According to the work in [1] , industrial disassembling is a key enabler of circular economy solutions for obsolete electric vehicle battery systems. However, currently, the battery packs disassembly is primarily accomplished by humans with a fixed robotassisted battery disassembly workstation. In order to increase the number of electrical vehicles around the world, autonomous robot disassembly of battery packs is imperative.",

            "text": "However, different car manufacturers have adopted different types of battery cell designs and physical configurations, and especially have very diverse scales of disassembly formats and relative sizes, which create a difficulty for battery disassembly automation with robots [2] . Disassembling different battery packs will demand different methods. However, because the disassembled parts, processes, tools, and methods are currently only revealed in text, robots are unable to comprehend the disassembled text's knowledge on their own. Despite this, robots must be taught to learn from disassembly text on their own. Nonetheless, robots cannot autonomously understand the knowledge in the disassembled text. So, robot learning from disassembled text is an important research topic that can help the disassembly of electric vehicles, currently handled manually by humans, to allow robotics to take over the task of dismantling. Furthermore, this will improve dismantling efficiency and reduce resources consumption, change the dismantling working environment, reduce worker labor intensity, and increase the annual revenue of the dismantling enterprise. According to the power battery dismantling procedure, that is based on the domain keywords including disassembly parts, disassembly process, disassembly tools, disassembly methods, and other category of disassembly keyword for different disassembly products [3] . Robotics can employ key phrases to decipher the semantic relationships in a disassembly text. However, there is presently no terminology dictionary in the field of disassembly of electric vehicles, thus it is critical and important to create a domain dictionary for data mining from scientific and technological literature in the disassembly domain, which will have enormous academic and commercial value. Furthermore, the goal of creating a domain dictionary automatically has long been a hot topic in NLP research.",

It's harder to specify word boundaries properly, especially in the domain of disassembly. Simple and complex phrases are being used in disassembly terminology, with different combinations resulting in different meanings. They are not only rare but also contain a large number of technical terms and proprietary jargon. Due to the lack of a standardized definition of a word from disassembly text, the task of Chinese word segmentation has traditionally begun with the creation of a segmentation standard based on linguistic and task intuitions, followed by the creation of segmenters that output words, and are not suitable for disassembly [4] . For decades, machine learning systems have been used to text feature extraction based on deep learning, but required careful engineering and significant domain expertise to design a feature extractor that transformed the raw data into feature vector. Deep learning learns millions of parameters, features, and feature representations automatically from large data, instead of adopting hand-crafted features, which rely heavily on designers' past knowledge [5, 6] . Recently, rich literature has been produced on machine learning algorithms, and this may be an effective method for text feature extraction. However, the effective information in the disassembled text is relatively sparse.",

Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeling for keyword extraction, where mainly using TF-IDF and TextRank ranks to measure the importance of each candidate keyword. In recent years, research has focused mainly on adopting more dimensional features to describe the information on keywords as much as possible. However, few studies use graph representations of semantic information for extraction from text. At the same time, unsupervised learning algorithm lacks to consider the impact of additional multi-dimensional features of keyword extraction. In addition, the usually classifiers were na\u00efve Bayes, K-Nearest neighbors, random forest, and others, but they have lower accuracy and performance in the prediction of disassembly domain variables, and require higher memory [9] . In this paper, in order to effectively extract keywords from text and classify keywords into domain dictionary we adopt supervised learning algorithms for keyword extraction from texts, which are based on multi-dimensional features of constructed candidate keywords. To determine whether the candidate keyword is a keyword, we use the LightGBM classification model. The domain dictionary is expanded via pointwise mutual information (PMI).",

It is a probabilistic generative model that characterizes each text as a mixture of topics and each topic as a word distribution [17] . It is a three-level Bayesian model that can extract possible topic models from corpora, provides an efficient method for quantifying research subjects, and is frequently used in text categorization [18] . Many researchers have worked tirelessly to enhance the LDA model in order to achieve the desired topic mining impact. For example, in the field of information security, keywords could well be extracted through using LDA and TextRank models [19] ; and LDA models are combined to improve the weight of the essential words [20] adjusting the weights of the keywords' features from the elements of location and part of speech, and extending the feature generated process of the LDA model to obtain more expressive words.",

The study in [30] was based on the N-grams model to discover new words from a large corpus and create a dictionary in the news field. Additionally, ref. [31] improved the accuracy of word segmentation based on the N-gram model with heuristic rules. The paper in [32] improved keyword extraction accuracy for TF-IDF model with location features and N-gram models which adjusted the weight distribution of feature words. To construct a short text feature vector space in emotion information extraction adopts a distributed semantic expression word vector model which was based on Word2Vec algorithm and N-Gram algorithm [33] . The supervised method regards the keywords extraction as a binary classification problem, using classification model to determine whether the candidate keyword is a keyword with the help of multi-dimensional features of words in the text [34] . At present, the keyword extraction research for supervised learning methods is mainly divided into feature extraction and feature classification. Statistical features have been widely adopted in the text including length, frequency, location, as well as linguistic features such as part of speech and syntactic information [16] . Approaches of classification algorithms have different types of text categorization, that mainly include: logistic regression, na\u00efve Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, CRF (conditional random fields), random forest, hidden Markov models, maximum entropy models, neural network models and SVM (support vector machine) [7] . The authors in [35] apply a naive Bayes classifier for an automatic news classification problem where TF-IDF algorithm based features are extracted from the news text. To address the problem of poor text sentiment classification accuracy, they adopted Bayesian classification algorithm with feature weighted fusion in sentiment text [36] . In [37] , keyword extraction from text based on multi-dimensional features and classifiers in CRF. The work in [38] presents an automatic keyword extraction system with multi-featured supervised learning algorithm and a random forest was used for classifier. In [39] , the TextRank algorithm was used to extract keywords from text with multi-features such as TF-IDF, word vector, position, and lexicality, with the help of SVM to train the initial weights of words and as well as to classify keywords and non-keywords.",

Figure 2 shows that the influence of multiple features of the extraction results where IDF features, title frequency, semantic features, part of speech features have more influence than other features. For verification of the performance of extracting the number of different keywords, we select the number of keywords in the range of 3 to 8, and a comparative experiment was design for extracting a different number of different keywords. Table 4 shows the multi extraction results with the number of keywords, and as the number of keywords increases, the recall continues to decrease and the precision continues to increase for the F1 score, which can better reflect the performance of the algorithm and that increases first and then decreases when the number of keywords is 5 and the performs is best. By comparison we find that the word count for professional vocabulary in the field of disassembly is around 5.",

The experiment proves that keyword extraction performs better for precision and F1 score, with the precision value increased to 0.95. Because of the vast amount of proprietary jargon in the disassembly document, as well as the lack of emotion in the depiction of scientific and technical literature. In addition, there is no obvious semantic relationship in the scientific and technical literature. Although the BERT model is more accurate than previous models, it takes a long time to train, and our model can meet the real-time requirements. For the performance of the classification algorithm for LightGBM we are using SVM, K neighbors, and random forest as comparisons, as seen in Table 7 . From the Table 7 , it can be observed that the classification algorithm LightGBM is significantly better than classic keyword extraction algorithms. Combining the features of the LightGBM model and disassembly text that LightGBM is more suitable for classification on the domain of disassembly of electric vehicle for construction dictionary. ",

After data analysis (see in Table 8 ), we found the largest number of parts in the document was extracted by PMI and there is relatively little terminology for methods. The Extraction accuracy of PMI conforms to the distribution of keywords in the text, which means that there are more keywords will be found by our algorithm model if try it in more text. ",

We received more accurate results as we increased the number of features supplied to the classifiers. Furthermore, semantic information exceeds other features in terms of extraction performance. The argument is similar to that of a previous observation: as NNbased embeddings, Word2Vec and BERT can provide richer semantics even with a smaller dataset. Word semantics were better captured in these word embeddings with richer vocabularies and a larger corpus. At the same time, different features and classification algorithms present different extraction results. The combination of LightGBM and PMI beats other combinations. ",

We proposed a method for automatic dictionary construction in the field of electric vehicle disassembly, with each candidate keywords extraction based on multi-dimensional features, and then proposed LightGBM to quantify the relevance of candidate words, with automatic dictionary extensions using PMI that combines position feature, linguistic features, length feature, term-frequency feature, external knowledgebased features, semantic features, and other multi-dimensional features extraction for the keywords from the disassembly corpus. Based on the multidimensional features, we describe word information more comprehensively and explain word importance more completely. Additionally, the LightGBM can identify keywords in an accurate, efficient, and consistent manner. Finally, we designed a PMI model that identified the various types of keywords. The experimental results show that our model can significantly improve extraction and classification performance. Compared with other models, our model is more suitable for identifying diverse features of keywords, classification, and expansion, and its accuracy is obviously higher than the other models. For the next step, we will focus on higher expected performances using BERT-BiLSTM-CRF, leaving this exploration for future work. ",
