[1] Owing to the frequent involvement of respiratory tract in humans, the viral agent is also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [2] Up to date, COVID-19 has affected over 7 millions of people and has been associated with more than 400 thousand deaths worldwide. [3] A large discrepancy in the rates of mortality has emerged across reports, resulting in an open debate involving healthcare administrators, physicians and researchers in several countries. Beyond the strategies adopted by governments and health-care resources availability, [4] the inconsistency of overall case-fatality rate between centers seems largely influenced by the clinical profile of the patients enrolled. [5, 6] Previous studies have investigated the association between baseline characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19, and have showed that age and multiple comorbidities may precipitate clinical course during hospitalization. [5, 7, 8] Cardiac injury, defined by increased serum troponin levels, emerged as an independent predictor of mortality in COVID-19, particularly when associated to underlying cardiovascular disease. [9] Moreover, traditional cardiovascular risk factors including age, hypertension, diabetes and smoking, were frequently reported in critically ill cases and seemed to affect in-hospital outcome. [9] [10] [11] These conditions are highly prevalent in high-income Asian and Western countries and represent a matter of concern, especially considering population growth and ageing. [12] .",

There are many reasons for the effect variability detected across observational studies including clinical setting (ICU, ward), the prevalence of in-hospital complications (e.g. ARDS) and the need of invasive mechanical supportive measures, which may play as effect modifiers. We tried to account for this variability by performing exploratory analyses of the relationships between the rate of mortality and the proportion of ARDS and IMV use, which are indexes of disease severity. As expected, the higher the percentage of ARDS/IMV among patients enrolled, themm higher was the rate of death during in-hospital course. In addition, the subgroup including only studies conducted in ICU, compared to the mixed group, showed a significantly higher risk of death. These analyses were still affected by high residual heterogeneity suggesting that these variables, although able to stratify prognosis, could not account for the differences among the studies included in this meta-analysis. Our analysis could not account for multiple variables as well as for concealed confounders such as the availability of healthcare resources, in-hospital paths, healthcare systems and strategies adopted in the context of pandemic between centers or countries. [4] Actually, high inconsistency is a frequent finding in meta-analyses of observational studies and should be weighed against inference statistics considerations.

            "text": "Our study demonstrates that the association between hypertension and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reflect largely the older age of these patients. In fact, the significant correlation observed at the univariable meta-regression model was not confirmed after adjustment for age. Preliminary studies suggested that hypertension was a risk factor for inhospital outcome in patients with COVID-19. [7, 10, 26, 60] Based on these findings, some authors hypothesized that ACEi or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) might increase the expression of ACE2 in animal models and facilitate virus entry into the host cells. [63] However, these studies reported only descriptive or univariable regression analyses, not accounting for potential confounders, and did not demonstrate an independent association between hypertension and fatal outcome. Actually, a recent multi-center propensity-score matching study on 1,128 COVID-19 patients with hypertension showed a significantly lower risk of 28-day all-cause mortality and of septic shock in ACEi/ ARBs group versus non-ACEi/ARBs [52] . This finding was confirmed in a recent study on 8,910 from 169 hospital, which showed that no risk of in-hospital death was associated with the use of ACEi/ARBs at multivariable analysis [64] . The association between smoking and mortality in COVID-19, though plausible, is still debated [65, 66] . A recent study by Williamson and colleagues on 17,278,392 adults from the OpenSAFELY platform, showed that current smokers were also associated with a lower risk of mortality related to COVID-19 [HR: 0.89 (0.82-0.97)] compared to never smokers [67] . In that analysis, the hazard ratio could not be interpreted causally owing to the inclusion of factors that were likely to mediate smoking effects (e.g. the association was no longer significant after adjustment for COPD). Thus, whether smoking is associated with higher risk of mortality need to be clarified in future studies as the epidemic progresses and more data accumulate.",
