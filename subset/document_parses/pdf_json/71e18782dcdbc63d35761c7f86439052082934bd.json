            "text": "Cytokine storm refers to the dysregulated production of inflammatory mediators leading to hyperinflammation. They are often detrimental, and worsen the severity of COVID-19 and other infectious or inflammatory diseases. Cannabinoids are known to have antiinflammatory effects but their possible therapeutic value on cytokine storms has not been fully elucidated. In vivo and ex vivo studies were carried out to investigate the effects of high-THC and high-CBD extracts on cytokine production in immune cells. Significant differences between the extracts were observed. Subsequent experiments focusing on a specific high CBD extract (CBD-X) showed significant reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines in human-derived PBMCs, neutrophils and T cells. In vivo mouse studies, using a systemically inflamed mouse model, showed reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa and IL-1b and a concurrent increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in response to CBD-X extract treatment. Lung inflammation, as in severe COVID-19 disease, is characterized by increased T-cell homing to the lungs. Our investigation revealed that CBD-X extract impaired T-cell migration induced by the chemoattractant SDF1. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling proteins Lck and Zap70 were significantly reduced, demonstrating an inhibitory effect on the early events downstream to TCR activation. In a lung inflamed mouse model, we observed a reduction in leukocytes including neutrophil migration to the lungs and decreased levels of IL-1b, MCP-1, IL-6 and TNFa, in response to the administration of the high-CBD extract. The results presented in this work offer that certain high-CBD extract has a high potential in the management of pathological conditions, in which the secretion of cytokines is dysregulated, as it is in severe COVID-19 disease or other infectious or inflammatory diseases.",

In the field of infectious diseases, cytokine storms were first reported in the early 2000 for several viruses among them influenza virus (11) , avian influenza H5N1 virus (12) , cytomegalovirus (13) , Epstein-Barr virus (14) , variola virus (15) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV2 (16, 17) . A cytokine storm in Coronavirus-disease-19 is accompanied by the rapid release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a (18) . The parallel activation of the NF-kB pathway and the subsequent activation of the STAT3-pathway result in a signalamplifying cascade releasing other pro-inflammatory cytokines from immune and non-immune cells involving the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, which can induce the release of TNF-a, among other cytokines (19) . IL-6 has an important role in this process because its trans-activation via gp130 results in pleiotropic effects on innate as well as acquired immune cells, leading to enhanced cytokine release resulting in a cytokine storm (20) .",

Different classes of cannabinoids, including the psychoactive phytocannabinoid tetrahydrocannabi noid (THC) and the non-psychoactive phytocannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) show anti-inflammatory action (21, 22 ). The endocannabinoid system plays a key role in the immune response of the innate and the adaptive immune systems. It modulates the migration of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (23) and regulates the cell trafficking of mature immune and effector cells, such as lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells (24) . It was reported that pure CBD and THC extracts could attenuate the proliferation of activated lymphocytes and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby increasing the secretion of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 (25) . In addition, THC could induce immunosuppression in B cells (26) . However, the mechanistic basis for the effects of cannabis on systemic hyperinflammation and the cytokine storm, and locally on lung inflammation, is not yet fully understood.",

We revealed that one of the high-CBD-extracts, termed CBD-X, had an enhanced anti-inflammatory capacity compared to the other CBD strains. We will show that CBD-X extract reduced the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-6 and IFN-g while increasing the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 in primary human derived neutrophils and T cells. In a murine model displaying systemic and local lung inflammation, it was shown that the administration of high-CBD extract downregulated the migration of leukocytes to the site of infection and the development of cytokine storm and leukocyte migration, both systemically, and locally in the lung tissues.",

Therefore, human derived CD4 + T cells were isolated, activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, and treated with CBD-X extract. The cells were collected and analyzed for the activation of the key components of the TCR-signaling pathway by investigating the phosphorylation levels of STAT5, Lck and Zap70 by Western blot analysis. Activation of CD4 + T cells by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 increased the phosphorylation levels of Lck, Zap70 and STAT5. Treatment with CBD-X extract downregulated the phosphorylation levels of Lck and Zap70 drastically more at the higher concentration of CBD-X whereas the phosphorylation levels of STAT5 were inhibited in a dose dependent manner ( Figure 3A) . Quantification of the phosphorylation status of the proteins in correlation to the total protein levels confirmed the results from the Western blots, including the statistically significant down-regulation of the phosphorylation of the tested proteins following the addition of CBD-X extract ( Figure 3B ). From these results, we concluded that CBD-X extract interferes with the early events of TCR signaling, indicating that it is an early regulator and can inhibit pro-inflammatory events at an early stage of T-cell activation.",

Therefore, we examined whether high-CBD extract affect leukocyte migration into the lungs of LPS-treated mice. Isolated immune cells from the lung tissue were examined for the leukocyte marker CD45 by FACS analysis. Our results show that lungs from untreated mice contained 9.78% CD45 positive cells, while lungs from LPS-treated mice had a remarkable increase in the CD45 population, with up to 80% CD45 positive cells. Treatment with CBD-X extract reduced the number of CD45 positive cells to 12.3%, which is a reduction almost to baseline level ( Figure 7A ). Fold of change in CD45 population was calculated in comparison to control ( Figure 7B ). Next, we checked the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the lung tissue, since it is a major player in migration andinflammation (35) .Inthelungtissueofuntreatedmice5pg/mlIL-6 was measured. When micewere treated with LPS thelevels increased to 24pg/ml, which were lowered to a value below baseline to almost 0 pg/ml when CBD-X extract was administered to LPS-treated mice ( Figure 7C ). Histology images from lungs of each experimental group (Control, LPS +Vehicle and LPS+CBD-X) were analyzed 24 hours after treatments ( Figure 7D ). Focal neutrophil infiltration and congestion were noticed at the lungs of LPS treated mice, that were reduced in the mice treated with CBD-X extract ( Figure 7D) . From these results we concluded that CBD-X inhibits leukocyte migration to damaged lungs and reduces local IL-6 secretion, thus reducing inflammation in the inflamed tissue. Over all our data support the hypothesis that CBD-X extract exhibits a potential to downregulate cytokine storm in the case of acute inflammation.",

Since anti-inflammatory medications can have severe side effects and cytokine storm can be fatal despite treatment, preventing the development of hyperinflammation at an earlier stage with little or no side effects may be a better form of treatment or prevention. Here, we showed that one of the six high-THC or high-CBD extracts (termed CBD-X) presented enhanced antiinflammatory effects. That different cannabis extracts have diverse effects was also shown earlier when the prevention of COVID-19 disease was investigated. This group has shown that different high-CBD strains had a varying potential to inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the host cell in vitro by modulating the ACE2 protein (37) . Similarly, it is widely accepted that high-CBD has anti-inflammatory properties and can indirectly improve anti-inflammatory effects (38) . In our study, we went a step further by demonstrating a direct effect of a specific high-CBD extract on inflammation by reducing anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted from immune cells but also regulating the translocation of pro-inflammatory T cells to the site of infection. The exact mode of action still needs to be elucidated but our observations hint to an involvement of early events in T -cell activation via the TCR signaling.",

Moreover, the activation of STAT5 proteins is a very early event that is mediated by IL-2 family cytokines (44) , which is mainly produced by activated CD4 + T cells and less by activated CD8 + T cells (45) . The activation of STAT5 and downstream proteins was inhibited by CBD-X extract suggesting that CBD-X has a potential to prevent severe COVID-19 disease at an already very early stage of the disease. Furthermore, CBD-X extract downregulates the migration of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in response to the chemoattractant SDF1 and thus may reduce the translocation of pro-inflammatory immune cells to the site of infection. This may explain the lower number of leukocytes in the inflamed lungs of LPStreated mice administered the CBD-X extract. Most interestingly, in a systemic inflammation model, CBD-X extract promoted immune reprograming by reducing the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and TNF-a and concurrently increasing the secretion of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that mediates the process of counteracting the pro-A B C FIGURE 6 | CBD-X extract promotes immune silencing in a murine model of lung inflammation.

The increase of IL-10 in the blood of LPS-treated mice suggest that certain high-CBD extract, in our case CBD-X, have the potential to help resolve the immune response of innate and adaptive immunity in order to maintain the afflicted tissue in a healthy condition (46) . The influence of CBD on IL-10 is not studied in detail and a clinical study on patients with multiple sclerosis did not find evidence of an influence of CBD on the increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (47) but a more recent study on activated encephalitogenic T cells showed that IL-10 was increased by high-CBD extracts (48) . On the other hand, the usage of cannabis as a medicinal drug revealed contradicting results in clinical studies (49) , although this might be due to the diverse effects of the different cannabis strains. Thus, clinical studies are needed to confirm our results that were obtained ex vivo and in vivo in mice studies. Moreover, we conducted our experiments on cells from healthy donors. In a next step, we would investigate the influence of CBD-X extract on cells isolated from the blood of patients that were hospitalized due to an infection with SARS-CoV2. One more challenge in the field of cannabis based treatment, is the capacity to apply the cannabis extracts to the patients. It is critical that the delivery system of cannabis extracts will match the patients status. In this study we injected the extract to the mice vein or peritoneum. However for human cytokine storm patients, a delivery system should be developed according to the patient's health condition and the target organs and cells. We believe that this strategy will make the treatment applicable and will allow an efficient cannabis based treatment to the cytokine storm patients. Nonetheless, the presented results are promising because they indicate that CBD-X extract not only regulated cytokines secretion in systemic and local inflammation, but also modified migration of immune effector cells and interfered with the downstream signaling of the activated T cell receptors. Our data point to the prospect that certain high-CBD extract has a high potential in the management of pathological conditions, in which the secretion of cytokines is dysregulated as it is in severe COVID-19 disease or other infectious or inflammatory diseases.
