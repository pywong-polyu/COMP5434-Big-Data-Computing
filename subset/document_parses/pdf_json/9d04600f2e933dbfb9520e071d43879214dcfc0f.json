Yokoi et al. reported bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) on autopsy in 8 of 81 patients who underwent allogeneic BMT with AML or ALL. All patients received conditioning regimens with total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide with or without busulfan or cytosine arabinoside. Immunosuppressive therapies were administered to all patients after BMT, including methotrexate with or without cyclosporine. The onset of respiratory symptoms was 110-430 days after BMT, and the symptoms were non-productive cough, dyspnea, fever, chest pain, and pneumothorax. Seven patients died of progressive respiratory failure and one of relapsed leukemia. Coexistent infections included CMV, varicella zoster, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Aspergillus [21] .

Pastores et al. reported a major missed diagnosis rate of 26% in 86 autopsies performed on cancer patients who died in a medical-surgical ICU [78] . Of the 86 patients, 25 (40%) had undergone HSCT, 18 (29%) had either leukemias or lymphomas, 19 (31%) had solid tumors, and 24 (28%) were surgical cancer patients. Among the patients with discrepancies 54% had class I discrepancies, 32% had class II discrepancies, and 14% had both class I and class II discrepancies. Of the 22 discordant cases, 6 had hematological malignancies and 4 underwent HSCT. Opportunistic infections due to viral, fungal, bacterial, and parasitic organisms and cardiac complications were the most common class I discrepancies. The majority of Class II discrepancies were accounted for by cardiopulmonary complications due to pulmonary embolism and thrombotic endocarditis. The study was limited by the retrospective study design and selection bias that may have occurred as physicians and family members of patients with premortem diagnostic uncertainty would have been more likely to pursue an autopsy. Xavier et al. reported a class I discrepancy rate of 31.3% in 118 autopsies of patients with hematological malignancies or severe aplastic anemia [79] . The most common diagnoses causing these discrepancies were hematological disease, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Class I discrepancies were more common in elderly patients (>64 years) and in patients who had not received previous specific treatment for the hematological malignancy, had not been treated with bone marrow or peripheral blood HSCT, or had not been treated in a specialized hematology unit. Seftel et al. reported a discrepancy rate of 64% (34% major, 30% minor) in 48 autopsies of patients who underwent HSCT (blood and bone marrow) [82] . Infectious complications, including pulmonary aspe rgillosis, candidiasis, and infective endocarditis, accounted for the majority of the major discrepancies.

Despite the technological advances in diagnostic testing and imaging modalities, obtaining an accurate clinical diagnosis remains difficult and is often not possible until autopsy. Major diagnostic discrepancies between clinical premortem diagnoses and postmortem autopsy findings have been reported in patients with hematologic malignancy. The most common missed diagnoses are due to opportunistic infections and cardiopulmonary complications. These findings underscore the importance of enhanced surveillance, monitoring, and treatment of infections and cardiopulmonary disorders in these patients. Autopsies remain important in determining an accurate cause of death and for improved understanding of diagnostic deficiencies, as well as for medical education and quality assurance. The Goldman classification of diagnostic discrepancies was applied. Major discrepancies included two categories (class I referred to missed diagnoses that would have led to a change in management with possible increased survival or cure; class II referred to major missed diagnoses that would not have impacted survival because no treatment was available, treatment was given even though the diagnoses was unknown, or the patient refused further treatment). Minor discrepancies included two categories (class III referred to missed minor diagnoses related to the terminal disease process but not directly related to the cause of death, and class IV referred to missed minor diagnoses that did not contribute to the cause of death but ultimately may have been significant had the patient survived the major illness) Congestive heart failure -2", "cite_spans":
