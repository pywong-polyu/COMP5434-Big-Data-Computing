However, the positive psychological processes that help to promote CSE in foreign-language learning (FLL) remain under-studied. Focusing specifically on FLL students, the present study examined the associations among optimism, hope, empathy, and CSE and investigated the possible mediating roles of hope and empathy in the relationship between optimism and CSE. A sample of 330 FLL students from two Chinese universities participated in this study. The results showed that (i) optimism, hope, and empathy were all positively related to CSE and that (ii) optimism did not directly predict CSE but indirectly and positively predicted CSE through hope and empathy. These findings suggest that optimism, empathy, and hope potentially play positive roles in facilitating CSE in FLL students. Based on the present results, some practical approaches are discussed that could help improve the CSE of FLL students, paying particular attention to the effects that potentially motivate their positivity.",

Moreover, as a tool to increase cultural sustainability, creativity enhances cognitive flexibility and enables FL learners to better understand different cultures and values, thus contributing to improved competence in intercultural communication (Portnova et al., 2020) . In recent years, creative learning activities-represented by creative writing and group problem-solving tasks-have been Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 831593 increasingly promoted in modern FL teaching (Tin, 2010; McDonough et al., 2015) , thereby requiring FL learners to use their imagination and creative thinking. Therefore, it is necessary to focus more on creativity in FL learning (FLL) . It has been shown that emotions are key factors in FLL success . Positive emotions can make FL learners more willing to absorb new language knowledge, whereas negative emotions can reduce their attention and motivation to input language (MacIntyre and Gregersen, 2012) . In addition, for learners with more-positive emotions, their FLL is better because they are more attentive and more aware of language input during class (Dewaele and Alfawzan, 2018) . It is evident that positive psychological traits may play a greater role in FLL than in other disciplines (MacIntyre et al., 2019) .",

However, the link between positive emotional feelings and FLL is still unclear , and the important role of positive emotions in building personal resources for FL learners requires further research . For instance, research evidence in the field of second-language acquisition on emotion regulation and loving pedagogy is scant, yet these psychological variables contribute to successful teaching and may be a motivator for FLL (Ghanizadeh and Moafian, 2010; Pavelescu and Petric, 2018; Bielak and Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2020; Wang et al., 2021) . Furthermore, little is known about the impact of emotional influences on positive nonverbal outcomes (e.g., creativity) in FL learners . In addition, FLL is a form of intercultural communication, and the nature of communication can be seen as the transfer of information and feelings (Zhang, 2020) , making FLL more susceptible to personal emotions. Therefore, we select multiple positive emotions of FL learners as the main objects of this study.",

CSE refers to an individual's perception of their ability to use creative thinking and creative functioning while problem-solving (Tierney and Farmer, 2011; Zhang et al., 2019) . CSE has a strong effect on different forms of creativity (Beghetto et al., 2011) , has a more substantial predictive effect than other predictors (H\u00fclsheger et al., 2009) , and can directly determine creative behavior (Tierney and Farmer, 2011) . Furthermore, CSE can also increase creative production, improve well-being, reduce the negative effects of learning disabilities, and enhance professional competences and personal development (Chen, 2020; Alvarez-Huerta et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2021; Smith, 2021) .

For instance, the survey by Li and Wu (2011) revealed that optimism positively predicted CSE and innovative behavior and that CSE mediated the relationship between optimism and creativity. Zhang et al. (2019) obtained similar results when they found that optimism indirectly affects social creativity through CSE. However, although previous studies have identified some important associations, they focused only on the direct effect of optimism and CSE and neglected to ask whether there are intermediary variables between these two factors. Moreover, few studies have analyzed specifically the relationship between optimism and creativity among FL learners. To fill this gap, the present study was aimed at determining which factors might affect the relationship between the optimism and CSE of FLL students.",

Several studies have offered evidence of these roles and shown that individuals with an optimistic and happy mindset are more capable of controlling negative behaviors (Zhang et al., 2019) , more flexible in dealing with problems, and more confident in their ability to generate creative ideas (Hirt et al., 2008) .",

For instance, the COVID-19 epidemic made traditional classroom-based FL teaching unfeasible, and many schools were forced to shift toward online instruction (Alfadda and Mahdi, 2021) . In this context, being optimistic may manifest as having the confidence to develop effective online-learning methods and work hard while maintaining a sense of hope. However, despite the wealth of literature that explores the effects of optimism on creative behavior (e.g., Hsu et al., 2011; Li and Wu, 2011) , few researchers have examined the optimism of FL learners and their beliefs about using creative approaches to learning.",

As these two components illustrate, the willingness and means associated with goal achievement are the two core qualities of hope. Recently, some studies have found that hope is related to a series of positive psychological resources, including gratitude (Feng and Yin, 2021) , courage (Bockorny and Youssef-Morgan, 2019) , resilience (Wu et al., 2021) , and optimism (Ratinen and Uusiautti, 2020) , among which optimism is an important influencing factor.

A few empirical studies have demonstrated the predictive role of optimism on empathy. For example, in a study of 35 patients, Hoffart and Sexton (2002) found that physician empathy predicted patient optimism and that increased patient optimism elevated the level of physician empathy. Nevertheless, the sample size of 35 patients allows for idiosyncrasies (Hoffart and Sexton, 2002) , so these findings need to be validated with a larger sample and different subjects. Furthermore, a study of 265 medical students by Hojat et al.

Therefore, the association between optimism and empathy must be further verified in different settings, such as in an FLL context.",

Wang and Su (2019) revised the QCAE twice according to the characteristics of the Chinese adolescent population, and the modified scale showed satisfactory internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.80). Given that cognitive empathy develops more consistently during adolescence than does emotional empathy, the OS subscale, which measures cognitive empathy effectively (Wang and Su, 2019) , was chosen for the present study. The OS subscale consisted of three items (e.g., \"I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective\") scored on a five-point Likert scale (1 = \"Strongly disagree\" to 5 = \"Strongly agree\").

One reason for this difference may be that women lack confidence in their intelligence (Furnham et al., 1999) , whereas men are more confident in their creative self-perceptions and self-concept in problem-solving (Khanam and Sen, 1998; Marsh et al., 2006) . In addition, increased creativity requires greater tolerance of ambiguity (Zenasni et al., 2008) , whereas women's traditional identities give them greater Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org \"other-directedness\" that diminishes this tolerance (Taylor, 2011; Karwowski et al., 2013) .

            "text": "The results do not support hypothesis 2, indicating that optimism was not a direct predictor of CSE but could indirectly affect CSE through mediating variables. This result is consistent with the findings of Hsu et al. (2011) in the Taiwanese service industry, where optimism had an indirect effect on employees' creativity. These results extend the findings of Li and Wu (2011) and Zhang et al. (2019) on the relationship between optimism and CSE by considering two possible mediating variables (hope and empathy). Therefore, the direct effect of optimism on CSE may be reduced when taking hope and empathy into account in the model. A possible reason for the above results may be that happy emotions have been shown to make people more playful and exploratory, leading them to take novel and adventurous approaches to solving problems (Bless et al., 1990) . Optimism and hope are both happy emotions, but hope seems to be more emotional than is optimism (Peterson and Seligman, 2004) . Moreover, hopeful individuals may give up on short-term Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org emotional goals; instead, they look to the future and choose flexible and effective strategies to achieve long-term goals (Trope et al., 2003; Hirt et al., 2008; Lopez et al., 2009 ). This could explain why hope affects CSE more directly than does optimism. On the other hand, individuals in happy moods are more focused on emotional regulation and the feelings of others; they explore possible avenues for mood change and engage in human-centered design from the perspective of others, which could promote cognitive improvement and constitute a positive effect of empathy on creativity (Hirt et al., 2008; So and Joo, 2017) . Nevertheless, the effect of optimism on CSE is certain, regardless of the direct or indirect impact. For FLL students, the need to master a new language outside its context often presents difficulties and challenges (Khodarahmi and Zarrinabadi, 2016) . Therefore, maintaining positive emotions (e.g., optimism and hope) in FL learning is important because students with positive emotions are more engaged in learning, better at self-regulation, more willing to optimize learning strategies, and more self-motivated, which can enhance their language proficiency, emotional competence, and creative thinking (Fredrickson, 2003; Khodarahmi and Zarrinabadi, 2016; Chen and Padilla, 2019; Yin, 2021) . Moreover, FLL is often accompanied by the learning of the culture in which the target language is spoken, which involves empathy for other cultures (Kokkola et al., 2022) . Students with high empathy are more tolerant, understanding, and accepting of foreign cultures, which leads them to think more deeply about different cultures and thus contributes to creativity (Savchenko et al., 2018) .",

Mediation analyses revealed the mediating role of hope in the relationship between optimism and CSE (hypothesis 3), which is consistent with previous research on these constructs (Creamer et al., 2009; Rand, 2009; Zhang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020) . Instead of giving up when faced with difficulties, optimistic individuals maintain high expectations and positive emotions for the future (Rand, 2009) , which contributes to the development of creative thinking and motivates them to experiment with multiple approaches to solving problems and reaching goals (Snyder, 2002; Amabile et al., 2005; Hirt et al., 2008) . Along with problem-solving, the ability to use creativity was enhanced, and the confidence in one's capacity for innovation increased. Conversely, individuals with low optimism tended to lack self-confidence and motivation. They felt confused and hopeless about the future and could not develop practical and innovative approaches to problem resolution, thus reducing their CSE (Snyder, 2000) .",

Furthermore, hope can increase intrinsic motivation and inspire individuals to make an effort to accomplish tasks (Yang et al., 2020) .

Notably, the indirect effect of optimism on CSE through empathy was not statistically significant in this mediation model (hypothesis 4). Similarly, the direct impact of optimism on empathy was also not effective, despite the significant correlation between these two variables (r = 0.27). It was inferred that hope could play an adequate mediating role in the relationship between optimism and empathy. In other words, highly optimistic students may foster greater hope to cultivate higher levels of empathy. These results extend the findings of Hojat et al.

Moreover, empathizing with others is an exploration of emotional regulation (Hu et al., 2021) that requires individuals to engage in creative thinking while participating in constant self-reflection, which also contributes to CSE. For FL learners, reading the FL requires cognitive effort and creativity because they must engage cognitively and emotionally with fictional characters, at which point empathy can be viewed as a creative cognitive act (Kokkola et al., 2022) . Therefore, it is understandable that the FLL students who were more optimistic tended to have higher levels of hope and empathy, which in turn enhanced their CSE.",
