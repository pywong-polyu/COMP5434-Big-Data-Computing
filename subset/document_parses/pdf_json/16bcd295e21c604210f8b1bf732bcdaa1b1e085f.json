Typically, alterations in the expression of key genes and proteins play a central role in many of these biological states. Thus, to understand the differences between these states, one of the fundamental steps is to identify a set of genes or proteins that are differentially expressed 3 . To understand the underlying biological process and functions of these molecules, annotation enrichment methods, such as pathway and gene ontology (GO) term enrichment, have been used widely 4 . Although the enrichment analysis provides crucial clues about the underlying biological processes and pathways, the lack of information about the underlying regulation hinders us to mechanistically understand how these biological states can be achieved.",

In a gene/protein interaction network, densely connected genes (or hub genes) are crucial for the network's integrity and the corresponding biological state 6, 7 . However, considering only topological parameters (such as hubness or degree) of a network may overlook key regulators 5 .

NeTFactor algorithm uses this type of network and applies topological, statistical, and optimization methods to identify key regulators 24 . An R package called VIPER takes advantage of this network and uses t-statistics (or other measurements) by comparing gene expression of different conditions to compute the final enrichment p values for TFs based on analytic rank-based enrichment analysis (aREA) algorithm and a null model generated by sample bootstrapping 25 . VIPER has been successful in identifying master regulators in many studies [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, it currently utilizes the network reverse-engineered by ARACNe that typically requires a large number of samples, which may not always be fulfilled, to successfully build a robust network, thus hampering VIPER's broader application.",

And the gene expression data were simulated with different numbers of samples (10, 20, 50 , 100 for the COEN method and 50, 100, 200 for the random forest method (GRN)) and different numbers of genes (from 2000 to 40,000). Overall, the speed of both methods decreased with the increase of the number of genes, and the speed was also dependent on the sample size for only the GRN method (Fig. 2a) . More specifically, the consumed time of the COEN method increased quadratically with the number of genes, while independent of the sample size. The COEN method was around 1~100 times faster, compared to the GRN method, when the number of genes was below 20,000, and the number of samples was over 50. However, since the GRN method is linearly, rather than quadratically, dependent on the number of genes, The COEN method spent more time when the number of genes was above 25,000 and the sample size was below 100. Network construction using the GRN method running on 4, 8, and 16 CPU cores was on average about 2, 4, and 8 times faster than the single-threading implementation, respectively (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ).",

Here, our interest is to investigate which regulators played the important role in regulating the transcriptomic changes of patients between V1 and V2. Thus, we retained 26 paired RNA-seq samples (three are removed because of quality control according to 34 ) on V1 and V2 for RegEnrich analysis.

Similarly, a little more overlapping regulators were observed between degree hubs and closeness hubs in the network constructed using the ARACNE-AP package, and these hubs are also barely the key regulators identified by the VIPER package (Fig. 3b) . Different network-inferencing methods and enrichment methods within RegEnrich showed consistent top-ranked regulators (Fig. 3c, d) which~40% were also identified by VIPER (Fig. 3c) . Altogether, both RegEnrich and VIPER tend to rank the nonhub regulators to be the key regulators. Using the network reverse-engineered from the full dataset of all 97 samples in 34 did not show the exactly the same results but still ranked the nonhub regulators to be the key regulators ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). These results suggest that looking for a gene/regulator with a high degree or other centrality parameters may not be ideal for identifying key gene regulators in every biological process. Although~40% of regulators were commonly ranked in the top 50 regulators by both RegEnrich and VIPER, most of the top 10 regulators identified by these two packages are unique (Fig. 3d) . Clearly, the expression of the three topmost-ranked regulators (CREG1, DEK, and E2F2) identified by RegEnrich was differential between V1 and V2 and showed a very similar pattern to that of corresponding targets ( Fig. 3e and Supplementary  Fig. 3 ). Although the expression of three topmost-ranked regulators identified by VIPER was also differential, only the expression of the targets of ZFP36L1 and CNOT7 was modestly correlated with that of the regulators themselves (Fig. 3f ). One may argue that it is inevitable that the expression of a regulator and its targets are highly correlated in COEN networks and this correlation may not hold for the network that was built by ARACNE-AP using mutual information. However, such correlations between the regulator and its targets were still observed when the network is built using random forest, which is also a nonlinear method (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, RegEnrich can successfully, as intended, identify the key regulators that both their expression and their targets' expression associate with the biological process of interest.",

RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene-silencing has been widely used to study the biological function of the silenced gene. In a gene regulator silencing experiment, the successfully silenced gene is typically the key regulator that has been malfunctioned. The performance metrics of RegEnrich and VIPER were compared by the ability to rank the silenced gene as one of the top key regulators. Here nine gene-silencing experiments from four independent datasets 16, 17, 35, 36 were used to benchmark RegEnrich using COEN network with either FET or GSEA enrichment methods, and VIPER using the network built by the ARACNE-AP package. Multiple cell lines/types, different silenced genes, and varied numbers of samples were deliberately included in these datasets to evaluate the bias induced by these variables (Table 1) . RegEnrich with either FET or GSEA enrichment method outperformed VIPER in all these datasets, and within RegEnrich, GSEA outperformed FET in most cases. For example, using the GSEA method, STAT3 and FOXM1 were ranked as the top key regulators when STAT3 and FOXM1 were silenced in the BTIC and ST486 cell lines, respectively (Table 1 ). STAT3 and FOXM1 were also ranked high (the second key regulators) in these experiments when we applied RegEnrich with the FET method. Interestingly, in the GSE17172 dataset, although FOXM1 was not ranked as the first regulator using RegEnrich FET method, other two genes (FOXN3 and FOXG1) from the same FOX transcription factor family were ranked as the first and fourth regulator, respectively (Supplementary Table 1 ). This implies that at least several members of the FOX family were perturbed by FOXM1 silencing due to either off-targeting or downstream transcriptional signaling and can be inferred by RegEnrich. It may also attribute to the \"pleiotropy of regulators\" 25 or \"shadow effect\" 17 , meaning that some of the transcriptional targets of FOXM1 are also part of the regulons of other FOX family members. By applying VIPER to this dataset, STAT3 was ranked as the 7 th regulator. However, FOXM1 was failed to be identified by using VIPER maybe because the sample size is small (Table 1) .",

The rankings of these regulators were considered high because these were regulators popping up from a total list of 1712 regulators in these RegEnrich analyses. Meanwhile, we also assessed the RegEnrich using two datasets, where STAT3 and CEBPB were tried to be simultaneously silenced in either BTIC or SNB19 cell lines. Even though these two genes were intended to be silenced, only one gene was successfully silenced. More specifically, STAT3 but not CEBPB was successfully silenced in the BTIC cell line, and CEBPB but not STAT3 was successfully silenced in the SNB19 cell line. Thus, only STAT3 and CEBPB were expected to be topranked as key regulators in the BTIC cell line and SNB19 cell line, respectively, which were the results returned by RegEnrich (Table 1) .

Due to the great therapeutic value of IFNs against virus infection and cancer, multiple studies have been performed to study the regulatory mechanisms of IFNs and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). For example, it has been revealed that extracellular IFNs activate cells by a signal transduction cascade, including activating transcription factors STATs and/or IRFs, leading to the induction of hundreds of ISGs, and forming a frontline of defense against virus infections 37, 38 . However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of most of these ISGs may vary between different cell types and tissues and remain incompletely understood. Given the potential of identification of key regulators by RegEnrich in a biological process, we sought to identify the key regulators by which IFNs stimulated cells to express ISGs. We retrieved and analyzed 11 microarray or RNAseq datasets from the GEO database, comprising 21 in vitro experiments, in which different cells were stimulated by either type I or type II IFN ( Table 2) . We found that RegEnrich identified STAT transcription factor family members, including STAT1 and STAT2, in most IFN stimulation experiments, which is supported by the wellknown IFN signaling pathway 38 . In addition, IRF (interferon regulatory factors) transcription factor family members, such as IRF9 and/or IRF7, were also identified as key regulators in a majority of the type I IFN stimulation experiments (Table 2) . These IRFs have been reported to play important roles in producing type I IFN downstream receptors that detect viral RNA and DNA, and in regulating interferon-driven gene expression 39 .",

Similarly, type II IFN ISGs were largely regulated by STAT family, IRF family, ETS family, MCM family, SP100/SP140 family (Table 2 and Fig. 4) .

Traditionally, COEN is considered a method for depicting linear relations between genes, while the random forest for nonlinear relations. Strikingly, in the Lyme disease transcriptomics dataset, the results from the COEN and GRN methods were consistent.

Interestingly, only a very small number of the key regulators from either RegEnrich or VIPER were hubs (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). One possible reason is that these hub genes are so important in maintaining the major functions of cells that too strong perturbations of these hubs could be fatal for cells 44 .

Such network is generated by an independent package, such as minet 46 , GPU-ARACNE 47 , and ARACNe-AP 23 .

More importantly, RegEnrich can identify the key regulators whose expression and targets' expression correlate with the experimental phenotypes. In addition, RegEnrich is able to find key regulators not only between two conditions but also in a time series experimental setting. Since RegEnrich is modular and is intended to be a flexible pipeline, we allow users to provide custom regulator lists and to have options for multiple methods at different steps in case needed.

These samples were evenly assigned into two groups. We first assumed that all samples had m common gene regulators (m = 500), of which k were bona fide key regulators (k = 20). The expression of each bona fide key regulator followed a Gaussian distribution in each group and was on purpose simulated to be differential between two groups. While the expression of the other regulators followed a Gaussian distribution with the same mean and standard deviation in each group, thus not necessarily differential between the two groups. Then we assumed that each regulator had t targets (t is a random number ranging from 3 to 50). The expression of the targets of a certain regulator was dependent on the expression of this regulator (the expression of this regulator plus Gaussian-distributed values). This resulted in an expression dataset with M genes (M = 13,789) and N samples (N = 100). Subsequently, we reduced the sample size by a downsampling strategy, resulting in datasets of 50, 20, 10, and 6 samples. Based on these datasets, we checked whether those bona fide key regulators that we predefined were top-ranked by the RegEnrich pipeline. The results showed that with the decrease of the sample size, less bona fide key regulators were top-ranked ( Supplementary Fig. 5) , meaning that the performance of the RegEnrich pipeline could be improved by increasing the sample size. As expected, the random forest (GRN) method in RegEnrich and ARACNe failed to build a network when the sample size was smaller than 20. Next, we checked whether the performance would be increased when we used the network that was built based on the complete dataset (all 100 samples) ( Supplementary  Fig. 6) . Indeed, all methods showed a higher performance. Although we observed that the ARACNe + VIPER packages showed a slightly better performance when the sample size was smaller than 20, the network was built based on the full dataset of 100 samples, which is an ideal scenario and hard to achieve in reality. Thus, we believe that RegEnrich is important especially in the area where not so much gene expression data are available.",

There are two major types of gene regulatory networks (or regulator-target networks) proposed: static network and dynamic network [53] [54] [55] . In a static network, genes are expressed in a steady state thus cannot describe the dynamics of an evolving process, while genes are dynamical in a dynamic network 56 . These networks can be constructed by many different computational approaches 21, 22, [57] [58] [59] [60] . Here, the regulator-target network inference is based on four assumptions: (1) the gene regulatory network is a snapshot of a dynamic network within the users' experiments; (2) It is a directed network, where the edges are from a regulator to its targets, or from a regulator to its targeted regulators; (3) the potential regulators are transcription factors and cofactors (this can be changed in RegEnrich by users); and (4) the expression change of a regulator can lead to the expression change of its downstream targets. Here, the targets are not only direct targets that the regulator binds to but also the downstream genes whose expression can be perturbed by the regulator. Presently, RegEnrich provides users two basic options to infer regulator-target network, i.e., COEN (co-expression network) and GRN (based on the random forest algorithm). For COEN, here, the co-expression network is constructed using WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis) algorithm 58 . And it can be summarized as three major procedures. First, a similarity matrix is calculated using correlations in expression data to measure the relationship strength between each pair of genes (nodes). Second, by applying the approximate scale-free topology criterion, raising the co-expression similarity to a power to define the weighted network adjacency matrix. Third, this adjacency matrix is then used to calculate the topological overlap measure (TOM), which reflects not only the similarity of each pair of nodes but also their neighbors' similarity 6 . The TOM defines the final coexpression network 58 .",

The basic idea of GENIE3 is that each gene is regressed in turn against all other genes to obtain network weights (edge weights), which quantify the strength of the dependence of each pair of genes. The edge weight (W ij ) is the importance of gene i in the tree model predicting gene j, which can be interpreted as the fraction of variance of the expression of gene j that can be explained by gene i 60 . However, the GENIE3 package is slow especially when it is deployed on genome-wide studies with a large number of experiments. So, to facilitate usage and improve speed, we implemented this algorithm by allowing users to define their regulators and by supporting parallel computing (Supplementary Fig. 7 ). In addition, in this random forest-based method we found the expressions of some genes were hardly predicted by other genes. So, we modified this algorithm by adding a filtering procedure to remove the poor random forest models ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . In other words, this procedure removed the genes and corresponding edges from the final network, whose expression was hardly predicted by the expression of the predefined regulators.",

To make the results comparable between viper and RegEnrich, here, the TF list is set as the same as the default regulators in RegEnirch. The regulon object is generated from the ARACNe network file and the corresponding expression dataset using the aracne2regulon function from the viper package with default parameters. Either the paired t-test or t-test was applied to compare the gene expression change between groups, depending on whether the experiment is a paired study. Meanwhile the sample permutation and paired t-test or t-test were used to generate a null model. The t-statistics and corresponding p-values, and the null model were used to perform master regulator inference analysis with msviper function from viper package. To confirm the results by using the network that we built, we reanalyzed the gene-silencing datasets using the public network of corresponding cancer type from the aracne.networks package (version 1.16.0).",
