Patients referred to an intensive interdisciplinary pain management program between June 2020 to June 2021 were asked, \"How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect your life?\" as part of their interdisciplinary assessment. Ninety patients (50 Veterans, 40 civilians) provided comments to this question, which were independently organized into themes using an inductive approach by 4 researchers. Nine main themes emerged: (1) changed psychological state, (2) minimal to no effect, (3) affected personal life activities, (4) changes in accessing care, (5) changes in work/education situation, (6) changes in family dynamics, (7) experiencing more annoyances, (8) COVID-19 pandemic is a barrier to making positive changes, and (9) got COVID-19. Themes are consistent with topics of interest in light of this ongoing, global stressor. Most commonly reported themes reflected changes in psychological well-being and changes in access to care, highlighting similarities between life with chronic pain and life under the pandemic for this group.",

Worldwide, governments enforced several public health measures to curb this deadly virus, including social distancing, mandating masks in public, closing of businesses, cancelation of social events, and extended lockdowns. Given the persisting uncertainty and the sudden and drastic changes to individual lives, the COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the psychosocial health of communities around the world (1) (2) (3) . However, emerging studies point to unequal distribution of the mental health effects of the pandemic, such that some populations appear to be more affected than others (3) (4) (5) .",

All surveys were saved in REDCap and were de-identified using REDCap IDs. Patient names were removed from REDCap and stored in a passwordprotected Excel\u00ae that is saved on the shared drive and only accessible by the research coordinator. If participants filled out surveys online, responses were saved directly in REDCap and managed by the same coordinator. If a participant filled out the survey on paper, responses were inputted into REDCap and paper copies were securely locked in the patient's file.

The most common theme, changes in psychological state, highlights the significance of the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with chronic pain. This is not surprising considering the disruption of daily life, uncertainty, and increased risk of illness that accompanied the onset of this global stressor. Indeed, numerous studies point to increased psychological distress, especially for vulnerable groups such as those with chronic health conditions, following the onset of the pandemic (1, (3) (4) (5) 15) . Patients reporting negative psychological change described worsening of pre-existing pain-related problems, including depression, anxiety, sensitivity to life stressors, and pain intensity. These reported problems may reflect disruption in access to health services as was demonstrated by another theme that emerged in this study.",

It may be that life during the pandemic involves fewer daily hassles that would be perceived as stressful by those with chronic pain.
