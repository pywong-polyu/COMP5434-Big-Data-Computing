Participants were randomized to 6 hours of group treatment, either to WL or one of three versions of GEM. GEM groups differed in degree of blood glucose (BG) feedback provided during treatment: no recommended feedback, systematic capillary BG feedback before and after nutrient intake and physical activity, or continuous glucose monitoring. Since these GEM groups did not differ in pre-post improvement they were combined for initial and current analyses. Of those who completed the 3-month postassessment, 100% and 96% of the WL and GEM participants completed the 13-month follow-up assessment. Results Pre to follow-up within-group comparisons indicated WL participants sustained improvement in body mass index (BMI) (\u22120.9\u00b11.4, p=0.001). GEM participants continued to benefit in their HbA1c (\u22120.5\u00b11.4, p<0.001), BMI (\u22121\u00b11, p<0.001), high-density lipoprotein (p<0.001), reduction of carbohydrate ingestion (p<0.001), self-monitoring of blood glucose satisfaction (p<0.001) and frequency (p<0.001), diabetes knowledge (p<0.001), diabetes empowerment (p<0.001), and both diabetes distress emotional (p=0.009) and regimen (p=0.001) subscales. Forty-two percent and 52% of WL and GEM participants, respectively, were classified as responders (individuals whose A1c dropped by at least \u22120.5%), with a mean HbA1c reduction of \u22121.2% and \u22121.5%. Neither WL nor GEM responders differed from non-responders in baseline demographics, psychological or disease severity variables. While WL responders could not be predicted, 73% of GEM responders were predicted by post minus pretreatment reductions of HbA1c, diabetes medication and BMI. Conclusions While WL sustained improvement in BMI, GEM sustained benefits across a broad range of physical, behavioral and psychological parameters, beneficial for clinicians and adults with T2D. This may be especially relevant for primary care physicians who manage about 90% of patients with T2D. Trial registration number NCT03196895.",

However, some adults with T2D do not need to lose weight (approximately 15%), 1 do not want to lose weight or cannot lose weight and keep it off for the duration of T2D. 2 Consequently, we developed a paradigm shift in lifestyle intervention that reduces postnutrient blood glucose (BG) excursions, glycemic excursion minimization (GEM). GEM reduces BG area under the curve by identifying a person's food choices that minimize BG elevations and physical activities that hasten BG recovery, empowering patients to make choices that diminish BG excursions and thus reduce HbA1c and cardiovascular risk. 3 4 GEM has been found to be superior to routine care. 5 6 Most recently, we compared WL to GEM at a 3-month follow-up 7 A critical aspect for general use requires sustainability, that is, continued benefit from pretreatment, which is needed to determine its potential as a pragmatic intervention, but this had not been investigated. [5] [6] [7] [8] Therefore, we present the first long-term follow-up of GEM, testing the hypothesis that GEM will be equivalent or superior to WL in sustaining its benefits in the primary (HbA1c) and secondary variables (physical, psychological, and behavioral parameters) found improved at a 3-month follow-up, without any maintenance intervention.",

Generalization of these findings is limited by the above single-site recruitment of participants and a subject sample of predominantly white, college-educated adults. Furthermore, our past GEM interventions relied on face-to-face visits. Many clinics do not have the space or personnel to deliver such interventions and patients' routines may not permit such visits. A self-administered version would have significantly greater scalability. GEM's current benefits are notable when considering that these outcomes are similar to those of more intensive WL lifestyle interventions that incorporated booster programs, 20 and low or very low carbohydrate diets. 21 GEM targets reducing immediate postnutrient BG excursions whereas ketogenic diets restrict total daily carbohydrate intake in order to induce a state of nutritional ketosis. GEM is not prescriptive targeting a certain number of calories or grams of carbohydrates but is personalized allowing patients to identify food and activity choices that positively or negatively impact their BG excursions.",
