Almost all studies are primarily focused on description of the epidemiological, clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 1,2 However, only a few studies, mainly case reports, have addressed the importance of the follow-up of recovered patients. 3, 4 To date, the clinical and virologic course of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be investigated. In particular, there are no conclusive data showing how long patients with COVID-19 continue to have symptoms and test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even after 2 consecutive negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. 5, 6 The WHO criteria for hospital discharge or discontinuation of COVID-19 quarantine have been described. 7 Nevertheless, data show that some patients are positive on nasopharyngeal swab after being declared recovered, and thus the appropriate timing of ending COVID-19 quarantine remains undetermined. 8, 9 Overall, there is no information about signs and symptoms that can predict a new positive test in patients declared recovered from COVID-19.",

Furthermore, this is a single center study with a relatively small number of patients, without a control group of patients discharged from hospital for other acute illnesses. For example, patients with pneumonia can also suffer from persistent symptoms, 16 suggesting these findings could be not exclusive to COVID-19. In particular, sore throat and rhinitis are subjective symptoms, rather than objective parameters, which may have bias among the patients and are not easy to analyze quantitatively. However, the clinical characteristics of the participants make it possible to exclude that other acute illnesses were present at the time of evaluation. Unfortunately, objective laboratory parameters-such as the peak level of viral RNA, first duration of viral RNA positivity, and viral antibodies yielded when the viral RNA become negative-are not available to minimize subjectivity and aid in quantitative assessment. Another important limitation of the study is the methodology used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent data report the risk of eliciting false-negative and false-positive results with RT-PCR in diagnosing COVID-19. It is well known that results from RT-PCR using primers for different genes can be affected by the variation of viral RNA sequences. In fact, genetic diversity and a possible rapid evolution of this novel coronavirus have been observed in different studies. 17, 18 Finally, these data should be considered preliminary and require validation from larger data samples.",

In particular, the criteria for discontinuation of quarantine and assessment of patients who recovered from COVID-19 with specific follow-up protocols need to be implemented. 19 To contain the spread of the virus, it is extremely important to better evaluate all patients who recovered from COVID-19 but still test positive for the virus. 20 This will be a crucial contribution to better understanding both the natural history of COVID-19 as well as the public health implications of viral shedding. The main question for the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection that still needs to be answered is whether the persistent presence of virus fragments means that the patient is still contagious.",

A positive nasopharyngeal swab test can reveal whether a patient is still shedding viral fragments but is not able to discern whether they are still infectious. 7, 8 It is important to highlight that also in other viral diseases, such as Zika, it has been documented that specific RNA can be identified long after the clearance of the virus. 21 RT-PCR is unable to differentiate between infectious virus and non-infectious RNA. 22 In patients with clinical improvement, who are completely asymptomatic, 23 a post-negative positive RT-PCR test result does not necessarily reflect reinfection or viral carriage. 24 Evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 increases each day and new guidelines about the recovery criteria will continue to change. In clinical practice, it is urgent to have criteria to identify patients who, even if declared recovered, continue to test positive. If patients continue to have symptoms potentially related to COVID-19, such as sore throat or rhinitis, it is reasonable to be cautious in avoiding close contact, wearing a face mask, and possibly repeating a nasopharyngeal swab.
