A main limitation for widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is the global shortage of essential supplies, among these, RNA extraction kits. The need for commercial RNA extraction kits places a bottleneck on tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, including PCR-based reference tests. Here we propose an alternative method we call PEARL (Precipitation Enhanced Analyte RetrievaL) that addresses this limitation. PEARL uses a lysis solution that disrupts cell membranes and viral envelopes while simultaneously providing conditions suitable for alcohol-based precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins. PEARL is a fast, low-cost, and simple method that uses common laboratory reagents and offers comparable performance to commercial RNA extraction kits. PEARL offers an alternative method to isolate host and pathogen nucleic acids and proteins to streamline the detection of DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.",

The most widely used reference test for SARS-CoV-2 detection relies on the isolation of viral genetic material followed by PCR-based amplification 1-2 . The first step in this approach is the extraction of viral RNA from human samples. Commercial solid-phase RNA extraction kits that isolate viral RNA are the starting point for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 reference tests 3 . These kits use silicabased columns to purify viral RNA after disruption of cells and viral particles with proprietary reagents. The global demand for these kits has made them a limiting resource for SARS-CoV-2 testing, fueling the development of alternative SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolation methods and protocols. These alternative approaches include organic solvent-based RNA extraction, and the use of chaotropic agents and proprietary buffer formulations.",

However, TRIzol extraction is labor intensive, which challenges scaling-up to meet testing demands. Moreover, it requires special considerations for the disposal of organic solvents. A 5-minute RNA preparation method has been recently reported, but it depends on expensive proprietary lysis solutions originally developed for genomic DNA isolation 7 . Recently, direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples without RNA extraction was reported, indicating that the initial RNA isolation step could be omitted [8] [9] [10] . Despite encouraging results, this approach results in reduced sensitivity of downstream quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based detection. On average, this method required an additional 5-7 PCR cycles to reach the detection threshold when compared to reactions templated on purified RNA. Because detection of low viral loads is critical for minimizing false negative results, it is essential that new approaches do not compromise sensitivity. In a more recent report, guanidium chloride was used for sample lysis in nasal swabs obtained from COVID-19 positive patients 11 . Total RNA was subsequently precipitated with isopropanol. This approach conveniently concentrates the RNA, which can increase detection sensitivity in downstream analyses. However, the use of the toxic chaotropic agent guanidium chloride requires special disposal guidelines.",

Next, we compared the Cq values from PEARL extracts to RNA purified using a commercial kit. We found strong concordance between extraction methods using de-identified nasopharyngeal swab samples provided by the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (Fig. 1B) . However, PEARL, required a modest increase in initial sample input (1.25fold) to achieve similar sensitivity to that of the commercial RNA extraction kit we used (Fig. 1B , note that the sample input for PEARL was either 175 \u00b5L or 250 \u00b5L, while the sample input for the commercial kit we used was 200 \u00b5L or 140 \u00b5L, respectively).

In these experiments, we used iSLK-219 cells, which are latently infected with a GFP-expressing recombinant KSHV 14 , or HeLa cells infected with the PRVABC59 strain of ZIKV, which was isolated in Puerto Rico in 2015 15 , at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. We collected 100,000 cells, which corresponds to the estimated cellular yield of a typical buccal swab 16 , and prepared 10-fold dilutions to determine the detection limit for RNA, DNA, and protein. Next, we prepared PEARL extracts and probed for viral and host nucleic acids and proteins using qPCR-and immunodetection-based assays, respectively. To ensure the specificity of RNA or DNA detection, we treated the PEARL extracts with DNase I (to detect RNA) or RNase A (to detect DNA). For protein immunodetection, we treated the PEARL extracts with RNase and DNase before SDS-PAGE and western blotting to ensure undisturbed migration of the proteins during electrophoresis, or left them untreated for dot-blot detection.",

In these experiments, we detected the host chaperone HSP70 in PEARL extracts obtained from 100,000 cells (HeLa and iSLK-219) by western blot (Fig. 2C and 3C ) and in as few as 12,500 cells (HeLa and iSLK-219) by dot-blot (Fig. S3A, and S3B ). Detection of KSHV-encoded GFP was achievable with approximately 1,000 iSLK-219 cells (Figs. 2C and S3B). Detection of KSHV-LANA was significantly less sensitive by western blot than by dot-blot, requiring 100,000 and 1,250 iSLK-219 cells, respectively (Figs. 2C and S3B). Taken together, our results indicate that PEARL can be used as a reliable and efficient method to extract host and virus nucleic acids and proteins from a wide range of viral infections.",

We reasoned that we could make PEARL field deployable by using a handpowered centrifugation device. Inspired by the work of Manu Prakash and others who pioneered these types of devices [17] [18] [19] , we modified a freely-available design for a hand-powered centrifuge actuated by supercoiling of a string (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1946291). We engineered a safety lid and chamfered all edges to avoid abrasion on the string, and increased the distance between the pull points to augment torque around the rotational axis (Fig. S4A) . We 3D printed our device with thermoplastic polyester, measured its angular velocity using a laser tachometer, and found that we could achieve centrifugal forces of approximately 3,900 \u00d7 g (Fig. S4B ). To test whether our hand-powered centrifuge could replace a benchtop centrifuge in PEARL, we compared the RNA and protein extraction efficiency achieved with our device and with a tabletop centrifuge set at 19,000 \u00d7 g. Despite the substantial difference in centrifugal force, we found that viral RNA and proteins can be easily detected using PEARL extracts prepared with our hand-powered centrifuge (Figs. S4C and S4D) . Thus, this device can enable the deployment of PEARL in the field without a significant loss in detection sensitivity.",

Globally scaled testing remains an unmet public health need, as attempts to meet this demand have resulted in shortages of the reagents and supplies necessary for sample processing, RNA extraction and SARS-CoV-2 detection. Here we present data to support PEARL as a cost effective, simple, and less-toxic alternative for the isolation of RNA, DNA and proteins. Our results indicate that PEARL enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in COVID-19 positive swab samples with sensitivity comparable to that afforded by commercially available RNA extraction kits. This outcome highlights the validity of using PEARL as a viable alternative to facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples. Our data also show that PEARL extracts can be used to efficiently detect host and viral transcripts, genomic DNA, and proteins regardless of the nature of the infection-PEARL was equally useful in detecting DNA and RNA viruses with different tropism. Coupling PEARL to different downstream analyses for detection of nucleic acids and proteins can provide a powerful tool for detection of diverse viruses. Moreover, because RNA, DNA, and proteins are extracted at once, PEARL reduces sample handling time, allowing for streamlined diagnostic procedures. Thus, it may enable both nucleic acid and antigenbased SARS-CoV-2 testing. PEARL's minimal handling requirements also make it scalable, which is desirable for high-volume testing operations, as is needed for SARS-CoV-2 testing.",

Isopropanol is less polar than ethanol, and therefore, it has a higher propensity to precipitate salts and antibiotics 22 . In our experiments, co-precipitation of salts and antibiotics does not appear to compromise downstream RT-qPCR or immunodetection assays.
