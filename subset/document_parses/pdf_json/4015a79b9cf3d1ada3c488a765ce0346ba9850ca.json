The Swiffer material is very efficient in filtering ultra-fine particles (< 80 nm). This is primarily because of the fibrous structures of the Swiffer material trap the ultrafine particles by diffusional capture. The filtration efficiency drops as the particle size increase which is because the fibers are loosely packed and particles that follow the streamlines of the gas get through the material. The highest efficiencies are seen for the case in which two layers of Swiffer is stacked in between two layers of pillowcase fabric. The efficiency ranged from 45 -62 % for particle sizes between 100 -500 nm, with the minimum around 300 nm. However, when the layers are doubled, the filtration efficiency increases, and the percent increase is higher for larger particles. For instance, the efficiency of filtration for 200 nm particles increases from 45 % to 65 % (44.4 % increase), whereas for 500 nm, the efficiency increases from 30 % to 58 % (93.3 % increase). The pressure drop for a single layer was 0.01 inch of water and it doubled when the two layers were used, and quadrupled for the third case considered as is shown in Figure 3 (b). The 3D printed facemask is shown in Figure 4 (a). The filtration efficiency of a double-layered Swiffer material in the 3D printed face mask and filter holder are shown in Figure 4 (b). Similar observations in the variation of filtration efficiency with particle size can be observed. The filtration efficiency is higher at lower particle sizes and decreases gradually as the size increases. The relative higher filtration efficiency of the smaller particles (< 30 nm) can be attributed to diffusional losses behind the mask. These diffusing particles escape the sampling probe and deposit on the mannequin's surface. The relative lower filtration efficiency of the larger particles is due to the leakage around the sides on the filter in the 3D printed mask. As larger particles follow .
