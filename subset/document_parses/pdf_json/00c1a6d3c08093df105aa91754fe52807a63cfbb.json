When modelled in continuous time using differential equations, the resulting system contains a heteroclinic cycle between the three equilibrium solutions representing the existence of only a single species. The game can be extended in a symmetric fashion by the addition of two further strategies ('Lizard' and 'Spock'): now each strategy is dominant over two of the remaining four strategies, and is dominated by the remaining two. The differential equation model contains a set of coupled heteroclinic cycles forming a heteroclinic network. In this paper we carefully consider the dynamics near this heteroclinic network. We develop a technique to use a previously defined definition of stability (known as fragmentary asymptotic stability) in numerical continuation software. We are able to identify regions of parameter space in which arbitrarily long periodic sequences of visits are made to the neighbourhoods of the equilibria, which form a complicated pattern in parameter space.",

These ODEs contain a heteroclinic network between equilibrium solutions, shown schematically in figure 1. The stability of the entire network has been studied by Podvigina [17] , and Afraimovich and colleagues [18] , but they do not discuss the dynamics that occur as trajectories approach the network. Some results in a stochastic setting can be found in [19, 20] . The vector field generated by equations (1) (which have only linear and quadratic terms), is often thought of as being of 'Lokta-Volterra' (or 'May-Leonard') type. It is topologically equivalent, in the positive orthant, to one with Z 5 2 Z 5 symmetry which can be generated by the coordinate transformation x j \u2192 x 2 j . Vector fields of this latter type, with symmetry group Z k 2 or Z k 2 Z k (in both cases acting on R k ) can contain heteroclinic cycles, and some have been studied in the context of equivariant bifurcation theory -for example see [12] for k = 3, and [21] for k = 4. In all these cases the invariant sphere theorem applies [22] , and so all trajectories are attracted to an invariant (k \u2212 1)-sphere. The results we present in this paper apply only to the dynamics of (1) in the positive orthant, and as such, are independent of whether we consider these equations, or the ones with the coordinates transformed to squared variables.",

The results of Field and Swift are complemented by studies of heteroclinic networks in four dimensions by Brannath [23] and Kirk and Silber [24] . Krupa and Melbourne generalised the stability results in the k = 3 and k = 4 cases to include cases without the Z k permutation symmetry [25] . In addition to the so-called edge cycles between equilibria with just one species present, the results of Field and Swift [21] show that face cycles between equilibria with two non-zero components can occur (see also [26] ). In the k = 5 case, Field and Richardson [16] show that these face cycles can co-exists with edge cycles, and there can also exist cycles between equilibria with three non-zero components. In this paper, we do not consider the face-cycles, because our choice of parameters (namely, that c A , c B , e A , e B > 0) does not allow it, but we do consider the cycle between equilibria with three non-zero components (3-face cycles in the terminology of [26] ).",

Heteroclinic cycles which are proper subsets of a heteroclinic network cannot be asymptotically stable, because there must be some points on an unstable manifold of at least one of the equilibria in the cycle which are attracted to a different part of the network. This lead to the introduction of weaker notions of stability, firstly essential asymptotic stability, introduced by Ian Melbourne in 1991 [32] , and later fragmentary asymptotic stability, introduced by Olga Podvigina in 2012 [27] . Both of these types of stability require that the object only attract trajectories from a subset of its neighbourhood (a precise definition is given in section 2 below). In this paper, we are not only interested in the stability of subcycles of the heteroclinic network, but also of the existence of trajectories which approach the network following a particular sequence of equilibria: this sequence may include visiting the same equilibrium multiple times but, for instance, visiting two different equilibria afterwards.",

There are several other results on the stability of heteroclinic networks, for examples see [23, 24, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , but these are, in general, partial results and confined to specific examples.

Firstly, we give an explicit method for computing the stability, not just of sub-cycles of a heteroclinic network, but of arbitrarily complex (repeating) sequences of visits to the equilibria of the network. That is, we ask whether trajectories which visit neighbourhoods of the equilibria in the network in a particular order (the list of which can be arbitrarily long, but must eventually be repeating) are attracted to, or repelled from, the network. Using the terminology of a recent preprint from Podvigina [46] , each of these sequences is an omnicycle. Secondly, we are able to adapt the conditions for heteroclinic cycle stability given by Podvigina [27] for use with continuation software to compute boundaries of stability mentioned above. In order to do this, we need to write the stability conditions in such a way that they generate a scalar function, continuous in the parameters of interest. Finally, we find a region of parameter space in which there is a complicated set of stability regions for increasingly complex sequences in which trajectories visit equilibria; these regions are reminiscent of the sausage-shaped resonance tongues seen in piecewise continuous systems [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . A complete explanation of the shape of these regions is beyond the scope of this paper, but leaves us with many open questions and future work.",

In section 3 we give an overview of the dynamics of equations (1), including the stability regions of various equilibrium solutions. We also show that in addition to the heteroclinic network between the singlepopulation equilibria, there may also exist a heteroclinic cycle between equilibria each of which have three species present; we find the existence region and boundaries of stability for this cycle. In section 4 we derive a Poincar\u00e9 map which captures the behaviour of trajectories close to the heteroclinic network, regardless of which route between equilibria around the network is taken by a trajectory. The derivation of the Poincar\u00e9 map is complicated because we have to use a mixture of Cartesian and polar coordinates in order to capture the whole of the two-dimensional unstable manifold.",

This allows us to find regions in parameter space where different patterns are stable. A summary of these results can be seen in figure 2 . The sausage-like tongues in the centre of the figure are shown in more detail in figures 7 and 8, and each one represents a different pattern of visiting the equilibria in the network. The grey shaded region is that for which the sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of the heteroclinic network given in [17] and [18] apply. We conjecture that the grey (uncoloured) region is actually filled with infinitely many sausages for different patterns: obviously we could only compute a finite number of these. In addition, we note that there are regions of parameter space which are outside of the grey region in which the network is still strongly attracting. The numerical results and the algorithm used to generate them are discussed in detail in section 5. Finally, in section 6 we discuss regions of parameter space in which the network appears to be attracting, but no regular pattern of visiting equilibria can be found. This irregular behaviour appears to arise in at least two different ways. Section 7 concludes. Figure 2 . Stability boundaries of various types of behaviour, in c A -c B parameter space, with e A = 1 and e B = 0.8. The labels in each region correspond to stable objects: these are described in detail in later sections, but briefly, \u03be T and \u03be Q are equilibria, \u03a3 T Q is a heteroclinic cycle and A, B and AAB are various patterns of approaching the heteroclinic network \u03a3. The green, purple and orange shaded regions are the regions in which \u03be T , \u03a3 T Q and \u03be Q (as labelled) are asymptotically stable and the boundaries are the coloured curves: blue: \u03b4 T = 1; green: \u03bb 4 = 0; purple: \u03b4 T Q = 1, orange: stability boundary of \u03be Q . These are described in section 3. The set of tongues between the regions labelled AAB, A and B are regions of fragmentary asymptotic stability of more complicated ways of approaching the network \u03a3. These are described in more detail in sections 4 and 5. The grey shaded region is that for which the sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of the network \u03a3 given in [17] and [18] apply.",

As c A is increased, the quasiperiodic behaviour grows in amplitude, but due to the existence of the invariant sphere, it becomes essentially 'trapped' between the equilibria of the network \u03a3. As a result, the trajectory spends increasingly long times in neighbourhoods of the equilibria. In figure 9 (b) we can see clear visits of the trajectory to the five equilibria \u03be j , during which all but one of the coordinates are very small. However, the value of the smallest of these coordinates, which can be thought of as an approximate distance of the trajectory from \u03a3, does not tend to decrease over time, as can be observed in both trajectories in figure 5 . As c A is increased further, we observe that the distance of the irregular trajectories from the network decreases, although the network does not appear to be 'attracting' until c A is greater than about 1.3, when we see a sustained approach of the trajectory towards the network.",

Rather than approaching the equilibria on the coordinate axes, this cycle approaches equilibria which have three non-zero coordinates, and lie in the interior of the subspaces P j,j+1,j+2 . For the dynamics restricted to these three-dimensional subspaces, these equilibria loose stability when \u03b4 T is increased through 1, shown by a blue curve in figure 2. In figure 10 we show timeseries for two parameter sets, on each side of this line, with c A = 1.6. Specifically, in panel (a), we can see that within each visit to a subspace P j,j+1,j+2 (i.e. where two of the coordinates are very small), the oscillations are decaying: the trajectory is approaching the equilibrium in the interior. In panel (b), we see the opposite: during each visit to a subspace P j,j+1,j+2 , the amplitude of the oscillations increase, and in fact we see a sequence of visits to the three equilibria \u03be j , \u03be j+1 and \u03be j+2 . However, the number of visits made to these equilibria before we switch to the next subspace is not the same each time. This behaviour was termed irregular cycling in [58] , and in that paper we proved its existence for an open region of parameter space. In this system, this particular type of irregular behaviour seems to be restricted to a fairly small region of parameter space: it rapidly breaks down into the much more irregular behaviour of the type seen in figure 5(b) .

We find some complicated and intriguing patterns of stability regions in parameter space, which are reminiscent of those found in other piecewise studies. The numerical technique we have developed here could easily be used to analyse the stability of sequences of visited equilibria in other heteroclinic networks with two-dimensional unstable manifolds. This work offers several potential avenues for further study. Firstly, we would like to be able to prove some of the observations made about the patterns of stability tongues found in section 5. This would likely involve further analysis of the Poincar\u00e9 maps \u03a6 B (9) and \u03a6 A (10), before the approximations are made which assume we are close to the onedimensional connections in\u03a3. From the numerical results, it appears that the transitions between the tongues in each string of sausages is associated with a change from a A pattern to an BB pattern, which is exactly when the above approximation is not valid. Secondly, our calculations tell us only the regions where sequences have a basin of attraction of positive measure; we could further compute the shape of the \u03b4-local basin of attraction (see equation (3)) using the 'stability index' [62, 63] . We have done these calculations numerically, and found that except for the A sequences, all sequences have a 'cusp' shaped local basin -that is, one in which the measure decreases to zero as the network is approached. These numerical calculations are supported by analytical calculations in [64] , for the A, B and AAB cycle. However, these sequences are not hard to find by randomly selecting initial conditions for numerical integrations, which seems somewhat counter-intuitive. In fact, what we observe is that many trajectories wander away from a particular sequence for some transient period before settling down, meaning that the entire basin of attraction is much larger than predicted using only a local analysis. This type of behaviour was noted in both [24] and [40] ; in the latter the behaviour was termed essential quasi-asympototic stability. Thirdly, the numerical simulations clearly indicate that the network has strong attractive properties in regions of parameter space where there are no stable root sequences, and where the sufficient conditions for stability derived in [17, 18] do not apply, namely the region where we observe irregular cycling. It would be of great interest to investigate this behaviour further. It is also natural to ask the question: are the sorts of dynamics we observe for the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock network typical for larger networks, or for networks in which the Z 5 -symmetry is broken? To first address the issue of broken symmetry (i.e. there is a different set of eigenvalues at each equilibria, albeit with the same signs): we believe that much of the observed dynamics would remain similar. Numerical simulations (by integration) indicate that complicated dynamics are still possible. Although we have not computed any stability boundaries for the broken symmetry case, the technique would be exactly the same, only with more book-keeping: one would now need to keep track of equilibria visited in addition to whether A or B type connections were traversed.",

            "text": "We also expect to see similarly complicated dynamics in larger networks, with the added complication that there would now be more than one possible network topology, even if we consider only networks between equilibria with a single species present, and retain the restriction that there is a symmetry between the equilibria which preserves the network structure (that is, all the equilibria are the 'same'). It is possible to use group-theoretic methods to compute all the possible network topologies for 'small' number of equilibria k (as in, e.g. [65] [66] [67] ), and the number grows very rapidly with k. As for the non-symmetric case, the technique we have developed in this paper for analysing the behaviour could be applied to any of these networks. A full cataloguing of the behaviour for these networks will involve classifying the networks by some measures of their topology. Initial investigations we have made have shown that networks with k odd, which contain a \u2206-clique (as the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock network does), have a very similar pattern of tongues of stability regions arranged into strings of sausages. Understanding why this behaviour occurs would generalise the A \u2192 BB transition discussed above.",

In this figure, we can also see two stability regions which occur entirely within the A stability region, on the other side of the line c A e A = c B e B . These regions have sequences AAAB and T AAAB. Each of these touches the line c A e A = c B e B at the same point as a region on the other side of that line with a sequence with an A replaced by a BB, thus continuing the pattern noted above. We were unable to find any other such regions within the A stability region.The sausage strings appear to have a number of other interesting properties. For instance, the upper boundaries of the T n 1 D tongues sit on a straight line, as do the upper boundaries of the QT n 1 D tongues. The number of tongues in each sausage string is always is always odd, and (aside from those of type T D n ) increase with the position of the original tongue in the 'Farey sequence'.",
