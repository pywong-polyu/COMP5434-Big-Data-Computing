Well-controlled, randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of palivizumab in reducing RSV hospitalization (RSVH) in high-risk infants including moderate-to latepreterm infants. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), in its 2014 policy, stopped recommending RSV IP use for C 29 weeks' gestational age infants. Revisions to the AAP policy for RSV IP have largely narrowed the proportion of pediatric patients eligible to receive RSV IP and have been associated with an increase in RSVH and morbidity. On the other hand, after reviewing the recent evidence on RSV burden, the National Perinatal Association, in its 2018 clinical practice guidelines, recommended RSV IP use for a wider pediatric population. As the AAP recommendations drive insurance reimbursements for RSV IP, they should be revised to help further mitigate RSV disease burden.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of respiratory illness worldwide in pediatric populations [1] . The virus was first isolated from chimpanzees with coryza in 1955 and later from infants and children during a bronchiolitis epidemic in the early 1960s [2, 3] . RSV belongs to the Pneumovirus family and Orthopneumovirus genus [4] . There are two antigenic subtypes, A and B, with no significant correlation between the virus type and disease severity or plaque size [5] . The single-stranded RNA genome is enclosed in a lipoprotein envelope with major transmembrane proteins, including the glycoprotein (G) and fusion protein (F). The G protein aids with viral attachment, and the F protein facilitates viral penetration and fusion with neighboring cells to form prominent syncytia [6] . Of note, the prefusion F protein is a major immunogenic component and a target of several novel therapeutics in clinical development [7, 8] . Both humoral and cytotoxic T-cellmediated immunity are vital for effective host defense against RSV. Natural infection does not provide lasting immunity against RSV infection; therefore, reinfections are common throughout life [9] [10] [11] . While there are animal RSV strains, humans are the only reservoir for human RSV infection. Transmission of the virus occurs commonly through direct or close exposure to infected secretions [4, 12] . The virus can survive 6 h or longer on hard surfaces and 20 min on skin [13, 14] . RSV infection is a seasonal illness with onset and offset, duration, and peak varying annually. The season further varies by geographic region; in the northern hemisphere, it usually lasts from November to April [4, 15] . The southern US, including Florida, has a longer RSV season, sometimes starting in July [16] . In tropical regions such as the US territory of Puerto Rico and equatorial regions such as the Philippines and Mozambique, the RSV season can last year-round with minimal seasonal variations [17, 18] . This article will review the current disease state of RSV and discuss populations at high risk of developing severe RSV. In addition, guidance for prevention of RSV with immunoprophylaxis (IP) will be examined. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.",

Because infection with RSV does not lead to long-term immunity, children and adults can have recurrent infections, although generally limited to the upper respiratory tract [8] . In the US, RSV has been a leading cause of hospitalization due to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) among infants aged \\ 1 year [19] . In a population-based, active surveillance study, Jain et al. reported that RSV was the most common cause of pneumonia (28%) in children aged \\ 5 years, with the highest burden in children aged \\ 2 years [20] . Hospitalization rates associated with RSV are about 16 times higher than those associated with influenza in infants aged \\ 1 year [21] . In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported annual estimates of RSV-associated hospitalization (RSVH) and mortality among children aged \\ 5 years were [ 57,000 and 100-500, respectively, and among elderly adults were 177,000 and 14,000, respectively [22] . Although diagnostic testing for RSV has increased in recent years, these are likely underestimates of RSV morbidity and mortality according to the CDC [22] . Moreover, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends against routine testing for RSV, which would further decrease identification of specific RSV infections [23] . Globally, the annual burden of RSVH and in-hospital mortality associated with acute LRTI were 3.2 million and 59,600, respectively, among children aged \\ 5 years and 336,000 and up to 50,500, respectively, in older adults [24, 25] . The burden of RSV among the elderly is considered equivalent to that of non-pandemic influenza and has gained more recognition in recent years [25] [26] [27] . Although mortality due to RSV is less common in developed countries compared with developing countries, the societal and economic burden associated with RSVH is considerably high worldwide [26, 27] .",

The CDC determines the RSV seasonality (onset, peak, duration, and offset) based on weekly data from participating laboratories across the US available through the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). Although the CDC traditionally used antigen-based tests to describe the RSV season, the use of molecular testing with PCR is becoming more prevalent because of its increased sensitivity and accuracy. Detection of RSV is particularly challenging in elderly adults because of lower viral loads in their nasal secretions and shorter duration of viral shedding compared with children. PCR-based testing has improved detection of the lower levels of RSV in adults. In addition, antigen-based tests have higher detection thresholds and are less sensitive in detecting RSV infection among elderly adults compared with PCR-based assays [26] . For real-time detection of RSV, the CDC recommends the simple threshold method (3% threshold for PCR and 10% threshold for antigen detection test) [15] .",

Despite the finding that infants and children with viral co-infections were more likely to have fever than those with single infections, associations with disease severity cannot be concluded [37] . RSV infections have also occurred in the setting of coexistence of pathogenic bacteria such as Moraxella; however, differentiating co-infections from colonization may be difficult. Co-infections with viral and bacterial pathogens may be associated with more severe respiratory disease [38, 39] . Although azithromycin treatment in infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis was observed to prolong the time to a subsequent wheezing episode and led to a decrease in days with respiratory symptoms, treatment with antibiotics did not appear to benefit at the time of the infections [40] . These findings emphasize the need for prudent clinical examination of febrile RSV cases for such co-infections, which in turn is important for clinical decision-making and appropriate disease management.",

Ribavirin is the only licensed antiviral treatment for RSV; however, its use is limited to severe RSV infections in immunocompromised patients. This is because of its high cost, inconclusive efficacy overall, potential toxicity issues, and inconvenient route of administration [12, 13, 41] . Although initial studies reported a decrease in viral load, need for oxygen, and length of hospital stay, subsequent studies were unable to demonstrate consistent improvements in these clinical parameters among infants treated with ribavirin compared with placebo [13] . As aerosolized ribavirin has become very expensive in recent years (about $30,000/day), oral ribavirin is being investigated for its cost-effectiveness and convenient route of administration in immunocompromised adults [42] . Beta-adrenergic drugs, corticosteroids, and hypertonic saline are often prescribed for children with acute bronchiolitis. They are largely ineffective and are not recommended routinely for use in severe RSV infection. Bacterial superinfection, other than possibly otitis media, is a rare complication of RSV infection. Hence, systemic antibiotics are not routinely indicated during RSV infection but may be prescribed when there is a high suspicion of bacterial superinfection [12, 23, 26] .",

General measures recommended by the CDC and AAP to prevent RSV among high-risk infants include good hand hygiene among caregivers, limiting exposure to tobacco smoke, and avoiding overcrowded locations, including day care when possible [12] . As RSV is ubiquitous and highly contagious, droplet and contact isolation of infected patients, caregiver education on RSV transmission, and reinforcement of hygiene measures among health care professionals and families can help reduce nosocomial transmission of RSV [12, 14] . Despite this, once RSV enters a day care or a home, almost everyone exposed will have some symptoms related to RSV infection. In the hospital setting, placing RSV-infected patients in single rooms or cohort areas is recommended in conjunction with droplet plus standard isolation precautions [12] .",

Administration was time consuming (intravenous infusion over many hours), and the product was removed from the market following the approval of palivizumab [38, 44] . Palivizumab is a humanized, recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes RSV F protein. It is indicated to prevent severe LRTI caused by RSV in premature infants (B 35 wGA) aged B 6 months, children with BPD requiring medical treatment in the past 6 months and aged B 24 months, and children with hemodynamically significant CHD aged B 24 months. Palivizumab is available as 50-mg and 100-mg single-dose vials, and a total of up to five monthly intramuscular injections is recommended by the AAP at a dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight, with the first dose ideally given before the start of the RSV season [4, 12] . However, partial prophylaxis with fewer than the recommended five palivizumab doses is clinically common potentially because of patient out-of-pocket costs, insurance/payer restrictions, and physician preference, in addition to birth month during the RSV season. More than 65% of high-risk infants do not receive complete IP and are at a significantly higher risk of RSVH (P \\ 0.001) [45, 46] .",

For the first time, RSV IP was not recommended for otherwise healthy 29-35 wGA infants [53, 54] . Although some experts believe that cost was an influencing factor for the policy change, the AAP stated that the similar risk of RSVH in [ 29 wGA infants and term infants was the rationale for the change [23, 55] .

The large, observational SENTINEL1 study, including 46 centers across the US, reported that the major proportion of RSVH occurred soon after birth hospitalization discharge during the RSV season (n = 481). During the 2014-2016 RSV seasons studied (November to March), about half (46%) and four-fifths (82%) of RSVH occurred within 30 and 60 days, respectively, after birth hospitalization discharge [34] .",
