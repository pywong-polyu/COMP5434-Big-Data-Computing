Inadequate knowledge about perinatal depression and treatment options may contribute to the low help-seeking rates exhibited by perinatal people.

Factors contributing to the development of perinatal depression may include insufficient sleep [10] , individual and family mental health history [11] , perceived lack of social support [10, 11] , and a history of adverse childhood experiences, including abuse [12] . Of concern, perinatal depression can have detrimental effects on both maternal and infant health if left undiagnosed and untreated [11, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Despite the prevalence and adverse impacts of perinatal depression, help-seeking rates are low due to a multitude of barriers [18] . For example, pregnant and postpartum people struggling with depression may face criticism or feel ashamed if their perinatal experiences deviate from societal expectations, which often depict this period as full of bliss and satisfaction [19] . Consequently, people in the perinatal period may avoid seeking help for their mental health [19] . Another help-seeking barrier is low mental health literacy, an individual's knowledge about mental disorders and treatment options, which can hinder mothers' ability to recognize depression and make informed treatment choices [19, 20] .",

We selected Google as over 70% of online searches are conducted using this search engine [29] . Prior to each search, we activated Google's incognito mode and cleared the browsing data, including search history, cookies, and cached files, to reduce the impact of past searches on our search results. To investigate which search terms would return the broadest set of relevant results, we searched several terms related to perinatal depression in Google in February 2020. Based on these results, we selected several lay terms for depression in pregnancy and postpartum, as well as the medical term perinatal depression. Consequently, we captured a wide range of websites that pregnant and postpartum people with depression may visit. Our final search terms included: perinatal depression, depression AND pregnant, and sad after pregnancy. To meet inclusion criteria, websites needed to include at least 500 words on perinatal depression (depression occurring in pregnancy and/or within 12 months postpartum), be written in English, and be retrieved from the first three pages of the search, as most people do not look beyond this [30] . Websites were excluded if they were duplicates, blogs, forums, commercial websites, practitioner materials, book or article excerpts, or were inaccessible to the public (e.g., required a login). As detailed in Fig. 1 , 37 websites met inclusion criteria and were evaluated in the current study.",

To determine whether mean DISCERN scores were significantly associated with SMOG scores, PEMAT ratings, and mean VisAWI ratings, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients. As well, we computed correlations with these variables and search engine order from all three searches to evaluate how quality differed across searches. We also calculated interrater agreement for DISCERN, PEMAT, and VisAWI ratings using an interclass correlation coefficient. To make comparisons across measures, we assigned websites a rating (good, adequate, or poor) for each domain evaluated. We then calculated aggregate ratings for all websites and used these to assign websites an overall rank. Table 1 outlines the criteria for good, adequate, and poor classifications for website domain and aggregate ratings. Websites remained blind to evaluators until we completed data analysis. Table 2 shows website rankings, domain ratings, and aggregate ratings. Only five websites in our sample achieved aggregate ratings falling within the good range, as per the criteria outlined in Table 1 . The websites with the highest aggregate ratings were the American Family Physician and the National Health Service, which both had aggregate ratings of 13. Both websites were rated highly in terms of information quality, with the latter having the highest DISCERN rating across websites in our sample. Both websites also met the 70% threshold for understandability and actionability. The American Family Physician had a reading level of 7, thus falling within the recommended reading levels of 6-8; however, the National Health Service exceeded the recommended range, with a reading level of 10. These two websites also varied in terms of their visual design ratings.

Although all three of these websites met criteria for understandability, they did not meet criteria for actionability. Further, their information quality ratings only fell within the adequate range. Beyond Blue had the highest visual design rating across websites in our sample, while March of Dimes and the National Health Service had visual design ratings falling within the adequate range. It is essential that websites present trustworthy content to ensure that pregnant and postpartum people with depression can make informed treatment choices. Information quality scored lowest in areas related to the sourcing of information and information about treatment options. This aligns with findings of previous mental health website evaluations, suggesting that website authors must incorporate evidence-based sources and convey details of these sources to users [7, 28, 43] . Furthermore, most websites lacked detailed descriptions of treatment benefits and focused primarily on risks; however, information was generally limited to pharmacological interventions, which is consistent with a review of adult depression websites [28] . Websites successfully conveyed relevant information, such as depression symptoms, and provided comprehensive lists of treatment options.",

Although blinding websites to raters reduced subjective bias, there were drawbacks to this method. Specifically, it was not effective when rating websites such as Wikipedia that have highly recognizable appearances. Further, raters did not rate all VisAWI items independently due to initially low interrater agreement, attributed to the subjectivity of the VisAWI and its broad rating scale. It is important to contextualize our challenges with interrater reliability for the VisAWI within the extant body of research. The literature reveals a range in coefficients across studies measuring interrater agreement for shorter versions of the VisAWI (0.11-0.88) [49, 50] . This highlights the need for consideration on the use and potential refinement of this method to ensure that ratings are consistent across reviewers.",
