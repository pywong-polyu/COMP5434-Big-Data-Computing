            "text": "Background The annual number of robotic surgical procedures is on the rise. Robotic surgery requires unique skills compared to other surgical approaches. Simulation allows basic robot skill acquisition and enhances patient safety. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and transferability of a mastery-based curriculum using a new virtual reality (VR) robotic simulator for surgery resident training. Methods Nineteen PGY2s and 22 PGY4s were enrolled. Residents completed a pretest and posttest consisting of five VR and three previously validated inanimate tasks. Training included practicing 33 VR tasks until a total score \u2265 90% (\"mastery\") was achieved using automated metrics (time, economy of motion). Inanimate performance was evaluated by two trained, blinded raters using video review metrics (time, errors, and modified OSATS). Outcomes were defined as: curriculum feasibility (completion rate, training time, repetitions), training effectiveness (pre/post training skill improvement), and skill transferability (skill transfer to validated inanimate drills). Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney U tests were used; median (IQR) reported. Results Thirty-four of 41 residents (83%) achieved mastery on all 33 VR tasks; median training time was 7 h (IQR: 5\u203226\u2033-8\u203252\u2033). Pretest vs. post-test performance improved (all p < 0.001) according to all VR and Inanimate metrics for both PGY2 and PGY4 residents. Significant pretest performance differences were observed between PGY2 and PGY4 residents for VR but not inanimate tasks; no PGY2 vs. PGY4 posttest performance differences were observed for both VR and inanimate tasks. Conclusion This mastery-based VR curriculum was associated with a high completion rate and excellent feasibility. Significant performance improvements were noted for both the VR and inanimate tasks, supporting training effectiveness and skill transferability. Additional studies examining validity evidence may help further refine this curriculum.",

The UPMC curriculum also included three inanimate drills to evaluate transferability of skills acquired on the VR simulator to a real environment. As previously described, these include: Ring Rollercoaster (RRC), Around the World Needle Driving (ATW), and Interrupted Suture (IS) (Fig. 1) . Similar to the UPMC curriculum, the UTSW curriculum used a combination of VR and inanimate tasks and a pretest, training, and posttest design. Pretest and posttest consisted of five SimNow\u00ae VR and three UPMC inanimate tasks. The VR tasks (Fig. 2) were Around the World Needle Driving (vATW), Big Dipper Needle Driving (BD), Ring Roller Coaster 4 (RRC4), Knot Tying (KT), and Three-Arm Relay 3 (TAR3). The first 4 tasks were chosen due to similarity with the inanimate tasks. RRC4 and vATW are identical to RRC and ATW, respectively, and when taken together, BD and KT incorporate the movements required to complete IS. TAR3 was chosen because it was perceived to be a complex task that would likely discriminate improvement between pretest and posttest. Training included practicing all 33 SimNow\u00ae VR tasks until a composite score equal to or exceeding 90 (out of 100 maximum) was achieved (defined as mastery). Although residents were encouraged to reach mastery for all 33 tasks, they were not required to do so in order to posttest. The order of task completion was not stipulated.",

Performance data were downloaded from the da Vinci Surgery Community website. Inanimate tasks were video recorded to facilitate subsequent assessment by video review. Performance was evaluated according to completion time, errors, and a modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) similar to the UPMC methodology [15] . This tool has been used in the robotic inanimate setting by some of the authors and has been validated in different fashions previously [15, [20] [21] [22] . Moreover, the OSATS confers the advantage of evaluating the time component as well as the economy of motion and instrument handling. These metrics could be similarly assessed in the VR training as well as in the OR. Consequently, in order to be consistent in our work and to allow future comparison between different training and practicing environments, we decided to use the same grading tool that has been effectively used in the past [23] . The OSATS scale involved a combination of 5-point Likert scales in six categories for a maximum of 30 points; categories included respect for tissue, time and motion, instrument handling, knowledge of instruments, use of assistance, and knowledge of procedure. These metrics were assessed by two blinded graders who received specific training in OSATS evaluation. At the end of their training both graders independently scored 10 inanimate drills and achieved high interrater reliability (Spearman: \u03c1 = 0.84, p < 0.001).",

Pretest and posttest performance metrics were examined for normality by constructing histograms and performing Wilks-Shapiro test. Improvement between pretest and posttest was analyzed by summating each metric, across the four remaining VR tasks, and across the 3 inanimate tasks, and comparing metric totals for the pretest and posttest (total score, total time, total economy of motion, total errors). Paired t test was used to analyze improvement of the entire cohort between pretest and posttest.

Comparisons of performance between PGY2s and PGY4s at pretest and posttest were made using Mann-Whitney U test.

Our simulation center is equipped with a dual-console Xi System and the SimNow\u00ae VR platform. We designed our curriculum to use the VR system in an effort to allow surgery residents to acquire basic robotic skills without needing to use actual robotic equipment, which is associated with additional costs for instruments and supplies. Publications describing curricula using the SimNow\u00ae system are lacking; we therefore, opted to use methodology previously described for a curriculum using a similar VR system and inanimate transferability tasks [15] . Our study demonstrated that PGY2 and PGY4 residents with minimal RAS exposure can effectively train on the SimNow\u00ae VR platform to improve their skills in both the virtual and inanimate environments in a reasonable amount of time. This transferability of skills from a virtual to a real environment confirms the positive implications of the use of VR simulation as a major initial component of robotic surgical training.",

Hogg et al. enrolled 17 surgical oncology fellows to undergo a similar VR training curriculum with 94% of completion rate, yet only 24% were able to achieve mastery on every task. These results were attributed to the fact that achieving proficiency was not mandatory in order to proceed with the post-test [15] . Another trial by Kiely et al. enrolled 14 residents and attendings to complete a dVss VR training curriculum but had a completion rate of 36%. This low completion rate was attributed to the short training times available for some of the participants [24] . Several factors likely were responsible for our high curriculum completion rate. Having dedicated training equipment that was accessible 24/7 in the simulation center made access readily available without using clinical equipment. Having protected training time as well as a structured curriculum with clear expectations seemed pivotal as well. Indeed, most residents completed the curriculum in approximately one month, which corresponded to the duration of the clinical rotation we selected for scheduling of this training due to its relatively light clinical demands. However, 31% of residents required more than 4 months to complete the curriculum; but many of these residents either had their training interrupted by a mandatory shutdown of the simulation center due to the COVID-19 pandemic or elected to begin the curriculum before their designated rotation with protected time. Median completion time was 7 h. Considering all these aspects, our data support feasibility of this VR curriculum.",

These results support the use of a proficiency-based curriculum that challenges trainees to reach a certain level of expertise rather than to simply perform a pre-determined number of repetitions.

This finding has been previously described for prior robotic VR platforms [25, 26] but no studies had examined transferability for the SimNow\u00ae platform. After performing VR training, residents showed major improvements in total time, total errors, and total OSATS on the inanimate drills; these improvements were demonstrated when analyzed as one cohort as well as when analyzed as individual classes. While the PGY4s had significantly lower completion time compared to PGY2s on the pretest, both groups demonstrated improvement, and the PGY difference was not present on the posttest. Specific analysis of PGY2 performance showed significant improvement for all metrics on all three inanimate tasks. Similar results were found for the PGY4s, except for a nonsignificant improvement in time for RRC. The fact that both junior and senior residents had a comparable performance at completion of the VR curriculum suggests that skill acquisition was independent of the previous level of clinical training. These data further This study has several limitations. First, this study was a retrospective review of data collected for quality improvement purposes and did not follow a prospective experimental design. Nevertheless, our study involved a larger number of participants than previously published studies and represents new data for this simulator; additionally, many of our findings were consistent with results associated with other VR systems [15, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Second, our curriculum used automated metrics produced by the VR system but these metrics have not yet been investigated for validity evidence. Given the positive results of our initial experience, we intend to pursue such studies. Moreover, the passing score used was a pre-defined benchmark of overall score > 90%, established by the manufacturer, Sim-Now\u00ae (Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc.; Sunnyvale, California). There isn't previously reported data or publicly available information regarding these passing thresholds. This value does not seem to be equivalent and consistent for all tasks. Consequently, our team will be working in the future to define the content and construct validity of each individual VR drill. Third, transferability of skills was studied on the inanimate environment and might not correlate to the real operating room environment. Future endeavors in this direction must be taken to understand how VR simulation improves trainees' skills while operating. Lastly, this was a single-institution study and replication of these results at other institutions will be important to establish generalizability of our findings.",
