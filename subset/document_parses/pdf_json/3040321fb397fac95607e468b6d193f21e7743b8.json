Despite the recent availability of vaccines, still transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible. Hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends social distancing, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene as the most efficient measures to combat the pandemic, also called non-pharmacological. In this sense, on January 22, 2020, the Ministry of Health introduced a series of measures for the Brazilian population, such as guidelines on hand hygiene and social distancing (Ogen 2020) . Social distancing actions were widely publicized by local governments and have social network as an ally, which could expand the dissemination of necessary measures; it is also a tool to guide government on its decision making . Therefore, ministerial recommendations allied to state governments attitudes led to a decrease in transit, industrial actions, among other activities that, due to social isolation, decreased the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere (Kroll et al. 2020) .",

Table 1 indicates a reduction in the average concentrations of NO 2 of 48.7% in the metropolitan region of Baixada Santista, a place with the greatest reduction, followed by the region of S\u00e3o Paulo (37.8%) and Salvador (32.5%). In S\u00e3o Paulo, the reduction observed in this study for the concentration of NO 2 is in line with the results obtained by automatic air quality monitoring stations, which revealed a 25% reduction in concentration in March 2020 when compared to March from 2015 to 2019 (Connerton et al. 2020 ). Likewise, a reduction of 26.6% found in this study for the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro is similar to the obtained in the evaluation by two automatic NO 2 monitoring stations, which between 23 March and 12 April during the years 2019 and 2020 experienced a reduction of 32.9% and 24.1% in the concentration of the pollutant (Dantas et al. 2020) .",

In some states, the decrees were issued before that date, as in Alagoas (13 March), Distrito Federal (11 March), S\u00e3o Paulo (13 March), which stands out among the findings, because 5 out of the 21 regions that presented reduction in the emission of NO 2 are in its territory. These results explain the perception of improved air quality reported by Brazilian people, where 934 citizens, 60% of the state of Minas Gerais, 21.6% from the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, 3.7% from Rio de Janeiro, 2.4% from Bahia, and 2.3% from Federal District, which makes up more than 90% of the sample, reported a better quality of breathed air (Barbieri et al 2020). These five states have nine metropolitan regions portrayed by this study, and in all of them there was a reduction in the concentration of atmospheric NO 2 . This evidence is not only pointed out by Brazil. China also showed a reduction in the average concentration of NO 2 , recording a decrease in some of its cities, especially in February 2020, when the government has imposed interdiction measures to contain the Covid-19 epidemic (Chen et al. 2020 (Chen et al. , 2021 Dutheil et al. 2020; Venter et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020) .

Considering that social isolation measures were initiated at approximately the same time (second half of March) in all metropolitan regions, that a reduction in concentration was observed and the population and vehicle fleet remained relatively stable during the period, it was possible to observe the indirect effects of population and vehicle density in the reduction of NO 2 concentration. At a significance level of 0.05, the Spearman correlation coefficient found was 0.424 (population density) and 0.485 (vehicle density). The results indicate that there seems to be a dependency, albeit indirect, between the variables. This means that in those metropolitan regions where there are more vehicles per square kilometer there is a tendency for a more accentuated variation in the concentration of NO 2 . Higher vehicle densities may be related to a greater number of NO 2 emitting hot spots, such as high-flow highways or roads and traffic jams.",

In other words, stringent government policies are needed to keep the emissions low and even further lower them (Rivers and Jaccard 2005; Pane 2020; Dang and Trinh 2021) . To this end, we advocate the following actions for government authorities to adopt: Putting a cost on pollution by pricing the carbon externality for both producers and users of the polluting goods or services (Sterner 2012; Hagmann et al. 2019) ; Providing incentives for the development and use of sustainable energy and mobility solutions (Butler et al. 2020 (Butler et al. , 2021 ; Revisiting climate and energy-related legislations and adopting the New Green Deal for speeding up a green transition (Hafner and Raimondi 2020; Barry and Hoyne 2021) ; Investing on the state-of-the-art air quality monitoring and analysis systems (Liu et al. 2018; Gonzalez-Martin et al. 2021) Planning for sustainable urban form and transport integration to reduce emissions (Yigitcanlar and Kamruzzaman 2014; Dur and Yigitcanlar 2015) ; Offering government-financed stimuli for not rolling back environmental regulations and halting spending on a green transition (Elliott et al. 2020 ",

(2021) following assertion, \"five years after the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, growth in global CO 2 emissions has begun to falter. The pervasive disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic have radically altered the trajectory of global CO 2 emissions. Contradictory effects of the post-Covid-19 investments in fossil fuelbased infrastructure and the recent strengthening of climate targets must be addressed with new policy choices to sustain a decline in global emissions in the post-Covid-19 era.\" As emphasized by Sarimin and Yigitcanlar (2012) one of the promising policy choices to achieve climate and sustainable development targets is the knowledge-based development of our cities and societies. Besides the NO 2 findings, our study has also underlined the importance of continuous, i.e., time series, analysis on the air quality. Moreover, in interpretation of the results, we note the following limitations of the study. The limitations of this case report are tied to the period researched (the period of 36 days, 12 March to 16 April both in 2019 and 2020), since we considered the WHO declaration of pandemic as the start date for the execution of the research in all regions. Nonetheless, there is a delay between that declaration and the restriction measures adopted by governments and regional agencies. Furthermore, investigation of a single air pollutant is a limitation, despite we also liked at the O 3 . Another limitation of this study is not to focus on the policy issues and prescribe public policy and actions to address the air pollution and climate change issues in Brazil. Nevertheless, our prospective research will focus on these limitations by considering NO 2 and also other pollutants and investigating larger timeframes and conduct time series analyses and prescribe relevant policy actions.",
