The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose. All analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock.

There are a few provisionally licensed vaccines against COVID-19, and global efforts are focusing on developing safe and efficacious vaccines for COVID-19 prevention. According to the WHO draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines, 1 The safety of adenoviral vector vaccines has been extensively studied, and adenoviral vector-based therapeutic drugs are used in clinical practice. [5] [6] [7] Adenoviral vectordelivered antigens are known to induce both cellular and humoral immunity after a single immunisation, allowing their use as an emergency prophylaxis tool in a pandemic. Furthermore, the use of two immunisations gives a durable and long-lasting immune response. 8, 9 These characteristics make recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus (rAd)-based vaccines suitable candidates for the WHO target product profiles for long-term protection of people at high risk of COVID-19 in outbreak settings because they stimulate rapid onset of protective immunity. Although adenoviral vectors might induce immune responses against vector components and attenuate antigen-induced responses, prime-boost hetero logous vaccination with two different vectors allows minimisation of this effect. [9] [10] [11] Thus, the most effective approach for generating a powerful and long-lasting immune response that does not depend on the presence of a pre-existing immune response to the vector is the heterologous primeboost vaccination approach. We used this approach when developing a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.",

The titre of glycoprotein-specific antibodies in serum was ascertained by ELISA. To test anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, we used an ELISA that was developed at Gamaleya NRCEM and registered for clinical use in Russia (P3H 2020/10393 2020-05-18). The ELISA measures IgGs specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S.

First, despite the negative PCR test at screening and absence of increased temperature at the time of first vaccine dose administration, the onset of the first COVID-19 symptoms (4-5 days after first dose, similar to the average COVID-19 incubation period) testifies that participants had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before or near the vaccination day, which was additionally confirmed by the IDMC, on the basis of WHO and CDC guidelines and review of underlying clinical data. Second, both participants self-administered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs without informing clinicians, which inter fered with diagnosis and receipt of medical help upon hospital admission. Third, because of limited diagnostics at screening (limitations of medical examination and testing and patient unaware of comorbidities) each partici pant had comorbidities that were only known after hospital admission. Participants who have not developed protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 (ie, were infected before vaccination or early after vaccination) showed the natural clinical course of COVID-19. We did another analysis of the severity of the course of COVID-19 in the two groups, which showed that in the first 2 weeks after the first dose, there was no significant difference in the severity of the course of COVID-19 between the vaccine and placebo groups. From 15 to 21 days after the first dose, efficacy was 73\u00b76% (p=0\u00b7048), then from day 21, efficacy was 100% (p<0\u00b70001; appendix p 11). Therefore, in this study, the efficacy analysis was done 21 days after the first dose, because by that time, the immune response is formed.",
