Little is known, however, about the impact of the reporting of suspected protestor suicide deaths during social unrest, particularly in an age of social media. In June 2019, the most substantial social unrest in Hong Kong since its handover in 1997 was triggered by the proposed Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB). The social unrest subsided when Hong Kong and many parts of the world were hit by Covid-19 and very strict quarantine measures were imposed on crowd gatherings in Hong Kong at the end of January 2020. A number of reported suicides and deaths of undetermined cause took place during this 8-month period that received considerable attention. To better understand the possible effects of these highly publicized deaths, we examined media reports of suspected suicide cases before, during and after the protest period, as well as topics of suicide-related threads and their replies in social media forums. We found no clear evidence of increased rates of suicide as a result of these incidents, or during the protest period; however, it is suggested that certain narratives and attention surrounding the suspected suicides and undetermined deaths may have contributed to collective emotions such as sadness and anxiety. Some implications for misinformation (intentionally or un-intentionally) and mitigation of suicide risk during social unrest are discussed.",

Despite the utility of social media during certain events and incidents, there are concerns about how information may be misrepresented (intentionally or unintentionally), and the impact on social behaviours and mental health. The spread of \"fake news\" has been a concern, including surrounding political events such as the US election of 2016, and the risks of misinformation over social media have been described by the World Economic Forum as one of the major global threats to society [6] . Evidence shows that the demographic characteristics of the deceased person may influence emotional responses, and some emotional responses like sadness and anger show positive correlation with following days' suicide count [27] . Meanwhile, certain forms of reporting of suicide in the media have been shown to increase the suicide rate [7, 8] , and there is evidence that social media engagement with prominent suicides may also increase incidence of suicide [9] .",

Following an incident between police and protesters at a Hong Kong subway station in late August 2019, rumours of deaths being covered up or suppressed to avoid political consequences increased, and speculation about possible foul play relating to two particular deaths in September and November ensued, including that evidence was concealed [13] . These were the deaths of Ms. Chan Yin-lam (aged 15, a student, found unclothed at sea) and Mr Chow Tsz-lok (aged 22, a student that fell from a height in a carpark compound). Both deaths stirred considerable media suspicion, emotion and rumours of possible foul play. Some protesters even took to social media to share videos or photos in which they stated categorically that they would not take their own lives, in order to address fears involving suspicions and mistrust, should anything happen to them [14] . It turns out the two cases have been given the verdict of underdetermined cause of death for Ms. Chan and an open verdict to Mr Chow death by the Coroner Court recently. Unhelpful and sensational speculation (intentionally and/or unintentionally) may have been avoided had these cases been investigated by the Coroner Court more urgently.",

This may be especially pertinent during times of political upheaval or social unrest, when citizen journalists or activists may use media to stimulate emotions or conversations. At present, there is little research into how existing media guidelines and suppression of suicide stories may or may not lead to discussions being pushed underground into social media channels, at risk of further stirring speculation and reliance on unauthoritative source materials. Good media management for suicide prevention must consider political contexts and secondary effects beyond traditional media.",

While these protest deaths are not the sort of \"celebrity deaths\" that have been well studied for copycat effects, it is suggested that the impact on vulnerable individuals could be as much if not more due to the perception that they were fellow members of the protest movement and, therefore, highly relatable.

We collected the daily suicide cases reported by news outlets in Hong Kong from the database of Meltwater (See Appendix 1). Suicide-related keywords (Appendix 2 for Original Cantonese and English translation version) were used as the primary filters for collecting the information of suicide cases. After that, two well-trained coders coded each suicide news items independently, including removing non-suicide news, identifying duplicates, and coding suicide related features. For each case, the coders marked the suicide method, date, gender, age, location, and possible reasons mentioned in the news. Disagreements were discussed and resolved among two coders. After the data cleaning, there was a total of 1013 unique suicide cases reported during the study period (January 2019-May 2020).",

The results showed a decentralized pattern in initiating the hot thread discussions. This suggests a wide base in the community were participating in discussion, and not only a small number of individuals attempting to spark publicity or to steer conversations. Figure 3 reports the trend of suicide reported cases in the study period. The results showed that, contrary to some expectations, the total (or mean weekly) suicides in the protest period were actually slightly lower than the Pre-and Peri-protest periods. Multi-comparisons results in Table 2 revealed that there is no significant change in the suicide incidence based on the news reporting among the three periods. This does not mean that there was no copycat effect in individual cases or escalated suicide atmosphere. The high volatility in the weekly cases leaves open the question of whether there is some cancellation effect among the population, i.e., some groups might experience higher risk whereas the others might have lower risk, and the overall rate might not show any change as shown in the suicide cases during COVID-19 [33] . In the discussion, we consider some of the factors that may lead to lower risk amongst some individuals. Narratives that dominated suicide discussions in the protest period \"Martyrdom\" Figure 4a shows the trend of total threads, number of threads that mentioned martyrdom and number of replies in those threads that mentioned martyrdom. Figure 4b shows the trend for hot threads and their replies. The martyrdom related keywords started to be widely used from June 16 2019, after the first death on June 9. The situation is more substantial in the hot thread discussions, where 68% of hot threads in the protest period are martyrdom mentioning threads compared to 24% of total threads are martyrdom mentioning threads. The mentioning phenomenon gradually cooled down when stepping into the COVID period. Table 3 reports sentiment comparisons between martyrdom mentioning posts and no martyrdom mentioning posts. The results reveal that the anxiety score and sadness score of martyrdom mentioning posts are significantly higher than posts without mentioning martyrdom (U = 510,248,952.5, P < 0.001 and U = 506,100,631.5, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, martyrdom mentioning posts have significantly lower scores of anger and lower overall \"Foul play\" Figure 5a shows the number of threads and replies that mentioned foul play phenomenon and Fig. 5b shows the number of hot threads and replies that mentioned foul play phenomenon. The first surge of this phenomenon is around the middle of September, 2019, and it peaked at the week of November 4-10 where the death of the university student, Mr. Chow Tsz Lok had been announced. The situation is also more notable in the hot thread discussions, where 40% of hot threads in protest period mentioned foul play compared to 18% of total threads mentioned foul play. Unlike martyrdom, the mention of foul play extended into the COVID period. Table 4 reports sentiment comparisons between foul play and no foul play mentioning posts. The results reveal that posts mentioning foul play narrative have higher anxiety score while lower anger score than those without mentions (U = 332,715,633, P < 0.001, U = 318,018,823.5, P < 0.001).",

            "text": "The 8-month social unrest in 2019 was unprecedented in Hong Kong, and has become a source of sadness, anxiety, and anger for much of the city, with divisions causing conflicts within families and communities that have led to more polarization in the community. A number of high-profile suspected suicides/deaths were reported, raising concerns about a copycat effect or increase in suicides. Contrary to expectation, we did not find evidence of an increase in suicide rate overall during the protest period when compared to the pre-protest period. However, social media analysis found increased interest and engagement in suicide reporting during the protest period compared to pre-protest and post-protest periods, which could be partially explained by popular or sensationalized narratives-namely those pertaining to martyrdom and foul play. The martyrdom narrative in particular exhibited a comparatively negative sentiment, especially for anxiety-and sadness-related language. Such sentiment (intentionally or unintentionally) may have driven further engagement in the social unrest. It also raises concerns from a suicide prevention perspective, suggesting that while the suicide rate did not increase overall, there may have been conditions for copycat or emulated suicides. Given these risks, and also broader features of the protest that may have been conducive to poor mental health such as family conflict, it is perhaps surprising that the suicide rate did not appear to increase during the course of the protests. The possibly unexpected result may be due to the positive aspects of social gatherings and social cohesion cancelling out negative aspects, suggesting a complicated relationship between suicide and media during periods of social unrest and political tension. Additionally, some sources of support such as counselling and social work assistance were provided and publicised to those affected following the deaths that may have provided alternative means of coping (consistent with the \"Papageno Effect\") [34] . Thus, while there may have been an increased risk in some, the saliency of the belief that the suicides may have involved protesters may have increased participation in the social movement and given meaning to the lives of some who might not have had the opportunity to participate in mass social gatherings since the Umbrella Movement in 2014. If it is indeed the case that gatherings and social engagement helped to offset some negative effects of heavily reported suicides, then the ongoing suicide rate since the pandemic and related social isolation should be monitored closely.",

Some potential early interventions should be provided, including certain positive cues, fact-checked information and appropriate helpline information. In the long run, a concrete plan needs to be developed to monitor and respond to sensationalized discussions of deaths on social media in a real-time or responsive way to minimize suicide risk. Authorities may also take stronger steps to prevent potential causes for suspicion, for instance, through more timely investigations and Coroner Court inquests into deaths to provide accurate information to the community and counteract disinformation or misinformation [35] .",

Authorities should seek to provide open and transparent access to information for media outlets, including those of differing political positions, to assist them with the task of disseminating high quality, rapid information in response to public concerns. Global suicide media guidelines could also be updated to consider complex political factors that can affect reporting, such as during periods of social unrest. Finally, the presence of suicide media reports from international outlets that conflicted with suicide reporting guidelines suggests the need for more globally coordinated standards and monitoring of suicide reporting. Future research may examine this further.",

Hence complete data for the three periods were not available to make a full comparison. Although the reporting of suicides in Hong Kong has been found to be quite extensive and consistent, with 30-40% of cases being reported in the media, the percentage of cases being reported in the media may have fluctuated over the course of the study period. While there is confidence in the overall trends, further study at a later date may use official figures, which may be used to more precisely examine evidence of copycat suicides. Secondy, although we have used sentiment analysis to allude to possible emotional and behavioural risks, the relationship between sentiments and actual suicide rate remains unknown. Future work can consider conducting real-time sentiment analysis to establish the monitoring of public mood and risk, to further explore the causal relationships between media reports, social media discussions and suicide rate. sentiment score based on the positive score and negative score to represent the general sentiment of one post. The overall sentiment scores whereas 0.5 were used to represent the posts with both 0 positive score and 0 negative score. For anxiety, anger and sad, the range of the score is 0-100, the larger the score, the more tendency towards this emotion whereas the range of overall sentiment score (OSS) is between 0 and 1, and the post is more positive if SSO is closer to 1, and more negative if closer to 0. There are two steps to get the sentiment score. First, all messages were segmented into a set of keywords with the help of jieba. 1 In order to better fit Hong Kong cultural context, colloquial words and local slangs were added in jieba dictionary to optimize the word segmentation. Second, all punctuation, emojis were removed before calculating the emotion score.",
