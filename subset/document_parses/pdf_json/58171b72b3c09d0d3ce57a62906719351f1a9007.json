Patients will have different degrees of symptoms, such as swelling, pain, numbness, and raising difficulty, post-traumatic stress disorder, axillary web syndrome, cancer-related fatigue, become long-term health problems for patients [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Postoperative upper limb functional exercise can gradually replace the role of armpit tissue by enhancing muscle strength, fully activating deltoid muscle, deep scapular muscle and latissimus dorsi muscle, etc., and can effectively reduce the incidence of postoperative complications such as subcutaneous blood and fluid accumulation in the affected limb, necrosis of the skin flap and severe upper limb edema, which can prevent the functional recovery of the operative side limb [17, 18] . Rehabilitation exercise can improve muscle pump, promote lymphatic fluid flow, aerobic training can increase intra-abdominal pressure, to promote chest duct pump blood, improve lymphatic reflux [19] . It is safe and effective for patients at risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema and those with BCRL at all points in the life trajectory [14, 20, 21] . In addition, rehabilitation exercise can stimulate the release of \u03b2 -endorphin, exciting the patient's central nervous system, relieve their pain while improving sleep and mood, also can make nervous system release inhibition muscle tension and mental depression of the micro electrical stimulation, in order to eliminate or reduce fatigue [22, 23] , improve exercise compliance [24] , its role in reducing breast cancerrelated fatigue has been demonstrated [25, 26] . In addition, after upper limb exercise and muscle relaxation training, the affected shoulder function and health-related quality of life were significantly improved, and early rehabilitation treatment (including range of motion of shoulder and intensive exercise) could improve the range of motion of shoulder after breast cancer surgery [26, 27] . Therefore, it is very important to develop a scientific functional exercise plan for breast cancer patients after surgery and urge them to carry out gradual functional exercise for the recovery of upper limb and shoulder joint function and reduce the incidence of complications.",

            "text": "Usability evaluation is an indispensable link in the process of medical product development and one of the key factors for the successful implementation of telemedicine [32] . The International Standardization Organization 9241-11 international standard defines usability as the effectiveness, efficiency and user subjective satisfaction of a product when it is used for a specific purpose by a specific user in a specific use environment [33] . Usability expert Jakob Nielsen believes that usability testing is carried out at all stages of the product design and development process, including early paper prototypes, rapid prototyping, and postproduction [34] . Usability evaluation can bring great value for the patient, increase productivity, enhance user well-being, avoid pressure, increase accessibility and reduce injury risk; therefore, scholars have suggested that before large clinical trials, it is necessary to invest a certain amount of time and resources in usability evaluation. Due to the three characteristics of VR: Immersion, Imagination and Interaction, the connotation of product usability developed based on this technology and its derivative technology has been supplemented and updated. Presence is a subjective feeling rather than an objective reality, which is exactly what the VR system aims to achieve so that the \"virtual\" can achieve a \"real\" effect. Cybersickness is one of the most common side effects in VR applications, Statistics show that more than 60% of users will experience screen sickness when using VR devices, which will bring an unpleasant experience to users and reduce the time and frequency of using VR devices [35] . The degree of presence and the severity of cybersickness was gradually covered in usability study. To the best of our knowledge, at present, there is still no research on the usability of upper limb rehabilitation for breast cancer based on VR.",

When experiencing a new environment, novelty, immediacy and uniqueness can make people more excited. People can give more attention to completing a task or experience using VR devices through multisensory interactive approaches such as seeing, hearing [40, 41] . Patients can be motivated to participate by adding fun and gamification, in addition, game design elements and game principles can be added to the task to increase patient exercise compliance. According to the characteristics of movement disorders of patients, a flexible and personalized rehabilitation design makes it possible to provide stepby-step rehabilitation treatment. Low-cost virtual rehabilitation systems can be used as adjuvants to regular rehabilitation with less direct supervision by doctors or can be considered remote or home rehabilitation tools. The use of motion sensors in conjunction with a VR system for rehabilitation allows the functional assessment and digital tracking of patients, which adds beneficial elements to current rehabilitation strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the development and availability of a breast cancer rehabilitation exercise system, which has not been previously reported. There are many rehabilitation systems based on VR and its derivative technologies to assist breast cancer patients to recover their upper limb function, quality of life and psychological state. Such as House et al. [42] developed a virtual robot rehabilitation system platform, Brightarm Duo, which provides patients with multisensory stimulation through nine sports games and puzzle games for passive shoulder movement, motion control, single-hand [43] used an Xbox 360 Kinect, a 3D motion camera matched with a VR system, to move patients off of the handgrip during training and to implement task-based sports programs combined with shoulder passive motion. There were significant decreases in pain level and fear of exercise in the test group. The upper limb function score and shoulder joint range of motion increased. Axenie et al. [44] combined VR and machine learning technology to develop a sensorimotor function rehabilitation system for multiple neuropathies caused by chemotherapy. Virtual characters on the screen increased the patient's sense of existence and identity and combined the accurate mapping of motor characteristics and multimodal perception with the consistency and effectiveness of internal model prediction. Park et al. [45] developed a digital healthcare system based on augmented reality technology and motion sensor technology, through tracking and positioning 25 joints of upper and lower limbs, using Xbox One Kinect for Windows records and feedback the number of repetitions and precision of exercise tasks in real time. Doctors can remotely prescribe exercise prescriptions to users by referring to uploaded data, which can be modified and calibrated according to patients' recovery and exercise effects. Participants can carry out daily exercise according to doctors' prescriptions. But the technology used in this study mainly focused on the positioning of joint angles Tracking the trajectory, rather than placing the patient in an immersive world, remains fundamentally different from our focus. In addition, VR and its derivative technologies have been widely used in the diagnosis of complications [13], palliative care [46, 47] , pain relief [48] , reduction of chemotherapy side effects [49] , psychological intervention [41, 50] . Such as A. de Sire et al. [14] and Invernizzi et al. [13] used an augmented reality tool 3D laser Scanner, which uses a triangulation mechanism to project a laser point onto the upper limb to be measured. The sensor measures the distance to the surface of the object to detect THE PATIENT's BRCL, achieving an accurate, repeatable, reliable and economical diagnosis. Helene Buche et al. [51] confirmed that no matter immersive or participatory VR, it is different from traditional emotion regulation tools (such as music, Yoga), can be provided to the patients engaged, through visual will be isolated from the medical environment, patients with change the users' perception of time, a distraction from the tense unpleasant stimulus, are titer induced mood, improve the well-being, reduce anxiety, it allows the individual's attention on the virtual experience, scattered from the tense environment unpleasant stimulus.",

Possibly due to the higher number of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the region Women are often less likely to use Internet electronic products in the age range of 40-70 years because their cultural level is low, their learning ability is weak, and they have conservative and cautious attitudes when accepting new things; therefore, the next step in the process of improvement should consider the characteristics of the audience and the patients' attitudes and preferences as the basis of iterative improvement.",

Therefore, when designing VR scenes and animations, the experience of cybersickness can be reduced according to the influencing factors of cybersickness [59] : (1) the user actively controls his viewpoint and adjusts it; (2) avoid or limit linear or angular acceleration or deceleration to reduce stimulation of the vestibular organs; (3) display visual indicators or movement tracks to users; and (4) dynamically blur the unimportant areas.",

The SSQ scores were 0.93\u00b11.16, 0.80\u00b11.27 and 0.80\u00b11.27, respectively, among which the nausea score was the highest, which might be related to the patient's recent chemotherapy, but none of the symptoms were significant. Therefore, in future experiments and applications, the time after chemotherapy should be avoided to distinguish the causes of these symptoms and prevent adverse reactions to chemotherapy from leading to poor use experience of the system. The sweating symptoms of some patients are related to hot weather in summer and the heavy weight of the helmet. Therefore, considering the active exercise undertaken during rehabilitation exercise, in the improvement process, HMDs should be as light, comfortable to wear, stable in position and able to dissipate heat as possible. The device used in this study was an immersive HMDs, which gives the best immersive experience to patients compared with other devices [61] and can cooperate with the handle sensor for action recognition and interaction with virtual objects. Studies have shown that compared to using desktop computers and projectors and other nonimmersive devices, wearing HMDs can cause head pressure, eye fatigue, physical fatigue and halo screen symptoms more easily [62] . Therefore, in this study, some patients showed discomfort of the oculomotor nerve and fatigue, thereby targeting issues for improvement in the future. We will consider using surface TVs instead of HMDs to ensure a sense of immersion and reduce sweating, dizziness, oculomotor nerve discomfort and other symptoms.",

Second, the patients included in this study were exposed to this VR rehabilitation system for the first time, and the results may have been influenced by novelty effects. Third, only questionnaires were used in this paper to judge the availability of the system and the response to the use of VR equipment, and immediate and objective results could not be recorded. In the future, more comprehensive and scientific measurement methods (such as respiration, heart rate, and electroencephalogram) should be used to quantify the symptoms of cybersickness and immersion in real time. Finally, this paper only conducted a usability study without effect evaluation. In the next step, a strict randomized controlled experiment should be designed to evaluate the application effect of the system platform.",

The results show that the VR rehabilitation system is available, feasible and easy to learn for breast cancer patients. Through various human-computer interaction methods, such as sight, hearing and touch, participants adapted to the difficulty level according to the selection of rehabilitation mode based on the state of the affected limb and enjoyed the stimulating, diverse and interesting experience of sports games, which presented both physical and psychological cognitive challenges. The system developed in this study is not applied to commercial promotion; in contrast, it is designed to be used as a starting point in other clinical researchers' potential, immersive VR and interactive technology to explore the potential for the treatment and rehabilitation of breast cancer postoperative rehabilitation purposes. We look forward to the contributions of other researchers in this field. ",
