            "text": "Operating Room (OR) management has been among the mainstream of hospital management research, as ORs are commonly considered as one of the most critical and expensive resources. The complicated connection and interplay between ORs and their upstream and downstream units has recently attracted research attention to focus more on allocating medical resources efficiently for the sake of a balanced coordination. As a critical step, surgical scheduling in the presence of uncertain surgery durations is pivotal but rather challenging since a patient cannot be hospitalized if a recovery bed will not be available to accommodate the admission. To tackle the challenge, we propose an overflow strategy that allows patients to be assigned to an undesignated department if the designated one is full. It has been proved that overflow strategy can successfully alleviate the imbalance of capacity utilization. However, some studies indicate that implementation of the overflow strategy exacerbates the readmission rate as well as the length of stay (LOS). To rigorously examine the overflow strategy and explore its optimal solution, we propose a Fuzzy model for surgical scheduling by explicitly considering downstream shortage, as well as the uncertainty of surgery duration and patient LOS. To solve the Fuzzy model, a hybrid algorithm (so-called GA-P) is developed, stemming from Genetic Algorithm (GA). Extensive numerical results demonstrate the plausible efficiency of the GA-P algorithm, especially for large-scale scheduling problems (e.g., comprehensive hospitals). Additionally, it is shown that the overflow cost plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of the overflow strategy; viz., benefits from the overflow strategy can be reduced as the overflow cost increases, and eventually almost vanishes when the cost becomes sufficiently large. Finally, the Fuzzy model is tested to be effective in terms of simplicity and reliability, yet without cannibalizing the patient admission rate.",

            "text": "The healthcare of surgical patients is typically operated through a sequence of standard stages. Among them, there are two key stages, the operative stage and the postoperative stage, which characterize the transition from a high-to a low-intensity care (Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022) . The transition of surgery patients flows from the upstream to the downstream, and they are eventually discharged after recovery. Given that most upstream resources are relatively expensive and scarce, especially for operating rooms (ORs), the mainstream of extant research focuses on the scheduling issues of upstream resource (e.g., ORs), while simply assuming ample sufficiency of downstream resources (e.g., inpatient beds) (Dur\u00e1n et al., 2017; Roshanaei et al., 2017; Shylo et al., 2013) . However, in practice, if the downstream resources are exhausted, then the whole system will be disrupted accordingly. In this case, a shortage of downstream resources, especially inpatient beds, not only hinders the timely treatment of patients, but also further devastates the utilization of related resources in the operating rooms (ORs). One of the most effective ways to address a shortage of the downstream resources is to balance the resource by \"coupling\" the capacity of the upstream with the one in the downstream (Bastos et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020) . For instance, Schneider et al. (2020) indicate that blocking can be alleviated by balancing the capacities at different stages, viz., by minimizing variations of bed usage. In practice, balancing capacity alone could not always iron out the wrinkles, because there are many factors in play overwhelmingly causing a shortage of inpatient beds, such as insufficient capacity (Bazzoli et al., 2003) , inefficient capacity allocation (Green, 2012) , and certain unexpected emergency occurrences (Gupta, 2007) . In this case, many hospitals adopt the regionalized practices by allocating beds and medical resources in terms of the dedicated specialties (e.g., oncology wards, obstetric wards, etc.). Operationally, this can curtail the bed shortages (Song et al., 2020) . On the flip side of the coin, such resource allocation without a centralized coordination can also cause resource idling for some wards while others are suffering from shortages. Practically, raising hospital capacity, such as increasing the number of inpatient beds or nurses, is not always feasible under such a situation (Best et al., 2015; Wang, Li, et al., 2020; Wang, Qin, et al., 2020 .",

In practice, many hospitals first classify their inpatients according to specialties (e.g., cardiology, orthopedic, general medicine, etc.) based on which patients are then assigned to corresponding wards (i.e., primary wards) for treatments . Take the general medicine ward for example, as depicted in Fig. 1 , when its capacity is fully used, incoming patients must wait in a queue for beds; however, patient condition may deteriorate, or they may suffer from some emotional distress while waiting. To address the issue, the overflow strategy thus suggests diverting patients of over-capacity wards to other wards with available capacity for the sake of reducing waiting time. In view of Fig. 1 , surgery patients of general medicine wards are transferred to cardiology wards for postoperative recoveries in accordance with the overflow strategy. In this case, those diverted patients and the diverted ward are called overflow patients and overflow wards, respectively.",

Therefore, surgical scheduling needs to be systematically and judiciously examined by not only the benefits brought by the overflow strategy, but also its associated costs. To this end, this study proposes a two-stage model to holistically balance the costs and benefits pertaining to the overflow strategy.",

            "text": "In the real healthcare system, there are a myriad of inevitable uncertainties, which add more wrinkles to resource management. For example, a hospital manager may lack knowledge in advance on the exact surgery duration and LOS of a patient, which is the essential information for managing the bed and OR utilization. The absence of such knowledge or its unpredictability is the most cause that hinders the efficiency and effectiveness of resource allocation and scheduling (Shylo et al., 2013) . Typically, for such resource allocation problem with uncertain demand, it is usually solved by stochastic programming or robust optimization (Wang et al., 2022) , which radically assumes variables following a known probability distribution. However, the underlying distribution of a variable is often unknown in principle and is usually statistically estimated based on its historical data (Shapiro et al., 2009) . Nevertheless, the statistical inference of historical data to the underlying distribution is dubious or rather controversial (Shapiro & Nemirovski, 2005) . Besides, medical history data is not always sufficient or complete (Priya et al., 2017) . For example, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to disruptive changes in surgical procedures and entrenched preoperative preparation and postoperative disinfection time for most patients. There are also some elective patients who are unable to be hospitalized in a timely manner and their condition deteriorates, making their operation time and LOS even more uncertain. In this case, the surgery duration and LOS can only be estimated by experts (e.g., surgeons) based on their experience and expertise, which may vary significantly from person to person, and this intensifies modeling difficulty. Methodologically, Fuzzy theory is embraced to be an effective way to handle such variations in estimation (Bellman & Zadeh, 1970) , and has gained a wide range of applications in job scheduling (Abdullah & Abdolrazzagh-Nezhad, 2014) , production management (Han et al., 2020) , among many others. Fuzzy estimation of uncertain durations does not require a large amount of historical data, hypothetical data distribution or complex probability calculations-only the inference of a panel consensus, which significantly reduces data bias and alleviates the complexity of the scheduling model (Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., 2008) . In practice, the fuzzy estimates of surgery duration and LOS made by panel consensus can truthfully reflect the heterogeneity of patients. Nevertheless, there has been scarce research investigating the impacts of uncertainty in surgical management by adopting Fuzzy theory. This study aims to bridge the gap in the extant literature.",

As mentioned before, although the overflow strategy has been proven to be effective in solving the issue of downstream bed shortage and simultaneously improving upstream resource utilization, it unavoidably comes with a cost, e.g., exacerbating the readmission rate and LOS. This study is dedicated to analyzing these tradeoffs pertaining to the overflow strategy and to finding the optimal policy for overflow bed allocation. Furthermore, given that both the uncertainty of surgery duration and LOS radically impact the effectiveness of surgery scheduling, this study investigates the feasibility of using a scheduling technique fueled with fuzzy data to mitigate the uncertainty. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to streamline upstream and downstream medical resources in a fuzzy environment.",

However, for a small-scale problem, the overflow strategy is always effective, regardless of the overflow cost.

            "text": "Our model considers two homogeneous resources, inpatient wards and operating rooms (ORs). Surgical scheduling with limited beds has been studied extensively in the healthcare operations management literature. For example, Min and Yih (2010) focus on the shortage of downstream stroke intensive care unit (SICU) beds. By considering the number of SICU beds as a constraint, they develop a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize the total of patient treatment costs and expected overtime costs. Recently, Zhang et al. (2019) propose a two-level optimization model considering the limited capacity of downstream SICU for elective surgery planning in a single department. Vancroonenburg et al. (2019) employ a chance constraint method to tackle the shortage of downstream inpatient beds in surgical admission scheduling. The important feature shared by these studies is the \"exogenous\" capacity constraint of the number of beds-once the bed capacity is fully used, patients can no longer be admitted. In contrast, our study considers bed utilization as an optimization objective, in lieu of a capacity constraint. There are some other studies, which also consider bed utilization as an objective function of optimization. For example, Schneider et al. (2020) study the impact of inpatient bed resources (such as the utilization of inpatient beds in both the wards and the ICU) on surgical planning, and propose a singlestep scheduling model with the objectives of minimizing bed variations and maximizing OR utilization. F\u00fcgener et al. (2014) propose an MSS method, which aims to minimize downstream costs by balancing bed demand and reducing weekend bed demand. d 'Obrenan et al. (2020) propose a model with the objective of variation minimization in the required bed capacity to solve the stochastic scheduling problem. Beli\u00ebn and Demeulemeester (2007) assume that the bed shortage, such as expected shortage and the probability of shortage, is predictable if the daily bed demand can be stabilized, which further enables them to build a cyclical master surgery schedule with an estimate of bed utilization and shortages. All these aforementioned studies share the common goal of mitigating the impact of uncertain surgical scheduling on downstream resource management. Although their efforts to alleviate bed shortage is shown effective under some condition, we believe that further improvement can be achieved by consolidating the interaction of upstream and downstream management. Departing from the aforementioned studies, this paper considers the surgical process as a two-stage (upstream and downstream) system that also includes the management of multiple medical resources such as ORs and inpatient beds.",

In addition, Bekker et al.(2017) propose a shared ward strategy to allocate medical resources among different wards; this sharing strategy has been widely studied in patient admission scheduling problems (including both surgical and non-surgical patients). However, so far there has been only a few studies that have considered resource sharing in surgical scheduling. This study investigates the overflow strategy for sharing homogeneous beds to balance upstream and downstream demand and to increase patient admission rates as well as the number of surgeries.",

            "text": "The uncertainty in operation scheduling usually involves the surgery durations, LOS in the ICU, and LOS in the wards. Given that the upstream OR is one of the most expensive resources, most of the current research focuses on the OR scheduling and management. For example, Eun et al. (2019) define an OR planning problem in which uncertainty in surgery duration is incorporated. In addition, Denton et al. (2010) , Min and Yih (2010) , Freeman et al. (2016) , Wang et al. (2022) and Atighehchian et al. (2020) also consider the uncertainty of surgery duration. Given the intertwined connection between the upstream and the downstream in a hospital system, some studies extend to consider the uncertainty from both stages. For instance, Saadouli et al. (2015) assume the durations of surgery and recovery to be stochastic, and develop a model to optimize surgery and recovery planning that avoids OR occupation by recovery patients. Considering the surgery and recovery uncertainties, Zhang et al. (2020) employ a stochastic programming model, and propose several heuristics to solve the elective surgery scheduling problems. Unlike the abovementioned studies, this paper integrates the surgery durations and LOS in the ICU as the overall surgery duration, and also takes LOS into consideration.

            "text": "There are a variety of methods developed for tackling the uncertainties in surgical scheduling, among which the most common two are stochastic optimization and robust optimization. For the former, Kumar et al. (2018) develop a stochastic mixed-integer programming model to balance the patient flow under downstream capacity constraints. Stochastic optimization considers hospitalization time to be stochastic, but assumes that the distribution is known, which might not be true in practice. Denton et al. (2010) compare a stochastic optimization model with a robust optimization model for the uncertainty of the surgery durations. The results show that robust optimization is suitable for those in which parameter distributions are unknown. Neyshabouri and Berg (2017) propose a two-stage robust optimization model that considers both the uncertain surgery durations and the LOS to develop robust schedules for a surgical ICU. Moosavi and Ebrahimnejad (2020) assume the surgery time, LOS, and emergency to be stochastic, and develop a robust multi-objective programming model for elective and emergency surgery scheduling. In contrast to the assumption of known distribution for stochastic optimization, robust optimization is more resilient when the information about data distribution is scarce (Rachuba & Werners, 2017; Wang et al., 2022) . Given limited information, robust optimization needs to estimate the range of uncertain parameters from panel consensus, while epistemic uncertainties among panel experts are usually ignored. To accommodate such epistemic uncertainties and minimize model errors, we employ fuzzy sets for surgery scheduling. There have been several studies adopting fuzzy sets to tackle surgical uncertainties (e.g., De & Sana, 2015; Singh & Yadav, 2018; Tavana et al., 2013) . Moreno and Blanco (2018) propose a fuzzy planning method for multi-objective patient appointment scheduling in large hospitals. Lee and Yih (2014) , Behmanesh and Zandieh (2019) , and Wang, Li, et al. (2020) , Wang, Qin, et al. (2020) ) describe the uncertain duration of operations with fuzzy numbers to build fuzzy models, which proves to be effective in the application of surgical scheduling. In contrast, previous studies focused on the daily scheduling of surgery with limited ORs and ICU beds (i.e., the upstream), whereas we study multi-day scheduling for a planned time horizon with a focus on the limited recovery beds (i.e., the downstream). In this paper, we leverage triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) to model the surgery duration and LOS. TFN and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are two representative and commonly-used types of fuzzy numbers (Seyfi-Shishavan et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2019; S. Wang et al., 2013) . Actually, TFN can be treated as a special case of trapezoidal fuzzy number, which is characterized by its simple expression for a complex model. For our problem under this study, a surgical scheduling problem is usually complicated for its joint considerations of various resources (including upstream and downstream) and uncertainties of surgery and hospitalization durations. In this sense, TFN is selected for our proposed surgical scheduling problem to reduce its computational complexity.",

In particular, a larger \u03c8 2 reflects that the manager tends to rely more on the plausible estimates of surgery duration and LOS. In contrast, larger values of \u03c8 1 and \u03c8 3 mean that the manager inclines to conservatively control OR overtime and bed overflow by relying more on pessimistic estimates.

One example is illustrated in Fig. 5 . The diversity in patient population may pose a problem in the process of population initialization, which can directly affect the results of a global search. Therefore, we should generate as many feasible solutions as possible to avoid any bias in population initialization. Moreover, some constraints in surgery scheduling must be taken into consideration, such as the due dates of patient surgeries and the availability of surgery teams. In this case, the substrings \u03b7 can only be randomly generated within a limited time range. For example, if the due day of a surgery is day 4, the admission schedule for the patient must be randomly generated within the first four days. Besides, this study also considers outpatients, who do not require hospitalization and can be discharged on the same day of their surgery.

An example is illustrated in Fig. 6 , in which there are 9 patients scheduled for surgeries within a 2-day time frame, and there are two available ORs with a capacity of 45 time units per room per day. The first stage is performed through Steps 1-2, and the second stage is executed by Steps 3-6. Initial assignment stage (Steps 1-2): Patients are first grouped according to admission day, and then each group is sorted by the length of surgery duration in a descending order. The first patient in the first group is assigned to the freest OR and then removed from the assignment waiting list. The process is repeated and performed with the second group until all patients are properly assigned. Readjustment stage (Steps 3-6): First, ORs are ranked by the total duration of surgery in a descending order. In the illustrative example in Figure 6 , OR1 is suffering from overtime, while OR2 has idling capacity. Next step is to calculate the overtime of the first-ranked OR (OR_1) and the idling time of last-ranked OR (OR_J). The overtime of OR_1 in the example is 1 (i.e., 46-45=1), and the idling time of OR_J is 6 (i.e., 45-39=6). Third, the patient with shortest surgery duration in bottom-ranked OR are selected (patient 1, p1, with 19 time units of surgery in the illustrative example) to calculate the threshold duration L, which is the sum of overtime of OR_1, idling time of OR_J, and the shortest surgery duration in OR_J. In the example, L=1+6+19=26. Fourth, if the patient's surgery duration is less than L, then we swap the patient with the longest surgery duration in OR_1 (patient 9, p9, with 21 time units in the example) with the selected patient with shortest surgery in OR_J. In the example, since the surgery duration of patient 9 (p9) is less than the threshold duration of L=26, he/she is selected to be swapped with patient 1 (p1). Lastly, the process is repeated until all the overtimes of the OR are resolved. The algorithm process of OR assignment is curated in Algorithm 1 in Appendix \"Heuristic of OR assignment and bed assignment\". (2) Ward assignment Each specialty has a set of designated wards (beds) as its primary wards, and its patients can also be routed to nonprimary wards (beds) when it goes out of capacity. Ward assignment can be divided into two stages: initial allocation stage and readjustment stage. The first stage is to maximize occupation of the primary beds. In the second stage, beds released from discharged patients can be redistributed. An illustrative example is described in in Fig. 7 , which also delineates the basics of the bed assignment algorithm.",

In particular, there are 30 available inpatient beds in the hospital, including 10 primary beds and 20 nonprimary beds. The normal operating hours for an OR is 8 h per day, with maximum overtime of 3 h per day, and the surgery team follows the OR schedule scheme. To ensure practicality of our model, several hospitals are interviewed, which reveals that the unit cost of OR overtime and unit revenue of OR do likely vary hospital by hospital. However, several hospitals have a similar cost and revenue structure, as examined by the study of Gerchak et al. (1996) . Following their work, we set the unit cost of OR overtime to $15/min ( p o = $15), and the unit revenue of an OR to $10/min (r = $10). The per-bed costs at the stages of intensive care, step-down, acute care, and post-acute care, are set as $4000/day, $2500/day, $1000/day, and $600/day, respectively, by following the estimations in Bretthauer et al.

In this numerical comparison, we examine the idle rate of ORs (R1), the relative reduction of idle rate with an implementation of the overflow strategy (R2), and the relative reduction of idle rate per overflow bed (R3). The idle rate of ORs is successfully reduced by 7.2\u221229.6% with an implementation of the overflow policy. Furthermore, an overflow bed can reduce the idle rate of the OR by 0.87%-2.99% on average. In practice, the unit cost of the ORs is steady and could be easily assessed, but the unit overflow cost may vary significantly from one hospital to another. Therefore, it is our intension to conduct a sensitivity analysis in terms of the unit overflow cost to examine the robustness of the model. The results are summarized in Table 5 and Fig. 9 . There are several interesting findings in the sensitivity analysis. To begin with, it is shown that the higher the unit overflow cost, the fewer the surgeries can be scheduled, and the surgery revenue decreases accordingly. Moreover, when the unit overflow cost reaches around $3000, the advantage of the overflow strategy is almost fully compromised. The advantage of the overflow strategy tends to be salient when the scale of problem is small. Even when the unit overflow cost skyrockets to extremely high as $999,999 or beyond, the overflow strategy still successfully assigns an overflow bed in Problem 1. This would happen when a hospital has exhausted the bed capacity, but some patients remain and must undergo surgeries within the planning horizon. In summary, the overflow strategy will benefit for either a small hospital or one with lower overflow costs, and the overflow strategy empowers a hospital with more flexibility to handle excessive demand. Fuzzy theory is leveraged in this study for its advantage in analyzing data with limited size and uncertain probability distribution. It can model multiple probability distributions, while simulation experiments can only be performed with a single predetermined probability distribution. The probability distributions considered in this study for the surgery duration are assumed to be normal, lognormal, and uniform distribution (Lee & Yih, 2014; Marcon & Dexter, 2006; Min & Yih, 2010) ; those for the length of stay (LOS) are normal, exponential, and uniform distribution (Augusto et al., 2010; Best et al., 2015; Moosavi & Ebrahimnejad, 2020) . Fuzzy theory allows us to consider various combinations of distributions for surgery duration and LOS, e.g., lognormal distribution for surgery duration and exponential distribution for LOS. In other words, Fuzzy theory enables scenario analysis of probability distribution for the combined uncertainty of surgery duration and LOS to make a thorough examination of the model robustness.",

Table  Table 11 , 12 and 13 in Appendix C). The difference among various schemes is shown to be significant only comparing Problems 3 to 10. This can be intuitively explained by that when the problem scale is small, OR utilization is relatively slack, and surgery demand is relatively modest, the number of admitted patients is not sensitive to the estimation models. In other words, the effect of various models becomes significant only when the resource shortage emerges in play. The maximum estimation scheme, MAX, provides a conservative estimate of surgery duration and LOS, and thus admits and schedules the least number of patients, while enjoying a minimum of constraint violations. On the contrary, the minimum estimation scheme, MIN, yields an aggressive estimate of surgery duration and LOS, and thus admits and schedules the most patients, while suffering from more constraint violations. The MAX scheme is obviously not favorable to hospital management for its poor profitability, but the patient satisfaction level may be compromised by the MIN scheme. In addition, the MAX scheme is more susceptible to extreme values, so hospitals are generally not able to adopt it. Surprisingly, the MIN scheme does not always bring the highest income for each problem setting, from Problems 1 to 10, compared to the MED, MODE, and FUZZY. For example, for Problem NO.10, the ob of MIN is not the largest in all distributions. The reason for this is that the MIN scheme admits too many patients and exhausts the bed capacity, which erodes the profitability by additional OR overtime costs.",

This implies that the Fuzzy model and the crisp models (MODE and MED) have similar effects on the value of the objective function, while departing in their robustness.

More importantly, the fuzzy data generated in the experiments is to simulate the estimations made by inexperienced physicians (without any self-corrections); in practice, however, physicians repeatedly refine their estimations based on their accumulation of experience, which can be leveraged gradually to improve the performance of the Fuzzy model.

However, the strong nexus between the upstream ORs and the downstream inpatient beds is often overlooked. Operationally, a surgery cannot be performed if a downstream inpatient bed is not available. Some studies have revealed that the overflow strategy, albeit an effective solution for a resource balancing between the upstream and downstream, leads to an increase in both readmission rate and LOS. Additionally, surgery duration and LOS are both critical data needed for medical resource scheduling and allocation, but they are simply assumed to be deterministic or stochastic with pre-determined distributions. In practice, surgery duration and LOS are uncertain and estimated by doctors, and the estimation distributions are also usually unknown. Fuzzy theory is well known for its advantages in analyzing data with limited size and with uncertain probability distributions. This study thus leverages the fuzzy theory, and at the same time incorporates an additional cost of the overflow strategy to consider the strong upstream and downstream nexus. As a solution approach, a hybrid heuristic method (GA-P) is proposed to solve the NP-hard resource scheduling and allocation problem.",

Given that the uncertainties considered in this model are from the surgery duration and LOS, minimum estimates lead to the most optimistic and aggressive schedulingFig. 10 Measurements of triangular fuzzy number (TFN) 1 \u03b1 x MIN MAX MED MODEplan, and maximum estimates yield the most pessimistic and conservative scheduling plan, while the plans of median and mode likely stay in between.",

It is formulated as follows:where R k represents the target value of algorithm k, and R best denotes the target value of the optimal solution. Due to the inherent randomness of meta-heuristics, each iteration of the experiment may produce different solutions; hence RPD cannot be directly applied to algorithm evaluation. Instead, we average out the above evaluation formulas to obtain the average relative percentage deviation (ARPD). Its formula is given as follows:where n represents the number of iterations. Likewise, the best value for each run is the best relative percentage deviation (BRPD), with the formula given as follows:where B R k indicates the best target value among n runs. Similarly, the worst value for each run is the worst relative percentage deviation (WRPD), the formula being defined as follows:where W R k represents the worst target value among n runs.",
