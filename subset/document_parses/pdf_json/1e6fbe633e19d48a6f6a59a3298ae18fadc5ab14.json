For instance, the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone indirectly caused a 65% increase in AP within target communities [4] . School closures and economic downfall following periods of quarantine augmented sexual exploitation. Therefore, COVID-19 underlines the need to evaluate and learn from prior health policy in strategizing more effective AP prevention legislation. Reviewing Ecuador's attempts to reduce AP, first through the implementation of differentiated services for adolescents, then via establishing an integrated lifecycle model, and lastly, their current strategy involving gendered violence, demonstrates how each plan has varied in effectiveness yet collectively failed to create an upstream approach that builds human capital.",

SADAs was formed based on the assumption that adolescent pregnancy was the result of health education knowledge gaps that could be bridged by increasing access to trustworthy, non-condescending, approachable health professionals who only served adolescents. The program provided 1,061 health professionals with sensitization workshops and specialized medical training for working with adolescents [5] . However, the demographic census released before SADAs in 2005 reported that 96% of women in Ecuador between the ages of 15 and 49 expressed they already knew of information regarding contraceptive methods and that 95.5% of them were aware of modern preventative options available to them [6] . Therefore, by focusing on the individual, SADAs failed to recognize and address the larger systemic driving forces of AP.",

Policymakers concluded that the fragmented care structure created by SADAs, with its emphasis on providing specialty services to adolescents, actually worsened inequalities in health services. Thus, the new Model of Comprehensive Family, Community, and Intercultural Health Care (MAIS-FCI) emphasized the equal level of care throughout each stage of an individual's life cycle while also emphasizing that the adolescent population, in particular, continues to be intensely equipped with medical information [7] . However, the lack of guidance at the local level during this policy transition led to a regression in community health clinics' quality of services. Due to added workload requirements and confusion surrounding which competencies they were to continue under the new framework, health personnel had difficulty sustaining adolescent-targeted care. Most concerning, Ecuador had continued using the promotion of health information as the main AP prevention strategy.",

For example, one of the scheme's main goals is to improve the justice system such that it is easier for adolescents to file charges against sexual predators [8] . Hopefully, future evaluations of this rights-based approach will find it to be successful in decreasing AP especially among girls under 15 years, whose rates of AP in LAC have been increasing.",

Only 11% of adolescent girls from wealthy Ecuadorian households give birth, whereas, for girls in impoverished households, this rate reaches 28% [9] . Adolescents living in communities characterized by social isolation and limited job opportunities may view early parenthood as a means of ascending in social status. If a greater effort is placed into mandating intense career-counseling and creating job opportunities, disadvantaged adolescent boys and girls may overcome their neighborhood's culture of despair. Given viable aspirations, they will be more likely to obtain economic mobility and delay parenthood [10] . Empowering girls economically may also reduce their dependency on male partners and strengthen their ability to refuse partaking in unprotected sex.
