Although studies on this disease are emerging rapidly, less is known about the impacts of COVID-19 and urban greenery on leisure-time physical activity, which is critical to maintain health for urban residents during the pandemic. In this study, we used a natural experimental research design to identify whether urban greenery cushions the decrease in leisure-time physical activity caused by the pandemic and related social distancing measures in a high-density city. The two-wave physical activity data (before and during the pandemic) were collected for urban residents in neighborhoods with high or low levels of greenery. The results of difference-in-differences model suggest that urban greenery mitigated the decrease in physical activity during the pandemic. People who lived in greener neighborhoods experienced a lesser decrease in the leisure-time physical activity level than those who lived in less green neighborhoods. Additionally, people who lived in greener neighborhoods experienced increased levels of physical activity related to visits to country parks during the pandemic. These findings suggest that urban green spaces play a significant role in shaping physical activity and providing a refuge for the public during crises. Our study is among the first to investigate the impact of urban greenery on pandemic-induced changes in leisure-time physical activity in densely populated Asian cities, and our findings shed light on the potential protective role of urban greenery on public health during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that adults should perform at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or at least 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week (World Health Organization, 2010) . Adequate physical activity and exercise can reduce the risks of certain diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory diseases (Haskell et al., 2009; Kokkinos, 2012; Warburton et al., 2006) . Furthermore, regular physical activity may be particularly beneficial for health during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, a regular physical activity habit can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and limit the damage caused by COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020) . Second, the widespread nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertain prognoses, unfamiliar isolation policies, financial losses, and conflicting messages have induced considerable levels of fear, worry, depression, and anxiety among the public (Pfefferbaum and North, 2020; Torales et al., 2020) . Continued and increased engagement in physical activity is recommended to cope with pandemic-related stress, consistent with previous studies that proved the likely significant role of physical activity in the management of mental health diseases, especially depression and anxiety (Fox, 1999; Paluska and Schwenk, 2000) .",

Here we define the green space as the vegetated area, combined areas of trees, parks, forests, or gardens (Almanza et al., 2012; Bastian et al., 2012) . The superior health benefits of physical activity conducted in a green space may be explained by two reasons. First reason is related to the stress recovery theory and attention restoration theory, which suggest that green space may contribute to recovery from stress and attention fatigue (Kaplan, 1995) . The second reason is the synergy effect between physical activity and exposure to nature; empirical studies have shown that when compared with built-up settings, natural settings induced more positive affective, cognitive, and physiological responses (Mitchell, 2013; Van den Berg et al., 2007) .",

Regarding children and adolescents, strong evidence supports the relationship between the time spent in sedentary behavior and obesity (Rey-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; Tremblay et al., 2011) , and moderate evidence suggests links with blood pressure and total cholesterol levels in children (Gopinath et al., 2012; Ullrich-French et al., 2010) . In adults, strong evidence supports associations of sedentary behavior with all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (Chau et al., 2015; Patterson et al., 2018; Schmid et al., 2015) . In addition, moderate evidence supports a link between sedentary behavior and ovarian, colon, and endometrial cancer incidence rates (Kerr et al., 2017) .

In particular, urban greenery is an important contributor to physical activity and health outcomes (Richardson et al., 2013) . Exposure to urban greenery in neighborhoods generates significant health benefits, including reduced mental stress, improved physical health outcomes, and decreased chronic disease risks (Kardan et al., 2015; Stigsdotter et al., 2010) . In urban settings, accessible green spaces offer places for urban-dwelling residents to perform exercise or recreational activities. In an international study conducted in multiple cities, a significant and positive correlation was observed between the number of parks and the level of physical activity (Schipperijn et al., 2017) . Positive associations have been identified between physical activity and the proximity, access, size, quantity, and quality of urban green spaces (Coombes et al., 2010; Klompmaker et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017) . For example, access to a large, attractive urban green space is associated with more frequent walking (Astell-Burt et al., 2014) . In another study, people who lived in the greenest quintile neighborhood had a higher odds of achieving the recommended amount of physical activity than those living in the least green quintile neighborhood (Mytton et al., 2012) . Evidence regarding the effect of exposure to street-level greenery on physical activity has emerged in recent years. Researchers have noted that higher exposure to greenery at the street level increases the odds and total time of engagement in physical activity Yang et al., 2019 Yang et al., , 2020 .",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often recommended to mitigate confounding effects and isolate treatment effects (Kabisch et al., 2011) . However, large-scale RCTs remain impractical in urban planning or public health research. In recent years, natural experimental studies have been advocated strongly and preferentially for providing rigorous evidence about the potential associations between the built environment and physical activity (K\u00e4rmeniemi et al., 2018) . Natural experiments have a long history in public health research, and the most famous example is John Snow's study of cholera in London (Snow, 1855) . Generally, natural experimental studies are defined as observational studies in which particular interventions have been implemented but are not under the control of researchers (Leatherdale, 2019) . For example, outcomes of interest can be compared between populations that are newly exposed or unexposed to policies or environmental changes (i.e., experiment and control groups, respectively), and/or changes before and after the changes go into effect can be compared within a population (i.e., pre-post observations).",

In a study conducted in Australia, researchers identified an association of local recreational walking with objectively measured access to a medium-or large-sized park (Christian et al., 2017) . Another study confirmed that positive perceptions of the presence of and proximity to green spaces and the total and largest areas of green space contribute significantly to a higher likelihood of walking (Sugiyama et al., 2013) . Researchers also observed a relationship between the quality of streetscape greenery and \"green\" activity, but not with total physical activity (de Vries et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Most natural experimental studies support the link between access to urban green spaces and increased physical activity and health outcomes during normal periods (i.e., the period before the COVID-19 pandemic). However, little is known about the effect of urban green spaces on physical activity during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Several studies have offered some tentative findings. A recent study in Norway used average mobile tracking data from the same day over a 3-year period and found that outdoor recreational activity increased by 291 % during lockdown (Venter et al., 2020) . Furthermore, the propensity of visiting green spaces increases with the number of weekly new COVID-19 cases in four high-density Asian cities . Urban green spaces may have accrued health benefits for urban residents during the pandemic via five pathways : 1) Urban green spaces are suitable settings for people to conduct physical activity, which improves the physical health (Maas et al., 2008; Richardson et al., 2013) ; 2) People have prolonged electronic device use during the pandemic, which leads to negative mental health. Visiting green spaces provide necessary breaks from electronic device use (Jiang et al., 2018) . 3) People have elevated stress and anxiety during the pandemic, especially when confined to indoor settings. Exposure to green space may help to reduce stress and negative moods (Kaplan, 1995) . 4) People may be exposed to negative interpersonal factors and/or environmental factors at home, e.g., domestic violence, noise, crowding, while visiting urban green space may reduce such exposure (Douglas et al., 2020) . 5) People may have fewer social interactions during the pandemic. Visiting urban parks and other open green space and seeing others may increase a sense of social cohesion and social belonging (Fone et al., 2014) . Such findings suggest the importance of urban green space as a resilience infrastructure during times of crisis. However, these longitudinal studies did not implement a rigorous natural experiment design and lacked clearly defined experimental and control groups.",

On January 25, 2020, the Hong Kong government declared the COVID-19 outbreak as an \"Emergency\" and announced the temporary closure of all indoor sports facilities, outdoor land sport facilities, and aquatic facilities. Though these facilities resumed service in mid-March transitorily (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) , in view of the worsening situation of COVID-19, the government announced to close these facilities again on March 23. It is worth noting that Hong Kong did not implement a strict \"lockdown\" policy so far. Though these facilities were closed, green spaces and outdoor jogging tracks remained open as well. This change in the public policy provided the set-up for a natural experiment in which we may be able to collect longitudinal pre-post physical activity data on a cohort of urbandwelling residents of neighborhoods with different levels of greenery who were subject to the imposed changes. The baseline data were selfreported during January 6-10, 2020 (T 1 ), and the follow-up data were self-reported during May 2-5, 2020 (T 2 ). Only participants included in both data reports were retained in the analysis. Accordingly, the data of 661 residents were analyzed. Of them, 332 lived in a neighborhood with higher greenery (normalized difference vegetation index, or NDVI > 0.292, more details in the section below), and 329 lived in a neighborhood with lower greenery (NDVI < 0.199).",

Compared with those living in low greenery neighborhoods, participants living in high greenery neighborhoods reported lesser decreases in the durations of leisure-time physical activity conducted in neighborhoods, at home and the total leisure-time physical activity. Among the three domains, the most important difference can be found in the duration of physical activity conducted in neighborhood (DiD = 37.914). The difference in the duration of physical activity conducted in neighborhood between high and low greenery neighborhoods (159.83 min vs. 236.93 min respectively) was nearly 80 min in T 1 .

Residents in Hong Kong often rely on public parks to conduct leisure-time physical activity in neighborhood (Chow et al., 2016) . During the pandemic, the Hong Kong government also suggested residents to engage physical activity in open green spaces or at home to reduce virus infection risk while still maintain adequate physical activity. Although there is no lockdown in Hong Kong, people living in low greenery neighborhoods may avoid such community parks due to the fear, the crowdedness, and potential virus infection risk in such community parks. On the other hand, people in high greenery neighborhoods have more open green spaces per person. The perceived crowdedness and risk of virus infection in parks and other greenspaces was much smaller. Hence, they may continue to use such parks and other open green spaces, e.g., tree-lined streets, cycling lanes, or greenways. In other words, the disparity in the attitudes towards park use between the two groups may lead to a different reduction in leisure-time physical activity conducted in neighborhood.",

In other words, people in low greenery neighborhoods are more physically active than those in higher greenery neighborhoods. This may be due to two reasons. First, low greenery neighborhoods in Hong Kong generally have a high population density (see Fig. 4 ). Several empirical studies established a positive association between density and physical activity (Ewing and Cervero, 2010; McCormack and Shiell, 2011) . For example, people living in high-density areas are more likely to engage in walking as a means of transportation to their destinations. Second, residential self-selection bias may lead to this disparity. A previous study suggested that households with higher incomes in Hong Kong often choose to live close to urban centers, whereas low-income households tend to live far away from urban centers (Lu, 2018) . Affluent people are more likely to have positive attitudes toward healthy activities and tend to engage in more physical activity (Parks et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2004) .",

Again, this may be due to two reasons. First, indoor sports facilities were closed and could not provide space for urban-dwelling residents to engage in physical activity; consequently, the residents visited country parks and public beaches, which remained open. Second, country parks and mountains are less crowded than urban built-up areas, which may have encouraged the public to visit these sites rather than walking or performing other physical activity in their neighborhoods. From a psychological perspective, the attention restoration theory holds that exposure to a natural environment can alleviate mental fatigue (Kaplan, 1995) . Country parks far from dense urban areas not only provide space for physical activity but may also reduce the anxiety and stress caused by the virus outbreak. By comparison, participants living in low greenery neighborhoods are further away from country parks than those living in high greenery neighborhoods. Hence, participants living in low greenery neighborhoods visited country parks less often due to the long transportation and potential infection risk during transportation.",

The findings from our study demonstrate the positive contribution of urban greenery in mitigating the decrease in Table 3 Difference-in-differences (DiD) estimates of the effect of urban greenery on leisure-time physical activity. In addition, areas of natural greenery outside of urban built-up areas, including country parks and hiking trails, provide a refuge where urbandwelling residents can meet their physical activity and mental health needs during the pandemic. As the COVID-19 pandemic may last long, governments should balance their guidelines between preventing virus transmission and promoting physical activity. The key point of preventing virus transmission is reducing gathering and risk of cross infection. Therefore, outdoor individual physical activity, for example, leisure walking, jogging, should be allowed in pandemic non-crisis period with clear hygiene guidelines. Even though the indoor recreational facilities were closed, outdoor green spaces should remain open for residents to engage in outdoor activity and meet their daily needs. Another feasible strategy is to establish a booking system to control the number of visitors in these green spaces. Urban planners and designers should reconsider the contributions of urban green spaces to address public health needs during normal and crisis periods. A higher greenery neighborhood may increase the willingness to engage in physical activity during the pandemic, so it is important for each neighborhood to access greenspace easily, equally, and sufficiently. An accessible greenery network, such as pocket parks and roof gardens, was recommended to add in existing low greenery communities to serve residents better. Urban planners should also consider the capacity of greenspace in future design, which may bring evidence for the government to decide how many parks should be closed or opened during the crisis periods.",

People who lived in greener neighborhoods were less likely to become physically inactive during the ongoing pandemic.

First, we only observed physical activity levels at two time points, and therefore, we did not have sufficient data with which to estimate level and slope parameters that require multiple observations. Second, the physical activity data were self-reported by the participants, which may have introduced recall bias and social desirability bias. The ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may enable the continuous collection of physical activity data using automatic records from apps and devices (e.g., iPhone Health, WeChat Steps) in future studies. Third, as we mentioned above, the neighborhood population density may also influence the difference in physical activity reduction. Though we focused on physical activity for leisure and recreational purpose rather than physical activity related to transportation and work, a neighborhood with high density might make residents feel crowded and decrease the propensity to engage leisure physical activity in neighborhood. Therefore, the current findings should be interpreted with caution, even though we controlled population density in our analysis. Future studies need to disentangle which built environment factors shape physical activities and more importantly, and to understand the potential mechanism. Fig. 4 .

Using two-wave longitudinal panel data, we confirmed an association between changes in leisure-time physical activity and the level of urban greenery. Our findings highlight that exposure to urban greenery mitigates the decline in physical activity caused by pandemic restrictions. A lesser decrease in the leisure-time physical activity level during the pandemic was observed among people who lived in greener neighborhoods than among those in less green neighborhoods. In addition, the total duration of physical activity in country parks increased for all participants, suggesting that urban green areas may provide urban-dwelling residents with a suitable venue to conduct physical activity and reduce stress during the ongoing pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental prevention policies have created a natural or quasi-natural experiment research opportunity for public health and urban management studies, and our findings might provide evidence to inform future policy development.
