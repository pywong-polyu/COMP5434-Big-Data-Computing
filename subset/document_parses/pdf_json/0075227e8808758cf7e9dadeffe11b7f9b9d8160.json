However, the rapid immunochromatographic assay commonly used for antigen detection can only detect viremia at the progressive stage. In this study, nested recombinase polymerase amplification (nRPA) was developed for exogenous FeLV DNA provirus detection, and reverse transcriptase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) was developed for the detection of FeLV RNA. The approaches were validated using 108 cats with clinicopathologic abnormalities due to FeLV infection, and from 14 healthy cats in a vaccination plan. The nRPA and RT-RPA assays could rapidly amplify the FeLV template, and produced high sensitivity and specificity. The FeLV detection rate in regression cats by nRPA was increased up to 45.8% compared to the rapid immunochromatographic assay. Hence, FeLV diagnosis using nRPA and RT-RPA are rapid and easily established in low resource settings, benefiting FeLV prognosis, prevention, and control of both horizontal and vertical transmission.",

The virus causes fatal diseases, especially cytopenia and hemopoietic tumors including acute myeloid leukemia, thymic lymphoma, multicentric lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes, myelodegenerative disease, and aplastic anemia 2,3 . Coinfection with FeLV was found in more than 90% of cats with feline infectious peritonitis and more than 3.5% of those with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), increasing the severity of the symptoms and the occurrence of complications 4 . The prevalence of FeLV infections varies among geographical areas, occurring in about 31.3% of cats in Malaysia 5 , 24.5% in Thailand 6 , 14.2% in Iran 7 , 3.6% in Germany 8 , and 3.4% in Canada 9 . Horizontal transmission occurs by direct contact with infected cats via oronasal exposure to saliva by licking, mutual grooming, sharing food dishes or water bowls, and biting, and also from exposure to feces, milk, and by blood transfusion 10,11 . Although vaccination reduces FeLV infection in unexposed cats, it does not provide 100% protection. Moreover, FeLV vaccination does not prevent DNA provirus integration after exposure. The best methods of prevention are feeding cats in a closed area, separating an infected individual in a multicat household or animal shelter, and screening blood for the virus before blood transfusion 12 .",

The absence of FeLV proviral and RNA antigens is categorized as an abortive infection in either anti-FeLV antibody positive cats that have a low dose exposure and self-clearing of the virus by the immune system, or as antibody negative in unexposed cats. A regressive infection is categorized by undetectable OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ antigenemia, and FeLV RNA converts to exogenous DNA provirus, which usually integrates into the chromosomes of the germ cells. The incorporated DNA provirus becomes endogenous DNA in the host chromosome, leading to vertical transmission. The disease may relapse in regressor cats under immunosuppressive conditions 13 . Progressive infections are categorized by detectable antigenemia, FeLV RNA, and DNA provirus, since the virus persistently sheds into the circulation and tissues. Such progressive stage infected cats are a major reservoir for horizontal transmission. About 50% of cats with persistent viremia die within 2 years, and 80% die within 3 years 14 . Although antiviral drugs and chemotherapy can retard mortality, they cannot cure the infection or prevent mortality. Consequently, early diagnosis is beneficial in stopping or reducing the cycle of horizontal and vertical transmission in feline populations, and in managing the clinical outcomes.",

False positive results have been demonstrated in three point of care FeLV p27 test kits, using either single or combination tests 15 . Methods based on the detection of FeLV DNA provirus or RNA are therefore more reliable, and are recommended as the gold standard approach. A number of molecular methods have been developed, including conventional PCR, nested (n)PCR 16-18 and real-time quantitative PCR (rtq)PCR 19,20 .

The RPA process relies on three key proteins: recombinase, single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), and polymerase. The nucleoprotein, comprised of each primer and recombinase, binds to complementary sequences in the targets. The SSB binds to the dissociated DNA strand, stabilizes it, and prevents DNA reannealing. The polymerase exponentially amplifies the target sequence. The RPA reaction can be achieved in 20 min or less at a constant temperature of 37 \u00b0C-42 \u00b0C, and have high specificity and sensitivity 22 . The principle of primer design for nRPA is similar to that for nPCR. The two primers are designed for two consecutive RPA reactions. The first set of primers are designed to anneal to specific target sequences. The primary RPA products are used as the templates for secondary RPA reactions. The second sets of primers are design to anneal downstream from the first set of primers and amplify the internal target of initial amplicon 23 . The sensitivity and specificity of RPA amplification could be enhanced as in nPCR. Therefore RPA-based methods have become promising tools for the detection of various pathogens, particularly in laboratories that are not well equipped, or for field diagnosis. In this paper we described the development and validation of nRPA and reverse transcriptase (RT-RPA) assays for the detection of FeLV DNA provirus and RNA. Both FeLV RPA assays can be used in veterinary hospitals for rapid diagnosis, which is required in order to enable effective prevention and infection control.",

The positive RPA or PCR samples revealed a 145 bp amplicon, with the negative results being subsequently retested by nRPA or nPCR to yield the expected 101 bp amplicon in positive samples. There was an almost invisible positive band in seven negative nRPA samples with negative nPCR results and in four negative nPCR with negative nRPA results. These samples were retested using both techniques, and the negative results were confirmed. The results are summarized in Table 1 . Detection of FeLV provirus by PCR revealed 73 positive and 49 negative results, and 17 of these 49 negative PCR were then found to be positive by nPCR, giving a total of 90/122 positive samples. Detection of FeLV provirus by RPA revealed 70 positive and 52 negative results, with 20 out of these 52 negative RPA samples being found to be positive by nRPA, giving a total of 90/122 positive samples. Thus, 90 samples were found to be positive by both the RPA/nRPA and the PCR/nPCR approaches, with nRPA and nPCR having a higher sensitivity than RPA and PCR. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Comparisons of the results obtained from RPA with those from PCR, and of the results obtained from RPA plus nRPA with those from PCR plus nPCR for FeLV provirus detection are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. The RPA assay resulted in three false negative results compared to the PCR assay, which was taken to be the gold standard. The diagnostic performance of RPA compared to PCR produced 95.89% (95% confidence intervals [CI] of 88.46-99.14) sensitivity, 100% (95% CI of 92.89-100) specificity, and a kappa value of 0.949 (CI of 0.893-1.000).

In this study, we developed novel nRPA and RT-RPA approaches to detect FeLV DNA provirus and RNA in circulating blood. The use of nRPA for FeLV provirus amplification increased the detection rate by about 45.8% (27/59) over that of p27 antigen detection. This increase would improve clinical diagnosis, because antigen detection has limited sensitivity for the detection of viremia in the progressive stage, resulting in a loss of latent detection. The detection of FeLV provirus using nucleic acid amplification based methods has been recommended as the gold standard due to its higher sensitivity and specificity 12 . The presence of endogenous FeLV was related to disease progression, viral recurrence, and vertical transmission in cats' progeny. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ FeLV-A is the most common subgroup in cats 24 . The nRPA and RT-RPA primers were designed to target U3LTR, which is the conserved fragment in all subgroups of FeLV 25 . nRPA targeting the U3LTR showed very high sensitivity and specificity, with almost perfect agreement with the results of nPCR and rapid immunochromatography detection methods. The concordance between nPCR targeting the pol gene and ELISA has previously been found to be substantial 26 , and nPCR has a 100-fold greater sensitivity than conventional PCR 27 . The sensitivity and specificity of RPA amplification could be enhanced, as in nPCR based methods. However, carry-over contamination must be prevented by physically separating the area of the primary PCR reaction from that of the secondary reaction. The primary RPA products were diluted to optimum concentration to produce high sensitivity and specificity. The dilution of the initial amplification products also reduced the carry-over problem. One negative control/16 nRPA reactions/nested nRPA run was checked for carry-over contamination. The positive control was used at the minimum concentration, and added as the last tube to each nested nRPA run to prevent contamination 28 .",

Bands with a smeared appearance were suggested to be primer dimers, which did not interfere with the interpretation of FeLV detection. Although unexpected 200 bp products were identified in seven samples, their sequences were similar to those of the expected amplicon, except for the presence of three 21 bp repeat sequences similar to those in FeLV subgroup A and the FeLV v-myc gene. The repeat elements naturally occur between the enhancer and promoter in the U3LTR during FeLV replication through error-prone reverse transcription, and by endogenous provirus recombination, including c-myc transduction. The LTR variants was associated to particular disease outcomes, especially thymic lymphomas, multicentric lymphomas, and other non-T cell diseases 29, 30 .",

            "text": "One of the advantages of the detection of FeLV provirus and RNA using nRPA and RT-RPA is the ability to achieve rapid amplification using general heating tools, with no need for thermal cyclers. However, the major drawback, the need for post amplification detection using gel electrophoresis, could be improved in the future by the use of SYBR green I or lateral flow strip (LFA) detection. A simple post RPA detection step in FeLV diagnosis is needed for FeLV diagnosis at a molecular level in veterinary clinics. Multiplexed RPA-LFA has been shown to be able to detect ESBL genes in E. coli isolated from pork meat and pig feces 32 . Recently, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was rapidly detected by the naked eye, using allele-specific RPA combined with SYBR green I 33 . For RT-RPA, the TwistDx Basic RT kit is now not available for sale. However, a Basic TwistDX kit for DNA amplification can be used by adding an initial step involving a reverse transcriptase reaction such as RT-PCR to convert RNA to cDNA. The modified multiplexed RT-RPA by adding Moley murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and RNase inhibitor to the RPA pellet (Basic TwistDx kit, UK) successfully amplified and differentiated avian influenza viruses (AIVS) subtypes. Moreover, the combination of RT-RPA with capillary electrophoresis were simultaneously detected four AIVs genes with high sensitivity and high-throughput 34 . Recently, a one step RT-RPA by only adding ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase to the RPA pellet (Basic TwistDx kit, UK) could rapidly and sensitively detected SAR-CoV-2 35 . A combination of FeLV provirus and RNA testing using RPA assays is valuable for the diagnosis of the infective stages of FeLV before vaccination or blood transfusion. FeLV testing should be performed prior to blood donation to reduce the unintentional horizontal FeLV transmission. Nesina et.al. 10 have demonstrated that na\u00efve cats that received a blood transfusion from FeLV carrier cats developed FeLV-associated diseases, including nonregenerative anemia, T cell lymphoma, and secondary lymphoblastic leukemia.",

The administration of FeLV vaccine is ineffective in infected cats, and so makes cat owners become relatively incautious about preventing FeLV transmission.

Both RT-RPA and RPA had similar sensitivity and specificity to PCR-based methods but with the additional advantages of rapid amplification and no need for an expensive thermal cycler. The characterization of the infective stages of FeLV using RPA-based assays could be set up onsite in veterinary hospitals to enhance the efficiency of FeLV diagnosis, which is important for prognosis and disease control.

The column was washed twice with AW1 buffer and transferred to a new tube. The mixture of DNA and RNA was eluted by adding 70 \u00b5L AVE buffer, and centrifuged at 15,000\u00d7g for 1 min. The elution was aliquoted for DNA analysis and 30 \u00b5L was further purified for RNA using TURBO DNA-free kits (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).

The amounts of primary RPA products, primer concentrations, incubation temperature, and time were first optimized in preliminary trials. The first RPA reaction consisted of 0.24 \u00b5M of the U3F1 and U3R1 primers, 29.5 \u00b5L rehydration buffer, and 20 ng/\u00b5L template DNA in a total volume of 50 \u00b5L.

The 2 \u00b5L of primary RPA products from negative samples were diluted 100-fold and subjected to the second RPA reaction using the same nPCR primer set. The RPA conditions for the second round were unchanged, except that 0.18 \u00b5M of each primer was used, and incubation was carried out for 10 min only.

The U3 long terminal repeat (U3LTR) of the FeLV provirus was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, USA) and transformed into Escherichia coli JM109. The recombinant clones were extracted and utilized as a positive control for FeLV DNA provirus detection by PCR and nRPA assays. The Nobivac \u00ae Feline 2-FeLV vaccine (Merck Animal Health/Intervet Inc, Nebraska, USA) was used for preparation of the FeLV RNA positive control for the RT-PCR and RT-RPA assays. Detection of FeLV DNA provirus by conventional nPCR. The U3LTR of exogenous FeLV DNA provirus was amplified using two sets of primers with the GoTaq Green kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The first round of PCR primers were modified from Tandon et al. 44 as follows; U3F1 RPA: 5\u2032-AAA CAG CAG AAG TTT CAA GGC CGC TAC CAG -3\u2032 and U3R1 RPA: 5\u2032-CTG ATG GCT CGT TTT ATA GCA GAA AGC GCG CG-3\u2032, to produce a 145-bp amplicon. The reaction was performed in 25 \u00b5L total volume comprised of 12.5 \u00b5L master mix, 0.2 \u00b5M of each primer, and 20 ng of template DNA. The thermal cycling conditions were 94 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 45 s, 65 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 73 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by a final 73 \u00b0C for 5 min.

The second PCR reaction was comprised of the reagents as in the first round of PCR (except for the primers), using 1 \u00b5L of a tenfold dilution of the primary PCR product. The PCR conditions were 94 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 65 \u00b0C for 45 s, and 73 \u00b0C for 45 s, followed by a final extension at 73 \u00b0C for 5 min.Detection of FeLV RNA using one step RT-PCR.
