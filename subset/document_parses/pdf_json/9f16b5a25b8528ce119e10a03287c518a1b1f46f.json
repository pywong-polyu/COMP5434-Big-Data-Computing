Approximately 9.9% would perform it if they were instructed, 23.5%, if they wore facemasks, and 40.1%, if they were to perform hands-only CPR.

Although many strategies have been developed [3, 4] , BCPR is currently insufficient in most emergency medical service (EMS) systems [5, 6] . The epidemic outbreak of an emerging infectious disease (EID), such as COVID-19, may have a more negative impact on the BCPR rate for patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [7] [8] [9] [10] because of the fear of getting infected while breaking social distancing rules [11, 12] and helping such patients by coming in close proximity. Although the actual risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission to a health rescuer during BCPR is debatable [13] , the American Heart Association and European Resuscitation Council have recently provided an interim guideline for basic life support in this situation. The use of a facemask or cloth covering the nose and mouth of a lay rescuer and patient is recommended [14, 15] . Before appropriate strategies are designed and applied to optimize the BCPR rate, we need to determine the public's perceptions and reactions to this issue.",

First, it was observed that an outbreak of an EID, such as COVID-19, would have negative impacts on individuals' attitudes and behaviors toward performing BCPR, especially when the bystander is a physician or had no pre-existing CPR training. Second, we found that among those who already reported a negative change in attitude toward BCPR because of the outbreak, up to 74.5% still expressed positive behaviors toward BCPR (e.g., providing BCPR with facemask protection, performing hands-only BCPR without mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, or directly performing BCPR) once they encountered a cardiac arrest event. These findings could be helpful in exploring the barriers and facilitators of bystander resuscitations during an EID outbreak, which may shape better strategy or guideline modifications for BCPR achievement. Concerns regarding infectious disease transmission are a well-known barrier to layperson BCPR [29, 30] . In ordinary circumstances, Savastano and Vanni have shown that the fear of infection may be a possible barrier for lay rescuers to perform CPR [31]. In the context of an EID outbreak, Lam et al. reported the adverse effect of a severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak on bystanders' willingness to perform CPR [16] . Scquizzato et al. recently reported that laypersons refuse to perform CPR owing to coronavirus fears, thereby deteriorating the community BCPR rate [12] . Similarly, our study results showed that the COVID-19 outbreak has negative impacts on respondents' attitude and behavior toward BCPR.",

It is commonly assumed that individuals often behave according to their attitudes. However, social psychologists have found that attitude and actual behavior are not always consistent [32]. Our study results suggest that among those who had a negative attitude toward BCPR, only 14.7% of them would absolutely refuse to perform life-saving CPR. Most individuals (over 80% in our study survey) appeared to have attitude-behavior inconsistency such that even if their attitude toward BCPR became negative, they were still willing to perform BCPR in certain circumstances together with safer measures, such as hands-only CPR (44.3%), under facemask protection (25.5%), and under dispatch instructions of guidance (10.7%). Notably, individuals are more willing to perform CPR without mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, regardless of ordinary circumstances [33] or the pandemic context. Our study findings could support the rationality and feasibility of the American Heart Association's interim COVID-19 guidance for basic life support in adults, especially corresponding to the recommendation of performing at least hands-only CPR after recognition of a cardiac arrest event and covering the nose and mouth of the rescuer and/or patient with a facemask or cloth [14] .",

            "text": "It is also noteworthy that in this study, an individual's attitude and behavior toward performing BCPR were significantly associated with pre-existing CPR training. Our analysis showed that even if the respondents learned CPR from nonconventional educational platforms such as online media, their attitude and behavior toward BCPR were more favorable than those of the respondents without pre-existing CPR training. This finding is consistent with that of previous studies that indicated that CPR training could be a positive predictor of willingness to perform CPR [34] . Furthermore, we also noted relatively poor attitude and behavior toward BCPR among women, elderly population, and physicians. As the willingness to perform CPR is defined as an individual's perceived likelihood of performing CPR in a future scenario [35], our study findings indicated that these factors would probably be negative predictors of bystander willingness to perform CPR during the pandemic. Several studies have reported that men showed greater willingness toward CPR [36, 37] . It would not be surprising that the elderly population tended to refuse performing BCPR because of physical incapability or knowledge barriers. However, it is of interest that the physician respondents in this study, a group of individuals generally considered with the best knowledge of CPR, had the least willingness to perform BCPR during the outbreak. A similar phenomenon was reported by Huang et al. [36] in a telephone survey aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and willingness toward CPR but not specially focused on the occasion of infectious disease outbreaks. We speculated that physicians are more sensitive to uncertain mortality, routes, and risks of transmission of COVID-19, especially at the early stage of the EID outbreak when the evidence on this disease was sparse. Unless proven otherwise, physicians would tend to consider every sudden collapse of a stranger as a suspected COVID-19 infection. Hence, physicians were the least confident or willing to perform BCPR without full personal protective equipment protection (e.g., gown, gloves, N95 respirator, facemask, and goggles or facial shield) that they are used to having in hospital settings [38] .",

These measures could increase public awareness of epidemic risks of COVID-19 and hopefully aid better compliance with personal protective actions. However, they may also increase public fear of disease transmission and have a negative effect on the willingness of laypersons to perform BCPR. Therefore, EMS authorities should simultaneously launch certain countermeasures against this negative effect during the outbreak. Based on our study findings, we recommend the following major countermeasures: (1) continuous monitoring of the BCPR rate, (2) modification and reinforcement of dispatcher-assisted BCPR instructions (e.g., covering the nose and mouth of rescuers and patients with facemasks and emphasizing hands-only CPR), and (3) simultaneous education of the general public to routinely carry an extra facemask for emergency or resuscitations needs. These measures could be prepared for both rescuers and patients to reduce the barriers and fear of BCPR.",

However, there were limitations in our study that should be noted. First, our study population comprised active Internet and social media users; therefore, they may not represent the general population. These volunteer respondents from the Internet and social media may have more native attention and experience in first aid and disease outbreak information; hence, they could generally be considered less negatively influenced by BCPR than the general public. Our analysis showed a significantly negative change in the willingness toward BCPR among the study population; therefore, it could be inferred that the perception and reaction of the general public could perhaps be worse. Second, there may be a bias caused by limited Internet coverage and self-selection for data collection from the online survey design. However, there is evidence claiming that online surveys are a promising method for assessing how the general public understands and perceives a fast-moving infectious disease outbreak [39] . To our knowledge, there are 21 million active social media users (88% of the total population) in Taiwan. According to Wang et al. [40] , approximately 80% of the Taiwanese population relied on the Internet for COVID-19 information. In addition, in this study, we performed weighting using the raking method in the analysis of the survey data. In the weighted subgroup analysis, we found that the associations of the attitude and behavior toward BCPR with occupation and pre-existing training levels were similar to those of all eligible cases. Third, we were unable to confirm the time from the last CPR training of the respondents and the truthfulness of the respondents' answers regarding pre-existing CPR training, which could have affected our study results.",

However, this study was conducted at the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, that is, within 1 month after the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern. At this stage, COVID-19 outbreaks had mainly occurred in China, East Asian countries, Iran, Italy, and France. At the time, the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan exceeded that in the United States. There were four factors that might have stimulated the social pressure and public's fear of getting infected at this stage: (1) severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in the neighboring countries of Taiwan, especially China; (2) the boarder control and quarantine measures had not been expanded to inbound passengers from countries outside of China, thus increasing the risk of community outbreak; (3) the first COVID-19 mortality case in Taiwan was confirmed at that time; and (4) the public was very sensitive to unknown threats, especially in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, when the evidence on this EID was sparse. For these reasons, we believe that our study results can reflect the public's reaction and willingness toward BCPR during the COVID-19 outbreak, regardless of the incidence rate in Taiwan.",

Thus, the extrapolation of our study results to other countries should be done with caution. For example, in contrast to our findings, Baldi et al. has observed a significant decrease of the BCPR rate during the first 2 months of the epidemic in Northern Italy [41] . From our perspective, this conflicting information from the more burdened epidemic areas has verified the abovementioned Ajzen's theory of planned behavior [20] : the willingness to perform CPR is shaped by an individual's attitude, perceived social pressure, and perception of their capability to perform the behavior. In areas with severe epidemics, the individual's perceived social pressure such as concerns regarding infectious disease transmission may become more intense, which will have a greater negative impact on BCPR. Given that individual's attitude toward BCPR is not the only factor that affects \"actual\" resuscitative actions in the real environment; not to mention that most individuals appeared to have attitude-behavior inconsistency based on our study findings; therefore, we suggest EMS and health authorities should simultaneously launch certain countermeasures against the negative impacts on BCPR during the outbreak.",
