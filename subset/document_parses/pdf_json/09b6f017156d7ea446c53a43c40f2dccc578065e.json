Almost two thirds (65.1%) of the included articles were non-empirical and over two-thirds (68.4%) were from authors in the United States. More than half of the publications focused on specific areas, for example: oncology, cardiovascular care, and genomic medicine. Other key topic areas included: ethics, research, quality improvement, and electronic health records. We identified that definitions of the LHS concept are converging; however, many papers focused on data platforms and analytical processes rather than organisational and behavioural factors to support change and learning activities. Conclusions: The literature on LHSs remains largely theoretical with definitions of LHSs focusing on technical processes to reuse data collected during the clinical process and embedding analysed data back into the system. A shift in the literature to empirical LHS studies with consideration of organisational and human factors is warranted.

Even in the most developed countries less than two-thirds of healthcare delivered is in line with evidence-based guidelines (60%); one third of care is some form of waste (30%) and one tenth (10%) of it is associated with an adverse event. 1 These numbers have persisted for decades despite substantial efforts and resources dedicated to improving the safety and quality of care across the globe. 2 To overcome what has been coined the \"60-30-10 Challenge,\" 1 health systems will need to become more dynamic and responsive to new and emerging evidence. The Learning Healthcare model developed by the Institute of Medicine (IoM; now the National Academy of Medicine) outlines the form and function of such dynamic systems. 3-5 A Learning Health System (LHS), as defined by the IoM, is one",

Recent advances in technology, including the ability to collect and integrate massive amounts of routinely collected health data, have enabled health systems to begin to realise the potential of an LHS. 6, 7 Although the concept of an LHS is increasingly being embraced as a way to create smarter health systems, 8 it is more of a journey than a destination, and the evidence base surrounding LHSs is still in the early stages of development. 9,10 Previous reviews on this topic show that there is growing interest in LHS concepts and ideas, but relatively few empirical applications have been published to date. In 2016, a systematic review of the LHS literature by Budrionis and Bellika 9 revealed that of the 32 identified papers, only 13 described an empirically operationalised LHS. 9 Two years later, in 2018, Platt et al 10 conducted a scoping review and found that the LHS literature remained mostly theoretical, despite the growing number of publications in the LHS domain.",

One reason is that the IoM has published several different outputs explaining LHS concepts. 3-5 Overall, we found a large degree of convergence around definitions describing what constitutes an LHS. Typically, these definitions referred to an LHS as achieving healthcare quality improvement by using big data and embedding data analysis and intelligent decision-making into routine care delivery processes. This was consistent with key topic areas identified in our analysis, such as: electronic health records, quality improvement, and medical informatics. This is a promising finding for the emerging LHS field, as developing a common understanding and vocabulary around the LHS concept is imperative for its advancement. 17 Notwithstanding this, our findings suggest that the definitions and explanations of LHSs focused primarily on the information technology capabilities of an LHS at the expense of human and organisational factors. These human and organisational factors are necessary for environmental, system-wide change to support LHS development, such as organisational culture and the values and beliefs of staff required to drive behavioural and organisational change. 18 Another prominent topic area identified in this review was research ethics, such as the ethics of data access and re-use for clinical efficacy and safety. As the promise and potential of the LHS vision continue to emerge, there is increasing consideration of the ethical challenges that need to be addressed. A notable ethical challenge in LHSs is delineating to what extent structures need to be in place for informed consent 19 and where the difference lies between clinical care and research. 20 Publications included in our review referred to an",

Co-occurrence of keywords (ie, keywords used together on a publication) is visually depicted in the network of co-occurring keywords (Figure 2 ). In this network, each circle represents a keyword and each line indicates co- Oncology's CancerLinQ initiative. 22 CancerLinQ is a large database that collects information from electronic health records of cancer patients to foster an oncology learning community across the United States; it has been described as a rapid LHS. 23 This example demonstrates the inherent need for integrated data platforms to support the adoption of LHSs and the importance of rapid implementation and implementation science in this sphere. 24 As to strengths and limitations, this study highlighted key topic reviews. There is a need to capture research written in languages other than English to obtain a more widespread view of the LHS concept and its potential. This is particularly important given the divide between high-, middle-, and low-income countries when it comes to big data and personalised medicine, 25 which are key components of LHSs.",

Colours represent different clusters of keywords ethics framework conceptualised by Faden et al.21 In this framework, practitioners and institutions have an ethical obligation to feed information into the system to increase knowledge, while patients have an ethical obligation to contribute their experiences and health information to research. According to this framework, informed consent should only be sought if the learning activity could pose negative ramifications on care or result in burdens beyond normal expectations. However, access to data is often governed by laws and regulations determined outside of any individual LHS, and in many cases such laws and regulations may result in delayed access or other obstacles to the timely use and reuse of data collected during the course of clinical care provision. Despite a wide-ranging and robust set of discussions and contributions on the subject, the ethical questions of data use in LHSs are far from settled.As to progress with implementation, we identified specific healthcare conditions and services that were common sites for the adoption of LHSs. These included: oncology, cardiovascular care, general and internal medicine, and genomic medicine; these are consistent with findings from a past review on LHSs that identified similar clinical contexts.10 For example, oncology has become a key setting to examine concepts of and progress with LHSs, with one contributing factor being the implementation of the American Society of Clinical",

The LHS concept and terminology were coined by the United State's IoM; therefore, it is not surprising that when searching for LHS in the literature, much of it originates in the United States. There may be equivalent terms used in other parts of the world and in languages other than English.
