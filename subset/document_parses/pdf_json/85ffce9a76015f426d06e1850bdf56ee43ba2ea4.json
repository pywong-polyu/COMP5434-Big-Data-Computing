Unfortunately, we cannot directly observe the prevalence or growth rate of COVID-19; these must be inferred using some kind of model. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian extension to the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model that adds compartments to account for isolation and death and allows the infection rate to vary as a function of both mobility data collected from mobile phones and a latent time-varying factor that accounts for changes in behavior not captured by mobility data. Since confirmed-case data is unreliable, we infer the model's parameters conditioned on deaths data. We replace the exponential-waiting-time assumption of classic compartmental models with Erlang distributions, which allows for a more realistic model of the long lag between exposure and death. The mobility data gives us a leading indicator that can quickly detect changes in the pandemic's local growth rate and forecast changes in death rates weeks ahead of time. This is an analysis of observational data, so any causal interpretations of the model's inferences should be treated as suggestive at best; nonetheless, the model's inferred relationship between different kinds of trips and the infection rate do suggest some possible hypotheses about what kinds of activities might contribute most to COVID-19's spread. * Authors contributed equally to this work.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Preprint.

A simple model is the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered, or SIR model [8] , which partitions a population into \"Susceptible\", the people who are not yet infected, \"Infectious\", the people who have the disease and are actively spreading it to others, and \"Recovered\", the people who are no longer infected with the disease, often including both those who successfully recover and those who die from the disease. In practice, we may want to include an \"Exposed\" compartment, for individuals who have contracted the disease but are not yet infectious, resulting in an SEIR model. An SEIR model assumes an initial state (i.e. some initial numbers (S 0 , E 0 , I 0 , R 0 ) and a population size N S 0 + E 0 + I 0 + R 0 ) and a set of parameters that govern a simulation that evolves this initial state over time. The parameters include \u03b2, the infection rate, \u03b1, the incubation rate, and \u03b3, the recovery rate. The evolution of the state over time is prescribed by a set of differential equations: dS dt = \u2212\u03b2 IS N ; dE dt = \u03b2 IS N \u2212 \u03b1E; dI dt = \u03b1E \u2212 \u03b3I; dR dt = \u03b3I.

First, many (perhaps most) people who are infected are not tested; many mild cases are not tested either because individuals do not know that they are infected or because they have sufficiently mild cases that they either cannot or do not feel the need to get tested. Testing availability and policies are inconsistent across different regions, so the amount of underreporting is presumably also inconsistent across different datasets. Furthermore, demographic differences introduce selection bias: if patients with severe cases are more likely to get tested, then regions with a higher fraction of severe cases (e.g., because they have an older population) will have less underreporting. Second, there can be a significant delay between when tests are administered and when they show up in case counts; this delay is not consistently reported. Finally, there will be false positives and false negatives, and these error rates are also likely to vary by region since training is needed to get a good sample for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fitting compartmental models"}, {"text": "Death counts are more reliable than case counts and should also correlate with infection rate of the disease, albeit with a larger lag than case counts.

While there will still be false positives and negatives in the data due to misdiagnosed and misreported cases, we expect the death counts to be less noisy and biased than the case counts. Unfortunately, using death counts as a learning signal comes with a significant challenge: time lag. With COVID-19, it may take on the order of 2 to 3 weeks until death after infection, meaning any uptick in infections will not be visible in the death counts for 2 to 3 weeks [7, 9] . This introduces a modeling challenge, where a compartmental model that models the recovery period incorrectly will likely learn incorrect values for the other parameters in order to compensate for the incorrect delay. Furthermore, compartmental models do not usually directly simulate deaths in a population but rather the sum of deaths and proper recoveries.

However, given the surrounding literature, it is possible to construct a distribution over possible parameters that reflects the uncertainty that comes from both a lack of consensus and an inherently noisy process.

In three variants of this task, we choose a date (4/22/20) and fit a model to the data up to this date. We compute the predictive log-likelihood for the next 7, 14, and 28 days worth of data, using mobility data from the held-out period when forecasting 2 . To measure the quality of each model's forecasts, we report the average daily marginal log-likelihood numbers for the held-out data, which we estimate by taking the log-mean-exp of of the log-likelihoods for every sample, and averaging across days. This measures how well on average the model can predict the number of deaths on a randomly chosen day in the future.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 273, "end": 282, "text": "(4/22/20)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "COVID-19 forecasting"}, {"text": "Comparing mobility datasets We first evaluate whether having access to more fine-grained information about mobility trends is valuable for forecasting. To accomplish this, we examine held-out log-likelihood of MSEIQR[Multi/Overall] models in Table B.4a and Table B .5. We find that the MSEIQR[Multi] consistently achieves a higher average log-likelihood than the MSEIQR[Overall] mobility model in all forecast windows. Investigating further, it appears that the overall mobilitytrained model \"overfits\" to the slow increase in mobility we observe towards the end of the forecast period and predicts upticks in deaths where the data continues to trend downwards. This problem is reduced in the multiple-category model; we thus hypothesize that there are certain types of mobility that better correlate with infection rate and aggregating over different mobility types adds noise to these signals. For example, Figure B .3 shows that despite high uncertainty changes in grocery_and_pharmacy are a stronger signal of changes in infection rate than, say, transit_stations-this observed association does not imply that interventions targeting grocery stores and pharmacies will reduce COVID-19 spread more than closing subways, but it does suggest that these relative changes should not be weighted equally when trying to estimate its spread.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 264, "text": "Table B.4a and Table B", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 909, "end": 917, "text": "Figure B", "ref_id": null}], "section": "COVID-19 forecasting"}, {"text": "Comparing model variants We report held-out log-likelihood numbers for all model variants in subsection B.2.

Instead we conduct a held-out-data experiment to validate the consistency and sharpness of a model's nowcasting results. We pick a date t, fit a model trained up to t, and compute the distribution over R t . This model has not seen the deaths that result from infections happening to dates near t, so we expect its estimate of R t to have a wide interval, our \"nowcast\" estimate. We compare our nowcast distribution to a \"hindcast\" distribution, a distribution over R t from a model trained on data up to t + 21. In Figure 5 and Figure B .4, we plot a kernel-density estimate of R t from a range of models. We expect this hindcast distribution has a tighter estimate of R t since it has access to more data, but we also hope that it lies within the nowcast distribution. We find that CMSEIQR tends to have more conservative but less incorrect nowcasts. After including more data, the CSEIQR and MSEIQR[Multi] models collapse to a sharp estimate, but to an area with low mass in the nowcast, whereas the CMSEIQR model collapses to a less-sharp distribution that is closer to the nowcast.
