The specific changes were that a proportion of students learned a knowledge unit in advance under the guidance of the teacher through the SPOC model.

Firstly, our participants studied histology and embryology during the first semester of their first year according to the Syllabus of Harbin Medical University and had the basic capacity to understand morphological changes. Secondly, removing the Pre-assessment helped to reduce anxiety, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of online teaching during this period was to stimulate the interest of students to learn and transform fear associated with the pandemic using internal motivation. Table 1 shows that the Pre-assessment quiz could increase anxiety in the students. Deleting the Pre-assessment conferred an advantage during the early days of the pandemic.

We encouraged the Flipped class [14, 15] to feel personally committed, and to ask for and provide relevant feedback from and to students and teachers in SPOCs to consequently promote deep learning [16, 17] . The data showed that one of the 50 students did not wish to involve SPOC in this process, although teachers provided consultation in time. Five of the 50 students liked the combination of SPOC and the Flipped class, as they felt very motivated during the interaction. We believe that the difference was mainly due to various types of learning motivation in each individual. Some students who believe that \"passing is a good choice\" can hinder the enthusiasm of students and the root of this might be a long-term, complicated process in basic Chinese education. Teachers also spent considerable time and energy to prepare SPOCs, which might be adjusted in the future. Elementary schoolteachers also responded that preparing materials suitable for the Flipped class was laborious and time-consuming under the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [18] . However, the teachers believed that new thoughts and understanding through SPOC can be collected during the interaction of \"teaching and learning. \"",

Pre-class preparation resources and active learning materials that were already in place for flipped teaching were helpful in the transition to online teaching [20] . Therefore, the focus during the transition was to reconfigure active learning and examinations from the face-to-face format to the online platform by modified BOPPPS. According to the survey, 100% of the students were satisfied with online teaching and 70.4% of them who were particularly satisfied, thought that they could form a basic knowledge framework for oral diseases via oral histopathology lessons. Therefore, the main aim of this online lecture on oral histopathology was achieved under the unique circumstances imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. About 10% of the students thought that being unable to observe sections under an actual microscope was unfortunate, but most believed that the digital sections could compensate to some extent. A few students liked the online teaching method very much and even suggested that online and offline mixed teaching should be the main form of future learning. This indicated that the individualization of teaching and learning is gradually becoming obvious. This small-scale survey during a global pandemic found that education administrators in China should focus not only on personalized education for the students, but also on providing a platform for the personalized development of teachers, especially young teachers.",
