            "text": "Although evidence-based practices are available to prevent and control most diseases affecting domestic farm animals, economic losses due to animal health issues remain substantial (1) . Researchers emphasize the importance of risk factors related to numerous cattle diseases, but on-farm understanding and implementation of disease prevention and control measures is often suboptimal [e.g., (2) (3) (4) ]. For example, only 27% of producers in north-west England described biosecurity in relation to the management of pathogens or diseases on farms. Although farmers reported biosecurity measurements to be useful, many farmers did not actually apply them (2) . Additionally, despite comprehensive extension efforts and low costs to producers, 35% of Alberta's dairy farms were not enrolled in the voluntary Johne's disease control program initiated in 2012 (5) . It was previously assumed that decision-making processes were mainly driven by aspects related to financial costs and benefits. However, there is increasing evidence that decisions are also influenced by a variety of additional factors, e.g., farmers' perceived risk, perceived knowledge, perceived control, incentivization, emotions, and normative beliefs (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Therefore, better understanding of farmers' processes of decision-making regarding disease control on cattle farms is necessary to understand suboptimal implementation of best practices. Also, to design and implement successful behavioral change intervention studies, better understanding of farmers' behavioral influences is crucial.",

Disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, health psychology, and economics provide insights into factors that impact behavior. Social science approaches in veterinary epidemiology are increasingly recognized to understand the impact of stakeholders' behavior on disease control. Nevertheless, knowledge is still lacking on theoretically underpinned key determinants impacting whether farmers adopt practices that are important to prevent and control cattle diseases (13) . Explicit use of theory can help to identify influences on behavior change, understand mechanisms of change, and inform implementation of interventions (14) . However, interventions are often developed without a systematic method and without reference to evidence or to theories produced by behavioral or social sciences (12) .",

However, human behavior is influenced by a variety of factors and individual farmers are likely to respond differently in their evaluation of risk and whether to apply a disease control measure, with important consequences for disease transmission. The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that social aspects are important drivers for local and global variations in disease dynamics and burdens (15) . Therefore, a better understanding of important constructs that influence farmers' behavior would facilitate incorporation of human factors in epidemiological disease models, and eventually improve predictions and results.",

Furthermore, theories identify determinants of influence to be targeted to alter behavior and they reflect integrated knowledge about relevant mechanisms of action and moderators of change of behavior. Davis et al. (17) identified 82 health psychology theories for describing human behavior. Every theory consists of various key constructs, i.e., specialized terms, to label the theory's elements (18) . The 'Theory of Planned Behavior' (TPB) (19) , an extension of the 'Theory of Reasoned Action' (20) is the most commonly used psychosocial theory in human health (21) . A central factor in TPB is an individual's intention to perform a given behavior, because it is assumed that intention captures motivational factors that influence a behavior (19) . The TPB consists of three conceptually independent determinants of intention. The first is 'attitude toward the behavior, ' referring to the degree to which a person has a favorable or unfavorable appraisal of the behavior in question (19) . Secondly, 'subjective norms' refer to perceived social pressures toward a certain behavior, and thirdly, 'perceived behavioral control' refers to the perceived ease or difficulty of performing a behavior. The latter includes a reflection on past experiences as well as anticipated impediments and obstacles (19) .",

The Transtheoretical Model conceptualizes behavior change as a process involving a series of six distinct stages: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and termination. The Social Cognitive theory (24) states that behavior is influenced directly by goals and self-efficacy expectations and indirectly by self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and sociostructural factors. The Health Belief Model (25) hypothesizes that health-related behavior depends on a combination of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy. These theories include overlapping constructs such as results expectancies, i.e., beliefs about the behavior and expectations for the results of the behavior (21). Additionally, overlap in self-evaluation occurs, described as the individual's subjective evaluation of the amount of control and competency to engage successfully in a behavior. Finally, there is an overlap in social factors, regarded as the influences of other people on behavior change (21) .",

It provides a systematic way of characterizing interventions that enable their outcomes to be linked to mechanisms of action (12) . The BCW is a synthesis of 19 health psychology theories and frameworks and includes the assumption that behavior is not only driven by beliefs and perception, but also by unconscious biases, mental shortcuts, and physical and contextual environments (12) . The BCW consists of three layers: the hub of the wheel [the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation Behavior (COM-B) model], an intervention layer with nine functions, and a policy layer with seven categories (Figure 1 ). The hub of the wheel identifies the three constructs of behavior systems that could prove to be targets for intervention (12) . \"Capability\" is subdivided into psychological capability and physical capability. \"Opportunity\" can be subdivided into social and physical opportunity, and \"motivation\" into automatic and reflective motivation. All three constructs (capability, opportunity, and motivation) are conceptualized as being essential for behavior (12) . The BCW was successfully used in human health interventions to change human behavior [e.g., (40, 41) ]. To successfully apply this method, it is crucial to be specific about the target group and its behavior.",

Quantitative data help us to establish trends in the population and establish generalizability of the finding (44) . Surveys are the most popular and widely used method to capture information on attitudes and behaviors. Most commonly, these surveys are deployed in a cross-sectional study design. Data on attitudes could be collected also using longitudinal study design where surveys and questionnaires can be used to track responses over time, e.g., by asking the same questions at various time points, or they can compare differences across space, e.g., by asking the same questions in different countries using, for example, the British Social Attitudes Survey (45) and European Social Survey (46) . Finally, case-control studies could be also conducted to compare attitudes of two group. Attitudes are generally measured by a series of statements evaluated by Likert-scales, which uses five or six levels of agreement/disagreement. Another method used is the semantic differential scale, pairs of opposite concepts (e.g., strong/weak; democratic/authoritarian). The space between opposites is graded from a low e.g., 0 or 1 (expressing the lowest evaluation) to a high number e.g., 5 or 6 (representing the highest evaluation) (47) . After developing and validating the scale, data analysis begins by a statistical or empirical validation with the collected quantitative data from a survey by employing statistical techniques to ensure construct reliability and validity. Examples are explanatory factor analysis (mainly done for new scales), confirmatory factor analysis (48), confirmatory composite analysis (utilizing structural equational modeling technique) (49) , Cronbach Alpha (50) and item response theory (51) . Further analysis linking these constructs and behavior is conducted using for example regression techniques and latent class models (10, 52) .",

Common approaches to obtain qualitative data from study populations include indepth interviews, focus groups, expert panels (53, 54) and ethnographies. Often, data collection occurs via audio recordings and these recordings are transcribed and analyzed. Thematic analysis, commonly employed for qualitative data analysis, could either be done deductively or inductively (55) . In deductive analysis, themes or key categories are already defined before the analysis, e.g., script theory or Bourdieu concepts of field, capital, or COM-B model. An inductive approach is where categories are derived from the data, and new theories or hypotheses are developed. Grounded theory methodology (56), exclusively used for qualitative research, involves collecting and analyzing data (constant comparison) to formulate a theory.",

Overall, 58% of the published studies lacked any theoretical underpinning. Therefore, there is a lack of theory-informed tools to research in farmers' behavior related to cattle disease prevention and control. The percentage of studies based on theory increased from 2012 until 2014, relative to the period until 2011 (OR = 3.5, P = 0.04). However, in the years thereafter (2015-2018), this percentage tended to decrease (Figure 4) . Not all manuscripts of 2020 could be included in our review (search date October 26th), but it seems unlikely that the current percentage of 29% will increase substantially when the search term is used again. Reasons for the declining percentage of theoretical underpinned veterinary research remains unclear. It might be related to challenges of interdisciplinary research, and that most research on theories is published in sociological journals, which likely have limited veterinary readership. Presumably dissemination of developments in social science research to veterinary research is limited or at least suboptimal. Further, use of inductive approaches are a common feature of qualitative studies and half (51%) of the qualitative studies in the review were identified as exploratory. However, in studies using quantitative or mixed methods, 61 and 62%, respectively, lacked use of a theory.",

The TPB \"surge\" was also noticed in the human health studies but occurred a decade before the TPB \"surge\" in farmers' behavior studies, with the main increase between 1997 and 2012 (21) . A critical limitation of the TPB is that it is unable to explain sufficient variability in the data (65). For example, in human health studies, the TPB explained 39% of the variance in intentions but only accounted for 27% of human behavior variance (66) . Another concern about the TPB is its utility, as it fails in the primary function of a theory; namely, it does not accurately communicate accumulated empirical evidence and therefore does not enable practitioners to develop helpful interventions (Sniethotta et al., 2014) . The TPB is more useful for predicting self-assessed behavior than objective measurement of behavior and predicts behavior better in the short vs. long term (21) . In human health studies, there is a shift to frameworks that are composite of theory domain frameworks and are better for understanding and changing behavior, such as the COM-B model (26) .",

The overall aim in grounded theory is to generate theories inductively by collecting data about a phenomenon, identifying key elements, and categorizing the relationship of those elements to each other (67) . However, only 4 of the 11 manuscripts based on grounded theory ultimately mentioned the development of own theory, indicating failure to ensure that the analysis moved beyond narrative description to generate theoretical concepts (67) . This finding illustrates that the theoretical and philosophical underpinning of grounded theory was often not completely understood. Health psychology theories and constructs are validated in human health research, but there is limited evidence of measurement scale validation and very few have been statistically validated in the context of animal health (68) (69) (70) . In the reviewed work, there was a lack of confirmatory factor analysis testing theories and constructs. Human health and animal health environments differ considerably. Although farmers make decisions concerning themselves, similar to human health, they also make decisions that affect their animals and business. Therefore, it might be that these theoretical constructs may have even less explanatory value in the context of management of animal health. This hypothesis needs to be explored further.",

Constructs of the interpersonal influence consisted mainly of relationships with the veterinarian, peers, family, and employees. Constructs of the contextual influences were mentioned less frequently, but there was a huge variety of contextual influences in relation to farmers' decisions. This finding was not surprising, as contextual factors are likely to vary among countries with distinct legislations, industry initiatives, rewards and penalties related to disease control. Although most reported constructs belonged to the personal environment, it cannot be concluded that these factors are most important. Most likely, constructs belonging to the interpersonal and contextual environment were not extensively studied due to the limitations mentioned earlier in research methods used to study farmers' behavior. A drawback from focusing mainly on individual influences on behavior, is that understanding of more complicated and complex social, economic, and political influences remains unexplored (8, 71) . ",

There was a limited list of contextual factors influencing veterinarians' behavior, perhaps due to harmonization of practice standards or accreditation requirements under which veterinarians operated ( Table 6) . Personal determinants listed include veterinarians' own beliefs and perceptions as well as how they perceived farmers. Based on the evidence, we inferred that how veterinarians frame barriers to disease control differed from how farmers frame these barriers; unlike farmers, veterinarians put more emphasis of individual and interpersonal factors, as was apparent in the review (8) . To adapt to changing policy and practice environments, veterinary practitioners must more effectively blend scientific and evidencebased approaches to veterinary care with the pragmatic concerns facing farmers by fully understanding farmers' determinants of disease control (8, 78) .",

Furthermore, there was little evidence to validate any of the determinants related to farmers' behavior in cattle disease prevention and control or any interventions that lead to behavior change. To successfully change farmers' behavior, it is essential to understand influences on behavior, behavioral change mechanisms and implementation of interventions. Moreover, these understandings are crucial for knowing which theories are effective in veterinary epidemiology and ultimately for incorporating a human behavioral factor in infectious disease modeling. The explicit use of theory can promote understanding of complex behavioral structures. Additionally, our review indicated the complexity of constructs with effects at individual, interpersonal and contextual levels related to capability, motivation, and opportunity. Published studies have mostly focused on constructs at individual levels. Therefore, it is recommended that for a sustainable behavior change, studies should include wider constructs at individual, interpersonal and contextual levels. Also, interdisciplinary research involving persons specialized in applying social science techniques and associated analytical methods are key. The resulting constructs could subsequently be linked to interventions and be the first step toward theory-driven evidence-based interventions to influence farmers' behavior for disease control. ",
