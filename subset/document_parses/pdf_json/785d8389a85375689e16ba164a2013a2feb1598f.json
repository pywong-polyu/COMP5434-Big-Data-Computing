The gold standard in the detection of these antibodies is the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). As these experiments must be done in a very secure environment, other techniques based on pseudoviruses: pseudovirus neutralization test (pVNT) or surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) have been developed. Binding assays, on the other hand, measure total antibodies or IgG, IgM, and IgA directed against one epitope of the SARS-CoV-2, independently of their neutralizing capacity. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of six commercial binding assays to the pVNT and sVNT. In this study, we used blood samples from a cohort of 62 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. Based on the results of the neutralizing assays, adapted cut-offs for the binding assays were calculated. The use of these adapted cut-offs does not permit to improve the accuracy of the serological assays and we did not find an adapted cut-off able to improve the capacity of these tests to detect NAbs. For a part of the population, a longitudinal follow-up with at least two samples for the same patient was performed. From day 14 to day 291, more than 75% of the samples were positive for NAbs (n = 87/110, 79.1%). Interestingly, 6 months post symptoms onset, the majority of the samples (N = 44/52, 84.6%) were still positive for NAbs. This is in sharp contrast with the results we obtained 6 months post-vaccination in our cohort of healthcare workers who have received the two-dose regimens of BNT162b2. In this cohort of vaccinated subjects, 43% (n = 25/58) of the participants no longer exhibit NAbs activity 180 days after the administration of the first dose of BNT162b2.",

Following infection or vaccination, numerous antibodies are produced targeting different epitopes of the virus or the spike protein. Nevertheless, not all these antibodies are able to efficiently neutralize the virus since they can bind an epitope which is not essential for the virus entry into the cell. Therefore, the detection of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is of particular importance because these are the antibodies that can prevent the binding of the RBD of the S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present at the surface of human cells, preventing the entry of the virus into the host cells [4] .",

They concluded that \"VIDAS IgG and Euroimmun QuantiVac IgG showed a better ability to detect NAbs\" with an area under the ROC curve of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93-0.98) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92-0.98), respectively. According to the authors, the Roche assays, i.e., targeting the nucleocapsid or the spike protein, were less able to detect neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) with AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81-0.92) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82-0.93), respectively. They also reported a significant decrease in NAbs in 16.9% (11/65 ) subjects at the 6 months follow-up. Using their data, 33.3% (21/63) of the subjects lost their positivity with the VIDAS IgG and 27.7% (18/65) with the Euroimmun QuantiVac IgG. Having these data in mind, it is difficult to definitely conclude that these tests showed a better ability to detect NAbs than the other tests evaluated in this study [5] . In addition, our group and others previously showed that the positivity threshold reported in the instructions for using the Roche Elecsys \u00ae anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike is not a threshold for correlating with neutralization [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . It was demonstrated that higher antibody titers are needed to correlate with seroneutralization although this is subject to the diversity of antibody response among individuals [7, 11] . This has also been observed in vaccinated subjects [6] .",

ROC curves were performed to define cut-off values with the best specificity and sensitivity for each serological test. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as the accuracy, were calculated for the cut-offs provided by the manufacturer as well as for the adapted cut-offs obtained with the ROC curves as determined by Youden's index. A simple linear regression and Pearson correlations were computed to assess the potential association between NAb and antibody titers. Inter-rater agreements were also determined.

It means that we needed to deal with a loss of sensitivity or specificity in order to increase to other parameters (i.e., specificity or sensitivity and accuracy). However, there was no real possibility to improve the capacity of these tests to detect NAbs by adapting the cut-offs (Tables 1 and 2 ). Table 1 . Summary table of the analytical sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the six serological assays investigated in this study and sVNT technique in comparison with the pVNT. Results obtained with the adapted cut-offs are presented in italics. It is also interesting to analyze in more detail the samples that showed discordant results between pVNT and serological assays ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ). In general, serological assays targeting total antibodies, i.e., Roche RBD, Roche NCP, and Ortho S1 total antibodies generated less false-negative results. This meant that also measuring both IgA and IgM permitted to better evaluate the neutralizing capacity of the serum than just targeting IgG. In general, the rate of false-negative was around 3% for assays targeting total antibodies while it was around 10% for assays specific towards IgG except for the Phadia S1 IgG, which showed a false negative's rate of 2.2%. Nevertheless, this is at the detriment of a higher false-positive rate, which may be up to 84.0% for the Roche NCP total antibody assay. On the other hand, assays specific for IgG do not show very good performance either since their false positive rate was around 50 to 80%. These results were also confirmed by the ROC curves analyses (Figure 2) . Therefore, binding immunoassays which showed the best agreement with NAbs as determined by a pVNT method are the Roche total RBD, Roche total NCP, and the Ortho S1 total antibodies. Nevertheless, all of these binding immunoassays demonstrated poor correlation with results obtained in pVNT ( Figure S1 ). These results are confirmed by the ROC curves analyses (Figure 2 ).
