Due to prolonged shedding of the virus or positivity of nucleic acid amplification tests, particularly in immunocompromised patients or those with severe disease, discontinuation of isolation induces concern for transmission within the healthcare facility, making these decisions nuanced and difficult. 1, 2 Studies evaluating the transmission risk throughout the duration of illness have assessed the growth of SARS-CoV-2 on culture compared with the cycle threshold (Ct) values on RT-PCR. Notably, viable virus is rarely cultured at Ct values >30 on or after 14 days of illness, suggesting that the probability of infectivity decreases with increasing Ct values and is primarily seen in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset. 3, 4 Thus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created recommendations for removal from isolation; however, their recommendations regarding immunocompromised persons and those with severe disease were ambiguous.",

This procedure resulted in prolonged hospitalizations for patients who continued to test positive. In June 2020, we implemented a time-based isolation policy allowing the discontinuation of isolation in hospitalized patients 21 days from their first positive test, with the caveat that patients who remained critically ill, lacked clinical improvement, or were severely immunocompromised should be discussed with the COVID ID physician (Fig. 1) . Data for patients with severe disease or immunosuppression are limited; thus, decisions to remove these patients from isolation while molecular assays continue to yield positive results are more nuanced. In July 2020, the CDC updated their guidance and recommended a similar strategy based on time from symptom onset. However, we decided to continue our protocol of utilizing the initial positive test as 'day 1' given that day of symptom onset is subjective in nature.",

Because of the limited study size and because Ct values were obtained from testing performed as part of patient care, data from multiple specimen types and assays were analyzed together. The precision of Ct values obtained from qualitative assays is unknown, and the quality of specimen collection likely provides an additional source of variability. Furthermore, not all patients received testing on or after day 21. Finally, we utilized 21 days from the first positive test rather than time from symptom onset based on our hospital protocol, making this a more conservative discontinuation of isolation strategy. However, only 1 patient had a Ct of <30 when symptom onset was used as day 1, so using symptom onset, although less conservative and more subjective, may also be an adequate strategy.",
