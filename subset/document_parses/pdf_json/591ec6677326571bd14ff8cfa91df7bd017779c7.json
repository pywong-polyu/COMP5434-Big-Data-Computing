Globally, there are over 50 million people living with dementia with an estimated 10 million new cases annually [1] . Similar to the rest of the world, rates of dementia are increasing in Ireland [2] . Approximately 180,000 people in Ireland are currently, or were previously, carers for a family member or partner with dementia [3] and there are many others unaccounted for who are providing care and support structures in informal ways. There is considerable regional variation in prevalence of dementia across Ireland with some of the highest proportions reported in the West of the country [4] , which has an estimated population of 453,109, most of whom are living in rural areas.",

Epidemiological studies have identified poor sleep as a risk factor for dementia and good quality sleep as having a role in maintaining brain health [6] . Sleep patterns change with ageing and multiple lifestyle factors and co-morbidities can contribute to poor sleep hygiene. Pharmacological interventions for sleep are associated with significant adverse effects, particularly in the older population, so trialling a non-pharmacological strategy to improve sleep habits and overall brain health is of interest. Digital cognitive behavioural therapies targeting habits have shown promise for cognitive performance [7] but have not been trialled beyond the individual level. Several large European clinical trials have investigated multicomponent lifestyle interventions for \"at risk\" populations with varying efficacy on cognitive outcomes [8] [9] [10] [11] , all of which targeted interventions at an individual level.",

            "text": "Overall, individual-level randomised trials of shortterm, single domain, lifestyle interventions have not demonstrated a large, meaningful effect. This is thought to be due to several factors, including short follow up periods and methodological limitations including unblinded assessments of outcomes. The Finnish intervention study to prevent cognitive decline and disability (FINGER) [11] randomised individuals to a multidomain intervention (including physical activity, dietary advice and cognitive training), and demonstrated improvement in global cognitive functioning at 2 years follow up, and from this trial the World-Wide FINGERS network has been established bringing together global trials with methodological features in common with the original FINGER study [17] . Beyond this, consideration should be given to household level interventions (where the unit of randomisation is the household rather than the individual) to determine if a greater, sustainable effect on cognition can be achieved. Social contact has been identified as a protective factor in delaying dementia, and engaging with family regularly plays a prominent role [5] . Household level interventions may confer benefit beyond the individual with cognitive impairment, with collateral benefits for all household members. With many family members providing informal care duties for the individual with cognitive impairment, they may be at risk of emotional and physical strain leading to adverse health outcomes, physical injury, change in immune response and lack of engagement with their own preventative health strategies [18, 19] . Apart from cognitive and physical health benefits for the participants, targeting a household may improve feasibility and long-term sustained change in lifestyle, by changing the culture within the home. Given the prevalence of dementia, any strategy shown to benefit overall brain health is of use, and if individuals feel they are taking control to prevent further cognitive deterioration this may be, in itself, of benefit [20] . All members of households affected by dementia may, therefore, benefit from targeted lifestyle interventions.",

Although the sample size appears small, and it was difficult to judge when thematic saturation was reached, detailed information was gathered, and similar concepts were repeated among households, suggesting appropriate thematic conclusions could be made in this small, in-depth, study.",

During each interview, one researcher took the lead as interviewer and the other acted as moderator and facilitated if any technical challenges arose for participants. The interview guide was developed via research group consensus. Questions were developed around pre-determined topics and specific follow up questions were used to explore themes and opinions that participants volunteered. The pre-determined questions were devised based on research group experience of discussions on lifestyle habits and interventions within the memory clinic, by both patients and their caregivers.

The assumption is often held that this population would have little access to, or support to engage in, digital interventions. In addition, further assumptions would include that this older, cognitively impaired population would have little interest in engaging in clinical trials of lifestyle interventions. The aim of this study was to assess if this was truly the case and to provide a clear evidence base of this population for a future clinical trial protocol. Within this study the interviews were carried out by clinical research fellows (MMC and CEMcC) and both needed to consider how their previous clinical experience and professional knowledge would impact on the interview process. This was taken into account while concluding findings from the data collected, by discussing as a group if the clinical background of the interviewers could have affected the direction of the interviews. To mitigate this bias, the semi-structured format was chosen to allow open discourse and participants (in particular those with cognitive impairment) to lead, allowing them to focus on perspectives on lifestyle habits of most importance to them. To ensure that a range of perspectives were obtained, the households included varied in sex, urban versus rural location and relationship to other household members. As a research group it was discussed if those recruited would be appropriately representative and subject to selection bias. To reduce this risk households were recruited prospectively from the clinic and the inclusion criteria remained broad.",

These lifestyle factors are similar in complexity in terms of measurement, intervention and optimal dose. There has been a great interest in diet as a modifiable risk factor for dementia. Until recently, there has been limited evidence to suggest any form of additional dietary supplements play a role in dementia prevention [25] [26] [27] [28] however the recently published LipiDiDiet clinical trial, randomising participants with prodromal Alzheimer's Disease to Fortasyn Connect (Souvenaid) or placebo, demonstrated promising improvements in cognition, functional outcomes and cerebral atrophy within the intervention group [29] . Beyond this, there is a shift to explore the role of whole dietary patterns. The World Health Organisation recommend the Mediterranean diet for delaying dementia, although the evidence remains limited, with small effect sizes on cognitive performance demonstrated [30] . It has been proposed that adhering to this diet may improve cognition through several biological mechanisms including reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, improving metabolic control and minimising incidence of diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and coronary heart disease [31] . A recent systematic review identified that adherence to such diets in mid-life has promise for neuroprotection in later life [32] . Buckinx et al. applied the GRADE approach (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to determine recommendations for the preferred diet to prevent or to treat cognitive impairment, and although diet was determined to have an important role, specific guidelines could not be determined from the evidence to date [33] . Further randomised controlled trials targeting diet of at-risk populations, with sufficient follow up periods, are necessary to truly determine impact on cognition.",

There are several factors to consider when investigating the effect of physical activity on long term cognition including stage of cognitive dysfunction, associated functional impairments, intensity of activity and type of exercise. Physical activity which improves cardiorespiratory fitness levels is thought to be potentially beneficial to delay cognitive decline among healthy older adults. This has been a challenging area for comparison given differences in cognitive testing used and there is uncertainty around which specific areas of cognitive function benefit the most (e.g. visuospatial skills, motor function, cognitive speed) [35] . The cognitive benefit of physical activity in older adults has been reviewed extensively [36] [37] [38] , but clear clinical consensus is difficult to determine as many trials are limited in size, have inappropriate control populations, have short follow-up periods and use cognitive measurement tools that may not reflect clinically meaningful change. In a systematic review of randomised clinical trials published in September 2021, Liu et al. determined that older adults gain benefit from physical activity interventions in terms of mobility and physical functioning but overall there was no clear evidence of improvement in cognitive functioning [39] . Further research is required, not only to determine type and duration of physical activity, but also if benefits vary by dementia type.",

There is a U-shaped association, with both sleep deprivation and excessive sleep associated with increased risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia [5] . The mechanism for this association remains unclear, as it is uncertain if extremes in sleep duration are a risk factor or an early consequence of cognitive impairment. Biologically, shorter sleep durations have been associated with neuronal pathway disruption and amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation [40] but there have been no similar causal mechanisms identified for longer sleep durations [41] . New onset disturbed sleep in older age may be a very early feature of a dementia process and therefore may be a suitable time-point to intervene. Given the harm, including increased risk of falls and hospitalisations associated with hypnotics and benzodiazepines often prescribed for sleep disturbance, greater emphasis should be placed on sleep hygiene practices and behavioural interventions. The mechanisms behind the association of sleep and poor cognition are complex and multifactorial. There are several proposed hypotheses. First, insomnia, a common condition among older adults, can cause short term and long term cognitive disruption through immediate impairment of several cognitive domains and having limited important periods of sleep to embed procedural memories [42] . Second, the presence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) leads to fragmented, poor quality sleep, chronic intermittent hypoxia and neuroinflammation which may be contributing factors in the neurodegenerative process underpinning many dementias [43] . Finally, sleep duration is a target to be considered, with Wu et al. demonstrating the lowest incidence of cognitive disorders among individuals sleeping 7-8 h a night compared to those reporting shorter or longer durations of sleep [44] . Given the bidirectional relationship that exists between sleep and cognition, well designed clinical trials are needed to guide management of disordered sleep in order to prevent further decline among those with cognitive impairment.",

First, three households commented that it was very challenging to motivate the person with cognitive impairment to exercise. Interestingly, on further exploration, these individuals were very physically active when younger, involved regularly in team sports and took organisational roles within clubs. It has been previously reported that persons with dementia are more likely to abandon recreational and physical activities spaces [49] . Participation in physical activity, particularly group based activities has been shown to be of benefit for cognition [50, 51] but based on our interviews, physical activity interventions need to account for difficulties with focus and attention and not deviate greatly from routine. Many households also expressed that physical injury and risk of falls would be a concern with this type of intervention. Future trials should ensure that physical activity goals are easily incorporated into daily routine, with regular reminders that are achievable for all household members. The incentive for physical activity for most of our interviewees was stress relief and change of environment. Previous individual level trials of physical activity in older persons demonstrated that a targeted custom physical activity intervention was effective in reducing major mobility disability [52] and therefore it is worth investigating if there is benefit for those with cognitive impairment and their households to offset significant functional decline.",

Very few described challenges with internet access or sensory issues which would adversely impact engagement with online applications. For one individual, this study was the first time he had participated and engaged in a videobased call and found it very user friendly. He stated it had increased his confidence in participating in a future trial incorporating digital technology. Another household promoted the use of virtual trial visits as they were based rurally and attending in person would be time consuming and stressful. Involving patients with dementia in designing and adapting of online interventions is crucial to ensure engagement and acceptability [53] . Given the recent surge in information communication technology, piloting new applications is essential, however, our interviews suggested that many participants were already empowered to use technology, frequently using messaging services and video calling to maintain communication among family members outside of the home. Most had greatest comfort with smartphones and tablets and noted little need for computer or laptop-based activity which should be considered when choosing a digital application host.",

Most concern around participation was due to uncertainty about how and when to incorporate changes. Many felt that reminders or messages about small adaptations on a regular basis would be achievable rather than a single educational seminar at the beginning of the trial. There was a sense among participants that personalising the interventions would allow change to be sustainable and that would allow for better support within households. The use of smart technology to encourage health behaviour change has not been found to be superior to traditional methods following acute myocardial infarction and stroke [54, 55] , however, our findings suggest it may have a beneficial role for the cognitively impaired population and their households in allowing a trial intervention to be more feasible.",

Families shape health at an individual level by not only influencing wellbeing at a genetic level, but at an environmental level [56, 57] , with members often demonstrating shared behaviours including diet, physical activity and smoking. Despite this, there have been limited studies with households and families as the target unit of randomisation, with most household-level trials in the literature focusing on investigating behavioural change environments for children [12, 58, 59] . By intervening at household level, it is hypothesised that lifestyle adaptations will be better sustained by changing the overall routine and habitual patterns of families. Although adults influence health behaviours of children, there is uncertainty if this would be reflected in other household types, in particular those who are older and may no longer have children living with them.",

A household is traditionally defined as several persons who live in the same dwelling. Consideration should be given to the inclusion of groups of individuals who share the same meals, grocery provision and have physical contact on a consistent and regular basis, most likely living in very close proximity as meeting the definition of a household. Recruitment in certain countries or rural environments may be limited by only including the traditional definition of a household.
