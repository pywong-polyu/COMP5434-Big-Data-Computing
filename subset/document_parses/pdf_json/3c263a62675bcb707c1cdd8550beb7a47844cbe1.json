As a result, this disease is classified as a global threat to our health [14] which affects human life and countries' economy. The most common symptoms of this virus in almost all cases are fever and dry cough, while in certain cases, some other symptoms have been appeared such as sore headache, throat, shortness of the breath, fatigue, and joint/muscle pain. Various reports on COVID-19 cases indicate that many cases of infected people turned out to be infectious cases without any noticeable common symptoms. These reports also indicate that without any interventions, the doubling period of this pandemic is nearly one week [21, 29] . For a regular analysis of this pandemic's situation, countries have planned some essential measures at various stages to be adopted [22] . Due to the unavailability of accurate medical treatments for corona virus, some limited preventions have been adopted by most governments such as the complete isolation of infectious peoples, social distancing, and quarantining people with high potentiality to be infected [35] in order to reduce the spread of this infectious disease globally. Many research works strongly indicate that lockdown procedures and other social distancing methods are effective to reduce the expansion of various respiratory viral diseases [18, 37] . The quarantine strategy has been adapted by countries involving full lockdowns and other social distancing strategies. The uncontrolled cases of infected corona virus cases move towards acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe pneumonia, and mortality. Commonly, the expansion of COVID-19 is found within a large extent among the close contacts of people within approximately 2 m. In most cases, the average incubation time which is the time between infection's exposure and first symptoms' appearance, is approximately 1-14 days.",

Since then there are many ups and downs that have been seen in the trajectories of corona virus cases in India. Initially, certain cases were recorded in students coming from Wuhan. New additional cases were recorded in India in March 2020 as a result of contact with COVID-19 reported cases [2]. The Indian government has applied certain measures to slow down COVID-19 spread. A deep analysis of average cases of corona virus among the affected countries shows that the trajectories of corona positive cases in India are steeper than most countries in Asia. A full country lockdown for twenty-one days was announced by the Indian government on March 24, 2020. Later on, this lockdown was extended to May 03, 2020. This lockdown has reduced the COVID-19 cases to some extent. Based on the total infected cases, the Indian government has decided to divide the area of cases into three zones such as red zone, orange zone, and green zone. In this work, authors have studied the effect of this virus at its initial stages including various parameters. This study depicts the starting nature and behavior of COVID-19 spreading characteristics under the influence of quarantined parameters.",

The mathematical modeling of the biological processes has become a very important tool. Life scientists with a strong backgrounds in applied mathematical techniques have modeled many biological phenomena. Formulated biological models with the help of mathematical modeling via classical integer derivatives have certain limitations and most likely fail to correctly interpret biological phenomena. For efficient biological models, fractional models have been studied [17, 25] . Due to the important property of memory impact of fractional differential operators, the fractional calculus is an effective tool to provide the mathematical demonstration of nature-related truths, natural processes, and processes involving non-local dynamics behaviors. Researchers have developed new efficient models via fractional calculus [3, 6, 7, 12, 26, 27] .",

The basic parameters in the transmission of novel corona virus are the average quarantine time, average latent time, and contact rate, these parameters are very significant in modeling COVID-19 pandemic. This model calculates the number of infectious cases, latently infected cases. In this work, we formulate the COVID-19 dynamics in a human society using a systemic way via Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative. This model explains the transmission rate of disease, disease's impact on the susceptible cases', exposed cases', and infectious cases' rates with various parameters including contact rate and average latent time. In this formulation, the important interventions of the government to minimize the corona virus spread is also incorporated as a parameter. Our proposed model's simulations are examined, and the model's sensitive analysis are investigated to conclude with efficient model outcomes. This fractional mathematical model of COVID-19 is useful in many clinical trials, evaluations, and control and preventive programs within limited specified resources. The Genocchi fractional operational matrix of Caputo-Fabrizio derivative is used for the numerical analysis and simulations of the formulated mathematical model. Authors have used the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative during the mathematical formulation of COVID-19 containing parameters like susceptible, exposed parameter, and infectious. Earlier, many authors used classical derivatives including Caputo fractional derivatives to study these kinds of epidemiological models. The modeling of various physical models and complex phenomena under Caputo-Fabrizio derivative is more efficient than classical derivatives such as Caputo fractional derivatives [8] . Many researchers have used Finite difference method, Runge-Kutta fourth order method, Hermite Wavelet Technique, and multilevel gradient methods [16, 34, 38] . In addition, a recent study proposed a novel stochastic modeling of COVID-19 under the environmental white noise [15] .",

This mathematical model includes susceptible parameter, exposed parameter, infectious parameter, recovered parameter, and mortality parameter with a quarantined parameter. The effect of the quarantined parameter is very significant as it could reduce the number of infected people. Here, the effect of transmission rate on exposed cases is also very significant as exposed cases increase with the transmission rate. In this work, a behavior-changed parameter is also included which strives to minimize the COVID-19 transmission rate using social distancing and other prevention measures in India. The governments strategies bring lockdowns in effect to prevent every avoidable death and expansion of virus, but it may cause some unequal impacts on society. Assume that N(t), S(t), S F (t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), D(t), and R(t) represent the total India population in current time, total number of susceptible cases at time t, behaviorchanged susceptible cases, total number of exposed cases at time t such that the total number of infected cases in which they have not indicated yet to be infectious, total number of infectious cases which is not quarantined, total number of the quarantined cases, death cases, and recovered cases, respectively. Thus, N(t) = S(t) + S F (t) + E(t) + I(t) + Q (t) + D(t) + R(t) at time t in India.

The number of cases of susceptible peoples had been shifted towards the behavior-changed susceptible class as the total number of corona positive cases increased. This occurs as the society strives for prevention and increasing their immune system by adopting socialdistancing or using masks. The term \u03b2 F (1 \u2212 e \u2212 \u03c4Q )S in the above diagram denotes this transmission. Both cases: Behavior-changed susceptible cases and susceptible cases join the class of exposed people through a contact with infected persons, and \u03b2S(t)I(t) represents the number of susceptible people who have been infected (but not infectious yet) through a contact with infected people. Here, we also assume that the rate of transmission among behavior-changed cases is less because of their fear/awareness with a transmission reduction ratio \u03b4 which is denoted by \u03b4\u03b2S F (t)I(t). After an average incubation time, the exposed cases E(t) move to infectious class I(t) with a progression rate k, and this term is given by kE(t). Once the symptoms have been seen, it is assumed that some people get hospitalized or quarantined, some persons die and some cases recover. The transmission of these cases are denoted by \u03b1I(t), \u03c3I(t) and \u03c9I(t), respectively.

As we increase the value of transmission rate of COVID-19 disease, the exposed cases and infectious cases are increased to a large extent as shown in Figs. 4-5. In our daily life, the real behavior of transmission rate can be easily seen, as we gather, avoid precautions, or break lockdowns, the transmission rate increases, and hence, the infected and exposed cases will also be increased very rapidly. The quarantined cases' graph is represented in Fig. 6 for the alternative system. The data fitting curve for infected cases, recovered cases, and death cases vs. the numerical results obtained from the formulated mathematical model are shown in Figs. 7-9.",
