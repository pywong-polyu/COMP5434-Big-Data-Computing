The donor had no clinical history or findings suggestive of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and tested negative by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab obtained within 48 h of procurement. Lower respiratory tract testing was not performed. The recipient developed fever, hypotension, and pulmonary infiltrates on posttransplant day (PTD) 3, and RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 on an NP swab specimen was non-reactive, but positive on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. One thoracic surgeon present during the transplantation procedure developed COVID-19. Sequence analysis of isolates from donor BAL fluid (obtained at procurement), the recipient, and the infected thoracic surgeon proved donor origin of recipient and health-care worker (HCW) infection. No other organs were procured from this donor. Transplant centers and organ procurement organizations should perform SARS-CoV-2 testing of lower respiratory tract specimens from potential lung donors, and consider enhanced personal protective equipment for HCWs involved in lung procurement and transplantation.

Her initial immunosuppression included methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg every 12 h for six doses followed by a taper, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil without any induction immunosuppression. A persistently low cardiac index was noted on posttransplant day (PTD) 2, and a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed acute right ventricular dysfunction. On PTD 3, the patient developed worsening fever, hypotension, and ventilator requirements. CT imaging of the chest showed multifocal consolidations. Due to the sudden worsening in respiratory status and evolving lung infiltrates, a bronchoscopy was performed and BAL samples were collected from both lungs. HCWs present during the bronchoscopy all wore full PPE. Quantitative culture and Gram stain of the BAL fluid revealed a few polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no significant bacterial growth.",

            "text": "no other organs were donated in this case and thus this report provides no information on the risk of transmission to non-lung recipients. Of note, transmission of respiratory viruses (including H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza) has been almost exclusively detected in lung recipients. 1 A recent case series of suspected transmissions based on early posttransplant diagnosis of COVID-19 revealed no proven donor origin of infection, but high mortality for early posttransplant COVID-19. 11 While one base pair difference was noted in the transplant surgeon, an alternative source of infection is highly unlikely, given that the lineage associated with the donor, recipient, and surgeon sequences is quite distinct from other viral sequences circulating in our community at that time. While it is impossible to completely rule out alternate infection sources based on genome sequencing, transmission can lead to fixation of new viral mutations, consistent with the additional polymorphism in the surgeon. This report does raise questions regarding the appropriate SARS-CoV-2 screening for potential donors. While Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policies do not require SARS-CoV-2 donor testing, optional fields were added to DonorNet to indicate test results. 12 The American Society of Transplantation recommends a combination of clinical and laboratory donor screening. Laboratory testing for non-lung donors should include at least one sample from the respiratory tract, and consideration for a second sample obtained within 24-48 h of procurement. For thoracic organ donors, SARS-CoV-2 testing of the lower respiratory tract is recommended by both AST and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), if safe and feasible. 13,14 In the reported case, clinical and laboratory screening was not suggestive of infection with SARS-CoV-2, as family reported no suggestive symptoms and pulmonary imaging showed non-specific findings consistent with atelectasis combined with pulmonary contusion (consistent with her motor vehicle accident), and laboratory screening with RT-PCR performed on an NP swab within 48 h of procurement was negative. While testing of BAL fluid for SARS-CoV-2 would have diagnosed donor infection in this case, very limited data exist on the incremental sensitivity obtained by SARS-CoV-2 testing on BAL fluid or other lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens as compared to NP swabs. Case reports do, however, describe patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 testing in NP swabs but positive tests on BAL specimens and testing on BAL fluid may remain positive after testing on upper respiratory specimens becomes negative. 15-17 Barriers to testing BAL specimens on potential lung donors include lack of validation of testing of LRT specimens-although some assays do have FDA emergency use authorization on BAL specimens 18 -as well as possible difficulty obtaining the LRT specimens in a timely fashion resulting in delays in procurement. Since both the donor and recipient had negative SARS-CoV-2 pre-procedure testing, by institutional protocol, HCWs were not required to wear N95 masks and eye protection. During the double lung transplant procedure, HCWs are exposed to material expelled from the donor lung and one HCW was proven to be infected, likely during the transplant. Thus, transplant centers should consider the possible benefit of N95 masks and eye wear protection during lung transplantation even with negative donor F I G U R E 1 Phylogenetic analysis of the six sequences associated with this case laboratory screening of the donor complicated by secondary transmission to a HCW. While barriers to implementation do exist, OPOs and transplant centers-particularly in areas of high SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community-should perform SARS-CoV-2 testing of LRT specimens on potential lung transplant donors.",
