Participants reported confidentiality, amount of financial compensation, and time required as primary influential factors for research participation. Primary motivations for participation include financial compensation, free HIV/HCV testing, and contribution to research. Changed or false participant contact information and transportation are principal barriers to retention. Respondents who prefer methamphetamines over heroin reported being influenced by the purpose and use of their information (PR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.26). Females and Oregonians (versus Appalachians) reported knowing and wanting to help the research team as participation motivation (PR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.26 and PR = 2.12; 95% CI: 1.51, 2.99). Conclusions: Beyond financial compensation, researchers should emphasize confidentiality, offer testing and linkage with care, use several contact methods, aid transportation, and accommodate demographic differences to improve research participation and retention among rural PWUD.",

In 2019, one in five Americans used an illicit drug and 70,630 drug overdose deaths occurred in the U.S, of which 71% were opioid-related [1, 2] . Further exacerbating the substance use epidemic is the prediction of the opioid epidemic's \"4th wave\" or the rise in methamphetamine use among people with opioid use disorders [3] [4] [5] [6] . People who use drugs (PWUD) such as opioids and methamphetamines face rising rates of HCV, HIV, and other chronic health conditions [7] [8] [9] . When rural PWUD attempt to access treatment for these health conditions, they face transportation barriers, stigma from healthcare providers, and a shortage of providers who offer care for substance use disorders (SUD) and their associated harms (e.g., HCV and HIV) [8, [10] [11] [12] .",

PWUD in rural communities may benefit from participation in research through otherwise unavailable access to SUD knowledge, specialists, and medical facilities, the receipt of new and effective treatments and medical care, and supported linkage to community SUD resources and programs [18, 19] . Although research studies such as clinical trials may provide valuable care and treatment to rural PWUD, retention and recruitment remains challenging [15, 20, 21] .

There is mixed evidence for the presence of individual level differences in research enrollment and retention between genders. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) did not identify proportional differences in enrollment and retention between genders, and willingness to participate in an HCV vaccine trial among PWUD did not differ by gender [24] [25] [26] . However, other studies suggest that women are underrepresented in HCV and HIV clinical research [27] , and gender differences in utilization of harm reduction services exist among rural PWUD [28] . Further, there is some evidence to indicate that considerations for participating in research studies differ by gender [29, 30] . An individual's drug preference for methamphetamine over heroin may also impact trust in research due to adverse effects such as elevated paranoia and suspiciousness associated with methamphetamine use [31] . Patient-provider relationship factors such as stigmatizing attitudes unique to certain drugs [32] [33] [34] could result in variations in the perceived judgment by staff as a factor affecting participation in research studies, including studies irrelevant to substance use.",

We obtained informed consent from all participants and provided each participant with $20 cash or a gift card as reimbursement for survey participation. The survey was interviewer-administered in Kentucky and Oregon and self-administered in Ohio. In Ohio, trained study staff followed an IRB-approved script to recruit and verbally determine participant eligibility as persons departed a local, weekly syringe service program. In Kentucky, individuals who had participated in a previous study on drug use in the study region and who had consented to be contacted about future research opportunities were contacted by the study staff and invited to participate using an IRBapproved recruitment script. To those who were interested in participating, staff verbally administered each question from the eligibility screening survey and recorded their responses in the survey instrument. In some cases, individuals who were screened and/or enrolled informally told their peers about the study who then called to express interest in participating and were screened. In Oregon, potential participants were recruited from syringe service programs through flyers and staff and peer referrals. Survey instruments were administered and responses electronically recorded by research staff, as in Kentucky. We used self-administration survey methods in Ohio to ensure confidentiality of participant responses as data collection occurred in a shared room of a local syringe service program. In Kentucky and Ohio, we collected data using Qualtrics software, Version June 2019 (Qualtrics, Provo, UT).

Specifically, we conducted comparisons by gender given mixed findings from previous research on the association between gender and reasons for research participation [29, 30] . Analyses by geographic location and type of drug use address gaps in the literature on how these factors may impact research participation. The latter is especially important given the evolving drug epidemic in rural areas from one that is predominated by opioids to one of polysubstance use involving methamphetamine [48] . We assessed differences in the dependent variable by the independent variables of gender (male, female), region (Appalachia, Oregon), and preferred drug of choice (heroin, methamphetamine). We combined Kentucky and Ohio into a single \"Appalachia\" group for several conceptual and statistical reasons: the stratified prevalence ratios of Kentucky and Ohio were similar when compared to Oregon, the Kentucky and Ohio research sites are geographically close, and both are in the Appalachian region. Of the preferred choice of drug options included in our survey, we compared heroin and methamphetamine as most participants selected one or the other as their ideal drug of choice. To ensure that \"preferred drug of choice\" reflected actual use, we verified that most participants had access to their preferred drug of choice by generating cross tabulations with their preferred drug of choice and reported substance use in the past 30 days.",

The primary influencing factor and motivator for rural PWUD to participate in research is the amount and presence of financial compensation. Economic and social factors of the risk environment framework are determinants of substance use [54] and promote a disproportionate burden of substance use among people living below the federal poverty threshold [1] . A lack of assistance programs in areas where rural PWUD reside further exacerbate the economic needs of this population [55, 56] . The weight of financial compensation in our findings is consistent with studies of rural Kentucky PWUD populations and others that note receipt of financial compensation as positively associated with research participation and retention [24, 57, 58] . Lower economic status is also associated with poorer study retention; once enrolled in a longitudinal research study, PWUD who live below the federal poverty line are more likely to be lost to follow-up [59] . While financial compensation can be used to offset economic needs of participants and costs to participate such as travel and childcare, additional research is required to ascertain appropriate levels of financial compensation that do not coerce study participation among PWUD [60] .",

In the U.S., cost or lack of reimbursement by insurance companies and uncertainty about where to receive HIV care are reported as the primary barriers to HIV testing [61] .

This finding may be related to the design of Oregon's concurrent study (i.e., the Oregon HIV/HCV and Opioid Prevention and Engagement, or OR-HOPE) which employs peer recovery support specialists as study staff members [62] . While we found that most factors among rural PWUD did not differ between males and females, aligning with the findings of an analysis of 24 NIDA CTN trials [26] , we found a notable difference in the importance of privacy between genders. Females reported an increased likelihood of indicating if their information would be kept confidential and whether they can skip questions that make them uncomfortable as important for participation. Female PWUD participants might be more concerned with privacy due to concerns of their reputation [30] or losing custody of their children if their drug use became publicly known [55] or due to anticipated distress around certain topics related to past trauma. Studies that recruit primarily rural, female PWUD should highlight confidentiality protections when obtaining informed consent and reiterate these protections throughout surveys, questionnaires, and other data collection items to encourage participation and improve comfort. In accordance with standards for best practice in research with vulnerable populations [63, 64] , behavioral research studies can further support female rural PWUD by providing the opportunity to opt out of questions that make them uncomfortable.",

            "text": "Participants who reported methamphetamine as their drug of choice to get high, as compared to those who selected heroin, had a higher prevalence of considering factors central to privacy and confidentiality. While not all of these factors met the threshold for statistical significance (\u03b1 = 0.05), the positive measure of association speaks to a theme of distrust and privacy concerns present among those who prefer methamphetamine use. These findings align with a community-based study in Vancouver, Canada, that found those who use methamphetamine reported greater suspiciousness and paranoia compared to those who use opioids [31] . Methamphetamine-associated paranoia may magnify the general distrust of healthcare systems where PWUD frequently experience stigma [66, 67] and may exacerbate skepticism about the transparency of research which is already elevated among rural The level of response for each survey item was dichotomized into \"selected\" or \"not selected\" to generate prevalence ratios c Cell sizes for \"not selected\" were < 10; analysis not performed * Significant at \u03b1 = 0.05 level residents [68] . Research enrolling people who use methamphetamines in rural communities should tailor recruitment and retention strategies to emphasize confidentiality and privacy. Our findings should be interpreted in light of several potential limitations. First, though our sample was drawn from U.S. rural communities in three states, findings may not be generalizable to rural communities outside of Appalachia and southwestern Oregon and may not be representative of all PWUD in the study communities due to our use of convenience sampling for data collection. Demographic characteristics of our sample align with those of previous studies of rural PWUD in the regions included in our study (i.e., mostly male, white, low education level, and age between 25 and 45 years [28, [69] [70] [71] [72] ); however, because county-level demographic information for PWUD in the study areas are not publicly available, we cannot fully assess the generalizability of our findings to rural PWUD in these locations. Second, the numerous response options provide crucial descriptive information on improving clinical trial recruitment and retention in rural areas but are likely correlated. Future work with large population-based samples will be needed for testing multiple hypotheses of multilevel factors. Still, our study found differences in factors for participation and retention between geographic locations and types of preferred drug use. The cross-sectional design of our study is a limitation in regard to capturing the challenges of enrollment and retention over time. We recommend that future longitudinal clinical research studies explore enrolled participants' influencing factors and motivations for participation. Study staff should collect data on the reasons rural PWUD participants miss follow-up appointments among participants who are not lost to follow-up. Another limitation is the difference in administration methods between the three sites. The selfadministered survey among Ohio respondents likely contributed to a lower selection of survey item responses. We believe the lower selection of responses biased the prevalence ratio comparisons between Oregon and Appalachia participants up and away from the null prevalence ratio value (i.e., 1.0). However, previous studies have demonstrated no difference in responses between interviewerand self-administered surveys [73, 74] . Based on our results, further research is needed to determine if a difference in modes of survey administration is present among PWUD populations. A further limitation is that our results may differ by recency and duration of drug use; however, the need to reduce respondent burden precluded our ability to examine these variables of interest. Finally, participants were recruited in locations where epidemiological studies had already been recruiting rural PWUD; nearly two thirds of participants (64% overall, ranging from 42% in Ohio to 75% in Kentucky) reported previously participating in a research study. Therefore, our results may not adequately capture the perspectives of rural PWUD less familiar with or interested in research, which may differ. However, because our participants are more familiar with research, the reported factors may have been less hypothetical than with research na\u00efve or adverse PWUD.",
