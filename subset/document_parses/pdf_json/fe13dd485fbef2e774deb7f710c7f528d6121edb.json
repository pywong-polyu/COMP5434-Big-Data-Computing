While POC-LUS is highly efficient, it requires expertise, and when wrongfully interpreted may badly influence the treating physician's decision-making. Due to the logistic and medical equipment limitations in quarantined zones in which COVID-19 patients are treated, the importance of POC-LUS increased [2] . We aimed to assess the reliability of a newly designed POC-LUS machine-integrated tool for automatic-real-time bedside quantification of B-lines among critical COVID-19 patients.",

An example of automatic-POC-LUS assessment across the spectrum of SARS-CoV2-ARDS severity is illustrated in Fig. 1 .

When divided into \"dry\" (\u2264 3 In conclusion, we found that the machine-integrated Venue TM -auto-B-lines tool is highly reliable among severe COVID-19 ICU patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to validate a machine-integrated automatic-B-lines quantification tool with high reliability among COVID-19 patients. The small number of patients included in this feasibility trial should be acknowledged as a limitation; thus, further research to validate the results of this study is warranted. Previously, a non-integrated automatic B-lines detection application has shown good overall reliability while also stressing the difference in assessment reliability dependent on the operator experience [5] . The current study's results may help better interpret POC-LUS assessments performed by less-experienced operators and reduce interoperator variability. This tool may provide technological infrastructure for future telemedicine, even in non-experienced hands or for self-assessment by patients. The Venue TM -auto-B-lines tool may reduce the medical staff 's exposure time and promote more accurate and standardized LUS assessment methods. ",
