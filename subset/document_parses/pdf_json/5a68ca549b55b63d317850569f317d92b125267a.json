[6] [7] [8] [9] It is well known that systematic reviews with meta-analysis can provide the best levels of evidence, 10 being an important tool to define health care strategies and resource allocation planning. Previous papers 1, 2 have warned about the risk of low quality and duplication of ongoing research that could result in \"massive waste in research.\" 1 Still, in this sense, the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 11 emphasizes that a systematic review protocol should be developed and registered in specific databases before its start, to avoid reporting bias or the change of the previously planned study design. However, a study by Tricco et al 12 observed that a third of systematic reviews changed or did not specify their primary outcome on the register and that only 18% of published systematic reviews have previously been registered.",

Finally, we assessed only the first version of each PROSPERO record, and it is possible that such records were or will be modified. The assessment of only the first version of the record aimed to standardize the records and to evaluate the first body of the planned methods of these reviews.",

Thus it should be carefully and adequately planned, registered, and made freely accessible to the scientific community as a reflection of good research practice. 18, 19 Also, it is important to highlight that guidelines such as PRISMA-P are available and are strongly recommended to enable quality reports of systematic review protocols creation. 20 In conclusion, a massive number of SRs about COVID-19 have been conducted, whose PROSPERO records present varied characteristics.",

Duplication can also create confusion when SRs addressing the same research question reach conflicting findings. 14 It is important to bear in mind that some duplicated reviews can be explained by the fact that there is a gap between the submission of a record and its publication. This gap could take around 30 days, as it is currently stated on the PROSPERO website. Also, due to high traffic and increased number of registers, some of the records can be pub-lished without being checked by the PROSPERO staff if the gap from submission to publishing exceeds 30 days.In our analysis, China was the country that had registered the most significant number of records. It is clear that many researchers from different regions around the world desire to contribute toward addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and that such attempt could lead to duplication of SRs being conducted. However, that focus would be better expended on creating strategies of collaboration among differ-",

It is important to emphasize, though, that the uncontrolled duplication of SRs at the same time is not categorized as replication, and the present study identified what seems to be more likely an epidemic of redundant reviews on COVID-19.13 Based on our results, there is evidence that most of the SR records in PROSPERO about COVID-19 are impossible to be replicated because some information, such as full search strategy and details about outcomes, were poorly reported.A few limitations of our analyses should be mentioned. First, although GRADE is not a risk of bias tool, many authors cited the use of such tool in their PROSPERO records and, therefore, we have opted to include it in the table about the risk of bias tool used; however, it must be emphasized that those records that reported the use of GRADE misused such tool. The results should be interpreted with caution since we performed a cross-sectional analysis, and during the year 2020, more and more records are being created on PROSPERO about",
