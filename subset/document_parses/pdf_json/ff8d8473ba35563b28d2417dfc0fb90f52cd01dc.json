By May 2020, the pandemic had caused great loss of lives and disrupted the way of lives in more ways than one. The nature of the disease saw several strategies to curb its spread rolled out. These strategies included closing of businesses and borders, restriction of movements and working from home, mask mandate among others. With these measures and the effects, many individuals have taken to the social media to express their frustrations, opinions and how the pandemic is affecting them. This study employs dictionary based method for sentiment polarization from tweets related to coronavirus posted on Twitter. We also examine the co-occurrence of words to gain insights on the aspects affecting the masses. The results showed that mental health issues, lack of supplies were some of the direct effects of the pandemic. It was also clear that the COVID-19 prevention guidelines were well understood by those who tweeted. The results from this study may help governments combat the consequences of COVID-19 like mental health issues, lack of supplies e.g. food and also gauge the effectiveness or the reach of their guidelines.",

Governments would want to know how their policies, interventions etc. are received or perceived by the masses, politicians would want to know if they have a favorable rating, and how their policies are received and implemented while businesses would want to understand the reputation of their brands. Social media presents a great promise for achieving this by analyzing social media posts, product reviews, customer feedback etc. The advent of social media has made available a platform where individuals can freely express their opinions, feelings or judgments.

Several studies have used varied approaches and datasets to try and explain the COVID-19 dynamics. Kumar [7] employed cluster analysis in monitoring COVID-19 infections in India. The approach identified areas/clusters that needed more medical facilities (ventilators, testing kits, masks etc.) and those that needed optimization of monitoring techniques (screening, lockdowns, closedowns, curfews etc.). Khakharia et al. [8] used machine learning techniques to predict the outbreak of COVID-19 for 10 densely populated countries. In particular, they compared the performance of 9 machine learning models in predicting the outbreak. The highest prediction accuracy was achieved for Ethiopia using the Autoregressive Moving Average Model. Social contact based analysis has also been employed to study the underlying disease transmission patterns. Liu et al. [9] using this approach showed that the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities were dispersedly distributed explaining why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. Other data mining techniques that can be employed to study the dynamics of COVID-19 are available in [10, 11] Sentiment analysis or opinion mining can be defined as the process of identifying and extracting the subjective information that underlies a text [12] . This information can either be an opinion, a feeling about a particular topic or subject matter or a judgment. Sentiment analysis is becoming a field of interest that cannot be ignored. Nguyen et al. [13] employed sentiment analysis on social media to predict stock movement. Their method of incorporating social media data achieved 2.07% better performance than the model using historical prices only. Vincenza et al. demonstrated that Twitter data and sentiment analysis can be used to study disease dynamics [14] . Twitter is a micro blogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as tweets [15] . Twitter's 321 million active users provide a rich source of data from the tweets they post. In this study we seek to mine opinions and sentiments on the COVID-19 pandemic from Twitter users.",

Sentence level sentiment analysis classifies sentiment expressed in each sentence [18] . Sentiment classification techniques can be divided into machine learning approach, lexicon based approach and a hybrid approach that combines machine learning and lexicon approaches [19] . Machine learning approach relies on the machine learning algorithms like the na\u00efve Bayes, support vector machines, neural networks among others together with linguistic features. In lexicon based approach, a collection of known and precompiled sentiment terms known as sentiment lexicon is used. This approach can be divided into dictionary based approach and corpus based approach which employs statistical or semantic methods to find sentiment polarity [18] .",

The polarized cluster of words c i jl is pulled from around the polarized word pw and defaults to 4 words before and two words after pw to be considered as valance shifters. The cluster is represented asc i jl = pw i j \u2212 nb, . . . , pw i j , . . . , pw i j \u2212 na. Here nbandna are parameters n-before and n-after set by the user. The words c i jl are labeled neutralw 0 i j , negatorw n i j , amplifier/intensifier w a i j or deamplifier of downtonerw d i j . Neutral words only contribute to the number of words in the equation. Each polarized word is then weighed by some function and the number of valence shifters surrounding the positive or negative word. Pause locations denoted by cw (i.e. punctuations that denote a pause including commas, colons and semicolons) are indexed and incorporated in calculating the upper and lower bounds in the polarized context cluster. The polarized word in the cluster is acted upon by the valence shifters. Amplifiers increase polarity by 1.8 (0.8 is the default weight) and they become de-amplifiers if the context cluster contains an odd number of negators (two negatives equal a positive and 3 negatives equal a negative). De-amplifiers decrease polarity. Adversative conjunctions (AC) (e.g. but, however, although) also weight the cluster. AC before a polarized word up-weights the cluster by 1 + z(n AC ) (with 0.85 being the default weight for z 2 andn B AC is the number of ACs before the polarized word. An AC after the polarized word down weights the cluster by1+{n A AC \u2212 1} * z 2 . The weights z may be provided by the use with the default being 0.8. Lastly, these weighted context clusters c i jl are summed and divided by the square root of the word count (W i jn ) yielding the polarity score \u03b4 i j for each tweet i.e. \u03b4 i j = c i j / W i jn For the co-occurrence of words the study used the udpipe package [21] . The study considered only 63,056 tweets that were written in English. Figure 4 shows the spatial location of all positive tweets.
