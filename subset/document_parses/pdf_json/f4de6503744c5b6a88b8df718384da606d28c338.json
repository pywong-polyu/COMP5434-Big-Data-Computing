Childhood and adolescence is a vulnerable period for the occurrence of anxiety symptoms, which widely range from mild temporary symptoms to an anxiety disorder that meets the full diagnostic criteria. According to a US nationwide survey conducted with 10123 adolescents aged 13-18 years, the prevalence of all types of anxiety disorder was 31.9%, making it the most common mental disorder in this population [3] . In another study, it was observed that anxiety disorder occurring in adolescence became chronic, persisting into adulthood or commonly cooccurring with other mental disorders, like depression [4] . In a longitudinal study with 1228 adolescents, 20% of those who met the full diagnostic criteria for any anxiety disorder (panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder) still met the criteria at the 19 months follow-up, and 42% of the adolescents who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder were still experiencing anxiety symptoms at the follow-up, following a chronic course [5] . The National Survey of Children's Health conducted in the US in 2016 reported that approximately 4.4 million children and adolescents aged 3-17 years (7.1% of this age group in the US) were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and that about one in three adolescents with anxiety disorder showed conduct problems (37.9%) and depression (32.3% ). In addition, drug and alcohol abuse or dependence were found to commonly co-occur with anxiety disorder [6] .",

Children can express fear and worry during the normal developmental process; thus, it can be difficult to differentiate this process from pathological anxiety. Children and adolescents may seem to seriously suffer from normal anxiety, but most of the time it is a transient phenomenon [7] . Accordingly, in children, the severity of distress due to anxiety is not an appropriate criterion with which to differentiate normal and pathological anxiety. Anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents may have different manifestations than those in adults. However, in the current diagnostic system, the same diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorder are used in adults as well as in children and adolescents, with the exception of separation anxiety disorder, and the clinical characteristics (e.g., duration, type of symptoms, frequency) unique to children and adolescents are mentioned only in a few anxiety disorders [1] . Because children and adolescents may have difficulties in communicating cognition, language, and emotions due to developmental differences, differences in cognitive development should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of and approach to anxiety. However, there are no such guidelines in the current diagnostic system. Moreover, anxiety disorders are the most untreated mental problem in adolescence and currently, only 18% of adolescents with any anxiety disorders are under treatment [8] .",

Health risk behaviors do not occur in isolation, but tend to co-occur with other risk behaviors. The two types of risk behavior are mutually predictive because they share similar risk factors [10] . The earlier the health risk behaviors occur, the more likely it is to lead to substance addiction, substance abuse, physical and mental health worsening, and occupational and educational underachievement during overall adolescence and adulthood [11] . Accordingly, many countries pay close attention to health risk behaviors as a key to public health policy. Generally, anxiety is known to be associated with decision-making to avoid risk. However, evidence has steadily accumulated that excessive anxiety is linked to smoking, drinking, substance abuse, unprotected sexual intercourse, gambling, and other unhealthy habits, and that health risk behavior may worsen as a means to control anxiety [12] .",

To evaluate our hypothesis, we first identified the sociodemographic characteristics of communitybased adolescents suffering from anxiety by classifying anxiety severity.

The raw data of the 16th wave survey were the first data to contain scores of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and were used in this study to evaluate anxiety levels. Students anonymously selfreported the survey with 103 items across 15 domains by connecting to the homepage in a group setting at school computer labs or by utilizing mobile devices under faculty supervision in classrooms if computer labs were unavailable due to coronavirus disease. It took 45-50 min to fill out the survey. A total of 57925 students were selected. Of those, 54948 (94.9%) participated in the survey.

In the 16th wave survey, items regarding the number of cars at home, whether the student had his/her own room, the number of overseas travels, the number of computers at home, the number of bathrooms at home, and whether the household had an air purifier were used in the family affluence scale. The scale was scored between 0 and 13 points. The area of residence was classified into rural area, small-to-medium city, and large city. With regards to academic achievement, students were asked about their grades in the last 12 months and were instructed to select one of the following answer choices: high, high-middle, middle, low-middle, and low. With regards to the history of violence victimization, the presence of a history was determined if students responded \"once or more\" to the question, \"In the last 12 months, have you been treated at the hospital due to violence from friends, senior students at school, or adults (physical attack, threat, bullying, etc.)?\"",

The scale consists of seven items in total, each scored between 0 and 3 points [14] . GAD-7 is widely used in primary healthcare institutions since it can effectively screen for generalized anxiety disorder in a short time, and it was found that severity assessment by GAD-7 has a high correlation with the severity of anxiety symptoms as assessed by clinicians. In a large-scale study conducted with 110000 children and adolescents in Finland, the internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 value) of GAD-7 was 0.91. The reliability and validity of the scale in assessing anxiety in this age population were confirmed by a previous study [15] . In Korea, Seo and Park [16] studied the reliability and validity of the Korean translation of GAD-7 in migraine patients. In their study, Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.915, and the sensitivity and specificity were 78.1% and 74.6%, respectively, which were very close to the levels reported in studies conducted outside of Korea. The internal consistency evaluated in Korean adolescents was an at acceptable level for a large-scale study. In this study, the Korean version of GAD-7 was used, which asked regarding the extent to which students how often have been bothered in their daily lives due to anxiety-related symptoms over the last 2 weeks [17] . In each of the items, students were instructed to check one of the following options: \"1) not at all; 2) several days; 3) more than half the days; 4) nearly everyday.\" Based on the total GAD-7 score, anxiety severity was classified as follows: normal if the total score was 0-4 points, mild anxiety if it was 5-9 points, moderate, 10-14 points, and severe, 15-21 [14] .",

All the variables presented p-value\uff1c0.05. \"Reference\" indicates the reference time for comparing the OR. CI, confidence interval; GAD-7, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale; OR, odds ratio tion of female adolescents increased as anxiety severity increased. Being a female is a risk factor for anxiety disorder, and the sex ratio of anxiety disorder in adolescence was reported to be 1:2 to 1:3 [18] . In this study, the sex ratio in the severe anxiety group was also approximately 1:2, a level similar to previous study findings. In most epidemiological studies, participants with a low educational attainment level had a higher anxiety level than those with higher educational attainment levels [18] . However, the temporal relationship between the educational attainment level and anxiety has not yet been clearly demonstrated. In this study, the proportion of adolescents who reported their grades to be low increased as the anxiety level increased, but the proportion of those who reported their grades to be high did not show a consistently increasing or decreasing trend with increasing anxiety severity. Academic achievement was assessed using a self-reported question, and the finding may have been limited by the lack of an objective assessment of academic achievement. In a previous study on the history of violence victimization, early experiences of loneliness and social anxiety were the predictors of violence victimization [19] . In this study, the proportion of adolescents with a history of violence victimization was high in the severe anxiety group. However, causal relationships, namely, whether a history of violence victimization was an early negative experience that influenced anxiety level or whether a high anxiety level had an impact on violence victimization, was not examined. The ORs for mental health scales increased more sharply with increasing anxiety level than did the ORs for health risk behaviors. In the severe anxiety group, loneliness showed the strongest association (OR: 32.08), followed by stress (OR: 26.39), suicidal ideation (OR: 24.53), suicide attempts (OR: 22.87), and depressive symptoms (OR: 17.61). This group was also associated with decreased subjective sleep satisfaction (OR: 0.28) and happiness (OR: 0.09). In particular, the experience of loneliness (OR: 32.08) had the strongest association with anxiety severity. The proportion of adolescents with an experience of loneliness was 4.8% in the normal anxiety group, whereas the corresponding number was 65.0% in the severe anxiety group. This finding is in line with the previous studies which demonstrated that loneliness and anxiety are strongly associated with each other [20] . Some studies reported that loneliness is a mediator of social anxiety and suicidal ideation [21] . In summary, these findings provide a basis for the need to assess loneliness in parallel when evaluating adolescents experiencing anxiety. A review of the literature on the relationship between anxiety and stress showed that there is a functional change in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system in children with anxiety disorder and that the change is similar to what happens due to long-term exposure to stress [22] . As a hypothesis regarding the cause of the functional change, an animal model, which showed that stress is involved in the expression of glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus, has been put forward [23] . Based on the study finding that the proportion of perceived stress in the severe anxiety group was very high (88.0%), it can be speculated that anxiety and stress may share a common factor.",

The increase in the ORs of depressive symptoms according to increasing levels of anxiety severity, that is, high levels of co-existence of anxiety and depression in childhood and adolescence, may be due to the presence of common biological factors [25] . On the other hand, the co-occurrence can also be explained by overlapping symptoms in the diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders. For example, the symptoms of fatigue, sleep disorder, and attention disorder, plus oversensitivity in the case of children and adolescents, are included in both diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder [25] .

In summarizing existing study findings, we concluded that it is difficult to determine an association between anxiety in adolescence and later alcohol use, but suggested that the lack of evidence may have been due to between-study differences with respect to the control of confounding variables and study design. So far, numerous observational studies have reported that anxiety is associated with drinking [31] , and that the association between the two is explained by one of the following hypotheses: 1) anxious persons drink to assuage physiological and emotional reactions, and 2) repeated drinking induces anxiety. Similarly, in this study, the ORs of current drinkers steadily increased as anxiety severity increased. In a nationwide epidemiological study conducted with 40000 adults aged 18-44 y in the US, anxiety disorder was associated with alcohol use and substance use disorders, with a stronger association with substance dependence (OR: 6.0) than with alcohol dependence (OR: 3.0) [32] . In this study, as anxiety severity increased, its associations with current drinkers and habitual substance use both tended to increase as well, but the study was limited in that drinking and substance use could not be compared with each other due to inconsistencies in the survey items.",

In this study, as anxiety lev-els increased, the ORs of sexual intercourse, unprotected intercourse, and other risk behaviors, such as smoking and drinking, increased at the same time.",

            "text": "The limitations of the study were as follows. First, the KYRBS has limitations as a self-report survey filled out by adolescents. The survey was performed online during class at school; thus, it may have been plausible that the behaviors that adolescents did not want to reveal (such as sexual behavior, smoking, drinking, violence victimization, and suicide) were underreported because respondents feared the consequences of disclosing their behavioral characteristics. As the information on academic achievement was obtained via the respondents' personal opinions, objectivity in the data could have been lacking. In the responses to items asking about experiences in the last 12 months, recall bias may have occurred. Second, this study was cross-sectional, and causal or temporal relationships between anxiety and other scales could not be clearly explained. Third, of the items pertaining to mental health, the subjective feeling of happiness and perceived stress were not accompanied with objectified information, Thus, it is possible that the responses did not accurately reflect the adolescents' states. For instance, the survey item regarding depressive symptoms did not mean to assess clinical major depressive disorder. Fourth, in this study, anxiety level was classified using GAD-7 scores. While GAD-7 was developed as a scale to evaluate the severity of generalized anxiety disorder, it may have been difficult to assess all anxiety symptoms using GAD-7. However, based on the studies conducted thus far, GAD-7 seems appropriate in assessing anxiety disorders other than generalized anxiety disorder. The scale has been shown to be useful in assessing panic disorder (sensitivity, 74%; specificity, 81%), social anxiety disorder (sensitivity, 72%; specificity, 80%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 81%) [34] . Hence, in consideration of the advantage that anxiety symptoms can be assessed with simple items in a short time, it is believed that GAD-7 can be effectively used to assess the level of anxiety in a large sample.",

Because anxiety symptoms during adolescence can be an early manifestation of various psychopathologies, adolescents with high anxiety levels are vulnerable to other anxiety disorders and other mental disorders. To prevent this, adolescents in the community who show severe anxiety symptoms should be screened early and be specifically managed and intervened with respect to anxiety symptoms, health risk behaviors, and mental disorders that might occur at a later point in time. In the future, large-scale longitudinal research should be performed to identify causal relationships between anxiety levels and other psychopathologies and health risk behaviors in adolescents.",
