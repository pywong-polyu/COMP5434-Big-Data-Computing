Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are not just immensely popular in the service layer applications but also have been proposed as essential enablers in many aspects of B5G networks, from IoT devices and edge computing to cloud-based infrastructures. However, most of the existing surveys in B5G security focus on the performance of AI/ML models and their accuracy, but they often overlook the accountability and trustworthiness of the models' decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods are promising techniques that would allow system developers to identify the internal workings of AI/ML black-box models. The goal of using XAI in the security domain of B5G is to allow the decision-making processes of the security of systems to be transparent and comprehensible to stakeholders making the systems accountable for automated actions. In every facet of the forthcoming B5G era, including B5G technologies such as RAN, zero-touch network management, E2E slicing, this survey emphasizes the role of XAI in them and the use cases that the general users would ultimately enjoy. Furthermore, we presented the lessons learned from recent efforts and future research directions on top of the currently conducted projects involving XAI.",

The innovations that thrive in the telecommunication sector have laid the infrastructure and led towards a consonant development that has led to exponential growth in living standards. The first generation of cellular networks started evolving wireless communication technology in the 1980s. 5G wireless technology, primarily based on softwarization, is expected to complete the transition with significant coverage by 2025. The most noticeable feature of 5G is the cloudification of networks via microservices-based architecture. With the start of commercialized implementation of 5G, experts predict that 6G mobile communication will become widely available in the following years [1] . Meanwhile, the academic community is more focused on new lines of study in advance of the beyond 5G or 6G standardization. Edge intelligence (EI), Beyond 6GHz to THz communication, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), Large Intelligent Surfaces (LIS), and Zero-touch Networks have risen in recent years [2] - [4] . These concepts are being developed into the technology that will power the next generation of communication networks. There is still a long way to go in terms of 5G network capabilities to meet the needs of these applications, which need high-speed data transfer rates and real-time access to vital computing resources. IoE, enabled by 5G, seeks to connect vast numbers of devices and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), surpassing 5G's capabilities into the B5G era. For example, 6G is expected to connect millions of devices and provide instant access to massive amounts of compute and storage power. For B5G wireless networks, the scientific community expects entirely intelligent network orchestration and management [2] , [5] . It will be distinct from previous generations concerning various aspects, including network infrastructures, radio access methods, processing and storage capacities, application types. New applications will need to intelligently use communications, compute, control, and storage resources. Moreover, wireless networks are producing a large amount of data. This paradigm shift allows data-driven real-time network design and operation in B5G.",

It now includes more complicated attacks and tougher assailants. 4G networks' most prominent security and privacy threats come from malware programs and common MAC layer security vulnerabilities, like viruses, tampering, Denial of Services (DoS), replay attacks. Eavesdropping. These attacks have morphed into Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and cloud computing in the 5G. Insecure SDN features include OpenFlow, centralized network administration (prone to DoS attacks), core and backhaul, edge device vulnerabilities, and open APIs [6] , [7] . Research communities are starting to focus on security vulnerabilities in B5G communication using advanced networking, AI/ML, and linked intelligence technologies that power the B5G vision. On top of the unsolved security issues brought forward from the previous generations, these new technologies open B5G networks to a whole new threat surface as never seen before.

Summarized table II outlines contemporary research and surveys conducted on the advancements of B5G, AI, and XAI. Here we have found out that each paper presents applications in dis-articulated contexts. On the contrary, implementing B5G technologies rather begs for a holistic review of AI and XAI in security, given that accountability and resilience are core and essential characteristics of any mobile network generation. Many researchers focus on B5G, XAI, and AI techniques in sunders, but currently, there has not been a cognate approach where the viability of XAI techniques has been reviewed in the context of B5G use cases. As a response, this survey reports a comprehensive overview of XAI and security technical aspects, applications, requirements, limitations, challenges/issues, current projects, standardization initiatives, and lessons learned for the beyond 5G applications.",

Following the success of 5G, 6G/B5G is becoming the focal point of academia and industry with research and implementations. 5G has addressed much of the prevalent problems [39] with high data rate enhanced mobile broadband systems (eMBB) and leaped on with new functionalities such as laying the foundation for enabling the Internet of Things (IoT). However, new IoT services are developed rapidly in applications such as virtual, augmented, mixed reality services (which fall under XR services), autonomous vehicle systems, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), telemedicine, haptic systems and blockchain-based systems [4] . In order to implement these services, ultra-reliable, lowlatency communications (URLLC) with short-packet support and high data rates in both uplink and downlink needs to be maintained in a secure and privacy protected wireless system [39] . A key factor affecting the dynamic of the revolution will be the profound number of human-type and machine-type devices connecting to the network. Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) is expected to be fully deployed alongside URLLC to address those devices' requirements to achieve end-2-end latency reduction once 5G is fully deployed later on. Catering those heterogeneous devices in 6G technologies would take the data rates to the terabyte realms (maximum 1 Terabits/second) in order to perform effectively [40] . In other words, nearly a 1000x increase from the last generation of wireless technologies [15] bringing in massive amounts of data each day. A cohort of technologies like AI, Symbiotic radio (SR), call-free massive MIMO (CFmMM), intelligent communication surfaces, index modulation (IM), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), networkin-box [2] , [5] , [13] , [16] , [18] , [22] , [28] , [41] will be used in handling those services mentioned above. AI takes a prominent place out of them due to its unprecedented evidential capabilities and ubiquitous applications. Following the massive success of AI in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, bioinformatics, social intelligence, and numerous others, the technology has proved to be ubiquitous [42] . Naturally, a profound amount of data is expected to be generated at high rates due to the vast and varied set of applications associating billions of devices in the B5G eco-system, making it the perfect grounds for the application of AI exploiting its capabilities of solving problems involving large amounts of unstructured data efficiently. So the potential to apply AI in numerous aspects of B5G ranging from network architectures to security, privacy, signal processing solutions, and system-level optimizations.",

Explainable AI 1) Motivations of XAI: While the early AI systems were simple to understand, opaque decision methods such as Deep Neural Network (DNN) have gained popularity in recent years. Deep Learning (DL) models are experimentally successful due to a combination of efficient learning algorithms and their large parametric field. DNNs are considered sophisticated black-box models since they have hundreds of layers and millions of parameters [43] . Transparency is the polar opposite of black-box-ness, which is the pursuit of knowledge of how a model functions. The need for explainability among AI stakeholders is growing as black-box Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to make significant predictions in critical settings [44] . The risk lies in making and implementing choices that are not reasonable, lawful, or do not allow for comprehensive explanations of their actions [12] . Explanations that back up a model's output are critical. For example, in medical applications, specialists need to uncover what causes are identified in the model to arrive at the forecast, which would reinforce their confidence in the diagnosis [45] .

Models in this domain may also be categorized according to the context in which they are interpretable, notably algorithmic transparency, decomposability, and simulatability. Decomposability refers to the capacity of a model to be explained in terms of its constituent components. Simulatability refers to a model's ability to be simulated or thought about rigorously by a person. When the model is sufficiently self-contained for a person to think and reason about it in its entirety, it can be referred to as a decomposable model with simulatability. Algorithmic transparency may be interpreted in a variety of ways. Prominently, it refers to the user's capacity to comprehend how the model generates any given result from its input data. The primary restriction on algorithmically transparent models is that they must be completely explorable using mathematical techniques and analysis [47] . Each of these classes includes its antecedents; for example, a simulatable model is both decomposable and algorithmically transparent. Some popular models that fall under transparent models are Linear/Logistic regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Rule-based models, GAM -General Additive Models, and Bayesian models. These models are deemed to be expressive enough to be human-understandable. [35] .",

The intuition here is to understand what would happen if a slightly different data point is given to the model in place of the original data point and how it would affect the prediction. For example, if a model classifies a person as not suitable to receive a loan, then the CFE would provide the reason that he/she needs to have a saving of 10 000 euros for the model to classify him/her as a suitable person to receive the loan. Unlike many other interpreters, the explanations are closer to human nature and provide actionable and precise recommendations. The basic idea of CFEs are model agnostic, but several variations are developed for model-specific applications [60] . XAI for RL has been explored for agent-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) AI systems from as early as 1994 [61] . It is not easy to deliver XAI for RL because it generally includes several judgments made over time, often seeking to offer the next action in real-time. Unlike conventional ML, RL explanations must cover a collection of acts spread across a plethora of different states that are connected in some manner. Also, the absence of an explicit training dataset can contribute to the difficulty in applying XAI techniques [62] . Some of the widely known AI techniques for RL is discussed below [63] .",

In DRL, neural networks reflect the policies and are difficult to comprehend. On the other hand, PIRL policies are expressed using a high-level, human-readable programming language. However, unlike standard RL, they limit the number of target policies by using a (policy) sketch. They use a framework based on imitation learning called Neurally Directed Program Search to uncover these regulations (NDPS). (b) Hierarchical policies technique [65] is another in-model XAI technique used to interpret the decision process of multi-task complex RL systems but locally. The core tenet of this approach is to decompose a complicated task into smaller subtasks. These smaller tasks will be accomplished with the already learned policies or learn a new skill. This model also takes the temporal connections and task priorities to improve efficiency and accuracy. The technique builds on multi-task RL with modular policy design and a two-layer hierarchical policy based on minimal assumptions and limits. In [65] they assess this technique in object manipulation tasks in the Minecraft game. (c) Linear Model U-Trees (LMUT) [66] is a post-hoc explanation method unlike the methods mentioned above.

            "text": "Network softwarization (NS) and network function virtualization NFV introduced with 5G are expected to be significantly enhanced as we enter the B5G era. Figure 1 shows that going; further, the conventional networking design will be evolved into a new layered architecture established on complex black-box AI/ML models in all facets of communication, including security. In the first layer of B5G architecture, data is gathered through IoT devices such as smartwatches, phones, drones, etc., to enable real-time services in higher layers. Although it's one of the essential operations, the convictions behind data collection and security/privacy issues are highly influenced by the demography and underlying regulations. Using XAI, such differences can be addressed evenly by giving more details about how collected data is used inside AI models in the rest of the pipeline. Further, it enables system operators to identify the performance of each device more intimately with respect to the overall AI system. RAN, edge, core, and backhaul layers provide the infrastructure to reach higher speeds and quality of services based on enhanced virtualization techniques. The security of these layers is envisioned to be addressed through AI/ML-based methods to accommodate the massive volumes of data. Getting automated feedback on the performance of those AI/ML systems is paramount to ensure maximum resilience by identifying false predictions and diagnosing any system issues. It will benefit system operators and stakeholders who are not technically sound in AI/ML. In E2E slicing and ZSM [3] , [69] security of AI/ML components are used in integral parts of the system architecture. For example, the ZSM's E2E service intelligence enables decisionmaking based on data collected in the domain and standard data services. An attacker may create inputs to cause the ML model to make incorrect judgments and threaten performance, financial loss, SLA fulfillment, and security assurances. XAI would be highly useful during the response process to estimate the overall effect and trace back to the most basic module responsible for the anomaly. Finally, the application layer would require the most high-level explanations relevant to the end-users in B5G. Techniques like counterfactual explanations are ideal for inculcating trust and confidence in the users in the application layer. When designing a system with explainable security, one must evaluate the 6W questions; Why, Who, What, Where, When, and How to generate security explanations. Inspired by Vigano et al. [70] , figure 6 depicts the flow of identifying basic building blocks to design an explainable security system. First, the apparent reason to why the system needs XAI must be identified. Then to whom and who create the explanation and decide the level of granularity of the content that is broadcast to each group of actors. Identifying the needs of each actor early on helps to decide on what aspects of the system that need to be explained. Here the system designers must consider the layer of B5G architecture and fit the explanation to meet its requirements. Although the explanation is generated in one layer, it will not be the same where it will be accessible. Whether it will be a separate service or embedded in the system/output must be decided. It is also essential to decide the when the explanations are needed during the process, i.e., during design, installation or maintenance, defense, etc. Finally, the nature of the explanation is decided by answering the question of how to interpret AI/ML model. It will lay the groundwork for choosing the correct XAI methods for highquality explanations.",

Research divided the server virtualization security threats into three main categories: hypervisor-based attacks, VMbased attacks, and VM image attacks [84] . A hypervisor-based attack is an exploit in which a malicious actor takes advantage of vulnerabilities in the program to allow multiple operating systems to share a single hardware processor. If attackers gain command of the hypervisor, all the VMs and the data accessed will be under their full control to utilize. Furthermore, it could compromise the control of the underlying physical system and the hosted applications. Some of the well-known attacks (e.g., Bluepill, Hyperjacking, etc.) insert VM-based rootkits that can install a rogue hypervisor or modify the existing one to completely control the environment.

VM sprawls, which occurs when a large number of VMs exist in the environment without proper management or control, and since they retain the system resources (i.e., memory, disks, network channels etc.) during this period, these resources cannot be assigned to other VMs. Cross VM-side channel attacks, when a malicious VM penetrates the isolation between VMs, and then access the shared hardware and cache locations to extract confidential information from the target VM. VM image threats comprise inside-VM attacks, where a VM image is infected with malware or OS rootkits at run-time; and outdated software packages in VMs, that can pose serious security threats in the virtualized environment, for example, a machine rollback operation may expose a software bug that has already been fixed [85] .",

A container image that is missing critical security updates, or has an improper configuration, embedded malware or clear text secrets, can be the target of exploitation that compromised the security of the rest of the system. Likewise, images often contain sensitive components like an organization's proprietary software and embedded secrets. If connections to registries are performed over insecure channels, the contents of images are subject to the same confidentiality risks as any other data transmitted in the clear [86] . By default in most container runtimes, individual containers can access each other and the host OS over the network. If a container is compromised and acting maliciously, allowing this network traffic may risk other resources in the environment. Moreover, a container running in privileged mode has access to all the devices on the host, thus allowing it to essentially act as part of the host OS and impact all other containers running on it.",

However, to adopt such technology, 6G cells must be changed from \"small\" to \"tiny\" meaning that much more complicated hardware needs to be built. This requirement also brings new privacy and security concerns, especially eavesdropping and authorization. Indeed, eavesdropping is believed to be difficult but still feasible. According to [87] , eavesdroppers can capture THz signals using narrow beams and by intercepting signals in line-of-sight transmissions. A countermeasure against these narrow beam attacks has been introduced. It has been proved to detect some, although not all, eavesdroppers. Moreover, authorization is another security concern that has been investigated in [88] . The authors proved that an unauthorized entity could capture communications by strategically placing objects in the transmission path and scattering the radiation toward the user. In [89] , the concept of electromagnetic signature of THz frequencies was mentioned as a potentially useful authentication method.",

These applications will collect a remarkable volume of sensitive personal information and thus, raise the need for solutions for gathering, storing, sharing, and protecting data. Traditional cryptography may help but bring a tradeoff between latency, reliability, and confidentiality. The characteristics of 6G promise potential physical layer solutions that can solve these problems by incurring fewer latency [110] .

In addition to that, traffic analysis attacks, RFID spoofing/cloning/unauthorized access, MITM, sinkhole attacks, and routing information attacks can be seen under network attacks [113] - [116] . Viruses, worms, spyware, phishing attacks, malicious scripts, and DoS attacks can be considered as the software attacks possible in the IoT [117] , [118] . Under physical attacks, Node tampering, malicious node/code injection, and sleep deprivation of sensors can be considered as some of the plausible attacks [111] . However, these attacks are rather difficult to achieve [118] . Encryption attacks are seen in the communication channels of the IoT. Side-channel attacks, cryptanalysis attacks, and MITM attacks are to name a few. [111] There are certain challenges for security that comes along with the IoT system. Resource limitation for processing and storage can be considered a major challenge. It might limit computationally intensive security measures (e.g., cryptography).

Most machine learning techniques used in IoT security are hardly backed up with explainable techniques to be safe from any adversary. DQNviz proposes a visual analyticsbased method to expose the blind training in four levels which makes the large experience space more comprehensible to the users [128] . In addition to the usual statistics of model training, it enables the developers to ensure proper training through visualization of the epoch level training, episode level training, and most importantly, the segment-level interpretation that reveals what the agent sees. Such visualization is integral for a high stake security system in the IoT. Similar research which explains the workings of DQN is [129] . Following the abundance of RL methods for security in IoT, there remains the possibility of using mimic learning [130] to match the output of a Q function neural network. In [66] a linear model U-tree (LMUT) is used to achieve optimal performance with high interpretability in DRL.",

Therefore the heavy automation and self-organization needed from operators' side to reduce costs can increase the necessity for reliable and more secure intelligence-based methods (i.e., AI/ML).

IDSs in RANs are one of the abundantly researched areas in RAN security using data-driven methods such as AI/ML. These systems must stay transparent to the operators, developers, and engineers working on these systems. Testing those models in the real world can result in some false classifications. However, the cost of such a misclassification which could result in a breach, can be too high in RAN systems. Using explainable AI methods makes it possible to interpret why a model behaved unexpectedly. The first step in making amends is to understand the reason for the misclassification. Once we know the cause, it's possible to prevent future attacks of such.

To ensure accountability, open distributed units that host those models will also require pipelines built to generate and communicate explanations. This requirement calls for more computation power and resources [135] . ML and AI models use real-time data from the RAN to monitor the RAN's health and performance. As O-RAN's security and management capabilities are enhanced because of the obtained results, added costs are justifiable. XAI techniques applied to those ML techniques will require additional time, effort, and resources. Near-real-time and non-real-time RAN Intelligence Controller (RIC) will require additional computation power to host interpreters incurring further costs. However, explanations are typically not a real-time necessity. Therefore, a certain leeway in power is possible. RIC also offers an open platform to host third-party applications (x/rApps) by specialist software providers, and thus additional XAI-based measures will be needed. The third-party application vendors should use fitting XAI methods to compliment the requirements on RIC during the deployment process to ensure software isolation, secure, standardized interfaces, and access controls to guarantee that x/rApps cannot bring vulnerabilities into the RAN [136]-[138]. 4) Summary: RAN commercialization is headed toward an alliance between CRAN, VRAN, and ORAN (xRAN) technologies. Each of these technologies is closely coupled with intelligent systems in operations such as resource allocation and optimization. AI/ML-powered zero-trust architecture will revolutionize the security in RAN technologies, from automating user access control policies to auditing. Backing up such integral tasks with a canopy of user comprehensible explanations would increase the accountability of the intelligent systems used under the hood.",

Also, the authors state that the DoS attacks, service or resource manipulation, privacy leakage, and man-in-the-middle attacks as the most prevalent security concerns on edge infrastructure. Current research describes the use of artificial intelligence as a facilitator of edge security in various contexts, including more general applications and complete architectures that rely on AI.

So the basic issue that explanations of such processes must deal with is finding methods to make all of these processes more manageable in their complexity. Making a proxy model that acts similarly to the actual model, but more understandably, may accomplish this goal. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) [49] is a perfect example for linear proxy models. With LIME, a black-box system is described by probing behavior on perturbations of input, and then the data from that probing is used to build a local linear model that acts as a simplified proxy for the original model in the vicinity of the input. Since this method is model agnostic and comparatively faster, the author emphasizes that the technique may be used in a wide range of models and problem domains to find the areas of the input that are most important for a choice. Research and suggestions are going on in explainable recommender systems that would be more resilient in place of edge AI [147] recommender systems as given in [146] .",

For improved performance, the edge server is constantly loaded with powerful multidisciplinary algorithms, including ML, data mining, NLP, and deep reinforcement learning [148] . XAI broadens the horizon of edge intelligence (edge caching, training, inference, and offloading [149] ) by adding a fifth dimension; edge explanations. Access to edge caching for generating and storing pre-model explanations is necessary to ensure security in the edge and IoT layers. Thus, additional storage spaces will be required. Similarly, when generating in-model and post hoc explanations during edge training and inference stages, supplementary computational costs might be encumbered depending on whether the situation requires new devices or edge/cloud servers. On the off chance that XAI methods are deemed too computationally expensive, operations will be extended and distributed using edge offloading. Each of the above scenarios will have inherent costs associated with them. 4) Summary: Edge computing thrives in ways to reduce costs, latency, and bandwidth usage. However, it has its caveats for a new threat surface that could expose to attacks such as MITM, DoS, and privacy leakages. AI/ML is increasingly used to mitigate those attacks, and those systems must be reinforced with a concrete interpretable data flow.

However, there is hope for these systems when coupled with interpretations of the internal workings. The MLP used in [160] for network optimization can be improved with various post-hoc techniques of explainability such as case-based reasoning (CBR) [161] coupled into the MLP network. With B5G around the corner, low latency and high throughput are closely associated with backhaul and core networks. Although ML is fully capable in this regard, the models need to be explainable enough without adding a burden on latency and throughput. Explaining RL models with LMUTs or replacing them with Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning (PILR) are worthy of application since they are efficient. PIRL policies are expressed using a high-level, human-readable programming language, making them understandable to humans [64] . Here identifying a policy that maximizes long-term reward is accomplished through Neurally Directed Program Search (NDPS), an imitation learning inspired technique [162] , [163] . The importance here is that in their experiments conducted in [64] , the NDPS model has surpassed the DRL model in performance.",

For this purpose, AI/ML-based systems have been widely adopted in recent studies. Consequently, XAI techniques become a requirement to increase their resilience and accountability. Deploying XAI methods in energy-efficient small cell backhauling techniques in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), high altitude platform stations, and satellites [164] will be highly challenging in terms of costs. These costs might be incurred on additional computation power, caching, and bandwidth to generate and communicate explanations. Although cost constraints could be a damper for XAI in core and backhaul networks, system insights gained through explanations are important because they indicate that wireless backhaul can be used in the field without any performance losses, and they also highlight the adjustments needed for optimal field use and robustness of the AI/ML methods used. 4) Summary: Security is an emerging trend for SDN and NFV-based backhaul traffic monitoring. Better network optimization, architectural enhancements, and security enhancements are envisaged in future research in B5G networks. AI/ML-based systems to identify common attacks such as viruses, MITM, replay attacks, and DoS attacks will also be applied in the core and backhaul parts of the networks. To avoid backhaul bottlenecks, balance the load, and measure the overall performance of resilience in backhaul networks, interpretable AI/ML models are more beneficial than blackbox models.",

This allows operators to meet customized client needs [165] . It is highly analogous to dynamically allocating computer resources to enable concurrent execution of threads in a complex software system, a notion known as program slicing. Program slicing divides (disaggregates) software routines into many threads and configures computing resources to create virtual computing environments for parallel processing. Similarly, through the segmentation of network designs into virtual components, SDN and NFV provide much more network flexibility than previously possible. In its most basic form, network slicing allows for the construction of numerous virtual networks on top of a single physical infrastructure, customizing the deployment of B5G resources and functions required to serve specific consumers and market groups by the network operators.",

Although this gives the adaptability to surroundings while still attaining near-optimal performance, due to the scalability issues inherent to Q-learning, the authors have extended the work in [168] where they have proposed an analytical model for the admissibility region in a sliced network which provides formal service guarantees to network slices. Also, they have proposed an online Machine Learning-based admission control algorithm that maximizes the infrastructure provider's monetization. Such models can draw the attention of stakeholders once they are commercially applied, and thus accountability and resilience are of great importance.",

Incidentally, explainable clustering is an up-and-coming area of research that can be used to improve ML-based clustering models' completeness, maintainability, resilience, sensitivity, consistency, accuracy, and robustness. For example, in [171] authors have proposed a general interpretability framework for any clustering/classification model called a single feature introduction test (SFIT) to explain the clusters. Although these techniques are used for different use cases, there is potential for them to be applied anywhere (e.g., B5G security) as long as the underlying algorithms are compatible. In addition to that, authors of [172] have proposed using decision trees to interpret the clusters provided by k-means and k-median clustering algorithms. ExKMC technique introduced in [173] is another approach to add the interpretability of the k-means clustering technique. It follows a similar approach as in [173] with small decision trees modified k-means algorithm. Since slicing is focused on delivering customized services to consumers, transparency is a growing concern in the community.

Additional communication protocols must be used to abstract and communicate domain-specific information for explanations alongside interpretations of ML models.

These algorithms should be backed with an expandable set of interpretability techniques in said applications. For example, Partial [52] , [179] to name a few. Generating adversarial samples is still not fully clear in service and network management fields [176] which is a fundamental step for identifying security vulnerabilities. Incidentally, IDS development and implementation is a salient concern for full automation. The use of XAI in this area is still in its infancy, but it is showing signs of promise.

            "text": "A. Smart Cities 1) Introduction: With the fast-growing urbanization and resource depletion [185] , [186] there comes the need to handle its drastic impacts on the cities. As a result, smart cities were proposed to manage and optimize resource and energy usage. To efficiently achieve the requirements of smart cities, suitable communication technologies that come with IoT have become an integral constituent. However, the immense amount of data collected in the IoT devices needs to be communicated appropriately, analyzed, and calculated precisely, and transformed into the envisaged services that are necessary to improve the standard of living in the cities. Thus AI and big data analytics come into play. More precisely, AI-based techniques will be found in many sectors of smart cities like Intelligent transportation, cyber-security, smart transportation, electric and water system, waste management, public safety, UAVs-assisted next-generation communication (5G and B5G), etc. [39] , [187] , [188] . With the usage of AI in integral parts of everyday life such as energy and security [127], [189] , [190] ; the reliability, accountability, and resilience of ML algorithms and systems using such AI, ML, DRL algorithms becomes paramount. On the other hand, the number of interconnected Fig. 10 . Smart cities in B5G era will involve collecting massive amounts of personal data that will require further accountability from the service providers end. From the collection of data to communicating the decisions taken by AI models, end users would require extra reassurance about the system security as the scope of services widen devices that becomes a part of the smart city can only increase with time. This inter-connectivity and the sheer number of devices have given rise to concerns with cybersecurity. Security in smart cities has been a growing field of research in the recent past. Numerous artificial intelligence and AI/ML-driven approaches considerably contribute to this. For example, authors of [191] emphasize the ability of ML to provide solutions for security threats such as DoS attacks (Using MLP based protocols), eavesdropping (Q-learning, Dyna-Q, and Bayesian techniques), spoofing (Dyna-Q, Qlearning, SVM, DNN, Incremental aggregated gradient (IAG), distributed FrankWolfe (dFW) techniques). They go on to show solutions to other challenges, such as privacy leakages and digital fingerprinting (SVMs, ANNs), where ML has become a viable candidate in the IoT and smart city domains.",

However, when developing XAI-based machine learning algorithms, it is necessary to consider various levels of explanation, ranging from \"comprehensive explanation\" in the case of complex black-box ML algorithms to \"no explanation\" in the case of transparent ML algorithms. In addition, contracts must be made in terms of the knowledge and competence of stakeholders who are addressed by the explanations from farmers of smart agriculture programs to technicians and computer scientists using machine learning algorithms in engineering practices that integrate data analysis into smart (traffic, water, energy, etc.) monitoring systems.

Heavy rains (floods) or heavy droughts can equally affect a city's water management, socioeconomic, ecological, and environmental aspects in more than one way. Nevertheless, with intelligent monitoring systems, these problems can be mitigated to a greater extent. Forecasting and being ready for any climate change is the first step. Traditional rule-based climate and weather forecasting systems were the preferred techniques in heritage cities. However, data-driven AI and ML model-based forecasting systems are emerging with promising results (even exceeding physicalbased models [192] ). Such systems occupy powerfully but complicated black-box machine learning models such as neural networks. The main impediment to using such systems in a real-world setting is the absence of accountability frameworks due to their lack of transparency, explainability, and trust. So it's vital to have an explainable wrapping to back the outputs of these models in different situations. For example, during a security breach or a malfunction of a meteorological system (e.g., Cyclone prediction), all the components should be transparent enough to be evaluated by the operators and state inspectors to make amends and find the responsible parties. General public and government/private institutes affected by such situations has the right to know the reasons behind the damages incurred upon them. Therefore an explainable and interpretable layer for AI-based models is of utmost importance. In [193] authors have used SHAP-based interpretations for CNN and LSTM-based spatial drought prediction systems. Such work realizes a step towards witnessing AI/MLbased sophisticated and precise techniques used in real-world scenarios and ensures their sustenance.",

In [195] the authors identify the necessity of using XAI techniques in smart monitoring systems which autonomously collect, analyze and communicate structural data from wireless sensor networks and note the usefulness of LIME and LRP (layerwise relevance propagation). With the intent of evaluating data fusion techniques in smart city applications, authors of [196] have elaborated on the importance of having explainable outcomes from the data fusion algorithms, which are used alongside AI and ML-based automation systems in smart city applications. In [197] , the authors have surveyed the performance of 10 ML algorithms for smart medical waste management in Morocco, and out of them, they have shown that ANN and SVM are most accurate in an IoT environment.

AI-based techniques will be found in many sectors of smart cities like intelligent transportation, cyber-security, smart grids, smart agriculture, and so on, where sensitive data will be processed to improve the standard of living. These systems should be held accountable for any abnormal behaviors while continuously updating for security vulnerabilities. With their capability to disentangle ambiguity in decision-making processes, XAI techniques could expose the truth from pedestrians to smart city service providers with relevant information. [198] . Smart health can be regarded as an intelligent and context-aware development of mobile-health services, expected to reduce future hospitalizations and provide remote healthcare services incorporating the latest wireless technologies fused with other enablers such as AI and ML. Following that, there's a growing use of ML in integral parts of healthcare such as medical image classification [199] - [201] , diagnostic science [202] - [206] , tumour analysis [207] - [209] , personalized healthcare [210] - [212] , etc.",

But the lack of trust in AI systems is due to the blackbox nature and lack of fail-safe mechanisms in case of security breaches. Not only that but also with proper transparency, XAI can be used to figure out adversarial samples before a breach. In [218] , authors have used SHAP DeepExplainer to create signatures for input images which are then identified as either adversarial or not. Those signatures buffer the original AI model, preventing misclassifications due to adversarial inputs. Such an explanation based security approach can provide a layer of trust in a variety of image-based analysis systems using AI and ML [199] , [200] , [204] in smart healthcare such as endoscopic images, breast cancer analysis, skin lesion analysis, MRI brain tumor analysis, lung image analysis and much more.

Authors of [219] have pointed out the impacts of XAI in Healthcare as three folds; increased transparency, result tracking, and model improvement. From the data collected in the systems, if a user is categorized to have a specific illness by AIML models, say a high blood sugar level, the clinicians will be sent a report mentioning the features which were used in coming into the above decision as heart rate, body temperature, and calorie intake. When XAI is used and the list of features, it is also possible to show the most responsible attribute for the outcome as calorie consumption.

In the paper [221] , the author presents a secure framework for hospital environments using IoT and AI. This system is expected to overcome frustrating queues, overwhelming paperwork, work overload for doctors, identifying critical illnesses in time, etc. The authors have also emphasized the security attacks that can potentially affect the hospital IoT environment, such as interruption, interception, modification fabrication, replay, protocol compromise, stack attacks, etc. However, in such an environment, the usage of XAI can be of utmost importance to enable trustworthy AIbased defense mechanisms. Security aspects of IoT using AI are explained in the literature [222] where they report the usage of AI/ML techniques used in the security of the healthcare sector. Although the research work on the use of AI in smart health has become prominent in the last several years, the security aspects of those AI techniques need to be addressed more due to the dynamic nature of the attacks and quick evolution of the attacking methods.

To summarize, the basic premise underlying industry 4.0 is to make manufacturing \"smart\" and automated to facilitate mass productivity with minimum human intervention. In contrast, the successor, industry 5.0, is envisaged to capitalize on the main principle of collaboration between human brainpower and creativity in the production workflows with intelligent systems enabling mass personalization.

The deeper involvement of people in the industrial environments alongside intelligent machines makes the safety and well-being of those users a crucial aspect of the whole process. Sophisticated intelligent machines used in this environment can occupy AI/ML techniques with their issues and security vulnerabilities. A malfunction or security breach in such a system can cause property damage risking the closely associated people working alongside those machines. For example, the trustworthiness of a robot working with humans in a steel-based utensil manufacturing company is a high priority due to the high temperatures and extreme forces used in heavy machinery. A security attack on the robot could potentially affect the humans surrounding it. By using XAI, trust in the AI models used in intelligent machines like robots can be enhanced. Mapping the internal mechanics and providing clear explanations of the cause and effect of those algorithms could help the users to understand the operations and take proper precautions. More importantly, XAI helps trace back the cause in case of a security attack or an unexpected behavior where solutions to prevent future malfunctions can be taken. This will reduce financial losses for the manufacturing organizations and enable smoother production of things that would otherwise impede the achievement of the goal of mass production in the first place.",

However, the XAI security in the industry 4.0/5.0 field is still in its infancy, with only a few related researches coming to light. Nevertheless, all these works demonstrate promising results in facilitating AI/ML models in real-world applications. Zolanvari et al. [234] proposes a model-agnostic and high performing XAI model named TRUST (Transparency Relying Upon Statistical Theory), which they show results after testing it in an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment with different cybersecurity datasets (WUSTL-IIoT, NSL-KDD, and UNSW). They rank the most crucial input features for each class based on mutual information after converting them to latent variables using factor analysis. The likelihood of any new sample falling into the classes is calculated using multi-model Gaussian distributions. Authors argue that this system beats the LIME system in terms of speed, performance, and explainability. Federated Learning (FL) has become a prominent research topic in IIoT systems due to its perks such as privacy preservation and resource Here, in case of a security breach or other anomalous behavior, XAI may assist in determining the root cause so that preventative measures can be taken. and data management in the edge devices [226] . With FL's rapid rise in popularity, it's natural that it would draw the attention of cybercriminals. One of such devastating attacks on FL systems is the backdoor attack [235] , [236] . In order to identify backdoor inputs, Hou et al. [237] offers a filter system that is based on a mix of classifiers and XAI models.",

With the increase of its scale, interconnections, renewable energy integration, widespread usage of DC power transmission technologies, and deregulation of electricity markets have multiplied and evolved. The smart grid's capacity to maintain its stable state has become a more complex problem. Traditional stability analysis and control approaches have become lengthy/timeconsuming, inefficient, and expensive because of these new developments. However, they also emphasize the possibility of overcoming this issue by embedding intelligent systems in CPS. Interoperability of AI/ML systems associated with the underlying infrastructure of smart grids becomes crucial in the context of the security of CPS.

In [243] the authors bring to light the potential to use AI in some of the critical operations in smart grids. Most of the applications are critical to the performance of the whole system, e.g., static/dynamic security assessments, stability control/assessment, and fault diagnosis. It is worth noting that these functions hold equally paramount importance to the grid and the livelihood of thousands that depend on the energy distribution system. The most important function of a smart grid is to control and maintain stability. During operations, the system could go through various states of power demand and other disturbances which would continuously drag the system away from the normal state. Corresponding control systems such as generation controls, damping controls, voltage controls, frequency controls, etc., need to be in place to handle each operative state. Lately, AI has been increasingly used in such control systems. For example, smart generations control systems are studied to use RL (DQN [244] and Q-learning [245] ). Among many other previous studies, frequency control systems have been implemented using LSTMs [246] , RL, and stacked denoising AEs [247] . Although these studies have shown promising results in terms of accuracy, limitations exist in practice. Interpretability of AI models, robustness to adversarial attacks, robustness to noise/data loss/time delay, and imbalanced data sets are a few. Plausible solutions to these issues can be drawn from XAI. In [248] authors have shown that with better interpretable methods such as DTs, security assessments of smart grids can be implemented accurately and in a transparent manner. Also, the authors of [249] have shown that using a local linear interpreter on top of a deep belief network would enable the users to identify crucial factors that contribute to system instability. Furthermore, these outcomes can be used in emergency control scenarios.",

STAR will investigate how artificial intelligence systems can acquire knowledge to make timely and safe decisions in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Additionally, it will conduct research into technologies that enable AI systems to deal with sophisticated adversaries and remain resilient to security attacks. Participants in this project consider a variety of AI-powered scenarios and systems, including active learning systems, simulated reality systems that accelerate RL in human-robot collaboration, XAI systems, human-centric digital twins, advanced RL techniques for optimal mobile robot navigation and detection of safety zones in industrial plants, and cyber-defense mechanisms for sophisticated poisoning and evasion. These technologies will be validated in challenging manufacturing scenarios in quality management, human-robot collaboration, and agile manufacturing powered by AI. STAR aims to remove security and safety barriers that currently prevent sophisticated AI systems from being deployed in production lines. 4) SPARTA [294] -SPARTA was founded to establish a long-term community capable of collaboratively defining, developing, sharing, and evolving solutions that assist practitioners in preventing cybercrime and enhancing cybersecurity. The SPARTA project is divided into four major components: SPARTA T-SHARK: established to develop and validate methodological, organizational, and technological solutions extending cybersecurity towards the comprehensive organization of security functions, enabling threat prediction and fullspectrum cybersecurity awareness, providing high situational awareness, informing decision and policymakers on broad or long-term issues, and providing a timely warning of threats. The SPARTA T-SHARK program aims to expand the reach of threat understanding, from the current investigative-level definition, up to strategic considerations on current, future, and down to real-time event handling and prevention. SPARTA CAPE: This program addresses the assessment of cybersecurity properties for software, focusing on two specific areas, cyber-physical systems, and complex systems. For cyber-physical systems, the objective of CAPE is to propose a method to specify security and safety properties jointly. SPARTA HAII-T: this program aims to develop an integrated framework and a toolkit supporting the design, development, and verification of security-critical, large-scale distributed systems. This aim will allow for the specification and enforcement of crucial security policies, including the confidentiality, integrity, resilience, and privacy of the exchanged data. The challenge will be tackled from multiple perspectives, including hardened legacy components, secure operating system software, resilience-and privacy by design. SPARTA SAFAIR: The SAFAIR program aims to conduct a thorough analysis of the threats and risks of AI. This is followed by providing mechanisms and tools to counter the deteriorating effects of recognized dangers in various critical AI applications, making them safe and secure from the possibility of being compromised. The program's impact on explainability will help AI users understand how the algorithms perform their tasks, which is particularly useful in domains where AI has already exceeded human performance. Finally, the work on fairness provides mechanisms and tools to ensure that the models created with AI methods do not rely on a skewed or prejudiced view of the situation they deal with. 5) 6G Flagship [295] -is a research project funded by the Academy of Finland that aims to commercialize 5G networks and develop a new 6G standard for future digital societies. 6G Flagship's primary objective is to develop the fundamental techniques required to enable 6G. The 6G Flagship research program recently published the world's first 6G white paper [296] , paving the way for the definition of the wireless era in 2030. The authors of that paper identified several intriguing security challenges and research questions, including how to improve information security, privacy, and reliability via physical layer technologies and whether this can be accomplished using quantum key distribution. Additionally, the 6G Flagship project will focus on key technology components of 6G mobile networks, including wireless connectivity, distributed intelligent computing, and privacy. Finally, with the support of industry and academia, the 6G flagship project will conduct large-scale pilots with a test network. 6) AI4EU [297] -through open calls and other actions, the project aims to create a comprehensive European AIon-demand platform to lower barriers to innovation, boost technology transfer, and catalyze the growth of start-ups and SMEs in all sectors. The AI4EU platform serves as a broker, developer, and one-stop-shop for services, expertise, algorithms, software frameworks, development tools, components, modules, data, computing resources, prototyping functions, and access to funding. Different user communities, such as engineers and civic leaders, can also get training to gain skills and certifications. The AI4EU platform aims to become a global standard built on existing AI, data components, and platforms. 7) SANCUS [298] -SANCUS aims to combine cutting-edge technologies for automated security validation and verification, dynamic risk assessment, AI/ML processing, security emulation and testing, and unique optimization modeling under the most recent containerized 5G system network platform. The project will develop several new engines and mechanisms to create a secure environment for product development and security posture assessment in a safe, multisectoral setting. The figure below depicts the conceptual approach to interconnecting such engines. All engines will be prepared and elaborated using virtual machines (VMs), allowing them to be integrated on the same platform simultaneously, conducting joint testing, formulating their instruction sets flexibly and on-demand, maintaining them quickly, and sharing them with research groups. 8) INSPIRE-5Gplus [299] -the project aims to advance the security and privacy of 5G and Beyond networks. Grounded in an integrated network management system and relevant frameworks, INSPIRE-5Gplus is devoted to improving security at various dimensions, i.e., overall vision, use cases, architecture, integration to network management, assets, and models. INSPIRE-5Gplus addresses key security challenges through vertical applications ranging from autonomous and connected cars to Critical Industry 4.0. INSPIRE-5Gplus will devise and implement a fully automated end-to-end smart network and service security management framework that empowers protection, trustworthiness, and liability in managing 5G network infrastructures across multi-domains. The conceptual architecture of INSPIRE-5Gplus is split into security management domains (SDM) to support the separation of security management concerns. Each SMD is responsible for intelligent security automation of resources and services within its scope. The end-to-end (E2E) service SMD is a special SMD that manages the security of end-to-end services. The E2E service SMD coordinates between domains using orchestration. Each SMD, including the E2E service SMD, comprises a set of functional modules that operate in an intelligent closed-loop way to provide a software-defined security orchestration and management that enforces and controls security policies of network resources and services in real-time.",

Management systems based on ML can be poisoned and evaded more quickly, e.g., to exhaust the system and network resources through lousy management. Third, XAI constrains the design of ML applications meant to be run on resource-limited edge devices, reducing their performance and security and making them more vulnerable to attacks.

The white-boxing of ML models by explainability would not increase the vulnerability to attacks if this is not the case. Second, we need to quantify the exact trade-off between the several ML properties required by trustworthy AI: What is the impact (positive or negative) of different ML properties on each other? The answer must primarily be on the explainability vs. security trade-off but also explore additional properties: performance, fairness, accountability, etc. Finally, more research is needed to identify the vulnerabilities of different XAI methods to attacks: How vulnerable are XAI methods to attacks? By knowing their level of security and the weaknesses of different XAI methods, we can make them more secure by designing or developing defenses against the discovered attacks.",

Technical aspects regarding the role of XAI in B5G security issues were thoroughly examined throughout major enablers of B5G, including IoT, RAN, Edge, core, backhaul, E2E slicing, and network automation, etc. It was followed by a detailed discussion on trending AI-based use cases of B5G and the potential of XAI in ensuring the trustworthiness of those networks. Apart from the favorable prospects of XAI, we also bring to light new security issues introduced to future network infrastructure along with AI explanations.

The close vicinity of ML function to that datapoint is explored when generating an explanation. On the contrary, global methods take the ML function as a whole when generating explanations for the inference. This quality generally makes these methods slow but robust, where local methods are fast but erratic sometimes.(c) Pre-model, In-model vs Post-model explainers:Depending on the stage at which XAI methods are applied in the development process, there are three main categories of XAI; pre-model, in-model, and postmodel.

It shows how the ML methods can be implemented directly over the data.The document studies the security aspects of the ZSM use cases, framework and solutions, identifies potential security threats and mitigation considerations to be covered in ZSM standardization activities. It aims to outline a list of security controls (aka security countermeasures) in order to raise awareness of security aspects that could be considered in ZSM specifications. The cited document explores the relationship between security controls and technologyspecific solutions.This document surveys approaches to establish trust in AI systems through transparency, explainability, controllability. It also surveys engineering pitfalls and typical associated threats and risks to AI systems, along with possible mitigation techniques and methods.The purpose of NISTIR 8228 is to help federal agencies and other organizations better understand and manage the cybersecurity and privacy risks associated with their individual IoT devices throughout the devices' lifecycles.NIST [307]NIST SP 800-53 revision 5: Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations NIST SP 800-53 is designed to help organizations identify the security and privacy controls needed to manage risk and to satisfy the security and privacy requirements.
