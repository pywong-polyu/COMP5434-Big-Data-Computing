This pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) has infected globally with 1,550,000 plus deaths to date, representing a high risk to public health. No effective drug or vaccine is available to curb down this deadly virus. The expedition for searching for a potential drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is of massive potential and favour to the community. This study is focused on finding an effective natural compound that can be processed further into a potential inhibitor to check the activity of SARS-CoV-2 with minimal side effects targeting NSP15 protein, which belongs to the EndoU enzyme family. The natural screening suggested two efficient compounds (PubChem ID: 95372568 and 1776037) with dihydroxyphenyl region of the compound, found to be important in the interaction with the viral protein showing promising activity which may act as a potent lead inhibitory molecule against the virus. In combination with virtual screening, modelling, drug likeliness, molecular docking, and 500 ns cumulative molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns for each complex) along with the decomposition analysis to calculate and confirm the stability and fold, we propose 95372568 and 1776037 as novel compounds of natural origin capable of getting developed into potent lead molecules against SARS-CoV-2 target protein NSP15.",

The first case of COVID-19 was reported in late December 2019 [1] [2] [3] [4] . Considering the spreading ability and the virus's potency to cause serious health issues, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in early March 2020. Initially, the virus was termed as 2019-nCoV. However, due to its similarity established with the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak (SARS-CoV), the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it as SARS-CoV-2 virus [5] . In general, the coronavirus is a single-stranded, spherical-shaped virus with RNA as its genetic material and crown-shaped glycol-proteins attached to its surface [6] . In the same line, the SARS-COV-2 belongs to the category of beta CoVs is a spherical-shaped virus with a diameter of approximately 60-140 nm [5] .",

Nucleocapsid protein is attached to a single positive-strand RNA whose role is imperative in hijacking the human cells to convert them into viral factories. Thus, averting N protein binding to the viral RNA serves as a potential target for developing drugs to prevent viral replication. The membrane (M) protein is present in the viral surface, and it is believed to be the central organization of the coronavirus assembly [7] . The spike (S) protein, which is assimilated to the viral surface, mediates the attachment and the virus's fusion to the host cell surface receptors, thereby facilitating the viral entry into the host cell. This attachment makes the spike proteins a crucial target for drug development, depicted in Fig. 1 [8] .",

Also, NSP15 is responsible for protein interference with the innate immune system [11] . Further researchers proposed that NSP15 might degrade viral RNA to hide it from the host immune system. However, there is no substantial evidence to support the suggestions. Nevertheless, the role of NSP15 in coronavirus biology is found to be imperative [13] .",

The two histidine residues come from the helix, and the others come from the beta-strands. His235 acts as a general acid, whereas His250 acts as a general base. Lys290 combined with these residues forms the catalytic triad.

Information about the binding affinity and interacting partners (interacting residues of the protein) is provided in Supplementary Table 2 . It is evident that compound 1777791 shows the best binding affinity of \u2212 11.880 kcal/mol followed by 95372568 (\u2212 11.2790 kcal/ mol) with the protein structure, but compound 1776037 has been chosen over 1777791 because of better energy profiles in MMPBSA calculations (shown in the \"Binding free energy (MMPBSA) and per-residue energy decomposition (MMGBSA) analysis from MD simulations\" section). In the case of 1776037, 1 H-bond, 4 acidic, and 3 basic interactions are obtained (in total 21 interactions) in comparison with 95372568 where 3 H-bond, 3 acidic, and 4 basic interactions are found (in total again 21 interactions). Although the difference between the two ligands' binding energy is just~0.6 kcal/mol, the increase in number of Hbond interactions in the case of 95372568 makes it a better choice to be a lead molecule. To validate our hypothesis, we performed various studies including MD simulations. The docking conformations of protein-ligand complexes are reasonably accurate as this docking procedure is validated by a control. The PDB structure 6WXC (crystal structure of NSP15 endoribonuclease from SARS-CoV-2 in the complex with potential repurposing drug tipiracil) has been redocked (results not shown) and found to bind at the same site, thus validating the protocol [14] .",

The most deviated was observed (4 \u00c5) as average RMSD change for around steps 35 to 40 ns for 1777791 (shown in black) (Fig. 5) . After that point in time, the trajectory is relatively stable and equilibrated. 1777791 also offered the best docking score, and this deviation might be the result of the change in conformation as the ligand molecule binds with the protein. The trajectory of compound 1776037 (shown in blue) showed the best equilibrated profile throughout the simulation (Fig. 5) . Similarly, the RMSF plot for the trajectories shows approximately the same per-residue fluctuation in the case of 1777791, 25575299, and also for 1776037 (Fig. 6) . The rest of the compounds showed slight fluctuations in the whole run. 1777791, as expected from the RMSD plot, showed most local residue-based fluctuation near residue numbers 30 to 40, 155 to 165, and 300. The same kind of profile is also observed in other compounds. These residue clusters could be the functional site of the ligand binding phenomenon. Figure 7 (left) demonstrates the hydrogen bonding pattern observed during 100 ns simulation runs in all five proteinligand complexes. The highest number of H-bonds was observed in the case of NSP15-95372568 complex, and the least number of H-bonds was observed in the case of NSP15-25575299 and NSP15-1776037 complexes. Figure 7 (right) shows the change in the secondary structure content of all the 5 protein-ligand complexes during the 100 ns simulation run. The least secondary structure change has been observed in the NSP15-1777791 complex. The rest 4 complexes along with 1776037 show more or less the same pattern of the secondary structure change which can be thought out to be their efficient involvement in ligand binding. These results suggest that 1776037 can also be a potential binding partner for the NSP15 protein along with 95372568, which will inhibit its bio-functional activity without showing any side effect.",

Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) for all the proteins was also calculated to check the effect of ligand binding on the residue profiling of the surface of the protein. Supplementary Fig. 5 (left) shows the SASA plot for all five complexes as obtained using gmx sas command in Gromacs [45, 46] for 100 ns simulation run. More or less, the profiles are the same, leaving some exceptions in the case of 1776037 near 90 ns time frame. This suggests no significant change in the protein structure on binding with different ligands except 1776037. Supplementary Fig. 5 (right) depicts the radius of gyration plots for all the five complexes over 100 ns of simulation time. As we can observe that Rg for NSP15-1777791 complex increased around 40 ns, this may facilitate the change in conformation of a ligand inside the binding pocket at that time. It also points out that protein is exceptionally receptive and making conformational space for better ligand fitting. On the other hand, NSP15-1776037 complex shows least Rg value of approx.

The rest of the complexes show a slight decrease in Rg, suggesting that the ligand binding helps stabilize the protein's stabilized compactness. The radius of gyration (Rg) indicates the degree of compactness and is defined as the mass weighted root mean square distance of a collection of atoms from their common centre of mass. It is an important parameter which provides us an insight of the overall dimensions of the protein [47-49]. Changes studied through the use of the radius of gyration are, for instance, association and dissociation effects, conformational changes by denaturation, binding of coenzymes, and temperature effects (O. Kratky, P. Laggner, in Encyclopaedia of Physical Science and Technology (Third Edition), 2003).
