No COVID-19 infection was observed in 92 cases of breast cancer, 14 cases of gastric cancer and 12 cases of pancreaticobiliary cancer. However, in 72 cases of colon cancer, 11 cases of lung cancer, 5 cases brain tumors and 12 cases ovarian cancer; 4 cases of COVID-19 were observed. In the hematology cancers group, which included 14 cases of Hodgkin's disease, 23 cases of lymphoproliferative disorder, 12 cases of acute leukemia and 12 cases of multiple myeloma; 3 cases of COVID-19 were observed. Conclusion Patients with cancer who need treatment can be treated by taking some measures. These measures include observing individual and collective protection principles in patients and health-care personnel, increasing patients' awareness particularly about self-care behavior, performing a COVID-19 test, and taking a chest X-ray, before the treatment starts",

            "text": "Unfortunately, since December 2019 the world has faced a new Coronavirus epidemic which has been started from Wuhan, China. In 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) considered this infection a serious global health problem and announced it as a pandemic due to its outbreak all around the world. The most serious complication caused by this infection was a severe acute respiratory syndrome which led to lots of deaths [1] . The most important symptoms presenting this infection were cough, shortness of breath and sore throat; after a while, other symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting, changes in taste and smell, and headache were reported too [2] . The most important complication which results in death is severe acute respiratory syndrome. The number of resulted deaths in April 2020 was more than 45,000 [3] . The incubation period of COVID-19 infection is reported to be 2-14 days; 5.2 days on average since transmission time [4, 5] . In some studies, the average incubation time is reported 6.4 days. Diagnosis of this infection is done using Real-time PCR test [6] . According a report from CDC [7] , high-risk groups for being infected or showing severe illness of COVID-19 are elderly adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions, particularly if it is not well controlled. Based on the CDC's report, those who are at high-risk for severe illness are: people 60 years or older, people who live in nursing homes, people with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, people who have serious heart conditions, people who are immunocompromised (including patient who undergo cancer treatment, smokers, people who had bone marrow or organ transplantation, and people with prolonged use of corticosteroids). Moreover, people with severe obesity, diabetic patients, people with chronic liver disease and people with chronic kidney are among other high-risk groups. According to some reports, cancer patients are at a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, compared to the public [8] . Yet, there is no accurate and concise instruction for cancer patients to deal with this epidemic. COVID-19 is a challenge for oncology and hematology specialists. There are some suggestions about managing these patients, including instructions in ESMO site [9] . According to these suggestions, patients are divided into groups called Priority A, Priority B, and Priority C. These divisions are based on some facts; including if the cancer patient has an active cancer which is life-threatening, if they are at an average risk, or if they do not currently have active cancer. The aim of our study was to investigate COVID-19 illness and its outcome in cancer patients who needed treatment.",

The treatments were injection therapies including chemotherapy, Bevacizumab, Rituximab, Trastuzumab, Rituximab, Sunitinib, Sorafenib, Everolimus, Erlotinib, CCNU (Lomustine), Procarbazin and etc. Which were used based on the cancer's type. Patients divided in to two groups of solid tumors and hematology cancers. In solid tumor patients, if they did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 or other infection symptoms, just chest X-ray was requested before starting treatment. If they showed COVID-19 related symptoms, High Resolution CT scan of lungs was requested. Otherwise the cancer treatment would be started. In hematology cancers group, in addition to above mentioned tests, real-time PCR test for COVID-19 was requested before starting the treatment. Unfortunately, performing PCR test was not always possible. All patients and their families were added to a telegram group to receive educations related to protection and self-care, since beginning of this epidemic. In this group they were trained about protective measures such as using disinfectants, masks, use soap and water to wash hands, and other hygiene methods. Since the very beginning of the epidemic we suggested patients and their families to use masks, we suggested it was necessary for everyone to use masks, and we considered protection measures for personnel of oncology and clinic wards [10] . We paid special attention to increase peoples' awareness particularly about self-care behaviors. These people included patients, their families and health-care personnel. Chemotherapy treatments were performed as usual. The same routine treatment was used for patients; therefore, no ethical approval was needed.",

Among these 218 solid tumor patients, 92 cases had breast cancer whose treatment was either started before the epidemic or continued throughout this period, or the treatment was started during the epidemic. The staging of patients was as follows; 5 patients in stage I, 29 patients in stage II, 37 patients in stage III, and 21 patients in metastatic stage (some of these patients, referred to as metastases, were patients with recurrence of the disease). Twenty-one of the 29 patients were receiving Herceptin during the epidemic, and the usual chemotherapy was completed before the epidemic began. For breast cancer patients, treatment was started with the same usual dose and at the same usual intervals of every 3 weeks. We had no COVID-19 positive case in these patients. Among 72 patients with colon cancer, 11 patients were in stage II, 36 patients were in stage III, and 25 patients were in metastatic stage (some of these cases were relapsed patients). For these patients, treatment was either started during the epidemic or continued during the epidemic. Treatment was done once every 2 weeks (FOL-FOX4, FOLFIRI) and in metastastic cases Bevacizumab (Stivant) or Cetuximab was used. In majority of stage II patients, a 3-week regimen of (Capecitabin/Oxaliplatin) was used. There was one COVID-19 positive case with positive RT-PCR and lung high resolution CT scan. At first, the oxygenation and pulse oximetry status of patient was good, but gradually the pulmonary problems were worsened, the patient contracted respiratory distress and eventually died. No other COVID-19 positive case was observed among colon cancer patients (Table 1) . There were 11 patients with lung cancer; of which 7 patients were taking chemotherapy, and 3 patients were taking Erlotinib. Among these 11 cases of lung cancer, one case of COVID-19 was observed. The patient developed a COVID-19 infection before cancer treatment starts, and died as a result. In 12 patients with pancreaticobiliary cancer no COVID-19 positive case was reported. We had 5 patients with glioblastoma multiforme; in this group we had one case of COVID-19 infection. The patient was under the ventilator device and later died as a result of COVID-19 infection. In 12 cases with ovarian cancer, one suspected case with positive lung CT scan was observed, but COVID-19 PCR test for this patient was negative.

In hematology cancer patients, in lymphoproliferative disorder class, both chemotherapy and Rituximab was done every three weeks and without any changes in dose of treatment.
