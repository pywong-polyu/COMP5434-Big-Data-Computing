Veterans whose condition is the result of military service may be eligible for a disability pension. Department of Veterans Affairs compensation examinations, which determine the degree of disability and whether it was connected to military service, represent an opportunity to engage Veterans in pain management and substance use treatments. A multisite randomized clinical trial is testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM) for Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal disorders. This telephone-based intervention is delivered through a hub-and-spoke configuration. Design. This study is a two-arm, parallel-group, 36-week, multisite randomized controlled single-blind trial. It will randomize 1,100 Veterans experiencing pain and seeking service-connection for musculoskeletal disorders to either SBIRT-PM or usual care across eight New England VA medical centers. The study balances pragmatic with explanatory methodological features. Primary outcomes are pain severity and number of substances misused. Nonpharmacological pain management and substance use services utilization are tracked in the trial. Summary. Early trial enrollment targets were met across sites. SBIRT-PM could help Veterans, at the time of their compensation claims, use multimodal",

Both brief counseling interventions offered an initial 60-minute inperson session, with up to two 5-to 10-minute subsequent phone calls over 4 weeks. Follow-up data were collected at 12 weeks. Results showed that higher proportions of Veterans in SBIRT-PM and the pain management-only conditions received VA pain treatment than those in UC (51% vs 27%, respectively). In addition, Veterans in SBIRT-PM, with its added focus on reducing substance misuse, had significantly lower rates of self-reported problematic substance use than those of Veterans assigned to pain management counseling only or UC. Mean pain severity did not change over time, regardless of condition. A longer follow-up period may have been needed to detect effects of newly utilized pain treatments.",

We hypothesize that SBIRT-PM will be more effective than UC and that nonpharmacological pain management service utilization will mediate pain outcomes. Objective 2 is to determine whether SBIRT-PM is more effective than UC in reducing the number of misused substances requiring intervention and, secondarily, reducing use severity for individual substances. We hypothesize that SBIRT-PM will be more effective than UC and that nonpharmacological pain management and substance use service utilization will mediate reduced substance use. Objective 3 is to determine the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of SBIRT-PM relative to UC. We hypothesize that SBIRT-PM, relative to UC, will be a costeffective use of VA and societal resources and have no net budgetary impact on local VA resources.",

We will randomize 1,100 Veterans applying for service-connected, MSD-related compensation to either SBIRT-PM or UC across eight VA medical centers in New England. All [13, 14] . Several features make the trial pragmatic (i.e., testing SBIRT-PM in routine practice). The trial occurs in eight sites across New England rather than a single site, allowing for inclusion of a broad range of Veterans who have chronic pain with or without substance misuse. Data gathering includes primary outcomes (pain, substance use, and cost) of importance to Veterans, providers, administrators, and policy makers and is completed through review of the electronic health record (EHR). Moreover, the trial tests the effectiveness of SBIRT-PM compared with its real-world alternative, UC, rather than an active treatment control. Simultaneously, the trial has several explanatory features (i.e., testing SBIRT-PM with more internal controls). It relies on research staff to recruit and assess study-eligible participants. Counselors were hired to deliver SBIRT-PM, rather than existing medical center staff. In addition, the trial includes monthly SBIRT-PM adherence monitoring and supervision with performance feedback and coaching to maintain the integrity of the intervention.",

Each site provides MSD-related compensation examinations and several nonpharmacological pain, substance use, and mental health treatments.

Every medical center has an interdisciplinary pain team, physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga, and cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain. Many facilities also have pain education workshops, chiropractic care, nutrition consultations, occupational therapy, physiatry, rheumatology, Tai Chi, and other complementary and integrated health options supported by the VHA Whole Health Initiative [22] . Also, community care treatment referrals, funded by VA, are available to VA-enrolled Veterans [23] . A local principal investigator helps research staff implement the trial.",

Because the study is conducted entirely by phone, the trial has continued uninterrupted, albeit at reduced recruitment volume. Consulting the VA Pain Management Collaboratory [16] , we amended the SBIRT-PM protocol to include a COVID-19 questionnaire (developed within the Phenotypes Workgroup) to identify how the pandemic affects participants' health, social determinants of health, and access to health care. We also have anticipated (with input from the Biostatistics Workgroup) necessary adjustments to our analytic methods to accommodate potential pandemic effects that vary over time on primary and secondary outcomes. Furthermore, we have modified the SBIRT-PM intervention to permit discussion of pandemic-related stressors and updated information about available virtual and self-help pain and substance use services accessible to Veterans at all sites.
