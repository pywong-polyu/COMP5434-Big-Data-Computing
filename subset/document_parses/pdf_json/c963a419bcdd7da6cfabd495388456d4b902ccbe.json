The continuous genetic adaptation and rapid propagation of drug-resistant pathogens have led to an expected drop in the therapeutic efficacy of the current anti-TB drugs, forcing the scientists to face new challenges in the discovery of novel molecular entities to address this issue. Hence, the development of innovative compounds targeting both replicating and dormant Mtb bacilli is critical for the design of more effective and shorter therapies.",

Among them, the mycobactin biosynthetic pathway, which leads to the synthesis of siderophores capable of sequestering host iron, has been identified as a source of promising candidates [9, 10] . Indeed, the siderophore biochemical machinery is significantly upregulated under irondeficient conditions, common in infected macrophages, constituting one of the major pathogenic determinants of TB. Moreover, it is absent in humans, thus minimizing the risk of off-target effects.",

This enzyme belongs to the family of the chorismate-utilizing enzymes (CUEs) [11] and it catalyzes the reactions shown in Figure 1 . In this context, we developed in recent years a series of furan-based carboxylic acids as MbtI inhibitors [12] [13] [14] [15] . Among this class of compounds, I and II (Figure 2 ) emerged as the best leads, exhibiting a strong MbtI inhibition, conceivably related to their antitubercular activity, and a negligible cytotoxicity towards eukaryotic cells. When analyzing the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of these compounds, we observed that the activity of the substances was closely related to the presence of an electron withdrawing moiety in a suitable position of the phenyl ring. The removal of the substituent from the phenyl of our furan-based leads (III, Figure 2 ) resulted in a complete loss of activity [14] . Encouraged by these studies, and with the aim of enriching our arsenal of MbtI inhibitors with compounds exhibiting enhanced antitubercular activities, we enlarged our set of derivatives to include compounds bearing different heterocyclic scaffolds.",

Here, we investigated whether the furan moiety could be successfully replaced by any of the heterocycles shown in Figure 3 , also considering that extensive research efforts have been devoted to the exploration of heterocyclic compounds as antimycobacterial agents [17] . We considered the introduction of a thiophene (1), because, in several literature examples, the use of this ring has resulted in an improvement of the antimycobacterial activity [18] [19] [20] . The furan was then substituted by a thiazole (2); aside from being the most common heterocycle in drug design [21] , this ring is part of the chemical structure of many compounds endowed with antitubercular activity [22] . To expand our investigations, we synthesized two derivatives bearing an oxazole (3), where the sulfur atom of the thiazole ring is substituted by an oxygen, a sulfur isostere [23] . The imidazole was then selected as an attractive isostere of thiazole and oxazole; notably, nitroimidazopyran PA-824 [24] has recently moved to advanced-stage clinical trials, inspiring the development of anti-TB agents featuring this moiety [25] . Finally, we explored the 1,3,4-oxadiazole (5), as it was reported to interact with some of the newest anti-TB targets [26] , and the 1,2,3-triazole (6) , whose importance is demonstrated by the antitubercular agent I-A09, which is under preclinical trials [27] .",

Briefly, I forms H-bonds through its carboxylic group with Tyr385, Arg405, and an ordered water molecule; the oxygen of the furan interacts with Arg405, while the phenyl ring forms a cation-\u03c0 interaction with Lys438 and a Van der Waals contact with Thr361. Finally, the cyano group interacts with Lys205, a key amino acid involved in the first step of the catalytic reaction. While the diminished activity of the triazole ring may be justified by the absence of a heteroatom capable of accepting a H bond from Arg405, the formulation of a hypothesis to explain the superiority of the furan with respect to the remaining cores is more arduous. A computational analysis of the binding modes of the tested compounds did not reveal significant disparities with respect to that of the lead molecule (unpublished data), suggesting that other influencing elements must be involved. Similarly, an in-silico comparison of the physicochemical characteristics of the compounds did not lead to meaningful results. Despite the different heterocyclic nuclei impart modifications to the overall properties of the molecules, a correspondence between the alteration of a parameter and the biological activity could not be unequivocally established. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the superior activity of the furan derivatives cannot be merely linked to the variation of one single parameter, but rather it is the result of a much more complex intertwinement of unrelated minimal modifications. The inherent multifactorial nature of these processes makes it hard, and potentially misleading, to seek a simplistic, univocal interpretation of these results. Hence, it is our opinion that the biological activity, empirically detected with our assays, is the only meaningful parameter that should be considered while determining the best heterocyclic core for this class of compounds.",

In our previous work, we discovered that the m-CN substitution offered the possibility to achieve better results in terms of enzyme inhibition compared to the other groups [12] . Moreover, in the context of a previously published disubstituted series, we took into account 5-(2-cyano-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxylic acid, which proved to possess an interesting inhibitory effect (IC 50 of about 18 \u00b5M). Therefore, we decided to explore the activity of its isomer 5-(3-cyano-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxylic acid (IV, Figure 4) , bearing the cyano group in the preferred position 3. Additionally, the relocation of the trifluoromethyl moiety to position 5 to avoid the steric interactions between adjacent groups allowed us to examine a hitherto unexplored substitution site on the phenyl ring. The new isomer revealed an interesting IC 50 value of about 15 \u00b5M. Following the same strategy, we synthesized compound V, an isomer of 5-(2,4-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxylic acid (IC 50 of about 13 \u00b5M) [13] . The new analogue exhibited slightly lower inhibitory properties (IC 50 \u2248 19 \u00b5M) with respect to the parent compound, while maintaining a promising activity.

Anhydrous solvents were utilized without further drying. Aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 plates (0.2 mm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC), to follow the course of the reactions. Microwave-assisted reactions were carried out with a Biotage \u00ae Initiator Classic (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). Silica gel 60 (40-63 \u00b5M; Merck) was used for the purification of intermediates and final compounds, through flash column chromatography. Melting points were determined in open capillary tubes with a Stuart SMP30 Melting Point Apparatus (Cole-Parmer Stuart, Stone, UK). All tested compounds were characterized by means of mono-and bi-dimensional NMR techniques, FT-IR, and ESI-MS. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were acquired at ambient temperature with a Varian Oxford 300 MHz instrument (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) or a Bruker Avance 300 MHz instrument (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA), operating at 300 MHz for 1 H and 75 MHz for 13 C. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm (\u03b4), while J-couplings are given in Hertz. The full decoupling mode was employed for 13 C spectra when the relaxation times of the carbons did not allow for a sufficient resolution using the APT sequence. The 2D-NOESY sequence was employed to unambiguously assign the hydrogen signals, when appropriate. HMBC and HSQC analyses were performed to aid the assignment of 13 C NMR signals, when necessary. ATR-FT-IR spectra were acquired with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA), equipped with a Perkin Elmer Universal ATR sampling accessory consisting of a diamond crystal. Analyses were performed in a spectral region between 4000 and 650 cm \u22121 and analyzed by transmittance technique with 28 scansions and 4 cm \u22121 resolution. MS analyses were carried out with a Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA, USA) LCQ Fleet system, equipped with an ESI electrospray ionization source and an Ion Trap mass analyzer; ionization: ESI positive Recombinant M. tuberculosis MbtI was produced and purified as previously reported [14] . Enzyme activity was determined at 37 \u2022 C, measuring the formation of salicylic acid by a fluorimetric assay, slightly modified from Vasan et al. [38] . Briefly, the reactions were performed in a final volume of 400 \u00b5L of 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl 2 , containing 1-2 \u00b5M MbtI, by the addition of chorismic acid, and monitored using a Perkin-Elmer LS3 fluorimeter (Ex. \u03bb = 305 nm, Em. \u03bb = 420 nm). Inhibition assays were performed in the presence of the compound at 100 \u00b5M (stock solution 20 mM in DMSO) and 50 \u00b5M chorismic acid. Where possible, compounds were tested both as free acids and sodium salts, providing analogous results. For compounds inhibiting by more than 75% the initial activity, IC 50 values were determined. To this end, the activity was measured at different compound concentrations, and values were calculated according to Equation (1) ",

To this purpose, cells were grown in 7H9 medium, sub-cultured in chelated Sauton's medium, and then diluted to an OD 600 of 0.01 in chelated Sauton's containing different concentrations of the test compound. After 15 days of incubation at 37 \u2022 C, the growth was evaluated by the resazurin reduction assay method (REMA). Thirty microliters of a 0.01% solution of filter-sterilized resazurin sodium salt were added to each well, and the microtiters were re-incubated at the same temperature for 24 h.
