            "text": "The Corona crisis not only exposed the causes of supply disruptions for system-critical medical products and pharmaceuticals, and made the consequences of the digitalization gap in the health care system transparent, but in particular, revealed the consequences of fundamental leadership deficits in hospital personnel management, professional profiles and ethics, professional policies, and procurement management. However, Corona has also triggered a rethinking of the values, meaning and purpose of work content and behavioral norms. This paper aims to identify and analyse management failures observed and experiences made during the Corona pandemic. Based on these findings recommendations for good leadership practices are given. By literature research reported experiences from physicians and nurses were analysed related to working conditions, motivation-to-work, and satisfaction with incentive systems. Furthermore, interviews with clinical staff working under Corona conditions were realised based on a structured questionnaire. The workload of nursing has increased significantly due to economization: from 2005 to 2017, the number of treatment cases increased by 12%, while at the same time, the number of beds decreased by 9.4% and the length of stay shortened from 8.4 to 7.3 days. The accumulated nursing overtime in German hospitals alone is equivalent to 17,800 full-time employees. During the Corona crisis the working situation especially for nurses facilitating patients ventilated on the intensive care unit has dramatically worsened: additional overtime, high patient mortality, resource-intensive and stressful care requirements lead to prostration and mental exhaustion. As a consequence of this tremendous work burden for nurses and physicians during the Corona pandemic up to 30% of these occupational groups gave voice to inadequate working conditions and utter their intention to quit their jobs. Demotivation and a flight into professions remote from medicine are a reaction of many physicians and nurses to years of leadership failures in hospitals and politics, as well as an increasing economization of medicine. Between 68 and 82% of physicians cite the cost pressure associated with rationing as a source of dissatisfaction with their professional situation. It is up to management to learn from these findings, implement the necessary measures and provide family-friendly working conditions for occupational groups working \"at the bed-side\". A \"value-based leadership model\" that takes into account the specific conditions prevailing in the healthcare industry was developed and serves as a compass in meeting and overcoming this challenge. This paper transfers practical experiences made during the Corona pandemic and pertaining to motivation-to-work under stressful working conditions, the meaning of \"purpose\", the try-out of so far unknown working practices and types of inter-occupational cooperation into a leadership model that is unique for the health care sector.",

Medical ethics and nursing ethics focus on helping sick people at the existential, physical and psychological extreme, in borderline situations. This is about people whose behavior is characterized by fear, uncertainty, pain and a loss of autonomy. Taking responsibility in this context, and demonstrating entrepreneurial awareness in the sense of patient-centeredness, continuous quality improvement and a willingness to solve problems, is the normal work routine for physicians and nurses, and is what keeps the medical sector operating at a high level of efficiency. Supporting professions such as medical assistants, medical controllers and purchasers also draw motivation and identification from being part of a medical performance process that is significant for both society and the economy. Furthermore, attractive working conditions are a convincing instrument of human resource management in order to achieve staff retention and successful recruitment (von Eiff 2019a, b). On one hand working conditions from the employees point of view are perceived as an expression of appreciation for the importance of an occupational group. On the other hand working conditions as well as leadership style contribute to staff satisfaction and determine the willingness to a commitment for carrying out patient-centered services. At the end of the day it is fair to say that patient satisfaction, patient readiness for recommendation and achieving a brand or magnet status are the consequence of motivating working conditions (see appendix Fig. 1 ).",

Only one Corona infected patient ventilated on an ICU requires the five-fold capacity of nursing resources compared to a normal acute care patient and a Corona patient's length of stay (LOS) is four times higher than average. Hence, one Corona patient treated on the ICU causes that up to ten other acute care patients suffering from serious diseases like heart failures, cancer or cox-arthrosis cannot treated as instantly as necessary and were put on a waiting list. Therefore, the working burden for the staff escalates to a permanent situation. As one consequence, 30% of the nursing staff were very outspoken about quitting their job as soon as possible. This may be the start of a doom loop leading to a dramatic gap in health care provision.",

The vulnerability of global supply chains (von Eiff 2020) for medical products (catheters, wound drains, kitpacks, custom procedure trays) and pharmaceuticals (propofol, oxytocin, epileptics) has caused a dangerous undersupply, especially in therapy-intensive areas (e.g., oncology). A lack of drug availability for tumor treatment has induced, among other things, a partial abandonment of first-line therapy (e.g., combined PEB therapy for testicular tumors) and required a change in patient treatment therapy mid-cycle. Supply disruptions of personal protective equipment have made medical care more difficult in terms of organization and timing and raised the risk of infection for medical staff and patients alike (von Eiff 2021).",

            "text": "Corona has revealed that medical care quality depends increasingly on \"low-cost routine products\" as well. So, a tremendous shortage of personal protective equipment e.g. FFP2 masks, OR gowns and disinfecting agents (typical \"bagatelle products\" in non-COVID times) led to bottlenecks in patient care and hazardous situations for staff and patients. Another breathtaking example: the absence of sodium chloride irrigation for a transuterine resection leads to procedure cancellation. Thus, the absence of a product with a negligible cost in the single-digit euro range in turn causes a loss of revenue to the order of \u20ac7000 and impairs patient well-being (outcome). Such situations are frustrating for employees in the health sector, reduce motivation, and cast doubt on the meaningfulness of their work, and the esteem in which their profession is held, since, from their point of view, \"false economies have been made\", i.e. in the wrong area. 2. The digitalization gap, i.e., the extremely low level of \"digital maturity\" of German medical service providers by international comparison, has proved to be an obstacle on the way to establishing a pandemic-compatible organization for effective infection management (Corona app disaster), as well as for platform-controlled supply logistics for system-critical products to match product availability and demand. The absence of telemedicine services, of platforms for virtual physician visits, of tele-monitoring options for patient care in the home, and of diagnosis-and therapysupporting smart phone apps (von Eiff 2020) have led (due to fear of corona infection) to a sometimes alarming decline in patient numbers in medical practices OR doctors' surgeries, hospitals, and emergency rooms (Mangiapane et al. 2021) . The medical effects that emerge over time, and economic costs of a failure to screen for breast cancer screening (\u2212 83%), skin cancer (\u2212 70%), and diagnostic colonoscopies, as well as the consequences of the decline in outpatient treatment cases (\u2212 23%), are not difficult to imagine. 3. The shortage of specialists in medical professions, which has built up over the years and is directly accompanied by a deterioration in working conditions, increases the risk of treatment errors and has a negative impact on the motivation and willingness to commit on the part of the professional groups working \"at the bedside\". In the pandemic, it was not ventilators or intensive care beds but a lack of medical professionals, especially in nursing, that emerged as the crucial bottleneck in patient care.",

At the same time, it became apparent that these stressful working conditions were not compatible with the life plans and professional expectations of Generations Y and Z entering the workforce (\"work-life balance\"). Added to this was what was perceived as inadequate pay in terms of performance requirements and responsibility. The urgently needed young talent was deterred and preferred a career path in other industries who were keen to employ them in the cross-industry \"war for talent\". \u2022 Cost cutting through the procurement philosophy of \"price-oriented purchasing\" led to the lowest price of a medical product driving supplier selection, rather than its effect on process efficiency and patient outcome, i.e. its value contribution. Short-term supply contracts in conjunction with low-price-oriented tendering procedures resulted in a \"Lopez effect\": In his position as a chief purchasing officer of a big international automotive company Lopez leverages his purchasing power in order to put suppliers under severe price pressure. As a reaction, the suppliers reduced product quality to basic functionality in a cost-cutting manner. The identical reaction could be recognised in health care. If manufacturers of medical products were forced to low prices they react with cost cutting by value engineering to the disadvantage of product functionality, making the handling of medical products more cumbersome and worsening efficiency in clinical processes. The pressure exerted by purchasing managers and controllers to use cheap medical products, which are associated with cumbersome handling and risks of use, was perceived by nurses and physicians as expressing a lack of appreciation of their work.",

The economically driven concentration on a few production sites, in conjunction with an uncontrolled extension of supply chains with \"extended workbenches\" in emerging countries, exacerbated their susceptibility to supply disruptions and reduced the security of supply for the health sector.

The medical and social care of Covid-19 patients is complex, requires expertise from different disciplines and the interaction of different professional groups. An effective treatment method was not available at the beginning of the pandemic and specific drugs simply did not exist. The treatment process was driven by trial and error: face-down positions, intubation, ECMO therapy, ventilatory pressure. Through the mutual exchange of experience and joint development of processes and their unbureaucratic implementation, learning processes took place in the team, with a high degree of individual autonomy and responsibility. The teams experienced defeats (deaths despite weeks of intensive treatment), but were also able to share successes. The development of team spirit and the possibility of \"being able to make a cause one's own\", \"to achieve visible successes through one's own initiative\" (von Eiff/Stachel 2006) makes it possible to \"find the work meaningful\". This important design approach of a value-oriented leadership model is reflected in \"integrated therapeutic teams\", \"heart teams\", \"rapid response teams\", etc. as forward-looking forms of collaboration, as well as in innovative job descriptions such as \"surgical technical assistant\", physician assistant\", \"endo nurse\", and \"stroke nurse\".",
