In addition, the average search perimeter in the job seekers' search profiles can be measured. The data are used to estimate the behaviour of the search and placement activities during the business and labour market cycle and their seasonal patterns. The results show that the search activities of firms and employment agencies are procyclical. By contrast, job seekers' search intensity shows a countercyclical pattern, at least before the COVID-19 crisis.",

In this context, the efficiency parameter covers a range of factors such as mismatch [11, 22] or information and institutions. A key ingredient of matching efficiency, however, is the behaviour of the relevant agents: Whether people get into work, for example, depends crucially on how intensively unemployed look for jobs and how much effort employers make when trying to fill an open position. This behaviour can be described as search intensity. A further crucial factor of matching efficiency is flexibility and the willingness to make some compromise during the search for a job or a suitable candidate.",

This extends previous literature: While [1] , for instance, find matching efficiency as a whole to be procyclical, this paper aims to investigate the cyclical behaviour of several key factors of matching efficiency: firms' and job seekers search intensity, placement intensity, as well as job seekers' search perimeter. Several studies analyse job seekers' search intensity (e.g. [5, 20] ). Moreover, [3] consider recruiting intensity of firms and find procyclical recruitment intensity. Employers increase their hiring efforts in stronger, and thus tighter, labour markets in order to fill their positions. In contrast, search intensity of the unemployed is often found to be countercyclical. While lower chances to receive a job offer in times of labour market slackness should discourage search, the fact that search must be intensified in downturns to compensate for lower job arrival rates works in the opposite direction [19] . Furthermore, if average characteristics worsen during economic booms, countercyclicality could be reinforced [20] .",

One could think of several mechanisms at work here. If a tighter labour market requires employment agents to more intensively support firms in their search for suitable candidates, placement intensity could behave procyclically. By contrast, the agency might intensify support for unemployed and placement activities in times of economic downturn. Characteristics of the unemployed could play a role, too. If, for example, there are more unemployed with low job opportunities, the agency might intensify support, especially for difficult cases. However, this could then come at the expense of support for \"easier\" cases, given a limited working time of the employment agents. In the end, the cyclical behaviour of the search and placement activities is an empirical question that will be investigated in this paper.",

            "text": "Conventional measures of search activity are often based on survey data, e.g. from time-use surveys [8, 14, 20] . With the digitalisation of labour markets, online data such as the presence of individuals in online job search [7, 15] or applications to job postings [4] got into the focus. However, the job exchange of the FEA and its placementsoftware VerBIS open up innovative big data sources for research. This section focuses on how these sources are exploited for measuring search and placement activities. The FEA as the central intermediary for the unemployed runs a job exchange website 1 where job seekers (JS) can apply for open positions or offer their workforce, and firms (F) can find workers or place job offers. Once the job exchange is accessed, server log files are stored in anonymous form. 2 These server log files are then processed in Netmind, a software that allows accessing the data without publication lag. The data in Netmind provide valuable information, e.g. about which part of the job exchange website the user has visited. Thus, they allow distinguishing whether the job seekers' or employers' area of the job exchange was accessed and hence measuring the respective search intensities ( I JS , I F ). For instance, if the specific URL visited implies that the visitor wanted to look over her job openings or to find suitable job candidates, the exchange website was most likely accessed by an employer. On the other hand, if, for instance, the visitor searched for suitable job openings, it can be assumed that a job seeker accessed the website.",

It is possible that such alternative measures are subject to different time series dynamics.

It is possible to distinguish between visits and activated visits and whether the job seekers' or the firms' part of the online job exchange was accessed. However, Netmind does not provide access to interesting other information such as the free texts entered by the job seekers in the search masks, e.g. on the desired occupation. Furthermore, the job seekers of the online job exchange might not be representative for all job seekers since on-the-job searchers could use other search channels, too. However, for an important subgroup of the job seekers (the unemployed), the FEA is the (legally required) contact point and a central intermediary. In view of the matching function that will be discussed in Sect. 3 , the data at hand should be a very good proxy for search intensity of the unemployed. Consequently, it can serve as a valuable additional ingredient for the matching function (which does not model on-the-job search but the part of matches that stem from an outflow from unemployment). Table 1 shows the respective summary statistics. All three intensity measures show relevant variation during the sample. In the COVID-19 crisis, they experience a dramatic drop, reflecting the firms' reluctance to hire and difficulties for employment agencies and job centers in Job seekers' search intensity decreased, too, both due to a decreasing nominator (activated visits) but also due to an increasing denominator (unemployment). Figure 4 and the last column of Table 1 show the development and summary statistics of the job seekers' search perimeter. It moves within a rather limited range of 1.2 km. This is mainly due to the measure being a monthly average among all entries and needs to be kept in mind when interpreting the regression results in Sect. 4.2 with respect to economic relevance.",

Matching efficiency \u00b5 t represents the productivity measure of this function.

            "text": "This theoretical framework has several implications for the cyclical behaviour of search intensity. From the firms' perspective, an upswing is-ceteris paribus-connected to decreasing unemployment and hence a lower level of hirings (Eq. 1). However, the firms can react by posting more vacancies and increasing search effort (Eq. 2) in order to obtain the same level of hirings. In fact, there is evidence in the literature supporting this reasoning. Davis et al. [3] , for instance, find procyclical recruitment intensity. Employers increase their hiring efforts in stronger -and thus tighter -labour markets in order to fill their positions. From the job seekers' perspective, applying the same reasoning leads to counter-cyclical search behaviour. A stronger labour market with lower unemployment levels leads-ceteris paribus-to higher job offer arrival rates (see, e.g. [19] ), requiring less search effort from the job seeker to obtain the same level of hirings. In a similar reasoning, DeLoach and Kurt [5] argue that search effort can be countercyclical because it is intensified in downturns to prevent declines in household wealth. A procyclical search effort on the firms' side and countercyclical search intensity on the job seekers' side is in line with the compensation argument: Both market sides can compensate for a tighter (firms) or worse (job seekers) labour market via increased search efforts. This would also apply for the search perimeter since job seekers's willingness to compromise probably increases as the labour market situation worsens. However, one could also think of a mechanism where lower chances to receive a job offer in times of labour market slackness can discourage search [5] . Then, job seekers' search intensity (and probably also search perimeter) would be procyclical if the discouragement mechanism dominates. In this context, it is possible that the perceived severity and permanence of a downturn could influence the relative importance of the two competing channels. If a crisis is not being perceived as transitory, it could well be that the discouragement effect dominates the compensation effect.",

By contrast, the agency might intensify support for unemployed if the economic conditions worsen.

First, it needs to be addressed whether \"cycle\" means the business cycle or the labour market cycle. Beyond the fact that the latter usually lags the former, Klinger and Weber [13] , for instance, document a sizeable decoupling between business cycle and the labour market in Germany, especially so during the last decade. To cover both, gross domestic product (GDP) and labour market tightness ( \u03b8 ), defined as number of vacancies divided by the number of unemployed, are used. Calendar-and seasonally adjusted GDP (index: 2015=100) was taken from the Federal Statistical Office (FSO). It is only available at a quarterly frequency, which is why the imputation algorithm by Denton [6] was implemented using industrial production (also from the FSO) as auxiliary variable in order to generate a monthly GDP time series. Figure 5 shows that there was a rather stable upswing in GDP until the end of 2017 before the downturn in 2018 and 2019. Labour market tightness grew strongly until the end of 2017, followed by a period of slower growth until mid of 2019, after which it steadily decreased. Both variables dropped severely due to the COVID-19 crisis. All in all, both variables experienced upswing and downturn during the sample even before COVID-19, which allows to investigate the cyclical patterns of the search and placement intensities.",

While surprising at first glance, it could indeed be rational for firms not to Table 7 apply, except that annual differences of \u03b8 , I JS , I F , I EA , and SP have been used react immediately to (potentially short-lived) fluctuations but instead to wait until an economic upswing or downturn proves to be stable before making any decisions with respect to their search behaviour. Furthermore, the labour market itself lags the real economy.

For instance, job seekers' search intensity usually is lowest in January (approximately 0.4 activated visits per unemployed per working day below the trend-cycle level) and highest in February (around 0.5 activated visits above the trend-cycle). Note that the depicted months are not calendar months but months between the counting days (see Sect. 2). Thus, a typical January covers the period from mid of December to mid of January, a typical February goes from mid of January to mid of February, and so forth. Consequently, the period of lowest search intensity on the job seekers' side usually covers the holiday season of Christmas and New Year's Eve. Another, less pronounced, local minimum in the seasonal pattern is visible in August and September, most probably due to summer vacation.",

The other maximum of placement intensity is in February, matching the maximum of job seekers' search intensity. And also the minima of placement intensity closely match those of the labour demand and supply sides: They occur in January, September, and November. Measuring the extent of the seasonal pattern relative to the mean search intensity, the seasonality on the job seekers' side is found to be a bit higher (ranging from \u2212 25 to + 30% of its mean search intensity) than that on the firms' side, ranging from \u2212 25 to + 15% (compare also [4] who find that seasonality is much bigger for applications than postings).",

It is possible that long-lasting shifts in the economy and the labour market will remain even when the virus is under control. However, the data at hand allow for a descriptive analysis of search and placement in the COVID-19 pandemic. Since during the first lockdown in March 2020 the news situation changed almost on a daily basis, the fact that the data at hand allow for a daily analysis becomes all the more valuable.

A possible explanation for this development is that an intensified search in the first days after the lockdown was not seen as a priority due to extraordinary challenges to cope with the situation, and the search intensity therefore initially sank. Subsequently, a compensation effect responsible for the usual counter-cyclical search pattern (see Sect. 3) appears to have been dominant until the end of March, while the discouragement effect could have been the dominant driver relatively quickly from April onwards.",

The overall drop in search and placement activities naturally will have adverse impacts on the labour market, especially on the job finding rate [9] . The most critical labour market effects of the crisis may arise not via the separation but via the hiring margin [18] .
