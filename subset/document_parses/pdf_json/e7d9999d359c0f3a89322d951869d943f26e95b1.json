Parkinsonism cases had evidence of nigral degeneration in DAT scans or hypoxic damage to the basal ganglia [1, 2] . The majority recovered spontaneously or responded to dopamine agonist therapy. One case of a hypokinetic-rigid syndrome has been reported with COVID-19 [3] . However, this patient had asymmetrical presynaptic nigrostriatal pathway impairment on DaT-SPECT and showed significant improvement in the clinical picture without any specific treatment. Cases with AM associated with COVID-19 due to the disruption of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits originating in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are also known [4] . We report a COVID-19 encephalitis presenting with an acute akinetic-rigid syndrome.",
