            "text": "Ascertaining preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing and incorporating findings into the design and implementation of strategies for delivering testing services may enhance testing uptake and engagement, a prerequisite to reducing onward transmission. Objective: To determine important drivers of decisions to obtain a SARS-CoV-2 test in the context of increasing community transmission. Design: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to assess the relative importance of type of SARS-CoV-2 test, specimen type, testing venue, and results turnaround time. Uptake of an optimized testing scenario was simulated relative to the current typical testing scenario of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) via nasopharyngeal (NP) swab in a provider's office or urgent care clinic with results in >5 days. Setting: Online survey, embedded in an existing cohort study, conducted during July 30 -September 8, 2020. Participants: Participants (n=4,793) were enrolled in the CHASING COVID Cohort Study, a national longitudinal cohort of adults >18 years residing in the 50 US states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, or Guam. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Relative importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing method attributes, utilities of specific attribute levels, and probability of choosing a testing scenario based on preferences estimated from the DCE, the current typical testing option, or choosing not to test. Results: Turnaround time for test results had the highest relative importance (30.4%), followed by test type (28.3%), specimen type (26.2%), and venue (15.0%). Participants preferred fast results on both past and current infection and using a noninvasive specimen, preferably collected at home. Simulations suggested that providing immediate or same day test results, providing both PCR and serology, or collecting oral specimens would substantially increase testing uptake over the current typical testing option. Simulated uptake of a hypothetical testing scenario of PCR and serology via a saliva sample at a pharmacy with same day results was 97.7%, compared to 0.6% for the current typical testing scenario, with 1.8% opting for no test. Conclusions and Relevance: Testing strategies that offer both PCR and serology with non-invasive methods and rapid turnaround time would likely have the most uptake and engagement among residents in communities with increasing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. : medRxiv preprint eMethods 1: The final DCE design included 500 survey versions in which each level appeared approximately the same number of times as the other levels within each attribute across the five tasks, some level overlap within an attribute was permitted across concepts in the same task, and levels within one attribute were included independently of levels within other attributes-Sawtooth's Balanced Overlap design. 14,15 The design was tested with 2500 dummy participants and assuming \"None\" was chosen in 33% of choice tasks, yielding estimated standard errors ranging from 0.0212 to 0.0489, with an absolute D-efficiency of 1342.39. For comparison, in a completely enumerated design, also with 2500 dummy participants and 33% choosing \"None,\" the estimated standard errors ranged from 0.0208 to 0.0499 with an absolute D-efficiency of 1380.008; our design's relative D-efficiency was 97%.",

While recent increases in testing are promising, 4 some models 5 suggest a shortfall, and important populations may still be unreached. 6 Understanding factors that may influence an individual's decision to seek testing can help enhance and sustain uptake of SARS-CoV-2 testing when, where and among whom it is needed most for public health purposes. These factors include individual preferences for different types of testing services, which have not been systematically ascertained or incorporated into testing service delivery.",

Simulated uptake of this hypothetical scenario was 97.7% compared to 0.6% for the current typical testing scenario, with 1.8% opting for no test when presented with these two choices.",

Some preferred tests (e.g., at-home rapid antigen tests) may be less sensitive than gold standard diagnostic tests (PCR via NP swab). Nevertheless, these findings are significant from a public health standpoint since its possible that widespread and frequent use of a less sensitive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test could detect much greater numbers of people with active infection-and more quickly-than the current typical testing scenario. 13 Indeed, our data suggest that NP swabs may be a deterrent to testing, which could be addressed by adding serology or relying on saliva specimens.",
