            "text": "The transmission of vector-borne diseases is governed by complex factors including pathogen characteristics, vector-host interactions, and environmental conditions. Temperature is a major driver for many vector-borne diseases including Bluetongue viral (BTV) disease, a midge-borne febrile disease of ruminants, notably livestock, whose etiology ranges from mild or asymptomatic to rapidly fatal, thus threatening animal agriculture and the economy of affected countries. Using modeling tools, we seek to predict where the transmission can occur based on suitable temperatures for BTV. We fit thermal performance curves to temperature-sensitive midge life-history traits, using a Bayesian approach. We incorporate these curves into S(T), a transmission suitability metric derived from the disease's basic reproductive number, R 0 . This suitability metric encompasses all components that are known to be temperature-dependent. We use trait responses for two species of key midge vectors, Culicoides sonorensis and Culicoides variipennis present in North America. Our results show that outbreaks of BTV are more likely between 15 \u2022 C and 34 \u2022 C , with predicted peak transmission risk at 26 \u2022 C. The greatest uncertainty in S(T) is associated with the following: the uncertainty in mortality and fecundity of midges near optimal temperature for transmission; midges' probability of becoming infectious post-infection at the lower edge of the thermal range; and the biting rate together with vector competence at the higher edge of the thermal range. We compare three model formulations and show that incorporating thermal curves into all three leads to similar BTV risk predictions. To demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach, we created global suitability maps indicating the areas at high and long-term risk of BTV transmission, to assess risk and to anticipate potential locations of disease establishment.",

The infection severity and the presence of clinical signs both depend on the serotype, and the severity of infection can range from rapid death to quick recovery. Common outward clinical signs include a blue tongue, fever, and excessive salivation [13] . Since clinical signs are rare, BTV infection often goes without detection. Unfortunately, undetected cases can still result in mortality, and while BTV vaccines exist, vaccine development is in its infancy [15] . An effective polyvalent vaccine to immunize against more than one strain of BTV has yet to be developed [16] , and existing attenuated viral vaccines pose significant health risks to livestock, such as reduced milk production in lactating sheep, abortion, early embryonic death, and teratogenesis in pregnant females [17] .",

Although BTV was first detected among merino wool sheep in South Africa in 1905, since then the disease has been found on every continent but Antarctica [18] . In recent years, the disease has spread to areas previously believed to not be at risk, including Northern and Central Europe, parts of Asia, and Western North America [12, 19] . Mandatory testing of animals and losses in foreign markets impose a huge economic burden. This adds to the economic impact of BTV on the livestock industry.

When R 0 > 1 , the disease is likely to spread, leading to an outbreak; when R 0 < 1 , the disease is likely to die out.

(2) Do different model assumptions lead to different predicted suitability ranges? and (3) Which traits contribute the most to variation in estimates of transmission risk? To answer these questions, we take an approach used previously for VBDs such as malaria [1, 2] . We begin by using Bayesian inference to fit thermal responses to laboratory-derived data for temperature-sensitive midge life-history traits. We then derive R 0 for BTV as a function of these thermal responses and incorporate the fitted thermal responses to obtain estimates of these across temperatures. To focus on just the temperature-dependent components, we define a suitability metric, S(T), that isolates the temperature-sensitive components of R 0 . We compare forms of S(T) where the midge density, V, is constant versus temperature-sensitive to ascertain whether this generates major differences in suitability predictions. Next, we conduct uncertainty analyses to identify which parameters drive uncertainty in S(T). This can indicate that either further data collection is needed to refine estimates, or that certain parameters have greater impacts on BTV disease transmission at different temperatures. Finally, we visualize predictions of the fitted suitability framework to explore which geographical areas might be suitable for transmission in the current native range of the midges, or if they become established elsewhere. Furthermore, understanding which temperature range results in S(T ) > 0 for given levels of other fixed parameters in our model may inform prevention and control strategies that target particular parameters (e.g., adult mortality rates via pesticide application).",

Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of our BTV transmission model (Equations A.1-A.8 in Additional file 1: Appendix A.1) which considers a single host population split into susceptible individuals that are vulnerable to BTV disease (S), infected individuals that have acquired infection (I), and individuals who have recovered from the disease (R). Also, we consider a vector population containing susceptible midges ( S v ), three levels of exposed individuals ( E v ), and an infected class of midges ( I v ).

In this study, we focus on the two US vectors for which there are data and project a global risk. We do this under the assumption that given the capacity for Culicoides to spread and establish-as demonstrated by the Afrotropical C. imicola invasion across Southern Europe in recent decades-there may well be similar invasions and establishment by the two well-studied US vectors, and thus specific models will provide useful planning tools.",

At intermediate temperatures ( 18 \u2022 C < T < 33 \u2022 C ), the uncertainty is caused by the midge density V(T).

This result was obtained regardless of which S(T) formula was used, i.e., all three different models of the latent period survival probability, f, led to the same predictions. Similarly, the predicted peak and upper thermal limit of S(T) were the same for the three forms, and only a small difference between lower thermal limits ( \u223c 1 \u2022 C) was observed. This indicates that the uncertainty of temperature effects on traits outweighs the effects of differences in modeling assumptions in the form of the latent period survival probability for these models.

At moderate temperatures ( 18 \u2022 C < T < 34 \u2022 C ), the uncertainty in S(T) is caused by V, meaning that more data are needed in traits contributing to estimating the midge density. At very high temperatures ( 34 \u2022 C < T < 35 \u2022 C ) we need more data on vector competence bc and biting rate a. Reducing the uncertainty in these components of S(T) will allow refinement of predictions, control, and prevention suggestions.",

A risk map can be a useful planning tool, both to understand the scale of current risk and to anticipate suitable regions where the establishment of BTV could be successful were it to be introduced, with competent vectors. We created global risk maps showing the number of months per year each location worldwide is suitable for BTV disease transmission given the presence of two midge species, namely, Culicoides sonorensis and Culicoides variipennis. The results show that warmer areas are at risk year-round, while cooler areas are at risk for fewer months. Based on currently available data, few locations are predicted to have temperatures hot enough to exclude BTV for many months of the year. Further trait data to decrease the uncertainty near the thermal limits would enable more precise and accurate predictions. However, the particular predictions are also based on long-term, baseline current temperatures. With climate change, and the continuous rise in global temperatures, the area at risk of BTV may expand and shift to include places with previously lower risk, or some year-round locations may become too hot for year-round transmission [44, 45] .",

Other approaches might be to use climate products with different temporal resolutions and express suitability in the number of days between thresholds, but these products tend to be available at much coarser spatial resolutions, making them less suitable for combining with livestock layers. Instinctively, one may want to use minimum or maximum temperatures to impose thresholds, but this faces a very biological conundrum of model mechanics-a minimum or maximum temperature may exist for a very small time period within a given month, and thus not represent a longer period experienced by the vector in question. The behavioral avoidance mechanisms vectors can use in short periods of extremes would be missed by this approach, leading to underestimates of the potential extent of suitability.",

For example, a study on three mosquito-borne diseases, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus showed that transmission is likely to occur between 18 and 34 \u2022 C, with peak transmission between 26 and 29 \u2022 C [43, 46, 47] . Moreover, the temperatures suitable for the transmission of the plant-borne disease, citrus greening, are between 16 \u2022 C and 33 \u2022 C, with peak transmission at 25 \u2022 C [48] . Together with our findings, this shows that there are similarities between ectotherm vectors in the way they respond to temperature. For example, their traits follow hump-shaped thermal performance curves. But there are differences in the temperature ranges they tolerate, and the temperatures at which their performance is maximal. This points to the importance of building system-specific models for predicting the effect of extrinsic factors on the spread of VBDs.",

The systematic review summarized BTV models used post-1998 [49] , most of which relied more on strong modeling assumptions than data. The model results were used to inform animal health decision-making by identifying at-risk areas and the risk of spread in the case of introduction [50] and climate change [45] . While several examined R 0 for BTV [10, 22] , our model differs in that it incorporates temperature across a wide range, allowing us to estimate an R 0 that is also temperature-dependent. A more recent study used a mathematical quantity called vectorial capacity instead of R 0 to estimate BTV transmission [51] . R 0 and vectorial capacity are very similar, with the latter assuming perfect competence and ignoring host recovery rates (making our suitability metric somewhere in between). The study identifies the optimal transmission suitability range for C. sonorensis to be between 27 and 30 \u2022 C, which overlaps with our transmission peak range of 26 and 29 \u2022 C. The difference is likely due to our study including trait data for two Culicoides spp. as well as including temperaturedependent infection parameters. Overall, the two models are in agreement regarding the effects of gross temperature patterns on BTV transmission.",

This is of particular interest in assessing the potential for invasion and establishment (and hence spread) of disease vectors, which has been found to be almost a hallmark of Culicoides spp. across the European landscape in recent decades, leading to novel outbreaks of BTV. Linking R 0 or S(T) to temperature can help identify BTV outbreak risk based on the temperature at particular locations, which in turn can inform management policies and control strategies within current and changing climate conditions. By establishing a model specific to current vectors in the United States, we can assess the potential for invasion and spread to other parts of the globe.",

Bluetongue disease is a vector-borne disease that threatens different types of ruminants, including sheep and cattle. This disease affects the livestock economy in the USA and around the world. Here, we focus on two species of biting midges that transmit the bluetongue virus. First, we collect temperature-dependent trait data from previously published studies. Then, we use this data to derive the parameters incorporated into the mathematical and statistical models. To assess the transmission risk, we use a metric derived from the model to identify the temperature range suitable for bluetongue disease transmission. Our findings allow us to predict the areas around the world that could be at risk of bluetongue transmission should the midge species be present. These areas require more surveillance in the case a bluetongue disease outbreak begins. Potentially, our results can inform future control and prevention strategies for bluetongue disease.",
