Despite those factors, Chang et al report that COVID-19 had just a transitory effect on US national procurement figures [4] .",

When the focus was to prioritize COVID-19 cases, global organ donation rates (ODR) did not significantly change compared to 2018, even though a negative SARS-CoV-2 test was required to continue with every PD process. We compared the monthly effective ODR for both 2018 (6.6 donors pmp) and 2020 (7.2 pmp) and found no significant changes during the whole year (P = 0.88), nor during the first peak (P = 0.13), which seems to be counterintuitive ( Fig. 1) .",

In fact, between 2013 and 2017 only 13% of PDs were identified and notified to the organ donation units [5] . It is possible that this lack of process control, even before the pandemic, may have caused the event of identifying a PD to become very sporadic or random. This leads us to believe that there is no real competition between PDs and ill COVID-19 patients for ICU beds because the actual number of identified PDs is so small that even with a really high ICU bed occupancy because of COVID-19 prioritization, a bed could be available for PDs. Another hypothesis would be that the National Donation and Transplantation Coordination efforts on augmenting organ donation are, finally, giving results. It could also be because of a combination of both factors: an increase in the personal motivation and confidence of the local organ donation teams that, combined with the increase in the number of critical beds, caused the observed effect; the former of which would be similar to the personal protective equipment described by Chang.",
