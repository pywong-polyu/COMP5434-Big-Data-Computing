Despite the severity of oral diseases during pregnancy, the demand for dental care during the gestational period is low, which may improve with the participation of midwives in promoting oral health activities. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Spanish midwives and midwifery students regarding oral health in pregnant women; and (ii) to identify the barriers faced by these healthcare professionals in addressing oral health promotion during pregnancy. An observational cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. A total of 128 midwives and/or midwifery students \u2265 18 years old and of both sexes were invited to self-complete a questionnaire between January and April 2020. A total of 85 people participated in the study. Participants had a regular level of knowledge about oral health during pregnancy (overall knowledge score: 6.53), and although they were interested in activities that promote oral healthcare, their oral healthcare practices during pregnancy were limited. As midwives play an important role in promoting health, their training in oral healthcare could help to improve pregnant women's oral health.",

In general, participants had a positive attitude toward activities promoting oral health during pregnancy (Items 26-34, 36, 39, and 43-45) . Importantly, the most negative attitudes were observed when they were asked about if they though that conducting a dental assessment in pregnant women was outside the routine practices of midwives (Item 35). This answer could have been influenced by the lack of skills to provide advice (Item 37) or to perform dental assessments (Item 38) on pregnant women. The answers were grouped into three categories: agree (strongly agree and agree), neutral, and disagree (strongly disagree and disagree).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the views of Spanish midwives and midwifery students toward maternal oral health and their role in providing oral health education, assessment, and referrals as part of antenatal care. Due to the need to determine provider knowledge and attitudes prior to the planning of educational strategies for the prevention of oral diseases during pregnancy, the results of this study will be of considerable interest due to the important role played by midwives in neonatal care.",

For this reason, during the prenatal period, emergency dental care as well as routine dental care and regular dental checkups are indicated [6] . In general, most of the participants in the current study were aware of the oral manifestations associated with pregnancy (Item 17), and of the fact that pregnancy can exacerbate preexisting dental problems (Item 15), and that it is recommended for the expectant mother to receive preventive dental care (Item 14) and emergency and routine dental care (Items 23 and 25) during pregnancy. This knowledge explains the high percentage of midwives and midwifery students who advised expectant mothers not to delay or postpone their dental appointments until after delivery (Item 50). However, despite more than 80% of the participants indicating that they knew about the relationship between the mother's and baby's oral health (Item 13), their knowledge about the association between periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes was limited (Item 20). In this sense, other studies that were conducted not only with midwives [22, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] but also with other antenatal care providers, such as general practitioners [22, 24, 31, 32] , nurses [22, 25] , and gynecologists/obstetricians [24, 27, 30, 33] , have highlighted that they have insufficient knowledge about oral health and its influence on systemic health, despite the incorporation of oral health into health-promoting strategies and practices [34] ; moreover, this is highly recommended [35, 36] . The high level of specialization required by healthcare professionals together with a population-versus an individual-focused health delivery system have contributed to the separation between oral and general healthcare [37] .",

Furthermore, education about oral health during pregnancy not only improves lifelong oral hygiene and the oral health behaviors of mothers, but it also benefits their children's overall oral health (for example, reducing the risk of developing early dental decay) [39, 40] . However, despite this evidence, in Spain, as in other countries [41] [42] [43] , the dental attendance of pregnant women is low, which has been attributed to multiple barriers [13, 15, 28, 44, 45] , which were identified by participants in the current study (Items 54-64). Even though the approach to these barriers via the implementation of strategies of oral health promotion have contributed to improving the dental attendance of pregnant women [46, 47] , in Spain, unlike in other developed countries (for example, Australia) [48, 49] , the issue of maternal oral health during pregnancy continues to be a poorly assessed and treated aspect, which is almost exclusively managed by dentists, with minimum or zero participation from other healthcare professionals [8, 10] . This could be due to the expert panels in charge of the development of Spanish clinical practice guidelines and clinical protocols intended for the attention to pregnant women by midwives being composed of gynecologists, obstetricians, pediatricians, general practitioners, psychiatrists, nurses, and midwives [10, 50] . Thus, as non-dental professionals do not have a deep knowledge of oral healthcare ( [22, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [31] [32] [33] 41] , and the results of the present study), there is an urgent need for the participation of professionals in the field of odontology in their development.",

Among the three professional profiles to which we previously referred, midwives are the preferred health professionals to deliver strategies on oral health promotion because they have close contact with women, which allows them to break down barriers, dispel myths about the dangers of dental care during pregnancy, and raise awareness about the importance of oral health from before pregnancy up until the postpartum period. Likewise, they have the opportunity to implement early interventions, and to reevaluate if pregnant women have addressed their dental care needs or if they have implemented correct oral hygiene habits in subsequent follow-up visits during pregnancy [44, [52] [53] [54] . Expectant women seek more dental care when the midwife advises them to do so [55] , and women approve of midwives providing oral health education and screening, as well as dental referrals during antenatal and postnatal visits [38, 45, 55] . Nevertheless, in Spain, the participation of midwives in activities that promote oral health is limited, as demonstrated by the results of this study (Items 46-53). Regarding the latter, despite the only practice in oral healthcare that must be carried out by midwives according to the current monitoring protocols during pregnancy is informing women about the importance of good oral hygiene [50] , only approximately 25% were interested in the oral hygiene procedures carried out by pregnant women (Item 48). This could be due to the participants believing that they did not have the skills to provide advice to pregnant women about oral healthcare (Item 37), as oral health education is not integrated into the actual undergraduate midwifery curriculum.",

The sample size was small, limiting the generalization of the results; however, the Midwives' Teaching Unit of Galicia only has 32 students per year, with the demographic characteristics adequately represented in the sample. Although further research at a national level is required to identify whether the study findings are similar in all Spanish Autonomous Communities, it is hoped that this will be the case, as the curricula for a bachelor of midwifery degree are similar across Spain, as they are regulated by the Department of Health. The results of this study may lay the foundations for the design of a training program for midwives, whose pilot phase will begin in Galicia in the academic year of 2021-2022. The health emergency caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has hindered the distribution of the questionnaire in person, which would have had a negative impact on the participation rate. Third, as participants filled in the questionnaires themselves, there may be some self-report bias. Fourth, the results of the current study may not be extrapolated to midwives who work in the private sector, as they only represented around 10% of the sample. However, this finding is a reflection of the situation in our country, where the majority of the pregnant women attend public health services.",
