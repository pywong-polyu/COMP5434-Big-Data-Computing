Methods: The descriptive-interpretive lens of phenomenology was employed to explore and illuminate the isolation experience of critically ill Muslim patients). Semi-structured, face-toface, audiotaped interviews were conducted . Colaizzi's method of data analysis, in combination with an interpretive analysis supported by van Manen's \"lifeworld constituents\" were used. Results: Data analysis revealed four themes: Feeling isolated and imprisoned; losing basic patients' rights; feeling rejected by healthcare providers; and accepting isolation and its adversity. Findings were illuminated by applying van Manen's lifeworld constituents: spatiality, temporality, relationality and corporeality. The patients described the overwhelming impact of isolation on their physical, emotional, social and spiritual health.",

In addition to the emotional and psychological impact of isolation, studies have found that patients requiring contact isolation precautions were eight times more likely to fall out of bed, develop pressure injuries, and suffer fluid and electrolyte imbalance when compared to patients not under isolation precautions (Gould et al., 2018; Stelfox et al., 2003) . Researchers also found that healthcare providers spend less time in providing direct patient care to patients in isolation than with patients in non-isolation areas; this led to lower satisfaction rates with care (Dashiell-Earp et al., 2014; Shaban et al., 2020) .",

This sense of imprisonment within the lived space of isolation disrupted the individuals' normal life and suspended their daily routines. They experienced both sociological and psychological impacts, feeling entrapped in space, time, and absent of the comfort of family and loved ones. These conditions created feelings of loneliness and consequently fear of dying alone.

In this study, the inner time consciousness among critically ill patients in isolation settings differed from external real time; they had different perceptions of time passing due to the lack of options they had for spending that time. Consequently, a \"new\" meaning of time or perception of time was prominent and was described as lingering and meaningless.

Confinement to an isolation environment limits and alters patients' social relationships and interactions with their families and loved ones while creating new stressful relationships and interactions with healthcare providers. These findings are congruent with Barret and colleagues' results, which showed that the restrictions in isolation settings reduced patients' opportunities for socializing and interacting with others (Barratt et al., 2010) . In this study, patients in isolation settings clearly described their unmet needs and expectations. They identified three areas wherein healthcare providers failed to relate or act effectively: inadequate provision of information, inadequacy of physical care, and impaired interactions revealing lack of respect. Inadequacy of provision of information created a loss of trust in the source of information, escalation of fears and anxiety as they imagined all sorts of unpredictable news. These findings are consistent with the study of Guilley et al.

The people of Jordan are a collectivist society having two essential elements in their lives: religion and family. In the isolation setting, these patients repeatedly expressed the acuteness of the loss of both elements; they were painfully anxious about losing contact with their family and distraught at losing all material elements necessary for their practices of spirituality.",

Muslims believe that suffering and enduring illness is a way of testing one's level of faith and religious commitment; endurance of illness is purifying, and it is rewarded by an everlasting life and access to paradise and God's blessing (Imam Nawawi, 1987; Othman et al., 2020) . Muslims believe that God, in His infinite wisdom, has given them clear guidelines about how to deal with their illness to make it bearable with its afflictions and even to be grateful to Him to pass this examination of endurance. Reading the Holy Qur'an's words of remembrance and supplication, and a daily five-times prayers are perceived to be the most powerful tranquillity behaviours exercised during this stressful period.

Acceptance also supports the positive relationship between patients having trust in their healthcare providers and the subsequent active role in the treatment plan (Uchmanowicz et al., 2016) . In their struggle to accept or cope with the adversity of isolation, patients in this study justified strict rules and regulations and healthcare providers' distressing interactions as an element reassuring their safety. This finding is congruent with Gasink et al.'s (2008) study that found that 94.9% of the patients who were under contact precautions accepted their isolation status, and felt that the imposed precautions were instituted for their protection and the safety of others. The acceptance of the illness and associated precautions and restrictions can be interpreted as a subconscious resolution that enabled patients to survive the severity of the isolation experience with all its challenges. Reaching the stage of full acceptance of the illness was not an easy attainment, and the time required to achieve that probably varies with individual patient's tolerance, adaptability and resources.",
