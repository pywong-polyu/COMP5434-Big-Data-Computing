The quickSOFA (qSOFA) has emerged as a bedside clinical score to clinically categorize a septic patient. In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection are likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the qSOFA criteria: respiratory rate \u2265 22/min, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure \u2264 100 mmHg [1] . This definition has been subsequently validated in the emergency department for patients with suspected infection: for qSOFA \u2264 1 the mortality rate was 3% (95% CI 2-5%) vs 24% (95% CI 18-30%) for patients with a qSOFA \u2265 2 [2] . The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a game changer. Mass ICU care and ventilatory support are needed to treat patients with Covid-19. Prompt and accurate clinical identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients at risk to have poor outcomes is an utmost priority. The aim of the study was to examine if the 2-point qSOFA threshold is an appropriate bedside clinical score for Covid-19 patients.",

We recorded anonymized demographic data, information on clinical symptoms or signs at presentation at emergency department, and laboratory and radiologic results during ICU admission (performed at the discretion of the treating physician). The qSOFA was calculated based on its 3 components at their worst level before ICU admission. The reuse of already recorded and anonymized data falls within the scope of the French Reference Methodology MR-005 (2016-41 law) which require neither information nor non-opposition of the included individuals.

Patients who received mechanical ventilation did not seem to have a different qSOFA than patients without ventilator support.

Consequently, the previous 3% mortality rate observed in patients with suspected infection and a qSOFA score \u2264 1 is unlikely to be exact in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients [1] .
