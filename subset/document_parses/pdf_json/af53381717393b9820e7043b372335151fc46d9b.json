Family clusters were most frequent, with 18 clusters (62.07%) involving 62 cases (62.63%), followed by social clusters, with 3 clusters (10.34%).

There was a statistically significant difference in the infectivity of the imported clusters versus the local clusters, with imported clusters being lower (Z = -2.851, P = .004). The infectivity of all cases or family members was highest in Haikou and lowest in Sanya.

[2] The uncertainty and unpredictability of this new and highly infectious disease led to the inability to make timely decisions regarding specific preventive and control measures, which seriously affected social stability and economic development worldwide. [3, 4] Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be a global public health emergency. [5] To control the spread of COVID-19, the Hainan province of China launched a first-level response to this major public health emergency on January 25, 2020. Previous research has reported many clusters of COVID-19, [6, 7] but the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 clusters in Hainan are still unknown.

The first confirmed time for a disease cluster was on January 23, 2020, and 68.97% of the clusters occurred between January 31 and February 7, 2020, peaking on February 6, with the last confirmed cluster on February 17, 2020. The first occurrence time for the imported clusters was earlier than that of the local clusters, while the last end time of the local clusters was later than that of the import clusters. The occurrence of local clusters had a lag time, since most of the local clusters were caused by the imported cases, who had gone to Hainan before the Spring Festival of China, and 85.86% of the cases went to Hainan between January 16 and January 25, 2020.

[13] There were statistically significant (P < .05) differences in both exposure period and confirmed period after onset between import and local clusters.

Most studies use basic reproduction number (R 0 ) to calculate infectivity, but the disease cluster factors were not considered.
