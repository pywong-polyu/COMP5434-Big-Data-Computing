According to the Humanitarian Data Exchange website (HDX 2020), on January 22, 2020 there were 557 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 29 different countries. On the same date, the global number of reported COVID-19 victims has reached 17, all of them from the Hubei province in China. Due to the extensive international travel, the virus has spread quickly around the world, exceeding one million cases in 254 countries and territories by the end of March 2020 and 100,000 deaths 8 days later. The continuous response of national and regional authorities to the pandemic varied significantly from the near-absolute closure of international borders (e.g., Australia and New Zealand) and repeated lockdowns (e.g., New York City and Israel) to focusing on the protection of high-risk population only (e.g., Sweden).

However, in many cases, another, often a deadlier \"wave\" took place some time later. Starting from December 2020, many countries, in the hope of \"winning the pandemic\", have launched massive vaccination campaigns, which continue at the time of writing this article. By the end of July 2021, 1.14 billion people (14.6% of the world population) were fully vaccinated, while the global number of confirmed COVID-19 cases approached 200 million with about 4.2 million victims in 251 different countries and territories.",

            "text": "In a completely susceptible population, the effective reproduction number R e f f equals to the basic reproduction number R 0 , defined as the average number of secondary infections an infected person will cause in an \"immunologically naive\" population before he or she is effectively removed from that population as a result of recovery, hospitalization, quarantine, etc. (Maier and Brockmann 2020) . The population is expected to reach \"herd immunity\" when the proportion of non-susceptible (\"immunologically experienced\") individuals exceeds 1 \u2212 1/R 0 (Kadkhoda 2021) . A direct measurement of R 0 requires identifying the exact source of each infection case, which is rarely possible. However, the basic reproduction number can be estimated from the epidemiological data using a mathematical model such as SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) (Anderson and May 1992) . The authors of (Linka et al. 2020 ) used the SEIR model and the reported COVID-19 cases in each one of the 27 the European Union countries for projecting the effective reproduction number R(t) and predicting the epidemic evolution from May 10 to June 20, 2020. They evaluated three possible scenarios for their prediction period: a constant value of the effective reproduction number R(t), a slow return to the basic reproduction number R 0 within three months, and a fast return to R 0 within one month. Their study shows that the severe mobility restrictions on air travel, driving, walking and transit, which were implemented across Europe during March -May 2020, were highly correlated with R 0 in most countries, resulting in a drastic reduction of the population weighted mean of the basic reproduction number from 4.22 (CI 2.53 \u2212 5.91) to 0.67 (CI 0.49 \u2212 0.85). The study did not explore additional factors, which could contribute to the R 0 decrease during the same period, such as public health measures, a reduced amount of social interaction (also known as \"social distancing\"), and natural immunity acquired by the recovered individuals.",

We have shown that some intervention measures taken by the Israeli government, such as mandating mask-wearing in public (April 1) and Passover lockdown (April 7) were actually introduced after the value of R 0 (t) has already decreased from its starting level of 1.20 to less than the critical level of 1.0, a trend which continued for the succeeding weeks despite a fast relaxation of most restrictions enforced in March and April. After reaching an extremely low level of 0.30 around May 17 and shortly after reopening of all schools in the country (which stayed open until the end of the school year on June 20), the basic reproduction number in the Israeli population started another continuous climb as part of the COVID-19 \"second wave\". However, we could not reveal in (Last 2020) a consistent effect of any specific measures on the actual infection rate dynamics. A systematic review of 108 R 0 estimates reported in 45 articles published between January 1 and August 31, 2020 is presented by (Ahammed et al. 2021) . The pooled value of R 0 was found to be 2.69 (CI 2.40, 2.98), with statistically insignificant differences between Asian, European, and North-American countries. The review found only a few studies covering Africa and South America. The authors indicate that in the initial stages of a new epidemic, the calculated R 0 values may be overestimated due to insufficient amount of available data. They also explored 158 estimates of CFR presented in 34 articles. The pooled value of the CFR was 2.67% (2.25%, 3.13%), with higher mean CFR values observed for the countries with lower tests (3.15% vs 2.16%) and greater median population age (3.13% vs 2.27%).",

According to the mathematical model of COVID-19 presented in (Ahmed et al. 2021 ), a stable endemic equilibrium is maintained as long as the basic reproduction number R 0 is greater than 1. In contrast, a stable diseasefree equilibrium is achieved only when R 0 < 1. Though we do not have a direct way of estimating the current value of R 0 in each country, we may assume it to be close to the most recent peak in the effective reproduction number R. Considering the mean difference of 0.50 between the average and the maximum country-level values of R during our period of interest (February -July 2021), we should be able to reach a stable disease-free equilibrium of COVID-19 only after the average R will go globally below 1.0 \u2212 0.5 = 0.5.

The requirement of R = 0.5 implies Cases_per_100 = 0.5483/0.0079 = 69%, which is much higher than any country's current exposure to the virus of less than 20% and thus cannot be achieved globally in the foreseeable future. Moreover, reaching this level of natural herd immunity would require a prohibitively high cost in terms of human life. We may use an alternative regression model R = 1.023116 \u2212 0.001026Averageo f people_ f ully_vaccinated_per h undred to estimate the potential effect of vaccination percentage on R. However, this model indicates that even vaccinating the entire population would result in an average R of only 1.023116 \u2212 0.1026 = 0.92, much higher than the minimal estimated level for stopping the epidemic (R = 0.5). Thus, unfortunately, both models, which are based on the data available at the end of July 2021, suggest that the endemic equilibrium of COVID-19 will maintain its stability as long as there will be no \"game changer\" in the form of either a vaccine more effective against infection or a less infectious mutant. We may also estimate the average percentage of fully vaccinated population, which should bring the CFR close to the level of a seasonal flu (about 0.1%). According to the regression model shown in Figure 9 , CFR = 0.0275 \u2212 0.0005Averageo f people f ully v accinated p er h undred. Setting CFR to 0.001 implies Averageo f people f ully v accinated p er h undred = (0.0275 \u2212 0.001)/0.0005 = 53%, which is clearly a feasible number, already exceeded in several countries (Ritchie et al. 2020) .

We also investigate the long-term statistical dependence of the COVID-19 Reproduction Number and the Case Fatality Rate on epidemiological, demographic, economic, immunization, and government policy factors in each country. The findings of this study may have important implications for the health authorities worldwide in considering their vaccination policies, nonpharmaceutical intervention measures, and resource allocation decisions. This retrospective study suffers from several limitations. First, the officially reported numbers of daily COVID-19 confirmed cases depend on the local testing policy and usually underestimate the true number of carriers in the population. As daily virus testing of the entire population is not possible, this reporting rate is usually unknown. Second, the officially reported numbers of daily COVID-19 deaths in some countries may include all deceased individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (people who \"died with coronavirus\"), disregarding their actual cause of death, and exclude some victims (people who \"died from coronavirus\"), because they were not tested for COVID-19 before their death. The reported numbers depend on the time-changing policy of each country, which is not always made explicit to the public. Last but not least, the future dynamics of COVID-19 depends on the unknown characteristics of new mutants, short and long term efficacy of currently developed vaccines, government decisions, public behavior, and other uncertainty factors. Drastic changes in some of these factors may render the models based on the past data completely useless.",

On the other hand, the average percentage of fully vaccinated population, which appears to be the only statistically significant factor associated with country-specific CFR, can bring it close to the level of a seasonal flu (about 0.1%) after vaccinating more than a half of a country's population. Thus, while the currently available vaccines prove to be effective in reducing mortality from the existing COVID-19 variants, they are unlikely to stop the spread of the virus in the foreseeable future. It is also noteworthy that the performed data analysis revealed no statistically significant effects of government measures restricting the people's behavior (such as lockdowns) on either R, nor the CFR.
