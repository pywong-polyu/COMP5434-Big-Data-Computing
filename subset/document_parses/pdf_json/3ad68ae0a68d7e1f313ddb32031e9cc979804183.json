In particular, small-scale chicken raising is practiced by most rural households throughout developing countries for several reasons [2] . First, chickens lay eggs at the age of 6 months and are raised on short cycles. Second, chicken production systems require low levels of input and are efficient at converting feed into high-quality animal-source food [3] . Third, income generated from chicken raising is more stable and steadier than income from larger livestock [4] . Fourth, the fact that chickens are smaller and of lower value livestock makes them suitable livelihood options for vulnerable groups in the population who have few other options, particularly women and the poor [5] . Consequently, the potential contribution of poultry production systems, especially chicken systems, towards achieving the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been increasingly recognized by scholars and the development community [6, 7] .",

As noted by Hobbs et al. [10] , these containment measures have substantially affected the flow of agricultural commodities from producers to consumers and put food supply chains under the risk of disruption. In the same context, Hafez and Attia [11] revealed that the pandemic has disrupted many activities along poultry supply chains and posed unprecedented challenges to small poultry producers. There is growing evidence suggesting that the impact of the pandemic on poultry and other livestock supply chains threatens to worsen the livelihoods and food security status of poor and rural households in developing countries [12, 13] .",

            "text": "Unlike previous major disease outbreaks in recent decades (e.g., SARS, H7N9, Ebola, and Zika), the turbulence caused by COVID-19 mainly affected the downstream stages of the food supply chain [14, 15] . That is, COVID-19 has not directly affected the production stages of the poultry supply chain [16] ; however, disruptions in the downstream stages, such as transport and logistics as well as demand and consumption, have knock-back effects on producers [17, 18] . For example, the RBN [19] found that COVID-19 restrictions adversely affected the ability of poultry producers in East African countries to access feed, water resources, and other production inputs and showed that exporters in these countries face significant reductions in demand for livestock-source foods in major importing markets. In Ethiopia, the spread of the virus decreased the demand for livestock-source foods due to mobility restrictions and the fear of consumers that fresh products may be contaminated with the virus [20, 21] . Likewise, Lu et al. [22] showed that COVID-19 caused a shortage in farm labor on Indian farms due to restrictions on movement. In this context, small-scale poultry producers, in particular, struggled with several COVID-19 challenges, including disruptions in supply chains, a shortage of labor, and the malfunctioning of livestock markets, as well as price volatility and changes in consumer purchasing behavior [23, 24] . Abu Hatab et al. [25] identified three major causes of the negative effects of the pandemic on small-scale poultry producers as compared to larger producers. First, small-scale producers and firms in these countries rely more heavily on labor than on machinery, and, thus, their poultry production has been especially compromised by containment measures and lockdowns. Second, small-scale producers in developing countries have limited logistical and financial capacity to implement hygiene measures, which, in turn, increases their vulnerability to COVID-19 effects. Third, the majority of small-scale agrifood-producing farms, including poultry farms, operate informally and, therefore, are excluded from the stimulus plans that governments have offered to private businesses [25] .",

Specifically, a critical look into this emerging literature reveals three major shortcomings. First, the bulk of the literature is focused on developed countries, whereas there is still a lack of research based on the experiences of poultry producers in developing countries [18] . Second, most of the evidence is extremely aggregated and dominated by continental and regional-level studies and sector-level analyses, e.g., [28, 29] . This neglects the fact that poultry systems in developing countries are heterogeneous and that their challenges in relation to the impact of COVID-19 vary according to geography, the influence of institutional frameworks, and the socioeconomic conditions in which they are located. Third, the literature is dominated by qualitative studies, e.g., [30] , which tend to explore and describe the dynamics of COVID-19 and its effects on livestock chains in different contexts rather than measuring the extent of these effects.",

Drawing on a survey of 205 small-scale commercial broiler farms (SCBFs) in Egypt, we first investigated the pathways through which the effects of the pandemic were transmitted to the SCBFs surveyed, and then we examined the determinants of the SCBFs' perception of these effects. Our empirical analysis offers important insights into how COVID-19 has affected small-scale poultry producers in developing countries and how these producers can cope with the consequences of these effects. First, small producers still dominate poultry supply chains in developing countries; poultry systems represent a significant source of employment and contribute to household livelihood, food security, and nutrition. This implies that the negative effects of the pandemic may have substantial implications for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in these countries [31] . Second, the projections that the occurrence of pandemics and disease outbreaks will be more frequent in the future [32] entail the necessity to understand the impact of the current pandemic on small-scale poultry farms in order to build up their preparedness, adaptation capacity, and resilience. Therefore, although this study is only limited to a single country (Egypt) and the empirical results are context-specific, there are potential lessons to be shared across developing countries with similar structures of broiler production systems. In particular, future research undertakings should expand this analysis to other contexts in developing countries to understand the channels through which the pandemic has affected small broiler producers and develop relevant and effective interventions to mitigate these effects.",

Of the country's total broiler production, industrial and smallscale commercial systems supply around 90%, while household backyard poultry farms in rural areas and small towns supply the remaining 10%. According to statistics from the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MALR), small-scale commercial systems represent around 70% of all poultry-producing farms in Egypt, almost 10% of the total value of agricultural production, and close to 25% of the total value of livestock production [35, 36] . In this study, we focus on SCBFs, which produce less than 15,000 broilers per cycle [37] . Typically, SCBFs in Egypt are further subdivided based on the level of technology and the volume of production into farm-based and household-based systems. Most of SCBFs are simple units that produce between 4 and 5 cycles per year, with one shed of an average capacity of 5000 birds per cycle. Some farm-based broiler systems can have up to four sheds and a production capacity of 7 cycles per year, whereas household-based commercial broiler activities take place on the rooftops of rural houses, with significantly smaller numbers of birds and production cycles per year [35, 38] .",

In addition, consumer demand experienced dramatic declines due to public misperceptions linking poultry products to the transmission of COVID-19. As many SCBFs lack access to formal market channels, the closure of informal rural markets across the country led to a loss of income and market access. Furthermore, movement restrictions and blockages of transport routes during the pandemic were particularly obstructive for SCBFs because these measures disrupted access to production inputs (e.g., improved breeds, concentrate feeds, medicine, and vaccines), delivery, and marketing and, hence, led to the accumulation of production on the farms, leaving many SCBFs unable to sell their products [39] . Although the Egyptian government reacted to the economic impact of COVID-19 on small businesses by enacting fiscal and financial measures to alleviate liquidity constraints and facilitate continued production, many small businesses, including SCBFs, were excluded from these schemes due to a lack of official data about their activities [25] . In recognition of the role that SCBFs play in protein supply, as well as their significant contributions to employment, livelihoods, and food security, it is therefore important to understand the current impact of the pandemic on them in order to develop appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies and build resilience to future pandemics.",

In the first step, a polychoric principal component analysis (polychoric PCA) [43, 44] was conducted to reduce the number of variables/items included in the survey into a few interpretable combinations that capture the various effects of the pandemic on the farms surveyed. While the data in this study were categorical in nature, i.e., derived using the Likert rating scale, the literature suggests that standard principal component analysis (PCA) does not generate meaningful results on ordinal data [45] . Using polychoric correlations when ordinal data are used or in the presence of strong kurtosis or skewness is recommended, which is often the case of Likert items [46] . As noted by Gannon and Roberts [47] , polychoric PCA generates consistent estimates of the proportion of explained variance; however, it is computationally intensive. Therefore, we used polychoric PCA, as suggested by Kolenikov and Angeles [44] , which relies on polychoric and polyserial correlations that are estimated with maximum likelihood, with the assumption that there are latent normally distributed variables that underlie the ordinal categorical data. The polychoric correlations were estimated using the polychoricpca command in Stata 15, developed by Kolenikov and Angeles [43] . Similar to the standard PCA, the outcomes of a polychoric PCA reduce the input variables to principal components (PCs), which are of a magnitude less than the original dataset but preserve most of the information. Each component resulting from a polychoric PCA corresponds to a particular principal component that represents the underlying variables where there is most variance in the data. Thus, with the data grouped into components, examining these few new variables may develop a deeper understanding of the underlying causes that have led to the various effects of COVID-19, as perceived by the SCBFs surveyed. The identification of the number of components was based on the eigenvalue estimates generated from the Varimax-rotated factor analysis, where components with eigenvalues greater than unity were selected. The suitability of the data was assessed by computing the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measurement of sampling adequacy and the Bartlett test of sphericity.",

Given the structure of the dataset and the categorical nature of the variables, an ordered-response model appeared to be the most appropriate approach [48] . When the order of response value is considered, the commonlyused model is an ordered logit model (OLM) regression [49] . The OLM combines the independent variables in order to estimate the probability that a particular event will occur, in this case, the probability that an SCBF would be affected by one of the dimensions of the pandemic-induced impact. More specifically, each of the principal components was used as a dependent variable in an OLM framework to examine the role of specified SCBF characteristics on the probability that the SCBFs were affected by each dimension of COVID-19 impact. More details on the use and application of OLMs can be found in McKelvey and Zavoina [50] and McCullagh [48] .

Thus, an OR of 1 indicates that the effect under study is equally likely in both categories. An OR greater than 1 indicates that the effect of the pandemic is more likely in a comparison category than the reference category.",

A follow-up question was asked to understand the extent to which the pandemic containment measures affected their production and operation costs and farm profitability in the first half of 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019. As shown in Figure 2 , about 68% of farms witnessed increases in the total cost of production and operation during the first six months of 2020, ranging from 20% (about 57% of the sample) to more than 40% (about 3% of the sample) compared to the corresponding period in 2019. In contrast, about 7% of the farms indicated that their total costs decreased or remained unchanged (about 25%) over the same period. 2 also indicates that changes in SCBFs' costs of production between 2019 and 2020 had significant implications for farm profitability as nearly three-quarters of them indicated that their profitability had been reduced by a percentage of 20% (55% of the sample) to more than 40% (about 6% of the sample). The remaining quarter of SCBFs surveyed consisted of farms that witnessed no change in their profitability from broiler farming activities (17% of the sample) and those that had achieved higher profitability (only 7% of the sample).

Responses revealed that 83 farms (about 41% of the sample) had been forced to close temporarily due to sluggish demand, falling prices, or to prevent the spread of the virus, causing unforeseen sales and staffing problems. A subsequent question concerning the number of weeks it took for them to reopen was asked of the farms that had shut down during the pandemic. Nearly 30% of the farms stated that they reopened within 1 to 4 weeks, with 37% reopening within periods ranging from 4 to 8 weeks. The remaining 27% resumed their broiler farming activities after relatively longer periods, ranging from 8 to 12 weeks or longer. With regard to respondents' perception of when the broiler farming business would return to normal, around 10% of respondents estimated this period at 1-3 months, 16% at 3-6 months, 15% at 6-9 months, and 13% at 9-12 months (Figure 3 ). Another 12% of the surveyed farms were more pessimistic, believing that the poultry markets will take longer than a year to return to normal. Figure 3 also reveals that 36% of the SCBFs surveyed were uncertain and unable to make an assessment, which may be attributed to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic presented unpreceded risks to the surveyed farms, making it hard for many of them to assess the trends and developments of the pandemic and its likely effects on broiler farming and poultry markets.

More so, a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on Egyptian SMEs [40] revealed that 3% of the enterprises (n = 283) permanently ceased business activities, around half of them stopped temporarily, and close to two-thirds faced a projected 24% to 50% increase in operating costs and up to a 39% decrease in revenue.",

The farms studied illustrated that the pandemic had substantial effects on their human resources as their employees were unable to commute to work, which resulted in high rates of worker absenteeism. Worker productivity was adversely affected by the reduction in the number of working days, the reduced working hours, and worker absenteeism due to the fear of being infected [30] . Furthermore, several farms indicated that they had to lay off a number of workers during the peak period of the pandemic and, accordingly, lost skilled labor because of the scaling down of production activities and their inability to pay wages. A number of reports have shown that the pandemic created profound challenges for farm labor in Egypt, e.g., [57, 58] , which may be explained by the fact that SCBFs in developing countries rely more heavily on human labor than on machinery for their business operations [22] . Thus, the continuity of SCBFs' activities was compromised by restrictions on human mobility and other containment measures [25] . The fourth category, labeled \"market demand and sales\", had a scale reliability coefficient of 0.715. Price volatility and market fluctuations were the major effects in this category, together with market access issues and difficulty in supplying products to local markets. Furthermore, this category includes effects related to falling demand by the food service industry, which includes restaurants and other types of prepared-food retailers who consume poultry products. These findings are in concert with the findings of Cowling et al. [59] , who showed that SMEs are very vulnerable to unexpected events that significantly decrease household consumption and reduce the market demand, sales, and revenue of these enterprises. Similarly, the closure of schools, universities, and restaurants during the pandemic, together with the night-time curfew and other restrictions on human mobility as well as the loss of income in several segments of the population due to layoffs, reduced consumer purchasing power and the demand for poultry products [30, 54] .",

            "text": "The fifth category, labeled \"farm finances\", with a scale reliability coefficient of 0.619, contains effects related to financial flows and access to credit. Because of the measures taken by the government to control the spread of COVID-19, several farms reported that their farm businesses were seriously impacted financially. As a result, these farms reported difficulties in paying rent and loans. Furthermore, the pandemic complicated their access to capital and financial services, and many of them had to seek new loans to be able to cover their operational costs. In their quest to obtain credit, SCBFs encountered two challenges, namely, the rising interest rates, which may hamper their ability to make repayments, and the reluctance of many financial institutions to provide loans to small businesses during the pandemic. This finding is in accord with the findings of La Rocca et al. [60] , indicating that unexpected events amplify the financial challenges that small businesses generally face in normal times and leave them with little cash flow to cover recurrent expenses, including wages, bank interest on loans, and rent of premises. In this respect, Fan et al. [61] and Hafez and Attia [11] revealed that the pandemic has worsened the economics of poultry farming and that most small-scale producers are on the brink of bankruptcy, experiencing capital shortages and fearing that they will not be able to continue their work due to interruptions in the livestock supply chain. In terms of the personal characteristics of SCBF operators, the results in Table 5 reveal that compared to their male counterparts, female-led SCBFs were about 2.21, 1.88, and 1.49 times more likely to perceive COVID-19 impacts related to production and operational costs, farm finances, and availability of production inputs, respectively. This finding that female-led SCBFs perceived more financial challenges is in keeping with extensive and still growing literature showing that small enterprises run by women encounter significant financial obstacles (e.g., lack of access to credit and financial services) that impede female entrepreneurship and prevent women from participating in agricultural and livestock supply chains in developing countries [62, 63] . Studies that examined gender differences in access to financial services in developing countries have found that women possess lower financial literacy than men [64] and that women-led enterprises encounter greater financial obstacles and are more likely to rely on informal financing (see [65, 66] ). Furthermore, the results in Table 5 show that female-run SCBFs are more likely to perceive COVID-19 impacts in relation to the availability of production inputs and costs of production and operation. In this respect, the ILO [67] has shown that Egyptian women entrepreneurs not only face greater financial constraints but also face significant production and operational costs that reduce their competitiveness and growth opportunities. Raghuvanshi et al. [68] and Kathuku [69] identified a number of barriers that increase production and operational costs in female-run enterprises in developing countries, including the smaller scale of their business operations, their lack of membership of agribusiness organizations and networks, their lack of access to information on inputs and markets, and their lack of business contacts and networks.",

This finding is consistent with prior research that suggests that entrepreneurs with higher levels of education and training have greater capability to adapt their enterprise to changes in the business environment and that technical and managerial skills enable small businesses to manage and recover from external business shocks [70, 71] . In the same vein, the results indicate that the experience of SCBF operators in broiler farming (number of years in Table 5 ) tends to be associated with less COVID-19 impact. In particular, SCBFs operated by managers with experience of between 5 and 10 years or more than 15 years in broiler farming were 0.91 and 0.72 times less likely than those with experience of less than 5 years in the business to perceive COVID-19 impacts on labor and human resources. Moreover, firms operated by managers with experience between 5 and 10 years were significantly less likely than those with less than 5 years' experience to perceive impacts on costs of production and operation, labor and human resources, and sales and consumer demand. This finding is consistent with findings of prior research on small business perceptions of the impact of nature-induced and socioeconomic risks, where managerial experience is a significant determinant of risk perception and positively associated with risk management decisions [72, 73] .",

That is, rented farms were significantly more likely to perceive impact related to farm finances (OR = 3.08), sales and consumer demand (OR = 1.97), production and operational cost (OR = 1.72), and difficulties in sourcing production inputs (OR = 1.46). Likewise, the results revealed that collectively owned farms (shared) were more likely than individually-owned SCBFs to perceive COVID-19 impacts related to sourcing production inputs (OR = 7.13) and labor and human resources (OR = 2.46). In this respect, Mishra et al. [74] illustrated that the type of business organization may have an impact on the financial performance of farms. Moreover, Abd El-Hamed et al. [75] illustrated that the better performance of individually owned poultry farms in Egypt may be attributed to the fact that these farms manage resources efficiently and have much simpler and more direct decision-making processes compared to other forms of farm ownership. Furthermore, individuals running this type of farm have an incentive to perform well as the returns accrue directly to them. With regard to broiler production systems, the results indicated that farm-based systems were 2.38 and 2.34 times more likely than householdbased systems to perceive COVID-19 impacts on labor and human resources and on the availability of production inputs. On the contrary, household-based systems were found to be significantly less likely than farm-based systems to perceive the impact related to farm production and operational costs. This could be attributed to the characteristics of farms belonging to this category, including their relatively smaller size, their reliance on family labor, and selling directly to consumers without incurring transport costs [33, 76] .",

            "text": "Concerning SCBF labor, the results revealed that compared to SCBFs employing less than 5 permanent workers, farms employing between 6 and less than 10 permanent workers were 1.94, 1.67, and 1.43 times more likely to perceive COVID-19 impacts related to the farm's labor and human resources, farm finances, and production and operational costs, respectively. The results related to temporary workers further confirm this finding, where SCBFs hiring between 6 and 10 temporary workers were more likely to perceive COVID-19 impacts related to production and operational costs and human resources. These findings are expected, given that the categories of \"operational cost\" and \"labor and human resources\" of COVID-19 impact consist mainly of components related to SCBF labor, such as the increased cost of wages, the layoff of workers and loss of skilled labor, and high rates of worker absenteeism (see Table 4 ). Furthermore, these findings support those of Hashem et al. [17] , which pointed out that livestock production is a heavily labor-dependent sector, and thus, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused severe shortages in the workforce and professional services, leading to substantial disruptions in the livestock supply chain, including a decrease in the economic and productive efficiency of livestock farms. In relation to the value of SCBF total assets, the results indicated that farms with higher values of total assets perceived significantly less COVID-19 impact related to the availability of production inputs in particular. One explanation for this finding is that larger-sized SCBFs with higher values of total assets are customarily more integrated and have transportation means and storage facilities to transport and store production inputs. In this regard, the FAO [37] has illustrated that small broiler farms have poor transport links and lack storage facilities, which disadvantage them and make them less flexible in adjusting to outbreaks and unexpected shocks. The results also showed that higher values of total assets are associated with less perceived financial effects (OR = 0.335 for SCBFs with total assets between EGP 500,000-1,000,000). As shown by Abu Hatab et al. [25] , total assets of small and medium-sized enterprises function as a buffer against unexpected shocks of the inherently risky agribusiness in Egypt, and thus, higher total assets may reduce the likelihood that SCBFs will experience challenges related to operational and recurrent expenses, including wages, interest on loans, and rent. Noteworthy, most of the ORs related to the \"total sales\" variable were statistically insignificant. A similar finding was reported by Abu Hatab et al. [25] in Egyptian agrifood SMEs and was explained by the tendency of these enterprises in Egypt to underestimate their turnover and total assets.",

This finding is in line with the findings of Srinivas et al. [77] and Moraine et al. [78] , showing that diversified markets of livestock systems decrease farm vulnerability to external shocks and market instability. In connection with this finding, the results indicated that SCBFs without membership of poultry producer organizations are significantly more likely to perceived negative COVID-19 effects in relation to the availability of production inputs (OR = 1.74) and consumer demand (OR = 1.25). In this respect, several studies have shown that membership of poultry farmer organizations increases farm efficiency and risk perception through the sharing of ideas and experiences among members and the technical support and marketing services that these organizations provide to members [79, 80] .",

This requires a comprehensive assessment of various types of SCBF vulnerabilities and an understanding of what the magnitude and breadth of impact will be when these vulnerabilities are exposed. In this respect, the substantial negative impact that COVID-19 exerted on small-scale broiler systems, as evidenced by our empirical results, should be leveraged as an opportunity to \"build back better\" and enhance SCBFs' preparedness and adaptation to various threats. That is, developing countries should utilize the lessons learned from COVID-19 impacts as well as the rehabilitation activities of past zoonotic disease outbreaks to strengthen small-scale broiler supply chains at various stages and enhance their preparedness and response plans in the face of emerging disruptions.",

Thus, the adoption of more holistic management approaches would offer an opportunity to take a system perspective on the impacts of pandemics on all stages of small-scale broiler chains, from input supply and production to consumption, and allow for comprehensive analyses of their influence on broiler supply chains and consumer demand. In this context, coalescing diverse actors and stakeholders at all levels around One Health approaches is crucial, as these approaches integrate animal, human, and environmental health and place food systems at their center.",

Therefore, it is important to promote and facilitate SCBFs' access to finance by providing short-term stimulus packages to support sales and cash flow. In addition, our results revealed that female-led SCBFs are more likely to perceive negative impacts from unexpected events. This highlights a major threat to the empowerment of women in poultry value chains, which may have negative repercussions not only for female entrepreneurs and individuals but also for the entire value chain. Therefore, there is a need to develop effective approaches to support female broiler entrepreneurs during times of supply chain disruptions by offering funding programs with subsidized interest rates and providing tailored technical support and training and advisory services. Furthermore, the results suggest that building the capacity of SCBFs operators is necessary to equip them with the skills and abilities to deal with various business risks. In particular, SCBF operators and workers should be trained in risk projection and preparedness, management techniques, and risk management strategies. It is also essential to build the capacity of broiler producer associations to enhance effective communication, the sharing of good practices, and strategic partnerships with government and stakeholders in order to cope with the effects of the pandemic. Finally, the results indicate that improving small producers' access to markets is an important area of investment since producer access to markets is dependent on infrastructure and the prices in these markets. Thus, improving infrastructure in rural areas would exert a favorable effect on diversifying and improving SCBFs' access to markets and, thus, reduce their vulnerability to extreme events and market shocks.",

            "text": "Figure 2 also indicates that changes in SCBFs' costs of production between 2019 and 2020 had significant implications for farm profitability as nearly three-quarters of them indicated that their profitability had been reduced by a percentage of 20% (55% of the sample) to more than 40% (about 6% of the sample). The remaining quarter of SCBFs surveyed consisted of farms that witnessed no change in their profitability from broiler farming activities (17% of the sample) and those that had achieved higher profitability (only 7% of the sample). The specific pathways through which the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the costs, profits, and other aspects of farm operations, based on the results of the polychoric PCA, are discussed in the next section of this paper. The respondents were also asked to indicate if they had temporarily shut down their broiler farming activities due to the pandemic. Responses revealed that 83 farms (about 41% of the sample) had been forced to close temporarily due to sluggish demand, falling prices, or to prevent the spread of the virus, causing unforeseen sales and staffing problems. A subsequent question concerning the number of weeks it took for them to reopen was asked of the farms that had shut down during the pandemic. Nearly 30% of the farms stated that they reopened within 1 to 4 weeks, with 37% reopening within periods ranging from 4 to 8 weeks. The remaining 27% resumed their broiler farming activities after relatively longer periods, ranging from 8 to 12 weeks or longer. With regard to respondents' perception of when the broiler farming business would return to normal, around 10% of respondents estimated this period at 1-3 months, 16% at 3-6 months, 15% at 6-9 months, and 13% at 9-12 months (Figure 3). Another 12% of the surveyed farms were more pessimistic, believing that the poultry markets will take longer than a year to return to normal. Figure 3 also reveals that 36% of the SCBFs surveyed were uncertain and unable to make an assessment, which may be attributed to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic presented unpreceded risks to the surveyed farms, making it hard for many of them to assess the trends and developments of the pandemic and its likely effects on broiler farming and poultry markets.",
