            "text": "Recent research highlights a variety of negative outcomes associated with intraindividual variability in positive affect (PA) and in sleep. Thus, this study examined the associations of variability in multiple dimensions of sleep (quality, duration, wake after sleep onset, bedtime, rise-time) with mean and variability in PA. For 7 days, morning and evening surveys were collected online from two separate samples: community-based adults (N = 911) and university students (N = 322). Regression analyses revealed that across both samples, people with more variable sleep quality exhibited greater fluctuations in PA throughout the week and, surprisingly, higher levels of PA on average. In the community sample only, individuals with more variable sleep duration had lower and more variable PA. Findings suggest that fluctuations in sleep quality and duration are linked with daily PA outcomes, which is important to consider as technological advances and modern demands make inadequate and irregular sleep increasingly common.",

            "text": "Positive affect (PA) is often defined as the experience of pleasurable emotions such as happiness, excitement, and contentment (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005) . A large body of evidence suggests that PA has unique benefits for health (Pressman et al., 2019) , with higher trait PA being linked to lower inflammation (Steptoe et al., 2005) , reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (Boehm & Kubzansky, 2012) , and lower mortality risk (Chida & Steptoe, 2008) . Sleep has been increasingly recognized as a key factor influencing both emotional functioning and health (Kahn et al., 2013; Zohar et al., 2005) . Although several dozen studies have linked better sleep to higher PA , the role of variability and level of sleep in PA dynamics is unknown. Given that fluctuations in PA and sleep have separately been linked to worse health outcomes (Bei et al., 2016; Ong & Steptoe, 2020) , and that technological advances and modern social/ work demands have increased the prevalence of irregular sleep (Gradisar et al., 2013) , it is important to further investigate the relationship between intraindividual variability in sleep and PA. The current study examined variability in sleep as a predictor of mean levels and variability in PA during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period with heightened stress (Zheng et al., 2021) and changes in sleep patterns (Rezaei & Grandner, 2021) .",

Researchers have speculated that rapid fluctuations between extreme highs and lows in affect across a short period of time can be maladaptive for physical and mental health (Gruber et al., 2013) . These fluctuations might reflect environmental demands that evoke rapid shifts in affect or possibly poorer affect regulation skills (Ong & Ram, 2017) . Indeed, multiple cross-sectional studies have shown that people with greater variability in PA tend to have higher inflammation (Jones et al., 2020) , less-favorable cortisol profiles (Human et al., 2015) , worse immune response (Jenkins et al., 2018) , more chronic health conditions (Chan et al., 2016) , and more psychological distress (Gruber et al., 2013; Hardy & Segerstrom, 2017) . Recently, data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging showed that instability in PA (measured as the mean of squared successive differences) predicted allcause mortality across 12 years, independent of mean levels of PA (Ong & Steptoe, 2020) .",

However, given that individuals might experience short, fragmented sleep one night, and consequently sleep longer and more soundly the next night (Mezick et al., 2009) , intraindividual variability in sleep may reveal information that is not captured by betweenperson comparisons of averages alone. Indeed, Mezick et al. (2009) found that individuals who experienced more stressors over the course of 9 days had greater variability in actigraphy-measured sleep duration and fragmentation, independent of person-means for sleep parameters. In a population-representative adult sample and in nurses, those with greater variability in self-reported or actigraphic sleep duration had higher risks for inflammation, pain, depression, and medical conditions Slavish et al., 2020 Slavish et al., , 2021 . In their systematic review, Bei et al. (2016) observed that people who had greater variability in one or more sleep-wake parameters (e.g., duration, sleep onset latency, bedtime, or rise-time) also reported more stress, worse physical health, depressive symptoms, and overall poorer sleep.",

            "text": "The current study focused on sleep as a predictor of PA mean and variability. Although the relationship between sleep and PA is often conceptualized as bidirectional, ambulatory studies that directly test both directions of association have found more consistent support for sleep as a predictor of next-day affect than vice versa (e.g., Bouwmans et al., 2017; Sin et al., 2017 Sin et al., , 2020 . Neurobiological research has found that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep may be particularly important for promoting appropriate emotional reactivity (Goldstein & Walker, 2014) . Regarding emotion dynamics, our study draws on the conceptual framework proposed by Palmer and Alfano (2017) , which utilizes the process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 1998) to understand the influence of sleep on emotion regulatory processes. According to this model, the neurobiological and behavioral effects of inadequate sleep can impact multiple aspects of emotion generation and regulation, including situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, appraisals, and response modulation (Palmer & Alfano, 2017) . For instance, Palmer and Alfano (2017) explain that poor sleep can diminish motivation to seek out or fully engage in rewarding activities (e.g., social interactions) that would otherwise promote PA. In addition to shaping one's environment, disrupted sleep can impair attentional strategies normally used to regulate one's affective responses (Palmer & Alfano, 2017) . For example, sleep deprivation reduces accuracy in recognizing positive but not negative facial expressions (Maccari et al., 2014) . Thus, we expect that more variable sleep (reflecting poorer or disrupted sleep patterns) will be associated with lower mean PA and greater PA variability, perhaps reflecting diminished situational selection or emotion regulation.",

For example, in a sample of 1,025 community-based adults using the same dataset as the current study, we found that nights of better, longer, or more efficient sleep-compared to one's usual level of sleep-predicted better affective well-being, fewer physical symptoms, and lower odds of stressor occurrence on the following day (Wen et al., in press ). However, separate from within-person processes, a growing body of research has shown that between-person differences in affect variability are related to sleep dimensions. For instance, above and beyond traitlike levels of PA, Ong et al. (2013) found that individuals with greater PA fluctuations in response to daily events had lower actigraphic sleep efficiency, compared to those with less event-related affect. In addition, people with greater variability in momentary PA also had shorter self-reported sleep duration and greater morning tiredness . Of note, Leger et al. (2019) also observed associations between iSD in negative affect (NA) and average sleep quality and morning tiredness, but these associations were no longer significant after controlling for mean NA. Additional experimental evidence has demonstrated that a single night of sleep continuity disruption attenuates next-day state PA, inhibition of pain by PA, and attentional bias to positive stimuli (Finan et al., 2017) . Considering ambulatory, experimental, and longitudinal research demonstrating the unique associations of sleep indices with PA , the current study focused on PA, while controlling for NA.",

Two samples, community-dwelling adults (N = 911) and university students (N = 322), reported their previous night's sleep and current-day affect in twice-daily surveys for 1 week during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined characteristics of sleep that have been most clearly associated with better mental and physical well-being, based on Buysse's SATED (satisfaction, alertness, timing, efficiency, and duration) model of sleep health (Buysse, 2014 ). Specifically, we examined self-reported sleep quality as an indicator of satisfaction, bedtime and rise-time for timing, wake after sleep onset (WASO) for efficiency, and sleep duration; unfortunately, the current study did not capture alertness/sleepiness. Based on previous evidence that variable sleep patterns are associated with poorer psychological health outcomes (Bei et al., 2016) , we hypothesized that greater intraindividual variability in sleep quality, bedtime, rise-time, WASO, and sleep duration would be associated with lower mean PA, as well as greater day-to-day variability in PA. A better understanding of the role of sleep variability in PA dynamics could help guide efforts to improve both sleep and well-being. This has important public health significance given the prevalence of societal-level changes in sleep patterns (Rezaei & Grandner, 2021) and declines in psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic (Prati & Mancini, 2021; Robinson et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021) .",

Following previous research (Eid & Diener, 1999) , we calculated intraindividual variability as the iSD for each participant's reports of affect and sleep across all their days of observation. Intraindividual or within-person standard deviation is the most widely used measure of variability for both PA (Houben et al., 2015; Ong & Ram, 2017) and sleep (Bei et al., 2016) . Due to extreme outliers, WASO variability was winsorized to a maximum of 2 standard deviations above the mean. We analyzed the community and student samples separately. For each sample, we first conducted bivariate correlations among sleep and affect variables. Next, linear regression models were used to evaluate each sleep variability index (bedtime, rise-time, sleep duration, WASO, sleep quality) as predictors of mean PA and PA variability.",

Our study builds on and extends this literature on sleep variability by focusing on positive aspects of well-being, namely PA in daily life. People who have more sleep disturbances might subsequently have worse emotional functioning through REM sleep-related mechanisms, which help unlink emotion from prior affective experiences and recalibrate salience signalling in the brain (Goldstein & Walker, 2014) . Based on the framework described by Palmer and Alfano (2017) , patterns of inconsistent sleep may influence various stages of the emotion generation and regulation process. For example, individuals with more variable sleep quality may be more likely to select themselves into situations (via impaired decision-making and impulse control; Womack et al., 2013) that then result in greater fluctuations in PA, or perhaps have greater affective reactivity to emotion-eliciting events . It is also possible that inconsistent sleep across consecutive nights disrupts one's circadian rhythm, which could then influence PA given previous research which indicates that daily variation in PA is partially regulated by endogenous mechanisms (Murray et al., 2002) . However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a third variable (e.g., substance use or post-traumatic stress disorder, for which we did not have data) that could be linked to both sleep variability and PA dynamics.",

On the one hand, it may be that variability in sleep quality reflects responsiveness to the environment, such that individuals with greater variability in sleep experience more social interactions or positive events, compared to individuals with less variable sleep quality. Indeed, the measure of PA used in this study includes items (\"close to others\" and \"like you belong\") that reflect feelings of social connection and possibly interpersonal interactions that may have occurred that day. Another possibility is that people with greater variability in sleep quality have more responsibilities that could impair their sleep, yet promote PA. For instance, people with more daily stressors tend to have better psychological well-being because they are more likely to be educated, employed, engaged in volunteering, and have family responsibilities (Almeida, 2005) . However, although we have conceptualized sleep variability as a driver of affective dynamics, it is also possible that people who are happier tend to experience more positive events and/or are more emotionally responsive to their environments, which may then result in irregular sleep patterns.",

The between-person association of sleep duration variability with lower mean PA, and of sleep duration variability with greater PA variability, was observed only in the community sample and not in the university student sample. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining sleep and PA in student as well as non-student samples, but the pattern we observed in the students (i.e., mean and variability in sleep quality, but not duration, were related to PA) was in line with previous literature on the sleep-PA relationship in university students. For example, Kalmbach et al. (2014) found that only higher sleep quality, but not total sleep time nor sleep onset latency, predicted higher next-day PA in women university students. Similarly, Pressman et al. (2017) found that trait PA was related to higher sleep quality and efficiency, but not duration, during the week of a major exam. This is particularly relevant given that our data were collected when students were preparing for final exams amid the transition to remote learning during the pandemic. A possible explanation for the less robust relationship between sleep duration and PA in our university student sample versus community sample is that external factors may be more important for students' sleep duration. As Pressman et al. (2017) point out, students frequently controlling for mean PA, mean sleep quality, IIV and mean NA, and demographic factors. Sleep quality variability was centered on the grand mean (mean = 18.51, SD = 8.46 for the community sample; mean = 17.37, SD = 9.12 for the student sample) sacrifice sleep for school, work, or social commitments. Furthermore, younger adults may be more resilient to poorer quality sleep and as such, sleep may not be as closely tied to affect in students. Indeed, only sleep quality was correlated with PA in students, in contrast to many sleep measures in the community sample.",

            "text": "Limitations of the current study should be considered when interpreting its findings. First, we conceptualized variability in sleep as the driver of PA experiences, but we are unable to draw conclusions about directionality or causation due to the cross-sectional and correlational study design. Second, because data were collected entirely online, this study relied on self-reported sleep and affect. Studies examining the relationship between sleep and affect or stress using self-report (diary), inferred (actigraphy), and/or objective (electroencephalography) measures have sometimes found differential associations depending on the measure used McCrae et al., 2008; Messman et al., 2021) . These different measures reflect partially distinct domains of sleep, which perhaps explains why subjective sleep quality, which captures one's holistic appraisal of sleep and can only be measured via self-report, had the most consistent associations with PA in our study. However, other research has reported fairly consistent links between daytime stress and sleep using both self-reported and actigraphic sleep assessments (Yap et al., 2020) . Thus, the use of subjective versus objective sleep measurement when studying affect is far from fully understood and future research should take a multimethod approach for sleep assessment when possible . Third, this study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the patterns of night-to-night sleep and daily affect may not generalize to periods of lower stress. However, this was a unique opportunity to examine sleep and PA during a time of heightened disruption in daily life. Because this was a period of high stress and uncertainty, it is possible that people who were coping relatively well were more likely to participate in a daily diary study. Therefore, this dataset may not have captured individuals with the most disrupted sleep and affect. Finally, the community sample was recruited online and was primarily white, female, and well-educated. These factors related to the context and the samples could limit the generalizability of findings.",

            "text": "Future work could extend the current findings by investigating outstanding questions about the nature of variability in sleep and PA. First, it is possible that more variable sleep is associated with affective lability in general (i.e., both PA and NA variability). Much remains unknown about whether people with greater night-to-night variability in sleep might be unable to sustain their PA in particular or perhaps swing between positive and negative emotions. Further work is also needed to better contextualize variability in sleep and PA within one's environment and to determine when variability might reflect adaptive versus maladaptive responses to external events or when variability reflects intrinsic fluctuations that are not entirely due to external circumstances (e.g., Liu et al., 2018) . For some individuals, fluctuations in sleep and affect may primarily indicate adaptive responsiveness to environmental demands, whereas variability may reflect oversensitivity to the environment or poorer self-regulation for others. Answering these questions may help identify individuals who are more emotionally vulnerable to poorer or shorter sleep and at greater risk for developing future health conditions Vigoureux et al., 2020) .",

Based on parallel analyses in community-based adults and university students, our findings suggest that inconsistency in sleep patterns is linked to both better and worse psychological well-being. Specifically, people with more variable sleep quality had more variable and higher mean PA than those with less-variable sleep quality, whereas individual differences in sleep duration variability predicted more variable and lower mean PA. Future work should investigate potential mechanisms-such as neurobiological pathways and responsiveness to environmental contexts-that underlie the links between patterns of inconsistent sleep and affective dynamics.",
