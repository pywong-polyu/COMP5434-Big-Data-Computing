In macrophages (m\u03a6) responding to bacterial LPS and Dexamethasone, the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) activates target genes like Klf9 or Fkbp5 via interaction with the BRG1-containing SWI/SNF complex, chromatin remodeling and Mediator recruitment. At the same time, GR represses the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as Ccl2, Cxcl10, Il1a etc. by assembling a BRG1-containing co-repressor complex and deacetylating surrounding histone tails. Loss of BRG1 activity affects both the transcriptional activation and repression of a subset of myeloid GR target genes via distinct mechanisms.

To elucidate the complex molecular mechanisms employed by GR during the suppression of innate immune responses, we have performed proteomics, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and bioinformatics together with genetic and pharmacological loss of function studies in primary mouse macrophages. We found that GR interacts with the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to regulate a specific subset of target genes. Here we show that the central catalytic subunit BRG1 is required not only for the transcriptional activation of classical GR target genes such as Fkbp5 or Klf9, but also for the transcriptional repression of cytokines and chemokines such as Ccl2, Cxcl10 or Il1a. We demonstrate that loss of BRG1 activity leads to reduced histone deacetylase (HDAC) function, and consequently increased histone acetylation, at these repressive GR binding sites. Altogether, our findings suggest that GR interacts with BRG1 to assemble a functional co-repressor complex at a defined fraction of macrophage cisregulatory elements. These results may indicate additional non-classical, remodelingindependent functions of the SWI/SNF complex and may have implications for the development of future immunomodulatory therapies.",

It belongs to the nuclear receptor family of ligand gated transcription factors, whose clinical relevance is underscored by its life-saving effects in COVID-19 patients (Group et al. 2021) . Upon binding to its ligands such as Dexamethasone, GR translocates to the nucleus to either activate or repress target gene transcription. The exact mechanisms specifying positive versus negative regulation and the composition of coregulatory complexes assembled on target promoters or enhancers are inherently complex and pose many open questions (Escoter-Torres et al. 2019) . Several studies have suggested that cis-regulatory element recognition and binding by GR is predetermined by each cell type's specific chromatin landscape, which is established by pioneer factors like PU.1, AP-1 or C/EBP, and which shapes the GR cistrome John et al. 2011; Greulich et al. 2016) .",

Assembly of the SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose-NonFermentable) remodeling complex and its interaction with GR have been shown to enhance the transcriptional hormone response. BRG1 (SMARCA4), the central ATPase of the SWI/SNF complex, is required for proper and robust GR-regulated gene activation (Fryer and Archer 1998) . Both structural models and biochemical experiments indicate that SMARCD1 (BAF60A), SMARCC1 (BAF155), SMARCE1 (BAF57) and ARID1A (BAF250) components engage in protein-protein interactions between GR and the SWI/SNF complex (Hsiao et al. 2003; Muratcioglu et al. 2015) . Gene activation of various nuclear receptors, including GR, has been reported to broadly require the cooperation of this wellstudied chromatin remodeling complex. In this context, BRG1 both precedes GR chromatin occupancy, by establishing pioneer factor recruitment to create accessible GR DNA binding sites, and also serves subsequently as a coactivator and remodeler required for GR-induced DNA accessibility and transcription (Trotter and Archer 2004; Trotter et al. 2015; Hoffman et al. 2018 ).",

We therefore hypothesized that BRG1-containing remodeling complexes may mediate significant fractions of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid actions. Here we chose primary bone marrow derived murine macrophages, which are important cellular mediators of the innate immune response, as a model to study the GR-mediated repression of inflammatory genes (Uhlenhaut et al. 2013; Greulich et al. 2021b) . We performed ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages to functionally characterize the role of BRG1 (SMARCA4) for a subset of GR target genes. Our data suggest that the catalytic activity of the SWI/SNF complex is not only involved in the activation of classical GR target genes (such as Klf9 or Fkbp5), but also in the transcriptional repression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and interleukins (such as Ccl2, Cxcl10 or Il1a).",

(Since the other catalytic SWI/SNF component, SMARCA2 (BRM), was transcriptionally downregulated upon Dex stimulation, we focused only on BRG1 (Fig. S1B) ). As shown in Fig. 1C , almost all GR binding sites mapped in response to LPS and Dex, also showed co-occupancy of BRG1 (about 90%). As expected, we also detected many additional BRG1 binding sites throughout the genome, not overlapping with GR, which represent the central, essential functions of the SWI/SNF complex within the macrophage chromatin landscape (Chen et al. 2020) . Bioinformatic motif analyses of those ~8,000 common GR-BRG1-bound ChIP sequences revealed the GR consensus motif (GRE) as significantly enriched, together with the known macrophage pioneer factor PU.1 and the inflammatory mediators AP-1 and NF-\u03baB (Fig. 1D, Fig. S1C ), validating our data sets (Uhlenhaut et al. 2013) . For instance, we observed BRG1 binding to GR target sites such as the Fkbp5, Klf9, Ccl2, Cxcl10, Il1a and Il1rn loci (Fig. 1E, Fig. S1D ). Fkbp5 and Klf9 are two typical examples of positive GR targets induced by Dex, while Cxcl10, Ccl2, Il1a, and Il1rn, are representative cases of negative GR target genes repressed in response to ligand (Uhlenhaut et al. 2013; Escoter-Torres et al. 2020; Greulich et al. 2021b ). In addition to these exemplary cytokines, the functional annotation of the ~8,000 common GR-BRG1 target sites, based on the nearest gene, include many genes involved in inflammation, immune responses, myeloid migration and inflammatory signaling cascades (Fig. 1F) .",

When performing a differential motif enrichment search among those sequences mapping to loci which gained openness in response to GR ligand, we found the GRE consensus motif overrepresented among the ATAC-seq signatures (Fig. 3C) . These results might point towards GR's role in nucleosome positioning or phasing, possibly via BRG1 recruitment. Our data underscore the broad requirement and central role of the BRG1-containing SWI/SNF remodeling complex for transcriptional activation by GR (Hoffman et al. 2018) .

For those loci, we found that the histone H3 acetylation levels were maintained after stimulation with Dexamethasone, rather than decreased, which concurred with increased mRNA expression (i.e., reduced repression). While the DNA accessibility remained constant, the impaired repression could be explained by reduced recruitment of the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC3 in response to GR ligand, especially since pharmacological HDAC inhibition mirrored this phenotype.",

Furthermore, BRG1 was found to be critical for the formation of stable complexes between GR and HDAC2 on the POMC promoter, along with histone H4 de-acetylation and GR-dependent repression (Bilodeau et al., 2006) . SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes have been described as having both co-activator as well as co-repressor functions and thus may provide a molecular hub or platform, switching from transcriptional activation to repression (Zhang et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2021) . For example, locusspecific phosphorylation of BRG1 at Ser1382 has been reported to release the HDAC1/2-containing NURD complex and to favor BRG1's nucleosome remodeling activity (Kim et al. 2021 ).",

Blacklisted regions (http://mitra.stanford.edu/kundaje/akundaje/release/blacklists/ mm10-mouse/mm10.blacklist.bed.gz) were removed from analyses. Peak annotation was performed in R version 4.0.3 (RRID:SCR 014601 (Team 2017)) using the ChIPpeakAnno package version 3.24.1 and annotation data from the mouse Ensembl genome GRCm38.p6",

(B) Volcano plot of differential ATAC-seq signals at GR and BRG1 co-occupied regions, fold changes (FC) in LPS+Dex versus LPS treated samples. Dots represent single genomic regions, associated to the nearest gene. 7,351 peaks, n=4, FDR<0.05 (C) Differential motif enrichment analysis of the three categories of ATAC-seq peaks (shown in B), versus the union of all three peak sets (5,519 peaks). No significant enrichment was found for the gray or green sets. (D) Heatmaps of mean GR, BRG1, H3K27ac ChIP-and ATAC-seq signals at +/-2kb of GR-BRG1 co-occupied regions after LPS or LPS+Dex treatment. Sites are sorted by the Dex-induced change in ATAC-seq signal in descending order, and clustered by GR-BRG1 binding sites gaining (FC>1.5, FDR<0.05), maintaining (1.5>FC<-1.5, FDR>0.05) or losing (FC<-1.5, FDR<0.05) accessibility. Differential heatmaps (\u0394) compare LPS+Dex versus LPS. Coverage plots on top summarize the median signal per group (GBS: GR binding site). (E) Representative genome browser tracks showing the mean signal of GR (n=2), ATAC-seq (n=4) and H3K27ac ChIP-seq (n=2) for Fkbp5, Klf9, Ccl2 and Cxcl10 loci. Arrows highlight signal changes.",
