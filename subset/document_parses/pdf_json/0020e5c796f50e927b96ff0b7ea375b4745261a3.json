            "text": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) affects 85% of preterm babies born before 32 weeks gestational age (wGA). Currently, the strategy to manage RDS in neonates who do not require intubation in the delivery room includes non-invasive nasal ventilation, early rescue treatment with animal derived surfactant, and the limitation of mechanical ventilation (MV). In fact, MV is one of the main risk factors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) because it leads to chronic inflammation [1] [2] [3] . A reduction in the duration of MV is also one of the ways to limit the risk of BPD [4] . European guidelines from 2019 state that \"LISA [less invasive surfactant administration] is the preferred mode of surfactant administration for spontaneously breathing babies on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), provided that clinicians are experienced with this technique\" [5] . In the LISA procedure, the operator inserts a thin tube to administer intra-tracheal surfactant to spontaneously breathing preterm infants receiving non-invasive ventilation [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . After surfactant administration, the catheter is immediately removed and non-invasive ventilation is continued [6] . The main advantage of this strategy is to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury. Two metaanalyses reported a 30% decrease in MV within the first 72 h and in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks with the use of LISA [16, 17] . These meta-analyses pooled and studied the data of several randomized trials about LISA versus other strategies. One of the barriers to the wider implementation of the technique is the absence of consensus on premedication [18] . In fact, most studies were performed without sedation or with sedation at the discretion of the clinicians [19] .",

It may cause bradycardia and intracranial hypertension when it is performed without sedation [27, 28] . For this reason, several academic bodies have recommended the use of premedication before neonatal intubation, except in life-threatening situations [26, 29] . Despite this evidence, a Scandinavian survey showed that only half of responding NICUs always used premedication before a LISA procedure, although it requires a laryngoscopy similar to that required by endotracheal intubation [30] . The clinicians' major concern about using premedication before LISA is the opposing goals of obtaining efficient sedation/analgesia while maintaining respiratory drive. For these reasons, this study assesses the impact of sedation during LISA on the rate of MV. Our hypothesis is that using premedication with propofol in a standardized protocol will not dramatically increase the need for MV within 72 h.",

The equipment for the LISA procedure and for tracheal intubation (endotracheal tube, laryngoscope and Magill Forceps) is prepared.

In the two groups, when the intervention team is ready, a solution of atropine, caffeine and oral sugar solution 30% or 24% is given drop, wise orally using a syringe before the LISA procedure. The posology of drugs are chosen according to the protocol routinely in use locally (around 10 \u03bcg/kg for atropine, 20 mg/kg for caffeine and 5-10 drops for sucrose). If LISA is performed in delivery room, caffeine should be given at soon as possible after procedure. It is common practice in France for atropine to be used before any intubation procedure. The aim of the atropine administration is to reduce the risk of bradycardia associated with an exacerbation of vagal tone. Sucrose is given as an analgesic agent [31] and caffeine is used to avoid central apnea [32] .",

Direct laryngoscopy or indirect laryngoscopy (with videolaryngoscopy), according to local practice, is performed with the probe inserted to beyond the vocal cords at the required depth, and held in position at the lips. Once the probe is correctly positioned, surfactant is slowly infused at a dose specified by the local protocol. At the end of the administration, the probe is immediately removed. The newborn continuously remains on NIPPV throughout the procedure, since in previous trials using propofol for LISA, NIPPV was found to be required continuously [11, 20] . If the newborn develops transient apnoea, inflations providing additional positive pressure are given using the respiratory support (NIPPV), an Ambu\u00ae bag or a Tpiece resuscitator device (Neopuff\u00ae).
