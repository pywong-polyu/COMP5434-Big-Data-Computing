With regard to the environmental burdens of organic farming, scholars have arrived at contradictory recommendations. In the first set of studies, they have proposed organic farming system as a promising environmental solution due to a significant reduction in agricultural inputs resulted from enhanced soil organic matter and thus soil fertility (Markuszewska & Kubacka, 2017) . In another set of research, organic farming is not positively assessed, and the studies have also questioned as to what extent it can improve environmental performance. At the same time, more lands are required to produce the same amount of yields (Tuomisto et al., 2012) . The contradiction between the results of the assessment is due to the limitations of LCA (van der Werf et al., 2020) . Researchers advise that although there is no single best farming system, in many circumstances (depending on soil type, climate, altitude, and legislation), organic farming can be considered as the optimal system creating more resiliency in food systems. For a comprehensive discussion around the topic of organic versus conventional farming, we refer interested readers to Risku-Norja and Mikkola (2009). 2.2 Modeling methods in the agro-food supply chain From a modeling perspective, mathematical optimization techniques (combined with life cycle assessment) are the dominant approach used for designing SSC for food products (Zhu et al., 2018) . Some researchers take deterministic approaches such as linear programming, mixed integer programming, and goal programming (Oglethorpe, 2010) to design and plan SCs. The uncertainty and dynamics in the parameters are addressed by approaches such as stochastic programming (Costa et al., 2014) , fuzzy programming, simulation modeling, and game theory.

For example, Kunc (2016) , provided a useful resource to understand the use of system dynamics based simulations for behavioral modeling. These types of modeling approaches can provide new and emergent insights about operations and supply chain management.

While these approaches performed well generally, but they fall short in modeling behavioral aspects that are bounded rational in nature. Methods such as SD, ABM are able to simulate the intangible aspects of the SCM effectively, including interactions among different SC stages, learning over time for SC partners involved, and continuous feedback on key decisions in the presence of limited information.

In particular, the influence of green taxation schemes, informational marketing campaigns, and organic food promotions and incentives on the adaptive behavior of farmers and consumers can be further examined and assessed. Another example of such scenarios is to explore the impact of Covid-19, as the Reserve Bank of Australia forecasts that GDP will fall by 6% in 2020 with a slightly larger number of 7% for unemployment. At the same time, social norms probably play a less significant role in households' choices due to lockdown and social distancing. It is interesting and contemporaneous to quantitatively assess whether the negative effect of the pandemic on wealth can be overcome by reversing the norms. A potential extension of this model will include agroecological models of crop growth to forecast the farm yield with regards to the adopted farming system (i.e., organic, biodynamic, conventional, etc.) under changing climatic factors (i.e., temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.). The model was developed for the wine case study, yet, it is generic enough to be used for studying a wide range of agro-food SCs that have similar characteristics such as tea and coffee SCs. Another interesting area to explore is the heterogeneity of farmers regarding their expectations of organic farming adoption and their choice between different conversion strategies. With minor modifications, the model can be easily adapted for other agricultural products to explore ways for transitioning to organic farming. The analytical framework and suggested modeling approach can also be adopted by researchers to examine the adaptive behavior of the disaggregated, multi-scale tiers of the SC in other sectors.

There are situations when wines of a certain type, for example, conventional ones, are not available at the shops. If consumer m habit of purchasing conventional wine is weaker than their intention to purchase organic wine ( < ), a shift in their preference (from conventional to organic wine) can occur that may lead to purchasing organic wine (also depending on the other factors).

According to a recent report of Wine Australia (2019), the percentage of Australians who \"sought to purchase any organic wine in the past six months\" is approximately 20%. Despite the growing interest in the global market, still, organic wine remains a niche segment in the domestic market. Given this dependency of the primary organic production on the end consumer preferences, we take this case to illustrate the methodological added value of the ESSC. As shown inFigure 8, the ESSC has different aggregation levels, varying from individuals (e.g., consumers) to businesses (e.g., retailers, winery) and to farmers. Note that this is not a literal description of the Australian wine economy, and there are no specific assumptions apart from general connections between layers. The time step for the model is one week, as it is the basic time unit that corresponds to the wine shopping frequency reported by most of the households -once per week. In general, the economic life of the grapevines is up to 30-40 years(Carbone et al., 2019), and thus the simulation runs for 30 years.

There are five retailers in the model illustrating major Australian alcohol market players (including Woolworths, Coles Group, Metcash Limited, Aldi, and others). Each retailer has at least one shop in the City of Sydney Local Government Area (LGA). The average price of organic and conventional wines (tax included) across all stores is $13.00 and $10.00 per bottle, respectively. These prices are aligned with the average price of organic and conventional wines presented on Wine Australia website (https://www.wineaustralia.com). On top of retailing costs, the Australian wine retailers should pay Wine Equalisation Tax (WET) (29% of half the price of wine) and Goods and Service Tax (GST) (GST is 10% of the full price) to the governing body (refer to Appendix B.3). The wine preference of 2099 households reported in Ogbeide (2013) is used for the consumer agent. Readers can find the details of ORVin data in Appendix a vital step in tuning the model to reproduce empirical data by tweaking the values of some of the model parameters. There was only a limited number of experimental results that we could use for this purpose. From Ogbeide (2013), we had the number of consumers having a positive attitude towards organic wine, and from the Wine Intelligence (2018) survey, we could estimate the ratio of organic to conventional wine consumers. These numbers were used for calibrating the model. A list of calibrated parameters is presented in Appendix C.Where possible we use the real-world data (secondary collected elsewhere for other purposes, and primarily derived from expert interviews with wine and organic industry analysts) complemented with our assumptions about particular parameter values (explicitly discussed through the paper and tested on sensitivity) where data was lacking (refer to Appendix C). Given the methodological focus of the paperto illustrate the dynamics of supply chains integrated with the behaviorally-rich representation of consumers who follow empirical behavioral traits from the survey, usually omitted from the theoretical mathematical models-it is important to understand where and how the results of the ESCC differ from the conventional representation of a consumer.
