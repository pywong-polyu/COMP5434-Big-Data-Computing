Most patients were treated for New York Heart Association class II (38.7%) and reduced ejection fraction HF (70.2%). Psychological distress (Kessler 6 score \u2265 5) was common (18.5%), and 21.8% felt worse than before the lockdown. Few patients (n \u00bc 10) adjusted their intake of HF medications, always on medical prescription. Decreased physical activity was common (41.9%) and more frequent in women (P \u00bc 0.025) and urban dwellers (P \u00bc 0.009). Almost half of respondents (46.0%) declared increased screen time, but only few declared more alcohol intake (4.0%). Weight gain was common (27.4%), and 44.4% of current smokers increased tobacco consumption. Adherence to recommended salt or fluid intake restrictions was reduced in 14.5%. Increase in HF symptoms was commonly reported (21.8%) and tended to be higher in women than in men (P \u00bc 0.074). Of the 23 patients who had a phone teleconsultation during the pandemic, 16 had initially planned an in-person consultation that they switched for teleconsultation. Conclusions During the lockdown, psychological distress and decreased well-being were common in CHF outpatients, and there was an increase in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. These changes may negatively impact short-term and long-term prognoses. Medication adherence was maintained, and limitations in access to care were partly counterbalanced by use of telehealth.",

            "text": "Cardiovascular co-morbidities, such as congestive heart failure (CHF), dramatically alter the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 1 The outbreak of COVID-19 and the resulting lockdown have been generally associated with social and physical isolation, psychological distress, limited access to care, decreased medication adherence, and the adoption of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. However, patients with chronic diseases may be particularly affected by the specific stress caused by the pandemic. In CHF patients, psychological distress may lead to destabilizations through stress-related sympathetic activation. [2] [3] [4] [5] This distress, which is encouraged by social isolation, is often associated with unhealthy behaviours including decreased physical activity, unhealthy dietary intake, decreased treatment adherence, and substance consumption. Alcohol consumption may have a toxic effect on myocardial function and can cause life-threatening arrhythmias. Moreover, some media messages have suggested the protective effect of tobacco and the deleterious effect of taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which may have influenced tobacco-related behaviours and medication adherence. 1, 6 Limitations in access to care may impair the management of CHF while negatively influencing lifestyle behaviours, diet, and medication adherence, which are the foundations of CHF management. 7 However, these limitations could be offset by telemedicine, potentially preventing CHF destabilization by providing timely lifestyle counselling and treatment adjustments. It has recently been underlined that telehealth is underused in CHF patients in spite of the recommendations. 8, 9 It is currently unknown if the limitations in access to care caused by the lockdown may facilitate such interventions.",

This questionnaire was previously tested on 10 subjects (members of our research unit) as an internal procedure in order to assess compliance (understanding, coherence, and reliability), leading to changes in the questions regarding medications and tobacco consumption. Then the questionnaire was tested by phone on eight HF outpatients who were not managed in our clinic (external procedure), and no changes were found to be necessary. The 20 min phone interview was conducted by one of eight trained research assistants. Psychological distress was defined as a Kessler 6 score (K6) \u2265 5. 10 CHF data were extracted from patient medical files.

Interestingly, those living in rural area were less likely to decrease their physical activity, which is potentially explained by easier access to an environment conducive to exercise. The rate of subjects who declared increase in alcohol intake was low (5%), and more patients reported a decreased intake (15%). These findings could be partly explained by lack of access to bars and reduced social drinking with friends or family. Interestingly, one out of seven patients admitted poorer adherence to salt and/or fluid intake restrictions. In CHF patients, adherence to dietary advice is a key issue that is often a challenge even in a normal context. 11 Surprisingly, despite potentially alarming media messages, medication adherence was not diminished. We documented a significant reduction in health care access, and a number of patients delayed or even cancelled planned physician examinations. At the same time, a significant number of patients (\u224820%) switched from an in-person consultation to telemedicine after the initiation of the lockdown.",

            "text": "In conclusion, lockdown policies and medication adherence appear to be upheld by CHF outpatients for the most part. However, our data reveal deteriorations in well-being and cardiovascular health indexes, associated with an increase in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. Beyond the short term, these changes could profoundly affect disease severity. However, lockdown-related barriers to health care access were partly compensated by an encouraging increase in telehealth use. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19-related outbreak could act as an accelerator of telehealth implementation, which is a resource-efficient strategy in the management of CHF patients.",
