COVID-19 vaccines have been granted Emergency Use Authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, although pregnant persons were excluded from published phase three vaccine trials. COVID-19 vaccines include messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and viral vector vaccines such as J&J/Janssen. Pregnant individuals have had access to vaccines since their availability, with evolving strength of the recommendation and now urgency to protect pregnant persons from COVID-19 through vaccination 7 .

However, there is a paucity of pregnancy-specific data on kinetics of antibody titers over time from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fetal sex may also impact maternal and placental immune response to infection 18 . Additionally, mRNA vaccine immunogenicity in pregnancy has been demonstrated 19 20,21 .

Transplacental antibody transfer following infection or vaccine confers protection to the newborn, and vaccination during pregnancy is an important prevention strategy to promote infant health 24 . Transplacental antibody transfer has been shown in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA vaccination in pregnancy with varying reported transfer ratios (0.3-1.3) 14, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . There have also been concerns of impaired transplacental transfer after SARS-CoV-2 infection 13, 30 . With respect to COVID vaccination, two doses of the mRNA vaccine (as opposed to one) 23, 27, 28 and vaccination earlier in pregnancy (as opposed to later in the 3 rd trimester) are associated with higher transfer ratio, but data outside of third trimester are still limited 31, 32 . Given the likely waning of antibody titer and boosters recommended for those at high risk for severe COVID-19, including pregnant individuals, how the timing of infection or vaccination impacts duration of maternal antibody and transplacental antibody transfer is of particular interest.",

Thus, it is imperative to understand the durability of protection after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, because infants less than 6 months of age are vulnerable and require a unique vaccination strategy, antibody transfer to the fetus may be an important strategy to optimize protection of young infants from COVID-19.",

Prior work by Flannery et al noted that mothers with moderate or critical illness had higher maternal and infant IgG, but the differences were not statistically significant 14 . Our data demonstrates through stratified analysis and modeling that in pregnant people, greater severity of infection is associated with higher and longer lasting maternal antibody levels and higher antibody level in cord blood. It is notable that there was no difference in transplacental antibody transfer with more severe disease, thus the increased levels in umbilical cord blood reflect changes in maternal IgG levels. Furthermore, severity-specific differences in antibody levels are pronounced with longer latency from infection to delivery. Antibody duration has been reported to decrease over time after natural infection, in as little as 3-6 months and particularly after mild infection in nonpregnant individuals 36, 37 . In our study, pregnant persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a clear rise in IgG with peak approximately 6 weeks from first vaccination (2-3 weeks from second dose) and then a significant fall by 4-5 months, and those with asymptomatic and mild infection yielded lower antibody levels sooner. These data emphasize the need for vaccination as a protective strategy for pregnant people, even after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.",

Our study demonstrates that vaccination induces higher and longer lasting antibody levels in pregnant persons and their newborns than SARS-CoV-2 infection, while also avoiding the potential complications of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. The timing of vaccination, duration of response, and transplacental transfer to infant has shown various results across studies. Yang et al found that early third trimester vaccination led to highest anti-spike IgG levels 31 . Kugelman et al reported that second trimester mRNA vaccination led to protective IgG levels at delivery 38 , while Rottenstreich et al reported that IgG levels were lowest after first trimester and highest after 3 rd trimester vaccination 32 . Our data, although limited to second and third trimester vaccination, shows clear evidence that vaccination results in superior antibody levels and transfer ratios compared to infection, and that this difference is pronounced with longer latency. Nevertheless, there are decreasing antibody levels over time and, thus this study reinforces the importance of boosting maternal immunity with additional dose if greater than 5 months from primary vaccine series.",

The possibility that fetal sex modifies maternal antibody response or placental transfer is intriguing. Our data, however, did not find any statistically significant differences in maternal IgG level or transfer ratio according to fetal sex after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. Given the hypothesis that maternal proinflammatory response in the setting of acute infection impacts humoral and placental immune response, the timing of infection may be important in fetal sexspecific differences. Bordt and colleagues study focused on acute infection in the third trimester. Our stratified analysis of maternal and infant antibodies limited to third trimester SARS-CoV-2 infection still did not recapitulate the fetal sex-specific differences previously reported. Further dedicated work is needed in this area.",

Additionally, the mathematical modeling approach to maternal antibody kinetics adds to the statistical validity of severity and vaccine vs. natural infection comparisons. Limitations include the single timepoint of antibody measurements at delivery per patient and the single center study. Circulating anti-S1 RBD antibody is also only one measure of immune protection and does not account for aspects of immunologic memory. Although we did not specifically measure neutralizing antibody, anti-S IgG correlates closely with neutralizing activity patterns 16, 38 .",
