Thus, antibodies potentially induced by vaccines might directly interact with the virus spike coat proteins and interfere in the binding of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor for internalization (Miller et al., 2021) . In this regard, a study with an animal model, utilizing mutant mice with ACE2 deficiency, showed the important function of this receptor in innate immunity modulation, balance of intestinal amino acid, synthesis of antimicrobial peptides, and maintenance of the intestinal microbiome (Infusino et al., 2020) .",

Therefore, the present study aimed to provide insights and perspectives for the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics related to prevention/treatment and/or modulation of the microbiota of COVID-19 patients.

All relevant data on modulation of microbiota with probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics associated to prevention and/or treatment of patients with COVID-19 were downloaded from the Scopus, considered by the academic community, the largest citation database of peer-reviewed literature (Falagas, Pitsouni, Malietzis, & Pappas, 2008; Kulkarni, Aziz, Shams, & Busse, 2009; Mongeon & Paul-Hus, 2016; Zyoud & Al-Jabi, 2020) . The present study used a systematic process of four principles, adapted from Randhawa, Wilden, and Hohberger (2016) . First, discussions were held to recognize the theme and relevant concepts to the researched topic. Terms were identified to shape three cores: the supplement (i.e., probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics); the pathology, in this case was included the illness and the virus (SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus) and; the main problem/discussion, in this case, were included descriptors for microbiota, clinical trials, prevention, and treatment. Second, based on the identified terms, a search procedure was performed. For the Scopus the following terms were utilized: (\"probiotics\" OR \"prebiotics\" OR \"synbiotics\" OR \"paraprobiotics\" OR \"postbiotics\") AND (\"COVID-19\" OR \"Coronavirus\" OR \"SARS-CoV-2\") AND (\"microbiota\" OR \"clinical trials\" OR \"prevention\" OR \"treatment\" OR \"therapy\").",

A total of 5 subject areas were identified in all the top 10 publications. Each subject area was selected according to the source titles appertains to; in some cases, the periodicals had more than one subject area. The most pertinent subject area in the selected topics relates mainly to the Medicine area, accounting for 37.4% of the chosen publications. This subject area includes the following research fields and the number of papers: Infectious Diseases (1), Gastroenterology (1), Hepatology (1), General Medicine (1), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health (1), Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health (1), Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine (1), and Pharmacology (medical) (1). The second most relevant subject areas are \"Agricultural and Biological Sciences\" and \"Immunology and Microbiology\" with 18.8% each, and the third areas were \"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology\" and \"Nursing\" with 12.5% each. Those results show how to what extend probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics studies have multidisciplinary approaches. Thus, the multidisciplinary research of COVID-19 represents a great scientific progress and its approach is fundamental due to the virus newness, impact, and uncertainty. On other hand, the journals with most CiteScore among top the 10 are: The Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology (22.2), Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (6.7), and Virus Research (5.9), i.e., two from the top 3 (Table S1 ).

Australia and countries from the African continent had lower numbers of publications. Indeed, India has shown the highest number of cases reported in Southeast Asia to date (WHO, 2021), and from June 2020, Brazil has been among the 10 countries most affected by the pandemic (Sharma, Bansal, Yadav, Jain, & Garg, 2021) , which may have boosted research in this topic. On the other hand, the pandemic has had a very low impact on countries from Oceania (WHO, 2021), whereas African countries have been suffering political and economic instability for many years (Mwelwa, Boulton, Wafula, & Loucoubar, 2020) , which could be the reason for the low number of studies.",

More specifically, probiotics can influence intestinal epithelial cells to modulate cytokines; provide IgA secretion; activate phagocytosis; modulate the function of regulatory cells; induce dendritic cell maturation; strengthen the mucosal barriers and minimize viral entry (Bottari, Castellone, & Neviani, 2021; Patra et al., 2021) .

Presently, those peptides have been prospected to act also by reducing the progression of COVID-19 (Mulak, 2021) .

            "text": "The lung microbiota is less studied than the gut microbiota. It is known that to be a dynamic and transient ecosystem with microorganisms belonging to this niche coming mostly from the mouth, inhaled air and the digestive tract due to microaspiration (Allali, Bakri, Amzazi, & Ghazal, 2021) . Respiratory inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 is able to cause local dysbiosis and allows translocation of microbial metabolites and toxins to the gut and other organs, as long as antibiotics and antivirals used for the COVID-19 treatment could also result in further intestinal microbiota imbalance (Conte & Toraldo, 2020; Santacroce et al., 2021) . Santacroce et al. (2021) described in COVID-19 a dysregulation of four biological communication axes: gut/lung, gut/brain, gut/skin and skin/brain microbiota. Beneficial microbes delivered by water/food/environment may access the gut, lung, skin and other tissue, compose the local microbiota, compete with pathogens and promote protection (Antunes et al., 2020; Conte & Toraldo, 2020) . On the other hand, the gut-lung axis enables the migration of immune cells from the gut to the lung (Patra et al., 2021) . Not only can immune cells be exchanged through this axis, but also intact bacteria and their metabolites (such as short-chain fatty acids) can enter the systemic circulation via the mesenteric lymphatic system and influence the pulmonary immune response (Olaimat et al., 2020; Patra et al., 2021; Santacroce et al., 2021) . Besides, probiotics are able to restore dysbiosis and maintain gut immune homeostasis by intra and extra cellular molecules like peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid and phospho-polysaccharides (Bottari et al., 2021) . Patra et al. (2021) reaffirmed that the resident gut microbiota is able to modulate the immune system and improve lung infections. This group identified candidate genes associated to COVID-19 and probiotic treatment. The tools used by this group were systematic biological network and meta-analysis. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, loss of equilibrium between IL-10 and IL-17 and pulmonary acute damage known as \"cytokine storm\" are observed (Santacroce et al., 2021) . Probiotics could improve the inflammatory condition by regulating oxidative stress (Patra et al., 2021) . In this context it is important to emphasize that probiotic supplementation needs to be carefully evaluated because there are many different strains and multistrain products, whose profile of immune modulation is not likely to be the same. Some probiotic strains may promote anti-inflammatory response, but the opposite response is also possible to be observed. Although a proinflammatory state can be useful to accelerate viral clearance, in a context of cytokine storms, this strategy can put the lung function at risk, greatly hindering gas exchange at the alveolar level. According to Stavropoulou and Bezirtzoglou (2020b) special attention should be given to patients immunocompromised receiving corticosteroid therapy. In this situation probiotics should not be recommended.",

The same research group evaluated the intranasal administration of L. lactis W136 in twenty-three individuals within 96 h of diagnosis of COVID-19.

Reduction in the duration of the disease and the severity of symptoms as fatigue, olfactory dysfunction and breathlessness, nausea and vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms were some of the main findings.
