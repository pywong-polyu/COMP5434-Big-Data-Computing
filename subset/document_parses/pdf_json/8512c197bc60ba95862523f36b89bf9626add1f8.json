The most common presenting complaint in the COVID-19 cohort was a post-operative wound infection (n=5), of which two had deeper associated collections, with two further wound dehiscences. In the pre-pandemic group, four patients underwent their procedure overseas. Cases consisted of an abdominoplasty, a blepharoplasty, a breast augmentation and a gluteal augmentation. Two patients presented with a wound infection, and two with simple wound dehiscence.",

Many cosmetic surgery services abroad 6 were offering package deals of an operation combined with a holiday which was attractive to patients, especially amidst the UK lockdown and social distancing measures. The most popular destination in both cohorts was Turkey. As is often the case in the aesthetic sector, we do not have the denominator of the number of patients undergoing such procedures.",

At a time when the NHS was already stretched, the additional burden of complications from such procedures undertaken abroad was more difficult to manage.",

With the easing of restrictions for elective private surgery and air travel, we are likely to see an increase in the number of such cases. To ensure patient safety, surgeons should follow the guidance set out by aesthetic associations and ensure adequate COVID-19 screening. One could argue that such patients seeking surgery abroad should undertake additional insurance to account for possible complications that would need to be treated in the NHS on their return, although this would be difficult to enforce. Plastic surgery training should also include a robust grounding in aesthetic practice, as patients experiencing complications of these procedures are most likely to present to their departments.",
