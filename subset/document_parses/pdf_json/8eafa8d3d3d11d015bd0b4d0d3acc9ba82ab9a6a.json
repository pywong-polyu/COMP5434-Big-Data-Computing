It has been well documented that the pandemic has had widespread effects on physical health as well as mental health and wellbeing (Carf\u00ec et al., 2020; Krendl and Perry, 2020; Salari et al., 2020; Struyf et al., 2020; Zacher and Rudolph, 2020) . The pandemic has also been associated with changes in care-seeking behavior leading to reductions in preventative healthcare utilization, such as annual wellness visits and pediatric vaccinations, as well as declines in the use of hospital facilities for elective procedures (Chudasama et al., 2020; Santoli et al., 2020) . These changes have been attributed to several factors including fear of contracting the virus and shelter-in-place orders (Czeisler et al., 2020) . Changes in care-seeking behavior can have subsequent adverse effects in the future, such as late-stage cancer diagnosis or increased spread of vaccine-preventable diseases among unvaccinated children. Few studies have evaluated the consequences of behavioral changes due to the pandemic.",

            "text": "Previous evaluations have found large declines in emergency department use and inpatient admissions for acute conditions, such as myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic (Braiteh et al., 2020; Butt et al., 2020; Jeffery et al., 2020; Mantica et al., 2020) . The consequence of such a change in care-seeking behavior may be an increased likelihood of death from AMI or at a minimum, an increased risk of out-of-hospital death (Lai et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021; Wadhera et al., 2021) . Acute diagnoses such as myocardial infarction and subsequent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) require immediate medical attention and delays in seeking care may worsen outcomes. Previous studies have indicated that delaying treatment from symptom onset can significantly impact mortality (De Luca et al., 2003; Song et al., 2016) . Therefore, the reluctance to seek care for these conditions due to the ongoing pandemic may impact where people die. Thus, the goal of this study is to estimate the association between the pandemic and location of death for decedents of ischemic heart disease under the hypothesis that the pandemic changed care-seeking behavior leading to an increased probability of out-of-hospital death. Using death certificate data from the state of Arkansas, we compared the proportion of deaths occurring at home among individuals who died from ischemic heart disease before and during the pandemic, relative to deaths at home among those who died from non-natural causes such as suicides, unintentional injuries, and other causes likely that are unrelated to careseeking behavior.",

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, (ICD-10) codes obtained from the primary cause of death field on the death certificates were used to classify the cause of death. Ischemic heart disease-related deaths, which included acute myocardial infarction and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), (ICD-10: I20-I25) were compared to non-natural causes of death (i.e., unintentional injuries, suicides, and homicides) (ICD -ICD-10 -International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, 2020). Non-natural deaths were selected as a comparison group for the difference-in-difference (DID) analysis because the COVID-19 pandemic should have minimal impact on care-seeking behavior for these conditions resulting in no change for the locations of death. Non-natural causes of death were aggregated into one category to improve the stability of estimates associated with the relatively low numbers during the study period.",

To improve identification of treatment effects, the study used a DID analysis to estimate the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with dying at home among individuals who died from ischemic heart diseases compared to those who died from non-natural causes of death. A DID analysis is a quasi-experimental method that uses a control group (i.e., location of deaths for non-natural conditions) to serve as a counterfactual for what would have been expected to occur without a given treatment (i.e., the pandemic) (Wing et al., 2018) . A primary assumption of the DID approach is that trends in outcomes (i.e., deaths at home) remained similar in the treatment (ischemic heart disease) and control (non-natural deaths) groups in the time period prior to the intervention (COVID pandemic). The primary coefficient of interest in the DID model was the interaction between ischemic heart disease and the pandemic study period. The parallel trends assumption was tested using a linear yearly time trend in the pre-pandemic time period, from 2016 through 2019. The DID analysis used multivariable logistic regression to estimate outcomes controlling for age (as categories), gender, race, and Hispanic ethnicity.",

Generally, these therapies are administered in the emergency department.

There have been recent studies that brought attention to the decreased volume of patients presenting to the emergency department during the beginning of the pandemic (Barten et al., 2020; Garrafa et al., 2020; Jeffery et al., 2020; Mantica et al., 2020; Westgard et al., 2020) . A review of patient volume for 24 emergency departments across the United States (US) found decreases that ranged between 41.5% to 63.5% (Jeffery et al., 2020) . A study conducted in Italy highlighted the impact of \"fear week,\" a time period where lockdowns were implemented and daily press briefings regarding the pandemic were held (Garrafa et al., 2020) . Garrafa et al., found that \"fear week\" was associated with a 31.8% decrease in emergency department visits for a large teaching hospital in Italy (Garrafa et al., 2020) . Despite the decreases seen in emergency department visits during the pandemic, there is little evidence to suggest that the need for emergent care has decreased. In fact, Ciofani et al., found spikes in internet search volume related to chest pain during the pandemic (Ciofani et al., 2021) . The consequences of such changes in care-seeking behavior may be widespread.",

This study used death certificate data to assess whether there was a change in the location of death during the COVID-19 pandemic study period among individuals who died from ischemic heart disease relative to individuals who died from non-natural causes of death. The study findings indicate a drop in in-hospital deaths, with a 7.9 percentage point increase in deaths at home during the COVID-19 pandemic study period for decedents with ischemic heart disease. There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients who died from non-natural causes of death at home.

A prior analysis of excess mortality during the first two months of the pandemic found a 35% increase in deaths not attributed to COVID-19 (Woolf et al., 2020) . The largest increases in excess mortality were attributed to heart disease (Woolf et al., 2020) .

While these data are used for multiple reporting and public health activities, including those by the National Center for Health Statistics, it is possible that some data records may be later adjusted. Additionally, these data lack several variables that could have been useful in this study, such as insurance status, being in the presence of someone during symptom onset, and marital status, which have been identified to impact the propensity to seek treatment (Goff et al., 1999) . A final limitation is the lack of state-specific emergency department census data. These data would allow the researchers to examine the impact of the surges in COVID-19 cases, implementation of mask mandates, vaccination status, and other factors on the emergency department census within the state. Such data will not be available for research purposes for at least two years. Future studies should examine the impact of these factors on careseeking behaviors during the pandemic.",

Although we are currently unable to evaluate the long-term impacts of missed preventative care and screening, our study provides a clear indication that the pandemic was associated with negative consequences for people with ischemic heart disease likely resulting from changes in care-seeking behavior. The findings are consistent with the well-documented finding that fewer patients sought urgent care in the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued efforts should be aimed at helping patients identify what signs and symptoms indicate the urgent need for medical help and stressing the importance of seeking that care immediately.",
