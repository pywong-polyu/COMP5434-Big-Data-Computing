            "text": "Throughout the rise of modern medicine in the nineteenth century, the medical interview has long remained a physician's most effective tool for both rapport-building and diagnosis [1] . Even in today's high-tech world, this human-to-human interaction remains central to therapeutic relationships. Evidence suggests that in 90% of cases, physicians reach an accurate diagnosis during a medical interview alone [2] . Thus, thorough interviews where both parties participate in the conversation, result in better health outcomes for the patient [3] . Effective conversation is not unilateral, and the forces that moved medicine away from paternalism are to thank for improved, participatory interview processes. In partnership with their physicians, patients are now playing a more active role in their diagnosis and treatment, leaving them more satisfied and with an increased likelihood of treatment adherence [4] . Given these benefits, physicians cannot let the opportunity to make partners out of patients go to waste. As the medical professional in the relationship, it is the responsibility of the physician to facilitate these collaborative outcomes [5] .",

For truly effective interviews, a strength-based approach is best utilized as it can generate positive, effective, and sustainable results [6] . Whatever diagnostic method is chosen, it should never be considered an alternative to honest and open communication. Health educators have identified physician dependence on technology as a significant impediment to effective and informative patient dialogue [7] . Should this disruption impact the diagnosis process, physician-patient relationships are sure to suffer. When patients are dissatisfied with a medical experience, they are ultimately less likely to trust their physician [8] . Degradation of this crucial relational facet is further damaged if ineffective communication is translated as a lack of transparency [9] .

This approach examines poor experiences to identify the elements which lead to dissatisfaction and to generate recommendations that remedy the issues. For instance, a physician may find that an interview went poorly due to a patient refusing to discuss symptoms in favor of details that are of less diagnostic value. Based on this analysis, methods to refocus the discussion toward medically relevant details will likely be suggested [11, 12] . However, this dated method of analysis ultimately robs both the participants and the analyst of rich discussion. Further, deficit-based analyses can be counterproductive: for example, students who employ a deficit-based approach, where they focus on their weaknesses and attempt to improve upon them, face worse academic outcomes than their peers who practice the opposite strategy [13] . In general, people will perform better when they seek to build upon strengths rather than just eradicate weaknesses.",

AI is grounded in social constructionist epistemology, which utilizes a positive perspective to understand transformational change. This method was chosen for the study because it provides the necessary foundation to explore what makes for best practices in medical interviewing, rather than taking a more traditional, negative, problem-solving approach [16] . In doing so, physicians can deeply relate to and better diagnose their patients by learning the positive elements that optimize medical interviewing skills.

Researchers firstly read the transcripts several times to become familiar with the data. Then code data was generated by noting where similar discussions took place within the interviews. Code data was subsequently refined into themes. During this stage, data was mapped out and compared against the initial code data to ensure themes were consistent and unique in the dataset.

In one case, following probing by a physician, a gravely ill elderly patient revealed that he had no remaining family except for an estranged son. In this case, the physician stated that they \"decided to be proactive and instructed nursing staff to contact the son\". The outcome was not only medically beneficial for the patient, but the physician also remarked that it \"brought a lasting and positive change in the patient's life\". In a similar case, a patient facing a serious illness was not ready to accept the diagnosis and the physician felt that social support was required to move forward with the medical treatment.

Regarding a dying patient, conflicted about their death, one physician stated, \"I lent my ears to listen to his grief. The catharsis that he had after relating his story, was something that according to him none of the other physicians had offered him\". This act of compassionate listening afforded a dying man some peace. To establish any relationship, mutual respect is of essence. The overuse of medical terminology is counter to the idea of mutual respect. This sentiment was succinctly expressed by one participant during the investigation, \"Healthcare professionals should not use medical jargon which patients would be unable to understand\". Patients' level of medical understanding will vary; physicians should be attuned to determining this level and adjust accordingly.

One physician who managed to connect with a closed-off patient remarked that \"an atmosphere must be created in which the patients can speak of their deep-seated apprehensions and desires\". In line with this notion, a male physician noted that he chose to have a female nurse as a chaperone in the room after noticing a female patient's discomfort when discussing abortion. This adjustment helped ease the patient and enhanced the communicative process. By changing the environment, the patient was more comfortable communicating openly, resulting in a smoother interview process.

Moreover, they must remain present, both physically and emotionally, when communicating with patients. Active listening can be displayed in many ways. For example, a simple nod of the head demonstrates to the patient that they are understood. Poor listening habits may include focusing on a computer screen while the patient is explaining medical issues or pausing the interview to take a phone call.

The interviews uncovered the need for physicians to observe and interpret patient body language, including physical demeanor, gestures, and facial expressions. As explained by one participant, \"A physician should be observant enough to get cues from the patient's body language and eye movement\". Physicians can also use nonverbal cues to improve communication. During one interview, a participant made the following statement, \"[A patient] should regard the physician as a friend and healer and not as a superior being\". Physicians can adapt their body language to indicate friendliness by facing the patient directly, sitting down instead of standing, and kneeling beside or at the eye level of young children. If the physician is frowning, the patient may assume they said something wrong. Just as the patient's nonverbal cues influence physician perceptions, the opposite is also true; adjusting verbal tone and body language based on the patient's reaction is a valuable skill. In short, if a patient seems uncomfortable, physicians should be cognizant of such signals and make changes. In the physician-patient relationship, the onus to adjust is on the physician as they are the skilled care-provider. Patients are not uniform but rather complex individuals requiring personalized approaches, especially if something is noticeably amiss in their behavior. Each patient brings unique needs and characteristics, and physicians must continually communicate both verbally and nonverbally with patients to adapt to those needs.",

This change is contrary to one of the most prominent themes of patients' need for social support. This is especially important for individuals who demonstrate mental health disorders and mental illness. For over a year now, isolation has become standard in our Western society, which has negatively impacted many people's mental health. Unfortunately, as the threat of COVID-19 subsides, regaining social support may prove difficult for some, leading to sustained mental health issues.

Working with many patients with serious issues can weigh heavily on a physician, especially if they take excessive personal responsibility for patients' well-being. Thus, it is beneficial to partake in stress and burnout avoidance training programs to ensure a healthy work environment. Such training should educate physicians to take responsibility for patient outcomes without feeling unnecessarily responsible for factors beyond their control, such as terminal illnesses. The best outcomes for patients will be out of reach if burnout impairs work quality. Physicians must learn to self-assess and take individual or organizational steps to deal with symptoms of burnout, if present [34] .",

As physicians were asked to evoke their own best experience and describe it in a conversational style, results were vulnerable to distortion due to social-desirability bias; especially since the conversation relates to the physician's own medical interviewing prowess. The sampling method also limits this study; however, this is offset to some degree by the narrow aim of the study and by the established interview method delivered by a credentialed interviewer [35] . The topic could benefit from future quantitative or mixed-methods studies. Mental health, psychological trauma, and other ailments also represent rich quarries of analysis to determine how cognitive patterns and behaviors affect patient communication in medical settings. Larger studies regarding complex medical issues, both physical and psychological, will provide further insight into how medical interviews can be navigated in difficult cases. Barriers to face-to-face communication, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, may also be specifically analyzed, to determine how physical boundaries have affected relationships between physicians and patients. By exploring these areas, new information can emerge, resulting in more comprehensive medical interviews and improved patient outcomes.",

            "text": "As technology pervades our lives evermore, soft skills such as communication must never degrade through neglect. At the same time, opportunities to harness technology as a communicative advantage, and not a barrier, should be carefully considered. Using technology to augment the power of an effective medical interview can assist physicians in fine-tuning their skills. The theme of nonverbal cues indicates the importance of reading and communicating body language. Facial recognition technology may help physicians identify minute, nonverbal cues that signify discomfort. Artificial intelligence may be able to score levels of empathy recorded in a conversation, as a training and evaluation tool. Further analysis will reveal new pathways to improved communication, but more research is required. The opportunities are limitless and the benefits to patients much the same. A proper balance between physician skills and technological advancements must constantly be maintained, with the latter never overtaking and causing the former to lapse. The themes outlined in this study provide a basis for future exploration on a larger scale using novel methodologies in effective interview mechanics. However, one standard method will never fit every unique patient, so a keen aptitude for adaptation should forever be honed to continuously improve therapeutic relationships.",
