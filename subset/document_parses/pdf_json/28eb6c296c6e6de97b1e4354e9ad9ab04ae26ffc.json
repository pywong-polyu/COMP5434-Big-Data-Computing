            "text": "In similar situations where resources are in short supply, a procedure known as group testing (also known as pooled testing and specimen pooling) is often employed. Its most basic implementation begins by obtaining specimens from a set number of individuals and then pooling parts of each specimen into a \"group\" for a single test. If the group tests negative, all of its members are declared negative. If the group tests positive, each member has the remainder of their original specimen tested separately to determine the positive/negative outcome. This process of forming groups and testing is repeated over all individuals that need to be tested. Robert Dorfman originally proposed this particular testing algorithm to screen US soldiers for syphilis during World War II, and the process is often referred to now as \"Dorfman testing\". 1 When disease prevalence in a population is small (less than 15%), group testing results in a significant reduction in the number of tests performed. Group testing is used in a vast number of applications, including blood donation screening for infectious diseases (rcblood.org/3eQ2NHV), sexually transmitted disease detection, 2 bacteria in food detection, 3 and chemical compound discovery for use in new pharmaceuticals. 4 Group testing was even investigated for the influenza pandemic (H1N1) of 2009. 5 There are two important considerations for applying group testing. First, pooling specimens leads to each individual specimen being a smaller portion of the whole. This dilution could make it more difficult to detect the pathogen, thus potentially producing false negatives. Second, a group size needs to be selected. Too large a group size results in too many groups testing positive, leading to an exorbitant number of separate tests. Too small a group size results in many more group tests than needed. To prevent this from occurring, the expected number of tests is used to determine the most efficient group size. In other words, we want the group size that gives the smallest average number of tests if group testing was applied to a continuous stream of specimens coming into a laboratory. Our box (page 16) presents the technical details for selecting this group size.",

Their positivity rate was estimated to be 5% from initially testing specimens separately. The most efficient group size for Dorfman testing is 5 with this rate, resulting in 57% fewer tests on average than when testing specimens separately. Validation of the group testing process showed statistical principles -a consequence of the lack of statistical literacy that pervades the general population. (If the general population insisted on the use of random sampling to assess how widespread the virus is, leaders would not likely resist.) Or it could reflect concern over the limited availability of tests and a desire to devote all of these limited tests to those who show symptoms of novel coronavirus infection.",

After 6 days of actual implementation, Dorfman testing resulted in 58% fewer tests than if the same number of individuals had been tested separately. From another perspective, 137% more individuals were tested using the same resources as would be needed with separate testing. Figure 1 illustrates the expected efficiency of Dorfman testing in general. The reduction in the expected number of tests grows as the disease prevalence decreases, leading to an increase in testing capacity. Especially of interest is the extremely large increase in testing capacity for very low disease prevalence. This would likely occur if the stringent requirements for individuals to be tested were lessened to allow for testing asymptomatic individuals. For example, the increase in expected testing capacity is 411% when disease prevalence is 1%.",

The algorithm is similar to Dorfman testing, but groups that test positive are split into subgroups for further testing. If any subgroup tests positive, each of its members is tested separately. Figure 1 also shows that array testing increases testing capacity further as well. This algorithm involves arranging specimens into a matrix-like structure, where specimens are pooled by rows and by columns to form groups. Those specimens at intersections of positive rows and columns are retested to determine disease outcome. Many other group testing algorithms exist, including those that take advantage of individual-specific probabilities of positivity to increase testing efficiency.
