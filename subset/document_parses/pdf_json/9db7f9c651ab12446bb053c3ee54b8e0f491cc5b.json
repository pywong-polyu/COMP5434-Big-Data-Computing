For immunofluorescence with vWF and CD41 (Integrin alpha IIb, a marker of platelets and megakaryocytes) using paraffin-embedded human liver specimens, we deparaffinized the tissues and performed heat-induced epitope retrieval with citrate Buffer (0.1 M citric acid and 0.1 M sodium citrate). For immunofluorescence for fibrinogen, we deparaffinized the tissues and performed proteinase K-induced epitope retrieval. The sections were blocked in 5% normal donkey serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2103. The following antibodies were used: polyclonal rabbit anti-human vWF antibody (code A0082; dilution 1:200; Dako), monoclonal mouse anti-human CD41 (Integrin alpha IIb) antibody (sc-365938; dilution 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and polyclonal rabbit anti-human fibrinogen antibody (code A0080; dilution 1:100; Dako).

Demographics and selected covariates for the study population from the Yale DOM-CovX database.Significant differences between patients with and without ALT greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal included younger age, male sex, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, vasopressor use, and tocilizumab treatment (more prevalent in the high ALT group), and congestive heart failure, lipid disorder, hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction (MI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), atrial fibrillation/flutter, chronic kidney disease, alcohol use disorder, and solid tumor (more prevalent in the low ALT group). Patients with lower ALT had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities and alcohol use disorder, the converse of what would be expected if non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or alcohol-associated liver disease were responsible for the elevated ALT. No difference in the prevalence of preexisting liver disease was present between groups. Age shown as median (IQR)",
