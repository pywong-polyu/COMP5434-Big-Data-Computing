This decrease in the number of cases compared to 2019 can be seen numerically in both NSTEMI and STEMI patients, but this is significant in STEMI (overall cases p < 0.01, STEMI p = 0.02, NSTEMI p = 0.09). From calendar week 17, the number of NSTEMI cases increases again and reaches a level before the Lockdown (Figure 1 ). Focusing on the age of the patients who present with an ACS in Lockdown, it can be seen that, compared to 2019, those between 60 and 69 years of age present themselves significantly more often (p = 0.03) and between 70-79 (p = 0.01) years substantially less frequently. This trend is also evident in patients over 80 years of age ( Figure 2 ). seen that, compared to 2019, those between 60 and 69 years of age present themselves significantly more often (p = 0.03) and between 70-79 (p = 0.01) years substantially less frequently.

Fatally, studies have shown an exceptionally high ACS mortality in this age group [16, 17] . This phenomenon must be discussed; whether the multimedia attention to risk groups for a severe COVID-19 course in this age and the urgent political call for \"stay at home\" has led to an increased reluctance of the patients with regard to a clinical presentation. Meanwhile, existing data indicate that at the beginning of the pandemic, a relevant proportion of infections still took place in the hospital, while a low nosocomial infection rate is currently recorded [18, 19] . In Germany, however, most of the sources of infection are still unknown.",
