It is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, a disease that can have mortality rates as high as 100% in suckling piglets. PEDV causes severe economic loss, and has been in existence for decades. A panzootic starting in 2010 renewed interest in the development of a universal vaccine toward PEDV. This report details several design changes made to a Hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg)-based recombinant vaccine strategy, and their effect in vivo. Initially, several multi-antigen vaccine candidates were able to elicit antibodies specific to three out of four B-cell epitopes inserted into the chimeric proteins. However, a lack of virus neutralization led to a redesign of the vaccines. The focus of the newly redesigned vaccines was to elicit a strong immune response to the YSNIGVCK amino acid motif from PEDV. Genetically modified new vaccine candidates were able to elicit a strong antibody (Ab) response to the YSNIGVCK epitope, which correlated with an increased ability to neutralize the CO strain of PEDV. Additionally, the location of the inserted PEDV epitopes within the vector protein was shown to affect the immune recognition toward the native HBcAg during vaccination.",

The successful replication of PEDV in intestinal epithelial cells of young piglets causes malabsorptive diarrhea induced by decreased efficacy of brush border membrane-bound digestive enzymes and leaky junctions in the small intestine [13, 14] . The symptoms are severe enough in these cases to result in a death rate of nearly 100% upon exposure due to dehydration.

PEDV has an approximately 28 kb genome with ORFs arranged 5 0 to 3 0 in the order of: ORF1a, ORF1b, spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, ORF3, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. For most coronaviruses, the S protein undergoes post-translational modifications including cleavage into an S1 and an S2 domain [16] . This is not true for PEDV, but there is a conventional separation of the protein into these domains around amino acids (aa) 781/782. Recent research in recombinant vaccination against PEDV has predominantly focused on the S protein, with particular attention paid to the S1 domain [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . There are two known, small, and linear B-cell epitopes within the S1 domain corresponding to the aa sequences 748 YSNIGVCK 755 , and 764 SQYGQVKI 771 from the original CV777 strain [22] [23] [24] . An additional small B-cell epitope was discovered within the S2 domain corresponding to the aa sequence 1368 GPRLQPY 1374 [22] .

The resultant proteins are able to assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro after purification [26] . Used in a chimeric form, foreign antigens from other viruses can be inserted into the protein genetically for efficient immune system presentation from the VLP platform. HBcAg is typically divided into two separate domains for chimeric protein design. The change from the Nterminal to the C-terminal domain occurs around Isoleucine-80. Insertion of foreign epitopes near this residue will have a higher immunogenic response compared to an N-terminal or C-terminal insertion, and this site was identified as the major immunodominant region (MIR) [27] . Previous work by this lab used HBcAg as a vector protein in a novel PEDV vaccination strategy. During the original experiment, five treatment vaccines were designed including four candidates with each of the four ( 748 YSNIGVCK 755 , 764 SQYGQVKI 771 , 1368 GPRLQPY 1374 , 195 WAFYVR 200 ) linear B-cell epitopes inserted individually into the MIR. A fifth candidate had all four epitopes together in a linear peptide sequence inserted into the MIR of the HBcAg ''backbone\" protein [28] . The resultant epitope antibody (Ab) titers as measured by ELISA were not strongly correlated with virus neutralization with the exception of the 748 YSNIGVCK 755 motif. It was therefore concluded that an immune response to this particular antigen from PEDV might be more critical than others for virus neutralization. The inclusion of the YSNIGVCK epitope in future vaccine designs could therefore be critical to their efficacy.",

The elimination of three residues from the MIR of the HBcAg protein, 79 PIS 81 , was reported to increase the immune response to the inserted epitope [29] . This modification was performed for 5 vaccine candidates (Fig. 1B-D and Fig. 1F-G) . The addition of flexible, water-soluble residues between foreign epitope insertions at the MIR was also tested in two vaccine candidates to increase the solubility and presentation of the included antigens ( Fig. 1C and D) [30] . The substitution of two residues, D29C and R127C, in the HBcAg vector protein of two vaccine candidates ( Fig. 1D and G) was tested for increased efficacy. Assembly of HBcAg-based VLPs with these substitutions was previously shown by Lu et al to add a network of disulfide covalent bonds between pentamers and hexamers leading to an increased structural stability (Native VLP shown in Fig. S1A and C, additional disulfide bonds shown in red in Fig. S1B and D) [31] . Finally, the locations of the epitopes 1368 GPRLQPY 1374 and 195 WAFYVR 200 were changed so as to only include the 748 YSNIGVCK 755 motif in the MIR of the assembled VLPs.

Fig. 4A indicates that the addition of Alum to the formulation was detrimental to vaccine efficacy as measured by the immune response to the YSNIGVCK epitope (comparison of the HBcAg + SE candidate vaccine with and without alum added). This phenomenon appears to hold true for the HBcAg + SSM candidate as well. Interestingly, the addition of alum did not appear to disrupt the response to the mHBcAg + SSM vaccine, which was identical to the HBcAg + SSM vaccine with the exception of the D29C and R127C mutations. These results indicate the addition of Cysteine residues enabled the mHBcAg + SSM vaccine candidate to invoke an immune response even in the presence of alum, possibly due to the added network of disulfide bonds. However, inefficient antigen presentation in the MIR of the HBcAg + SSM candidate due to peptide interactions cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor to the low Ab response level. The mHBcAg + SSM candidate was also able to elicit an immune response to the Nterminal GPRLQPY and C-terminal WAFYVR epitopes as seen in Fig. 4B and C. Similar to the first animal trial, Ab titers for each treatment increased in a dose dependent manner throughout the experiment (data not shown).",

The Ab titers specific to the DHBcAg protein itself were therefore tested in conjunction with the individual epitope inserts. Results from Fig. 5A indicate that the Ab titers to DHBcAg were statistically similar across all treatments during the first animal trial, indicating that each vaccine induced an immune response, though not necessarily to the inserted epitopes (Fig. 3) . During the second animal trial (Fig. 5B) , however, the data suggest that the two vaccine candidates with an epitope inserted Nterminal to the Histidine tag (HBcAg + SSM and mHBcAg + SSM) had significantly lower Ab responses to DHBcAg compared to the other treatments. To further elucidate the immune response to the vector protein, Ab titers to an unrelated vector protein containing the same N-terminal Histidine tag and cleavage site were tested (AP205, as described in the materials and methods section). Fig. 5C and D indicate that all vaccines elicited a significantly higher Ab titer to the Histidine tag than those vaccines with a foreign epitope insertion N-terminal to the Histidine tag (HBcAg + SSM and mHBcAg + SSM), following the same pattern as the Ab titers to the whole DHBcAg protein. Together these data demonstrate that the histidine tag located at the N-terminus of the vaccine candidates may play a large role in Ab recognition to each protein, as has been seen previously by others, and the placement of an epitope N-terminal to the tag may reduce its immune interaction [40] .",

The elimination of the 79 PIS 81 residues and the addition of Serine residues between foreign epitopes tested during the first animal trial revealed a major flaw where either or both modifications prevented the presentation of the YSNIGVCK epitope. It is hypothesized that this phenomenon is due to residue interactions at the MIR of the VLP, as each modification is predicted to increase the flexibility of the region [29] . This newly added flexibility might therefore have removed a small a-helix native to the vector protein, allowing the new interactions to take place. These treatments were able to generate Abs to the other B-cell epitopes and to the vector protein, indicating that assembly of the VLPs with some antigen presentation did indeed take place. VN titers to these vaccine candidates were significant but low, indicating that high Ab titers to the SQSGQVKI, GPRLQPY, and WAFYVR epitopes are not necessarily associated with virus neutralization.",

Although neutralization is a key measurement, there may be a benefit to including multiple conserved antigens in a vaccine for future mutations in some strains. The HBcAg + SE protein was used as a positive control during the second animal trial in two different formulations. The addition of alum to the formulation of the HBcAg + SE treatment group appeared to be detrimental to its immune response as indicated by a lack of YSNIGVCK-specific Abs to the adjuvanted vaccine (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the HBcAg + SE + Alum treatment group was capable of inducing a response to DHBcAg (Fig. 5B) , possibly through the recognition of the Histidine tag (Fig. 5D) . Together, the data indicate that the HBcAg + SE VLPs were assembled with successful YSNIGVCK antigen presentation prior to formulation with alum, but the antigen presentation was reduced upon formulation leading to the Ab recognition of vector protein alone. The use of alum in an IP vaccine delivery may indeed reduce the immune response as seen by Chang et al. [41] . Cubas et al have also indicated that IP vaccine delivery of VLPs may not be the best route for drainage into the lymph nodes, which might reduce the exposure of the foreign antigens included in the VLP designs [42] . However, the complete elimination of an immune response to the foreign antigen with a similar immune response to the vector protein indicates that there may be additional factors present within this study. Future in vivo work may therefore require a more detailed analysis of the administration route as a possible variable in vaccine improvement.",

The mHBcAg + SSM vaccine, with the Cysteine substitutions, generated Abs specific to all three PEDV epitopes included (Figs. 4A-3C) and was able to neutralize virus (Fig. 6B) , while the non-substituted version elicited an immune response to the vector protein alone (Fig. 5B ). The sole difference between the HBcAg + SSM and mHBcAg + SSM candidate designs was in the vector protein located away from the MIR. Non-reduced PAGE analysis (Fig. S2B ) along with TEM images (Fig. 2G ) have indicated that there were no issues with assembly of the HBcAg + SSM VLPs. The difference in immune response therefore seems to indicate that the Cysteine residues have improved antigen presentation in the mHBcAg + SSM vaccine, possibly due to an increase in VLP stabilization as reported by Lu et al. [31] . We hypothesize this increased stabilization gives the mHBcAg + SSM vaccine a higher half-life in vivo, leading to a prolonged antigen presentation. However, this hypothesis was not investigated further. The placement of the GPRLQPY foreign epitope N-terminal to the Histidine tag in two vaccine candidates (HBcAg + SSM and mHBcAg + SSM) is correlated with a reduced immune reaction to DHBcAg when compared to all of the other treatments tested ( Fig. 5A and B) . Ab response to the histidine tag cannot be separated from that of DHBcAg in this case, as the Histidine tag was used for purification of the DHBcAg coat proteins used in the assay. However, ELISA values for an unrelated protein containing the same N-terminal sequence showed a similar pattern amongst all treatment groups (Fig. 5C and D) , indicating that the placement of the foreign epitope upstream may reduce the Ab recognition of the Histidine tag. These results may make physiological sense. If an extended N-terminus on the DHBcAg protein forms spikes upon VLP assembly, then it is possible that antigens located within that region (including Histidine tags) would have an opportunity to interact with immune cells [43] . The N-terminal placement of a more desirable epitope within this region may therefore cause a preferential interaction between the inserted foreign epitope and the immune system compared to that of the tag. It seems unlikely that the other changes (removal of 79 PIS 81 , C-terminal addition of the WAFYVR epitope) would influence the detection of the Histidine tag, but they cannot be ruled out as possibilities from the presented results. Fig. 6A and B indicates that a high Ab response to the YSNIGVCK epitope is of higher significance in vaccine design for virus neutralization compared to the other B-cell epitopes used in this study.",

Sera collected at Day 42 for each treatment group from (A) the first animal trial and (B) the second animal trial were tested for PEDV neutralization in vitro. These same serum samples were subsequently tested for their ability to bind to PEDV without neutralization measurement (C). Each treatment group's mean titer is compared to both the DHBcAg and PBS Only negative controls by ANOVA analysis. Standard error bars are shown for each treatment group ( * = P 0.05, ** = P 0.01, *** = P 0.001).",

            "text": "Although several design changes were made between the two animal trials outlined in this report, the individual epitope Ab concentrations were measured using the same assay. Furthermore, the significance of the YSNIGVCK motif has been implicated in previous reports by this lab as well as others [24, 28] . The inclusion of B-cell epitopes other than YSNIGVCK in vaccines for PEDV elicited Abs to multiple peptide sequences without any increase in VN titers. This result would make sense if virus neutralization were more dependent upon the concentration of Abs specific to the YSNIGVCK peptide sequence, meaning the addition of other epitope specific Abs have diminished returns. Since apoptosis of piglet intestinal epithelial cells is of primary concern, virus neutralization should be of the utmost importance. One possible explanation for the discrepancy in VN titers could be a fundamental difference in the GPRLQPY amino acid presentation in the context of the recombinant VLP compared to that of the native PEDV virus. If a difference were to exist, then it would be expected that Abs generated by the E. coli expressed proteins would have reduced or negligible binding to the PEDV virions. However, WV ELISA results (Fig. 6C ) demonstrate a strong correlation between epitope Ab titers and WV titers independent of the antigen sequence. Thus it seems as though the preferential neutralization of the YSNIGVCK epitope is a true phenomenon. VN results in this report are based on systemic IgG levels in a murine model. The results may therefore not correlate directly with prevention of viral infection in the mesenteric epithelia of suckling piglets without further development. However, the results herein help demonstrate an improved efficacy of a vaccine in generating neutralizing Abs toward PEDV. Future studies building on these results should therefore include strategies to enhance lactogenic immunity from the pregnant sow in the form of secretory IgAs specific to the YSNIGVCK antigen.",
