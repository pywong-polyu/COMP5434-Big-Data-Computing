We aim to investigate predictors of the development of OI in the patients with AAD. Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical data of AAD in hypertensive patients from July 2012 to March 2020. The patients included in this study were divided into OI (+) group (oxygenation index\u2264200) and OI (\u2212) group (oxygenation index> 200). Both groups were compared according to demographic and clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings. Characteristics of hypertension in the patients with AAD were described. Predictors for the development of OI were assessed. And cutoff values were determined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve.",

In OI (+) group, patients had significantly higher peak body temperature (37.85 \u00b1 0.60 vs 37.64 \u00b1 0.44\u00b0C, P = .005), higher levels of CRP (42.70 \u00b1 28.27 vs 13.90 \u00b1 18.70 mg/L, P = .000) and procalcitonin (1.07 \u00b1 3.92 vs 0.31 \u00b1 0.77\u03bcg/L, P = .027), and lower levels of albumin (34.21 \u00b1 5.65 vs 37.73 \u00b1 4.70 g/L, P = .000). Spearman's rank correlation test showed that the minimum oxygenation index was positively correlated with albumin, and was negatively correlated with the peak body temperature, serum CRP, procalcitonin, BNP and troponin. The stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that the peak body temperature, serum CRP and albumin were independently associated with development of OI. An optimal cutoff value for CRP for predicting OI was \u22659.20 mg/L, with a sensitivity of 91.0% and a specificity of 61.0%. Conclusions: The peak body temperature, serum CRP and albumin were independent predictors of OI development in the patients with AAD. The serum CRP on admission\u22659.20 mg/L might be a valuable and reliable indicator in predicting the development of OI.",

AAD can cause several organs damage, such as acute lung injury, heart hypofunction, and dysfunction of liver and kidney, etc. Oxygenation impairment (OI) is frequently complicated in the patients with AAD due to acute lung injury, with a reported incidence of up to more than a half [4, 5] . Patients with OI may necessitate mechanical ventilation, and long-term use of ventilator probably can lead to pulmonary infections which can prolong the use of mechanical ventilation and increase intensive-care unit stay.

The first stage of inflammatory reactions is the long-term chronic inflammation in the aorta in the patients with hypertension. Inflammation, oxidative stress and genetic predisposition play great roles in the pathogenesis of hypertension [13] . Chronic low-grade inflammation exists in the course of hypertension, triggers the progress of hypertension and contributes to vascular remodeling [9, 14, 15] . Angiotensin II also serves an important inflammatory roles in hypertension; it can induce macrophages to differentiate into the M-1 type, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and stimulate the attachment and migration of leukocytes [15, 16] . The second stage of inflammatory reactions is the rapid development to acute inflammation after aortic injuries [5, 6] . And it can subsequently develop to systemic inflammatory reactions syndrome (SIRS) due to uncontrolled inflammatory cascade [17] . Aortic samples from the patients with aortic dissection revealed a large amount of macrophages infiltration [18] . A large number of cytokines have also been found infiltrating the aortic wall of patients with aortic dissection, such as IL-6 and IL-17 [12] . It was reported that levels of IL-11 and interferon \u03b3 were increased in blood samples in acute thoracic aortic dissection [19] . In this present study, there was no correlation between the development of OI and hypertension grade, hypertension course, previous blood control, and antihypertensive strategy, suggesting that the impact of chronic inflammation in hypertension is limited in the development of OI.

            "text": "Systemic inflammatory reactions play key roles in the pathogenesis of acute lung injuries and the development of OI. Recent studies found that AAD complicated with acute lung injury was highly associated with the macrophages infiltrating the pulmonary interstitial tissue and [20, 21] . Inflammatory reactions can cause fluid to leak across alveolar-capillary barrier because of increased permeability and produce enough alveolar edema to cause the clinical characteristics of refractory hypoxemia [22] . In mice model, IL-22 could significantly attenuate the incidence and severity of angiotensin II induced acute lung injury [23] . Hence, concerns on antiinflammatory agents and some protective cytokines will help find insights on the therapeutic strategy for acute lung injury and OI development in AAD. Very limited has been known about the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and OI development in the patients with AAD, so further studies need to be conducted. Given the great roles of inflammatory reactions in the development of OI, inflammatory markers should be especially investigated in predicting OI development in the patients with AAD. Inflammatory markers can reflect the severity of SIRS, and in turn it may be predictors of OI development. CRP, a highly sensitive marker of systemic inflammation, is an acute-phase protein induced by proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 [24] . Elevated CRP was indicated in the patients with AAD [25] , and it can be a prognostic factor to be independently associated with inhospital death [24, 26] . Procalcitonin has also been advocated as a diagnostic parameter in systemic inflammation and infectious diseases [27] . Recent studied showed that postoperative levels of procalcitonin could be used to predict adverse outcome in acute type-A aortic dissection [28, 29] . We first described the characteristics of procalcitonin in the patients with OI in AAD. Our study showed the negative correlation between the 2 inflammatory markers, CRP and procalcitonin, and the development of OI. The peak body temperature was significantly elevated in the patients with OI and negatively correlated with the occurrence of OI, further increasing the evidence that systemic inflammatory reactions contribute to the development of OI in the patients with AAD. Upon an inflammatory challenge, hepatic and pulmonary macrophages (and later brain endothelial cells) start to release lipid mediators, including prostaglandin E 2 and cytokines [30] . Blood prostaglandin E 2 enters the brain and triggers fever, and at later stages of fever, prostaglandin E 2 synthesized within the blood-brain barrier maintains fever [30] . Albumin is both an important nutritional indicator and an acute-phase protein involved in inflammatory response [31] . Lower serum albumin levels were indicated in SIRS [32] . Decreased albumin levels have also been found in some cardiovascular diseases, of which inflammatory reaction participates in the pathogenesis, including heart failure and coronary heart disease [33, 34] . Its synthesis is stimulated by hormones and can be inhibited by pro-inflammatory substances, including IL-6 [35] . In inflammatory states, albumin distribution alters from intravascular to extravascular compartments due to increased microvascular permeability [36, 37] . And increased depletion of albumin further leads to the negative albumin balance [37] . We firstly introduce the value of albumin in predicting OI in the patients with AAD. We guess that decreased levels of albumin in the patients with OI are perhaps due to more severe inflammatory reactions.",

Hence, the predicting value of the peak body temperature and albumin was actually limited. Our study showed that the serum CRP \u2265 9.20 mg/L might be a valuable predictor of OI development in AAD patients. CRP is a simple, widely available, and in-expensive test.
