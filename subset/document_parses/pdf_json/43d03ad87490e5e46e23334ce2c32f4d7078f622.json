The attentional capture paradigm is regularly used to study conditions of attentional control. It has up to now not been used to assess influences of sudden onset distractor stimuli in MOT. We investigated whether attentional capture does occur in MOT: Are onset distractors processed at all in dynamic attentional tasks? We found that sudden onset distractors were effective in lowering probe detection, thus demonstrating attentional capture. Tracking performance as dependent measure was not affected. The attentional capture effect persisted in conditions of higher tracking load (Experiment 2) and was dramatically increased in lower presentation frequency of the onset distractor (Experiment 3). Tracking performance was shown to suffer only when onset distractors were presented serially with very short time gaps in between, thus effectively disturbing re-engaging attention on the tracking set (Experiment 4). We discuss that rapid disand re-engagement of the attention process on target objects and an additional more basic process that continuously provides location information allow managing strong disruptions of attention during tracking.",

In typical Experiments, observers follow a number of predefined targets out of a set of identical objects presented on a screen for an interval of time. Processes of visual attention are the central components in most current models of MOT (for reviews, see Cavanagh & Alvarez, 2005; Meyerhoff, Papenmeier, & Huff, 2017; Scholl, 2009) .

Attentional selection of stimuli is assumed to be accomplished either endogenously or exogenously. Stimuli are selected because of voluntary, endogenous, modulation of attention or they are selected because events occurring in the world automatically, exogenously, draw attention toward these stimuli (Awh, Belopolsky, & Theeuwes, 2012; Jonides, 1981; Posner, Snyder, & Davison, 1980 , additionally discuss selection history). Such latter involuntary shifts of attention are also referred to as attentional capture (for reviews, see Burnham, 2007; Rauschenberger, 2003; Ruz & Lupia\u00f1ez, 2002; Theeuwes, 2010) . Whether this attentional capture is modulated by top-down attentional control or whether it is strictly stimulus-driven is a debate still not resolved (Gaspelin, Ruthruff, & Lien, 2016; Luck, Gaspelin, Folk, Remington, & Theeuwes, 2020) .",

It is an interesting question whether these can be effectively distracted. Pylyshyn (2001) assumed core processes of MOT to be pre-attentive. According to Pylyshyn (2001, p. 146 ) the loss of an object during tracking could be due to an index being \"grabbed\" by the \"appearance of a new visual object.\" But up to now there is no empirical evidence that a momentary interruption of pre-attentive or attentional processes is detrimental to MOT. This seems surprising as there is a plethora of studies for other classic paradigms of attention (as visual search or rapid serial visual presentation [RSVP] ; for reviews see Rauschenberger, 2003; Ruz & Lupia\u00f1ez, 2002; Theeuwes, 2010) investigating consequences of interruption of attention.

Studies referred to as target recovery tasks (St. Clair, Huff, & Seiffert, 2010) have shown that tracking performance does not suffer when objects suddenly disappear for some time (Alvarez, Horowitz, Arsenio, DiMase, & Wolfe, 2005; Horowitz, Birnkrant, Fencsik, Tran, & Wolfe, 2006; Keane & Pylyshyn, 2006) . Gap times in these experiments ranged from 107 to even 900 ms. In all of these studies, observers were able to compensate the temporary loss of online information and successfully continued tracking when objects reappeared. A tracking study by Bahrami (2003) closely resembles an attentional capture paradigm. He presented unexpected events (mud splashes) during tracking to hide changes within objects. Of interest here is the result that, although the mud splashes suddenly covering the entire screen could be expected to cause massive interruptions, they did not affect performance. Feria (2012) presented additional distractors with distinct features in an MOT-task and found no negative effect on performance in comparison to a no additional distractors condition; she discussed this finding in terms of a potential attentional capture effect that this stimulus constellation might have had in visual search but did not show in tracking.",

Makovski and Jiang (2009) , for example, found detrimental effects of target-distractor pairing; Erlikhman, Keane, Mettler, Horowitz, and Kellman (2013) comprehensively demonstrated an influence of certain stimulus features, although they were detrimental to performance and irrelevant to task goals. In their experiments, targets and distractors shared features leading to automatic grouping thus impairing performance. This poses an interesting problem. Most researchers in tracking would agree that tracking of objects is accomplished by applying attentional mechanisms. From attentional capture studies we know that most attentional mechanisms can be captured; an effect that has been shown to be stable even under more general conditions (e.g. Forster & Lavie, 2008a; Forster & Lavie, 2008b) . It seems unlikely that attention in tracking is impermeable to additional distractors that onset abruptly and are irrelevant to the tracking task. Every dynamic actionwalking, driving, carefully monitoring multiple streams of action in general -requires a capability to adapt to sudden unexpected changes. Therefore, it seems rather implausible that unexpected events are not registered when they happen. On the other side, it certainly would not be adaptive if dynamic actions broke down every time something unexpected happened.",

If a cue or an irrelevant distractor is present in a trial, reaction time or error rate increase, thus indicating that attention has been captured. Following this conceptualization tracking performance would suffer when unexpected stimuli are displayed in MOT. In target recovery studies MOT was interrupted for periods lasting up to 900 ms (Keane & Pylyshyn, 2006) . However, the temporal course of attentional capture is estimated to last only maximal 200 ms (Kim & Cave, 1999; Lamy, Tsal, & Egeth, 2003) . Theeuwes, Atchley, and Kramer (2000) systematically varied the stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) between presentation of distractor and search display. In these studies, attentional prioritization was first found on the salient irrelevant distractors and latest after 200 ms back again on the targets. These results are corroborated by a study using single cell recordings in primates trained to perform attentional tasks (Ogawa & Komatsu, 2004) .",

This was accomplished by dot-probing locations on which attention should reside in accordance with the current task goals -the target objects -but was expected to be dislocated by an additional onset distractor. The background for this is the still pending question of how attention is distributed in MOT. Prominent theories of MOT provide differing answers: Models that assume multiple foci (Cavanagh & Alvarez, 2005) or indexes (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988) ; models that assume only one central attentional focus (Oksama & Hy\u00f6n\u00e4, 2008) ; other models propose a distribution of attention among a group of objects (Yantis, 1992 ). Yet, other models assume a flexible resource (see Alvarez & Franconeri, 2007 , for a discussion). The method used in our study complies with all these theoretical concepts. By focusing on absence of attention on targets we were able to rule out the possibility that only some of the attentional resource or that only one of many attentional foci or indexes would be captured. Thus, we were able to operationalize attentional capture as a loss of attention on an object in terms of missed probes -a definition that meets conditions of every model mentioned above.",

In pilot studies (N = 27) we found a substantial effect size: Cohen's d > 1 (55% probes detected less if probes were preceded by an onset distractor; R, R Core Team 2018, and the \"effsize\"-package by Torchiano, 2020, were used for estimates of Cohen's d). Additionally, we were also interested in tracking performance as a second dependent variable. We defined loss of half an object as a theoretically relevant measure for attentional capture. On the basis of a different pilot sample (N = 72), we determined an effect size of 0.9 (Cohen's d) to correspond with this definition, which equals a \"large\" effect (Cohen, 1992) , which seems adequate in comparison to the effect size for the probe detection data. In order to be able to demonstrate effects of the latter dependent variable, the lower effect size was used as the basis for a sample size estimate. A power analysis based on an alpha value of .05 and beta of .95 was conducted. In the Results section, several comparisons and interactions are reported. The effect of interest, however, is the effect that the onset distractor has on probe detection and tracking performance, respectively. Therefore, we estimated sample sizes for comparisons of two means. We found a minimal sample size of least 19 subjects was required in order to observe a possible effect of presentation of onset distractors on tracking (\"pwr\"-package; Champely, Ekstrom, Dalgaard, Gill, Weibelzahl, Anandkumar, Ford, Volcic, & De Rosario, 2020) .",

Location of probes was randomized with the following restrictions: in half of the trials, the first probe was on a target. In order to avoid sequence effects, maximally two (4 probes per trial) or three probes (5 probes per trial) in any trial appeared sequentially on identical types of objects. Probes were presented randomly in the movement phase with a minimal interval of 1500 ms between two probe onsets, which was also the minimal interval for the first probe in the movement phase. The last probe was presented at least 1000 ms before the end of the movement phase. Keypresses of observers within 1000 ms following a probe were registered as a reaction to it. As location of within object type was not restricted, probes could appear on the exact same object within one trial. Probes were presented on distractors also in order to avoid that probes became informative of the role of the object they were presented upon. Our design had one factor with three levels: mode of presentation of onset distractor with the levels no onset distractor preceding the probe, an onset distractor with a short SOA (100 ms) preceding the probe, or an onset distractor with a long SOA (1500-2500 ms) preceding the probe. The factorial level of a long SOA was introduced in order to prevent a response strategy of reacting to onset distractors instead of probes. The temporal placement of an onset distractor was randomized with two exceptions: an onset distractor was never presented before the first probe in a trial, and the interval between the probes in which the onset distractor was presented had to be long enough to accommodate the respective SOA.",

(2000) demonstrated that -given an SOA longer than 150 ms -a singleton no longer interfered with search reaction time in their paradigm.

The critical manipulation was that in the high load condition there were five different letters that shared features with the target letter whereas in the low load condition the distractor letters consisted of five o's. Cosman and Vecera (2009) confirmed effects of load on attentional capture in visual search. In hybrid flanker and feature search tasks, they demonstrated that attentional capture depended on a low perceptual load setting. Stimulus sets in their experiments consisted either of one relevant letter plus two task-irrelevant flankers for low load conditions or of six relevant letters plus two task-irrelevant flankers for high load conditions. Irrelevant distractors in this series of experiments were either onset or offset flankers (Cosman & Vecera, 2009) or motion-onset flankers (Cosman & Vecera 2010a) .",

However, in contrast to possible predictions based on load theory, probe detection still distinctly suffered even under the high load condition of Experiment 2 when probes appeared shortly (100 ms) after a salient onset distractor. In Experiment 2, the attentional capture effect even appeared prolonged. It was still detectable in the long SOA condition, which was added for methodological reasons -an unpredicted effect and thus a serendipitous result most likely due to the higher load demands of Experiment 2. Experiment 2 thus corroborates the findings of Experiment 1 and demonstrates the robustness of the attentional capture effect in MOT.

Low frequency condition: the difference in probe detection between probes with short SOA and probes following no onset distractor was highly significant ( Comparisons between low and high frequency blocks showed that frequency significantly affected the difference between rate of detection of probes that were presented shortly after an onset distractor (t [21] = 6.64, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.90, 95% CI [0.93, 2.87]) with lower probe detection in the low frequency block; whereas detection rate of probes presented after a long SOA did not differ between low and high frequency blocks (t [21] = 0.34, p = 0.738, Cohen's d = 0.07, 95% CI [\u22120.37, 0.52]); however, the detection rate of probes that followed no onset distractor in the low frequency condition was significantly higher than in the high frequency block (t [21] = 3.35, p = 0.003, Cohen's d = 0.22, 0.36] ).",

Presentation of up to four onset distractors per second lead to effective disruption of the tracking process. Huff et al. (2010) studied the processes involved in critical tracking situations. They examined gaze behavior in tracking after substantial disruptions and found less gaze on targets only for the first 500 ms after a viewpoint change, a sudden change of the perspective of the observer on the tracking array, whereas gaze on the centroid of the targets remained unaffected. The authors assumed that looking at the centroid aided the process of re-establishing the tracking set. In Experiment 4, frequency of distraction of attention was so high that the interval needed to re-establish the tracking mechanism after a disrupting event was itself disrupted. As the experiments of Huff et al. (2010) imply, a specific mechanism serves to reconstitute tracking. The frequent presentation of the onset distractor presumably prevented this mechanism to become effective. The deterioration of tracking performance induced by this continuous dislocation of attention provides evidence that although an additional component is necessary to direct attention as a beacon, it does not suffice alone to maintain tracking. Doran and Hoffman (2010) provided electrophysiological results that showed that attentional mechanisms are only optional for low tracking loads well below the load used in our experiments.",

However, the number of objects in each single moment of a trial in Experiment 4 -eight objects plus one onset distractorwas less than in the high load condition of Experiment 2, in which there were 10 objects plus the occasional onset distractor. Mind that there was no moment in a trial in Experiment 4 in which there was more than one onset distractor. Thus, crowding as a \"failure of individuation due to proximity\" (Franconeri et al., 2008, p. 802) would have been more likely in Experiment 2, which showed no effect of onset distractor presentation on tracking performance. One further argument is worth considering when discussing crowding. Bae and Flombaum (2012) showed that tracking performance was higher in trials in which nontargets changed to a different color from the color of the targets whenever a nontarget was within a critical distance of 4 degrees of visual angle from a target and thus showed that color changes can prevent tracking errors. In our experiment, the onset distractor was specifically chosen to be very salient and thus very different from the objects of the tracking set. Following Bae and Flombaum, the saliency of the onset distractors in our experiments would facilitate individuation and prevent tracking errors.",

In each of these paradigms, the performance in processing of a stimulus is decreased when another stimulus precedes it (or follows it in the case of backward masking) within relatively short intervals: typically less than \u00b1150 ms for masking (Enns & Di Lollo, 2000) , typically more than 150 ms for temporal crowding (Yeshurun, Rashal, & Tkacz-Domb, 2015) , and typically 200-500 ms for attentional blink (Dux & Marois, 2009 ). These paradigms, however, seem different to our findings as a central requirement for each of these is that the crucial stimuli are presented in \"spatiotemporal vicinity\" (Agaoglu, Breitmeyer, & Ogmen, 2018, p. 1) . In masking and temporal crowding, critical stimuli are placed on the same position or are closely adjacent (Enns & di Lollo, 2000 , Yeshurun et al., 2015 ; the attentional blink is typically demonstrated in a RSVP, where stimuli are typically placed in one RSVP-stream (Dux & Marois, 2009 ; but see Potter, Staub, & O'Connor, 2002 , who used two streams separated by only 0.4 degrees).",

Cavanagh, Holcombe, and Chou (2008) found an interval of even as little as 50 ms to be enough for dynamic attention to sufficiently process one stimulus before arrival of the next stimulus. Even if we account for some time of travel of attention from the stimulus of interest, a target, for example, to the disrupting stimulus and back, the processes of disruption and redeployment will not take long enough for the stimulus array to change enough that resuming tracking would become impossible. Because of this potential of dynamic attention to deal promptly with disruptions, monitoring dynamic scenes can be accomplished with high stability.",

Processes of visual attention are considered the central components in most theories of MOT. However, theories still differ on the exact form of these processes. Most concepts include either a number of tracking mechanisms, examples of such concepts are FLEXes -a flexible number of tracking mechanisms limited by a shared resource (Alvarez & Franconeri, 2007) , or multifocal attention (Cavanagh & Alvarez, 2005) or -the preconceptual -sticky indexes of the FINST-theory (Pylyshyn, 2001) ; other models propose a single process that organizes objects into a virtual polygon (Yantis, 1992 ; see also Zhao, Gao, Ye, Zhou, Shui, & Shen, 2014 , for evidence in multiple identity tracking) or a single attentional spotlight refreshing visual short term memory (Oksama & Hy\u00f6n\u00e4, 2008) or object files (Kahneman, Treisman, & Gibbs, 1992) . All these models share the common notion that some kind of visual attention (or preconceptual index) is deployed to the task at hand or -as in MOT -to various objects of interest. We were interested in the nature of this deployment and tried to influence it directly by trying to divert it from the focused objects. The current experiments demonstrated that it is indeed possible to capture attention set on multiple moving objects. This seems remarkable given the impressive robustness of MOT against interruptions (see also target recovery studies). We replicated our findings and specified some of the conditions that determine its extent. We were able to show that the attentional capture phenomenon we found was not diminished by task load; it appeared even prolonged in conditions of higher load -a provisional finding as it was not hypothesized a priori (Experiment 2). The attentional capture effect was increased substantially when frequency of onset distractors was lowered (Experiment 3). Finally, in Experiment 4, we demonstrated attentional capture in terms of deterioration of tracking performance.",

Although the onset-cues used in our experiments were chosen to be phenomenologically impressive and at best startling, there was no detrimental effect on tracking when these cues were presented on arbitrary points of time (Experiments 1, 2, and 3). As Kim and Cave (1999) and Lamy et al. (2003) , we found attentional capture effects by probing for attention. Thus, we were able to show that immediately after a salient onset distractor appears during a tracking trial, attention moves rapidly away from the targets -and probably toward this new object. Huff et al. (2012) found diminished probe detection on the boundaries between two meaningful events. To register the interruption in the chain of events, their observers had to track the development of a basic story (a soccer match). In contrast to their study, we assume that the attentional dislocation described here is a process of involuntary orienting. Thus, a substantial amount of the probes following the salient onset distractors remained undetected, whereas other probes not preceded by onset distractors were registered in a rate nearly touching ceiling.",

By means of salient cues we elicited a detachment of attention that led to a measurable absence of attention. The dependent measure in paradigms probing attention generally is reaction time. The underlying logic hereby is that if attention is captured, it takes longer to finally detect a probe resting on a target. What this method actually does is to sum up the course of attentional deployment in a given interval of time. It provides reliable and valid information about the distribution of attention. However, this measure does neither tell us anything about how effectively attention was captured nor about the exact temporal course of its allocation. The dynamic nature of the MOT task allowed us to use absence as an indirect measure. It can signal if attention resides on a certain location and it can do this with very high temporal resolution. On the grounds of this logic, we found that presenting a salient onset distractor led to a pronounced dislocation of attention. Probes that were undisturbed were detected in a rate of about 90% in Experiments 1 and 3. When salient distractors preceded probes by a very short interval of time, detection rate dropped markedly. By concentrating on the misses in probe detection, we were able to measure the time course of the dislocation of attention. With a stimulus onset asynchrony of 100 ms between onset distractor and probe, probe detection rate sank to a minimum of 38%. When onset distractors preceded probes with an SOA of 1500 to 2500 ms, probe detection was again fully reconstituted if task load was relatively low. In conditions with higher load (Experiment 2), the attentional capture effect was still detectable for probes with a longer SOA.",

            "text": "Our experiments provide a model explanation for the robustness of the MOT task against interruptions. It is not the case that attention is rigidly fixed on objects. It can be \"grabbed\" (Pylyshyn, 2001, p. 146 ) and dragged to other locations. However, attention is rapidly disengaged (see also Theeuwes, 2010 and Theeuwes, De Vries, & Godijn, 2003 , for a thorough discussion of the temporal course of attentional disengagement) and returned to the relevant targets. In our experiments, attentional mechanisms returned back to the targets efficiently to take up tracking without any performance cost. As the target recovery studies (see above) already demonstrated, it is possible to take up tracking without any cost after interruptions of up to 900 ms (Keane & Pylyshyn, 2006) . Our experiments thus broaden the base of evidence for the impressive stability of the representation of multiple dynamic objects. Only when frequency of presentation of onset distractors within one trial was dramatically increased -from one in the first three experiments to three to four per second in Experiment 4 -was tracking affected. Even then loss of tracking performance was considerably small. suggested a two-dimensional spatial memory model (parallel memory access model) as the backbone of the robustness of the tracking system against interruption. We assume that such a memory system as an additional tracking mechanism can offer plausible explanations for our tracking data. On basis of our findings, we assume that a current representation of the state of the relevant objects in this theoretical memory component is constantly available. A tracking system can therefore continue where it left at any given time -even though it has been drawn away from the task unforeseeably. Models of MOT that include more than one process (e.g. Doran & Hoffman, 2010; Oksama & Hy\u00f6n\u00e4, 2008; St\u00f6rmer et al., 2013) do explicitly assume an additional routine that manages tracking of multiple items. A plausible explanation for the stability of MOT against interruptions on the basis of such models would be that attention as one process can be captured while the other routine continues keeping spatiotemporal coordinates ready to guide attention back to the designated objects, thus leaving MOT unharmed by sudden disruptions. Although the time span for which the attentional mechanism is absent from the targets is relatively short, a routine that effectively reassigns it to the relevant stimuli is nevertheless necessary. It seems likely that it was the attentional process and not a basic mechanism like the FINSTs that was captured as performance was unaffected in this experiment and we assume such basic processes to constantly provide the necessary dynamic location information. Thus, although online allocation of attention in a dynamic task was effectively influenced by sudden presentation of irrelevant salient distractors, tracking itself was interrupted only when the attentional re-engagement was constantly disturbed, as in Experiment 4.",

            "text": "Our study touches another aspect of attention: The onset distractors in the current experiments were irrelevant, so attending to them would have been orthogonal to the task. It is of foremost importance to monitor \"historical continuity\" (Pylyshyn, 2004, p. 804 ) in a tracking paradigm. Therefore, stimuli that onset suddenly beside the relevant target locations were of no importance. Our findings thus also bear some relevance to the discussion of attentional control (see also Burnham, 2007, and Van der Stigchel, Belopolsky, Peters, Wijnen, Meeter, & Theeuwes, 2009 , for reviews). Criteria for automatic information processing, as discussed by Yantis and Jonides (1990) and Neo and Chua (2006) , are the load-insensitivity criterion and the intentionality criterion. Experiments 1 and 4 clearly established attentional capture in a MOT paradigm. Experiment 2 contrasted with findings of attentional capture in static tasks like visual search, in which manipulation of task load influenced the extent of the attentional capture effect (Cosman & Vecera, 2009; Cosman & Vecera, 2010a; Forster & Lavie, 2008a; Forster & Lavie, 2008b) . Although increasing object number from eight to 10 objects affected task difficulty, Experiment 2 replicated the attentional capture effect seen in Experiment 1. Attentional capture in MOT with salient onset distractors thus seems to fulfill the load-insensitivity criterion. In accordance with the study of Neo and Chua (2006) , we also found frequency of the onset cue to affect the attentional capture effect (Experiment 3). In contrast to Neo and Chua, the attentional capture effect was found in our experiments in all frequency conditions. Thus, the intentionality criterion may not be violated, although further studies are necessary to thoroughly examine this claim. The attentional capture found in our experiments was \"not subject to voluntary control\" (Yantis & Jonides, 1990, p.122) . Thus, it might be feasible to speak of the effect as an automatic reaction (see also Rauschenberger, 2003, and Theeuwes, 2010 , for a discussion of stimulus-driven capture; see Erlikhman et al., 2013 , for automatic processes in MOT), although not strongly automatic (Kahneman & Treisman, 1984) .",

In the consequence, attention is drawn away from the current focus to these irrelevant stimuli. However, these stimuli are categorized rapidly as irrelevant and attention is quickly disengaged. A continuously updated -probably basic -mechanism provides the necessary location information to guide attention back to the relevant signal. A conclusion our paradigm allows is that besides this basic mechanism there is some kind of an attentional focus on targets in MOT. The absence of this focus leads to an interruption of stimulus processing at the location of the targets. Although in the current form our paradigm does not inform about the exact nature of this attentional focus or the hypothesized basic mechanism involved in tracking, it nevertheless offers a solid prove -although ex negativo -that they are at work at a given moment of time.",
