Due to the surge in cases, health care systems around the world were inundated with highly infectious patients, placing an unprecedented strain on hospital resources. The World Health Organisation has reported over 200 million cumulative cases and over four million deaths globally as of August 2021 [2] . Australia, however, benefitting from geographical isolation as well as prompt border closures and enforcement of strict social distancing laws, has experienced a relatively low number of cases [3] . Consequently hospitals in Australia have not been overwhelmed and have not had to limit the provision of care to elderly and frail patients. Hence, Australia provides a unique and important opportunity to study the outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19.",

Of interest, early data from small case series suggested that cardiac complications such as acute cardiac injury, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy were common in patients with COVID-19 [5, 6] . Despite these early signals, there are few high quality studies that systematically report cardiac complications of COVID-19. The available data, moreover, is largely extracted from small or highly selective cohorts in a pandemic setting which have an unclear comparability to the population of Australia. The aim of our multicentre study, conducted in the context of a health care system that has not been overwhelmed, is to provide an unbiased representation of the incidence of clinical cardiac complications in hospitalised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

In a large multicentre study of patients hospitalised with influenza in the United States, 6.2% of patients had an episode of acute heart failure, although this study included patients with pre-existing chronic heart failure and cardiomyopathy [18] . In a single centre series of 123 hospitalised patients with H1N1 influenza, six (4.9%) patients had new or worsening LV cardiomyopathy on echocardiography [19] . With regards to atrial fibrillation, observational studies have suggested the prevalence of atrial fibrillation in hospitalised patients with influenza ranges from 7.9-15.8%, however these studies have included patients with known atrial fibrillation [20, 21] . In relation to acute cardiac injury, two large studies in the United States demonstrated that troponin elevation occurred in 2.9-5.2% of patients with influenza, however these results should be interpreted with caution as the criteria for measuring troponins varies widely [22, 23] . Taken together, these findings suggest that apart from troponin rise, the incidence of cardiac complications in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections are comparable, although once again, broad variability in outcome reporting limits the strength of this conclusion.",

It is possible that patients had subclinical complications which would only have been captured if systematic investigations, such as echocardiography and cardiac MRI, were performed in all patients. Moreover, data on patient outcomes after discharge from hospital have not been captured and cardiac complications such as myopericarditis or heart failure may manifest weeks after discharge. Future studies should be designed to address these limitations. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively capture and report the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 in a health care system that was not overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
