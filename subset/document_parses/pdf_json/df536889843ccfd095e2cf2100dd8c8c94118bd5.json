Oncologists and health care systems have adapted the delivery of cancer care to mitigate the increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 among oncology patients (\u00dcr\u00fcn et al., 2020) . However, the ways in which the pandemic has incited changes in multidisciplinary cancer care remain poorly defined with minimal prospective data.

Secondary objectives included defining pandemic-related delays of planned oncologic care and COVID-19 diagnosis. To evaluate the correlates of changes in cancer care delivery, multivariable logistic regression models, with listwise deletion for missing data, that included the following independent variables were computed: self-reported race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, or Other), cancer center (DFCI or MSSM), cancer status (metastatic/active, localized/stable, or No Evaluable Disease [NED]/complete remission, with the former referring to solid malignancies and the latter hematologic malignancies), receipt of systemic therapy during the index period (yes or no), and tumor type (genitourinary, hematological, breast, thoracic, gastrointestinal, head and neck, or other solid tumor). For numbers of visits, per-patient differences in the numbers of visits in the pandemic period compared to the baseline period were used as the dichotomized dependent variables (any increase in telehealth visits, and any decrease in all or in-person visits). Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare within-patient visit numbers between periods. Median follow-up was determined using the inverse Kaplan-Meier method. All tests were two-tailed and considered statistically significant for p < 0.05. All analyses were done in the R statistical environment (v3.6.1).",

A significant decrease in outpatient visits and increase in telehealth visits were noted during the pandemic period. However, Black and Hispanic patients were less likely to have an increase in telehealth utilization and were more likely to develop COVID-19 infection compared to white patients. Hispanic patients were more likely than White patients to have pandemic-related delays in cancer care. Racial and ethnic barriers to the adoption of telehealth and related socioeconomic factors place members of these vulnerable populations at disproportionate risk for both COVID-19 infection and decreased cancer-related visits, thereby exacerbating existing health disparities. Sustained efforts to reduce racial and ethnic barriers to the adoption of telehealth, as well as broader efforts to reduce the systemic inequities that place these populations at risk for COVID-19 infection, will be critical to narrowing disparities.",
