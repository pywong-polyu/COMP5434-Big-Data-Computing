It is by far one of the most common disorders seen in pet rabbits. Very often, it is caused by an inappropriate diet. However, stress is a common initiator of decreased GI motility, so any illness, painful condition, or stressful event can trigger an episode. Rabbits with GI stasis will eventually stop eating, and a lack of food in the intestinal tract will exacerbate GI stasis. Left untreated, GI stasis can rapidly become life-threatening.",

            "text": "To understand the pathogenesis of GI diseases of the rabbit, the normal anatomic and physiologic aspects of rabbit digestion must be appreciated. Details of this are discussed in Chapter 13. In rabbits, the main driving force for normal intestinal motility is the presence of large quantities of indigestible fiber. Lack of this fiber, caused by either dietary inadequacies or conditions that cause anorexia, is a major cause of GI stasis. 18 Fiber stimulates cecocolic motility, either by a distention effect of the bulk or directly. Diets high in fiber promote the production of specific volatile fatty acids in the cecum that promote peristalsis. 18 Inadequate ingestion of coarse fiber will inhibit normal GI peristalsis. Rabbits ingest hair routinely in the process of grooming. However, they cannot vomit to eliminate accumulated hair. If GI motility is normal, ingested hair moves along with food out of the stomach at regular intervals and is ultimately expelled in the feces. If GI motility is impaired, hair and ingesta accumulate in the stomach. Fluid is absorbed from the stomach, further compacting the contents. Compacted ingesta causes discomfort, contributing further to anorexia and exacerbating GI hypomotility. A vicious cycle can result, until large amounts of hair and compacted ingesta accumulate in the stomach. This accumulation is erroneously referred to as a \"hairball, \" \"wool block, \" or \"trichobezoar. \" These terms imply, incorrectly, that the hair accumulation is the cause of disease rather than simply being the consequence or a symptom of impaired intestinal motility.",

Diets low in fiber cause cecocolic hypomotility, prolonging the retention of digesta in the cecum and ultimately producing changes in cecal microflora. Populations of potentially pathogenic bacteria, primarily Clostridium and coliform species such as Escherichia coli, are normally present in small numbers in the cecum. 14, 23 Slowing of cecocolic motility leads to the production of abnormal cecal fermentation products and alterations in the cecal pH. Even mild alterations in cecal pH cause an increase in these pathogens as the populations of normal organisms decrease. Overgrowth of these pathogens can cause a range of pathologic changes, from intestinal gas distention to death from enterotoxemia. Gas and toxin formation cause pain and stress, further decreasing appetite, and a cycle of pain, inappetence, and hypomotility ensues. Without intervention, all motility can be lost, leading to end-stage ileus. Other effects of fiber consumption are indirect. Highfiber diets have a low level of available carbohydrates and thus decrease the risk of enterotoxemia caused by carbohydrate overload of the hindgut. Carbohydrates provide an environment in which pathogens such as E. coli and Clostridium species proliferate. Glucose, a by-product of carbohydrate digestion, is necessary to produce iota toxin by Clostridium species. Thus diarrhea and enterotoxemia in pet rabbits are often caused by this disruption in microflora, commonly referred to as dysbiosis.",

In suspect cases, palpate the abdomen with careful attention to the stomach contents, intestines, and cecum. The size and consistency of the stomach are key in differentiating GI stasis from obstructive disorders. With GI stasis, stomach size may vary with the duration of disease, but it always contains ingesta, as opposed to fluid and gas seen in rabbits with obstructive disorders. In GI stasis, fluid is pulled from the stomach, eventually leading to stomach contents that feel firm, doughy, and remain pitted on compression. Occasionally, stomach contents are very dehydrated and solid. No fluid and little or no gas is palpable in the stomach, whereas the intestines and cecum frequently contain variable amounts of gas. Little or no feces are palpable in the colon. Auscultate the abdomen, listening for borborygmus, because the character and frequency of gut sounds also will distinguish GI stasis from obstructive disorders.

Rehydrate the stomach contents by assisted feeding with a syringe or by placing a nasogastric feeding tube (see Chapter 12) if the rabbit will not accept syringe feeding. Ensuring that the patient continues to eat during and after treatment is important. Continued anorexia will exacerbate GI hypomotility and cause further derangement of the gastrointestinal microflora. The act of eating itself stimulates gut motility. Maintaining caloric needs will prevent secondary hepatic lipidosis, which progresses quickly in anorectic rabbits. Several commercial nutritional products for rabbits are available for this purpose, and most rabbits will readily accept them when offered by syringe. Base the volume and consistency of the feeding formula on your palpation of the stomach and radiographic findings. For example, if the stomach is small with radiographically dense ingesta, feed a diluted formula. If the stomach is very full or even dilated with ingesta, withhold assist feeding until the stomach contents begin to move out of the stomach. Do not feed pineapple, pineapple juice, or papaya, because these are ineffective and can be detrimental (see below). Offer rabbits free-choice water in a bowl, fresh hay, and a variety of greens to provide every opportunity to self-feed. Ingestion of fibrous food is critical to reestablish GI motility. Rabbits with GI stasis have moderate to severe gut pain, especially if the intestines are distended with gas. Most will not begin to eat until this pain is alleviated. If the rabbit appears painful (reluctant to move, hunched posture), administer an opioid such as buprenorphine (0.03-0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously [SC] or intravenously [IV] every 6-12 hours) or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) such as meloxicam (0.5-1.0 mg/kg SC every 24 hours) or carprofen (1.0-2.2 mg/ kg by mouth [PO] every 12 hours). Less painful rabbits may respond well to NSAIDs alone, but a combination of opioids and NSAIDS can be used in very painful rabbits. Before administering NSAIDs, be certain that the rabbit is fully hydrated and that no underlying renal disorders are present. Initially, always use a parenteral route for medications, because intestinal absorption is limited with ileus. A recent study compared the effects of IV buprenorphine and IV lidocaine continuous rate infusion (CRI) on gastrointestinal motility and evidence of pain in New Zealand white rabbits after ovariohysterectomy. 59a Rabbits that received a lidocaine CRI (2 mg/kg loading dose, then 100 \u00b5g/kg/ min CRI for 2 days) had higher gastrointestinal motility, food intake, fecal output, and normal behaviors and lower blood glucose levels than rabbits treated with buprenorphine (0.06 mg/kg IV q8h for 2 days). Therefore, a CRI of lidocaine may be useful in treating or preventing pain and associated stasis in rabbits.",

Where these mats of hair are formed is not clear, but possibly they are compacted in the cecum, then ingested and swallowed whole with other cecal contents during normal cecotrophy. 31, 32 Other foreign objects reported to acutely obstruct the intestinal tract include carpet or other cloth fibers, locust beans, and plastic. 31, 32 Extraluminal compression of the intestinal tract by neoplasia, postsurgical adhesions, tapeworm cysts, abscesses, and hernias may also occur. 29, 31, 32, 54 The most common cause of death from an acute intestinal obstruction is hypovolemic shock, caused by a sudden loss of fluid into the lumen of the GI tract proximal to the obstruction. In studies of intestinal obstruction with rabbits used as models, ligating the intestinal tract results in rapid, active secretion of sodium, followed by water into the intestinal lumen proximal to the obstruction. 10, 11, 47, 68 Within hours, as much as 200 to 250 mL of fluid accumulates first in the obstructed intestinal segments and then in the stomach. 10, 11, 47, 68 Sodium and fluid secretion is most active in the first 25 to 30 cm of the duodenum, proximal to the entrance of the pancreatic duct. 10 Fluid resorption is impaired in obstructed segments, and this rapid loss of fluid leads to hypovolemic shock. Gas formation also contributes to GI tract distension proximal to the obstruction. Within 1 hour of ligation, gut pH and bacterial flora begin to shift. Eventually, bacterial flora completely reverses, with an overgrowth of Enterobacteriaceae and gas-forming clostridia, adding to gastrointestinal dilation. 9, 14, 68 Accumulated fluid in obstructed intestines and eventually stomach results in stretching of the intestines, compromise of venous outflow, and pressure necrosis of the affected segments. 47, 68 In some cases, the stomach will acutely rupture. If the obstruction is not relieved, the affected intestinal loops will begin to necrose. 47, 68 As this occurs, motility declines and secondary GI stasis develops.",

The most common location is the proximal duodenum, approximately 2 to 5 cm from the pylorus where the lumen narrows. With a proximal obstruction, shock begins within hours and, if untreated, death occurs within 6 to 8 hours. If the obstruction is more distal, in the jejunum or ileocecocolonic junction, obstructed loops become progressively fluid or gas filled over a longer time. Experimental ligation in rabbits at the level of the jejunum results in death in 12 to 24 hours and at the ileum within an average of 21 hours. 11 In contrast to GI stasis, the intestinal tract proximal to the obstruction becomes hypermotile. Studies of electrical activity in obstructed horses and rabbits demonstrate intense, irregular activity proximal to the obstruction. 11, 17, 35 This intestinal hyperactivity will often be successful in moving the obstruction distally. These \"moving obstructions\" are common (Fig 14. 3A-B). The obstruction may pass with appropriate treatment, and small mats of hair may pass without treatment.

With moving obstructions, gut sounds may be audible from a distance, and the rabbit may stretch out and change positions frequently to get comfortable. With complete obstruction, they demonstrate signs of severe pain, such as reluctance to move and a hunched posture. As shock develops, affected rabbits become severely depressed, listless, laterally recumbent, and minimally responsive to external stimuli. With stomach rupture, they may suddenly cry out and die. On physical examination, the stomach will palpate as large, fluid-filled, or tympanic, in contrast to the firm, ingesta-filled stomach found with GI stasis. Rabbits may appear painful on palpation. Early on, before the affected segments become necrotic, gut sounds are increased, and sometimes gut motility is visible through the abdominal wall.

Initial treatment goals are to warm the patient (if hypothermic), treat shock, decompress the stomach, correct any fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and control pain. If hypothermic, immediately begin external heat support. Place an intravenous catheter and begin treatment with a shock dose (60-90 mL/kg per hour for the first hour) of warmed, isotonic crystalloid fluids. When shock is controlled, reduce administration to a maintenance rate. If shock is severe and a response to crystalloid fluid therapy is not seen, administration of 7.5% NaCl or hetastarch (3 mL/kg over 5 minutes) may be effective (see Chapter 41 Sedation is necessary to decompress the stomach in most cases. Sedation with midazolam (0.5-1.0 mg/kg IM, IV) or dexmedetomidine (0.03-0.05 mg/kg IM) or both, in addition to pain medications, may be sufficient if the patient is depressed, although the addition of gas anesthesia is often needed. A well-lubricated 18-Fr red-rubber catheter works well as an orogastric tube in most medium-sized rabbits; a smaller size may be needed in small breeds. Cut additional holes in the end of the tube to allow larger volumes of gas and fluid to pass. Measure the distance from the nose to the last rib (the distance to the stomach), and mark the tube. With the head held in ventroflexion, pass the well-lubricated tube gently by mouth into the stomach. If the tube becomes clogged, remove the tube and flush, then repass the tube to remove as much fluid and air as possible from the stomach. Percutaneous trocharization of the stomach is contraindicated as a method of decompression, because this will likely cause rupture of the stomach. The color and odor of the fluid are a prognostic indicator. The fluid should be brown to green and smell of food. If the fluid is odiferous and dark brown to red or black, the stomach is likely necrotic, and the prognosis is grave.",

If no improvement is seen after a second orogastric decompression, the obstruction is either not moving or is caused by extraluminal intestinal compression. Surgical treatment is indicated, because the intestines will begin to necrose if the obstruction is not relieved.",

Indications for surgery are a lack of response to medical treatment, an inability to decompress the stomach, or declining GI tract motility. These indicate that the obstruction is either extraluminal or is not moving. Surgery may also be indicated to quickly remove the obstruction if close monitoring of the patient is not possible after initial medical treatment. When possible, decompress the stomach and stabilize the patient for shock before attempting surgery. Because intraoperative gastric reflux may occur, always place an endotracheal tube for anesthesia. Provide IV fluids and heat support during surgery. A lidocaine CRI (loading dose 2 to 3 mg/kg, then 33-100 ug/kg/min) provides additional pain control, is antiinflammatory, and may help to prevent postoperative ileus. 59a,62 Most acute intraluminal obstructions are in the proximal duodenum, 3 to 5 cm from the pylorus. When possible, avoid enterotomy by manipulating the foreign body into the cecum. If this is not possible, move it into the stomach and perform a gastrotomy rather than an enterotomy. Gastrotomies are generally better tolerated, with a lower probability of postoperative complications such as stricture, leakage, or GI stasis. Assess the viability of the obstructed portion of the intestine. If the portion of intestine surrounding the foreign body appears necrotic, an intestinal resection and anastomosis may be indicated. If large sections of obstructed intestinal loops have become ischemic, the prognosis is grave, and euthanasia may be warranted. If no intestinal foreign body is found, explore the abdomen for evidence of neoplasia, abscesses, or adhesions as the cause of obstruction. Provide postoperative supportive care, including fluid therapy and pain management. If GI motility has declined, provide promotility agents and assist feeding. With prompt removal of the foreign body, the prognosis is good. If intestinal viability is compromised, the prognosis is guarded to poor. ",

They are produced several times a day, usually in the morning and evening, and consumed reflexively directly from the rectum, a behavior termed cecotrophy (see Chapter 13) . Because they are swallowed whole directly from the anus, most owners rarely see normal cecotrophs. If intact, cecotrophs appear as multiple, soft fecal pellets stuck together, resembling a blackberry, and have a strong odor. If cecotrophs are not eaten, they often stick to the fur around the perineum or are found smeared on the fur and flooring. This is often confused with diarrhea and is a common presenting complaint. Rabbits that do not consume their cecotrophs are either physically unable to do so or do not eat them because cecotrophs are abnormally formed. Obesity is a common cause of inability to consume cecotrophs because the rabbit cannot reach the anal region. Other causes are musculoskeletal disorders, vestibular disease, dental disease, pain, and physical barriers such as Elizabethan collars. Changes in normal cecal motility, pH, or flora result in the production of abnormal cecotrophs. These may be soft, malformed, pasty, or odiferous and are not eaten. Dietary deficiencies, as discussed above, are a common cause; however, other factors such as stress, concurrent disease, or antibiotic usage may also contribute.",

Because these are water-borne pathogens, outbreaks of disease can be seen when the watering system becomes contaminated. Salmonellosis is not common but can cause disease with high rates of both morbidity and mortality. Salmonella typhimurium is most often associated with salmonellosis in rabbits; however, other species and serovars have been reported. 7 Disease transmission is most often associated with contaminated food or water. Affected rabbits usually develop sepsis, which quickly leads to death; however, diarrhea may occur as well. Postmortem findings are consistent with septicemia and include vascular congestion of organs and diffusely distributed petechial hemorrhages. Lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue may be edematous and contain similar foci of necrosis.",

In acute disease, rabbits are febrile and exhibit depression, lethargy, anorexia, constipation, or diarrhea. Some may show neurologic signs such as ataxia, opisthotonos, excitement, or seizures. At end-stage disease, tachypnea, cyanosis, and a blood-tinged, foamy nasal discharge are often seen. In some rabbits, the disease course is slower, with animals exhibiting jaundice, depression, anorexia, and fever, eventually dying within 1 to 2 weeks. In the subacute form, milder signs are seen, and many of these rabbits live. Persistent or latent infections may occur in asymptomatic rabbits. 2, 24 Hematologic testing often shows a lymphopenia and a gradual thrombocytopenia. In moribund rabbits, prothrombin and thrombin times are prolonged, and fibrin degradation products can be detected. 55 The most consistent postmortem changes are hepatic necrosis, splenomegaly, and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Congestion and hemorrhage may be seen in most organs but are most pronounced in the lungs. The liver is pale, and periportal necrosis with a fine reticular pattern is observed; the spleen is dark and thickened, and catarrhal enteritis is often identified. 20, 55 Presumptive diagnosis is based on history, clinical signs, and pathologic findings.

Infant rabbits are most susceptible, because the virus targets terminally differentiated enterocytes lining the tips of villi of the jejunum and ileum. 3 Transplacentally derived maternal antibodies are protective, and some protection continues past 45 days, when antibody levels decline, so less severe or subclinical infections may be seen in weaned rabbits. Morbidity and mortality rates vary with age, host immunity, and environmental stressors. Coinfection with other pathogens, such as E. coli, can have an additive effect and greatly increase morbidity and mortality rates. 3 Diarrhea, dehydration, and sudden death are the main clinical signs. Necropsy findings include mild to severe villus blunting, villus fusion, and submucosal edema of the small intestines, and fluid cecal contents. The lamina propria is usually infiltrated with lymphocytes and occasionally with neutrophils. Definitive diagnosis is based on results of histopathologic examination of the intestine. Isolation of the virus or demonstration of antibodies is suggestive. Clinical signs and gross pathologic findings alone are not diagnostic. 20 Human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test kits will detect rotavirus group A in rabbits. 3 Preventing and controlling rotavirus infection is complicated by its highly infectious nature.

            "text": "Eimeria stiedae, the coccidium responsible for hepatic coccidiosis, is ubiquitous in open rabbitries in which rabbits are not treated preventatively with coccidiostats. Infection results from ingesting sporulated oocysts that undergo excystation in the duodenum. Sporozoites then penetrate the intestinal mucosa and move to bile epithelial cells, where they undergo schizogony. Merozoites invade contiguous epithelial cells and undergo gametogeny, giving rise to microgametes and macrogametes. After being fertilized by a microgamete, the macrogamete develops into an oocyst. Oocysts rupture from the epithelial cells and are passed in the bile and eventually in the feces. 36 Many infections are asymptomatic; however, the disease can be fatal, especially in young rabbits. Heavily infected rabbits show signs related to decreased hepatic function and bile duct obstruction. These rabbits become anorectic and debilitated; diarrhea or constipation can occur in the terminal stages of the disease. The abdomen is occasionally enlarged, and the animal may be icteric. Serum biochemical testing reveals increased levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bile acids, and total bilirubin. On radiographs, hepatomegaly and ascites may be present. At necropsy, the liver is enlarged and has yellowish-white, nodular, abscess-like lesions of varying size, some of which are within a fibrous capsule. Diagnosis is by identifying oocysts in a sample of bile, by histologic examination, or by fecal examination.",

Infection is by ingestion of sporulated oocysts. Although rabbits are cecotrophic, the cecotrophs eaten from the anus do not contain infectious oocysts. Clinical signs vary widely depending on the age of the rabbit, the organism involved, the parasitic burden, and the relative susceptibility of the animal. Subclinical infection is common in both young and adult rabbits. The finding of oocysts in clinically normal rabbits does not warrant treatment. Clinical signs are most often associated with poor husbandry or overcrowding and generally occur in rabbits under 6 months of age. Severely immunosuppressed older rabbits may also become symptomatic. Mild intermittent to severe diarrhea that may contain mucus or blood, weight loss, and dehydration may be observed. Animals with severe diarrhea may develop intussusception. Death is most often attributed to dehydration and secondary intestinal dysbiosis. At necropsy, lesions are seen in the small or large intestine, depending on the agent involved, and intestinal epithelium may be ulcerated. The presence of organisms in fecal samples or intestinal scrapings in symptomatic animals supports a presumptive diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis is based on histologic findings.",

History resembles acute GI tract obsrtruction, as affected rabbits become acutely anorectic, demonstrate cranial abdominal discomfort, and become weak and depressed. 27, 52 The stomach usually contains food and a small amount of gas, suggesting gastric stasis syndrome. An abnormal liver is sometimes palpable. Affected rabbits deteriorate over a short time; if not treated, they become obtunded and hyporthermic, with pale mucous membranes if hemoabdomen is present. Death may occur 12 to 72 hours from the onset of signs. The most common hematologic and biochemical abnormalities are anemia (packed cell volume, 16%-17%) and mild to severe increases in the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). 26, 27, 52, 63, 66 However, these values may be normal initially. On radiographs, rounded liver margins, hepatomegaly, increased density of the liver, or free abdominal fluid are sometimes visible. Ultrasonographic examination is diagnostic and demonstrates a heterogeneous appearance and lack of blood flow on color doppler in the affected liver lobe. 27, 52 With hemoabdomen, free fluid is visible in the peritoneum, and fresh blood is obtained on abdominocentesis. Treatment of acutely ill rabbits initially is supportive care, including intravenous fluids, analgesia, and thermal support. Prompt surgical removal of the affected liver lobe in these rabbits is the treatment of choice. 27, 52 However, if this is not feasible for the owner and hemoabdomen is not present, some affected rabbits will survive with supportive care alone. 27 Signs of chronic liver lobe torsion are often nonspecific. These rabbits are often described as \"poor doers\" with a history of recurrent GI stasis. Liver lobe torsion has also been diagnosed as an incidental finding at necropsy in previously asymptomatic rabbits. 65, 67 On physical examination, a firm, nonpainful mass is sometimes palpable in the cranial abdomen. Hematologic and biochemical abnormalities may include mild to moderate increases in liver enzyme activity, anemia, and azotemia. Diagnosis is based on ultrasonic examination of the affected lobe. Surgical lobectomy has been successfully performed in rabbits with this chronic presentation. 63",

The LD 50 for aflatoxins in rabbits is among the lowest for any species studied. 15 In one described outbreak, affected animals showed anorexia, dullness, and weight loss followed by jaundice in terminal stages, and rabbits died within 3 to 4 days. 37 At necropsy, livers were congested and icteric, and gallbladders were distended and had inspissated bile. Liver sections showed degenerative changes of hepatic cells and dilatation and engorgement of sinusoids. Bile ducts had mild to severe periportal fibrosis. The level of aflatoxin B 1 in tested feed samples varied from 90 to 540 mg/kg of feed. Withdrawal of feed and supportive care resulted in gradual disappearance of signs and deaths. 37 ",
