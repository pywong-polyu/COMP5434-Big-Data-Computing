While physical distancing and other measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing masks) have been shown to play an important role in reducing transmission, it is unclear whether closing outdoor spaces has made similar contributions. In fact, in the context of COVID-19 it may be even more important to provide children and youth opportunities for outdoor physical activity and play. Outdoor play opportunities increase the likelihood of children meeting the movement guidelines, since children that play outdoors tend to be more active, sit less, and sleep better (Tremblay et al., 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 766, "end": 789, "text": "(Tremblay et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Table 4"}, {"text": "Outdoor time can also provide children and youth a necessary refuge during times of stress (Yogman et al., 2018) and build a more robust immune system (Lasselin et al., 2016) . Further, there is evidence that transmission of COVID-19 is lower outdoors compared with indoors (Qian et al., 2020) . Thus, as reopening of public spaces begins across various Canadian provinces and elsewhere across the world, outdoor play spaces including playgrounds should arguably be prioritized as a means to enhance movement behaviours and overall health in all children and youth but particularly for those aged 12-17 years from lower-income households. As we enter the recovery period for COVID-19, and plan for future pandemics, it is important to balance concerns of virus transmission with evidence-based strategies to keep children active and playful. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic is a significant disruption that has the potential to change urban planning policy and practice in the long-term. Since the 1970s, practitioners and researchers alike have emphasized dense urban development as a means to promote environmental and social sustainability, livability and economic prosperity (Bramley and Power, 2009; Ewing and Cervero, 2017; Newman and Kenworthy, 1999) . Dense communities are also considered healthy communities, as they enable walking, biking and easy access to recreational/sports facilities for adults and children alike (Frumkin et al., 2004; Mitra and Manaugh, 2020) . During the current pandemic, large metropolitan areas had higher infection and death dates compared to low-density communities, fueling popular and scholarly discussions around the future of density as an urban planning principle (Florida, 2020; Rockl\u04e7v & Sj\u04e7; din, 2020) . It is worth noting that while some high-density cities (e.g., New York and London) have had the worst outbreaks of the COVID-19 virus, others such as Singapore and Tokyo did not have a similar experience (Florida, 2020) . This has led urbanists to argue that urban density is likely only one factor of many that makes a place vulnerable to a similar public health emergency. As we begin to recover from this pandemic and realign our urban planning principles with public health resiliency as a priority (along with other goals mentioned above), what will the future communities look like in the post-COVID-19 period? Our study begins to address this question with a specific focus on children and youth.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 112, "text": "(Yogman et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 151, "end": 174, "text": "(Lasselin et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 274, "end": 293, "text": "(Qian et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1204, "text": "(Bramley and Power, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1229, "text": "Ewing and Cervero, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1257, "text": "Newman and Kenworthy, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1452, "text": "(Frumkin et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1477, "text": "Mitra and Manaugh, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1725, "text": "(Florida, 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1740, "text": "Rockl\u04e7v & Sj\u04e7;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1751, "text": "din, 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1973, "text": "(Florida, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Table 4"}, {"text": "Results from logistic regression models indicate implications of neighbourhood design on changes in healthy movement behaviours during a pandemic.

Low density may create a perception of greater ease to physically distance because there may be fewer people outside. In addition, across Canada, people were advised to \"stay home\" during the pandemic, leading to very limited economic activities and travel.
