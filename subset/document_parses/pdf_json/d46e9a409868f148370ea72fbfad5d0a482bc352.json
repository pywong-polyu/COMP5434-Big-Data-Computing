Here we assess the potential importance of mandatory masks in the parts of community and in secondary schools. We show that, assuming current TTI levels, adoption of masks in secondary schools in addition to community settings can reduce the size of a second wave, but will not prevent it; more testing of symptomatic people, tracing and isolating of their contacts is also needed. To avoid a second wave, with masks mandatory in secondary schools and in certain community settings, under current tracing levels, 68% or 46% of those with symptomatic infection would need to be tested if masks' effective coverage were 15% or 30% respectively, compared to 76% and 57% if masks are mandated in community settings but not secondary schools.",

If people touch the contaminated objects and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth, COVID-19 may also be transmitted [2] [3] . Reducing the frequency of physical contact, maintaining good hygiene and good ventilation, and pursuing effective test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategies are important non-pharmaceutical interventions that can reduce COVID-19 transmission before a vaccine or effective anti-viral drugs become available.",

Laboratory experiments have found that almost all types of masks can greatly reduce droplet emission and viral shedding by infectious wearers [8] [9] suggesting their effectiveness for source control. Two observational studies [10] [11] and recent systematic reviews focusing on SARS-1, MERS and influenza [12] [13] [14] [15] indicate that masks also substantially reduce infection risk to the non-infected wearer, even when their infectious contact is unmasked. Specifically, Chu et al. [12] suggest that face coverings use could result in a reduction in infection risk of around 44% (95% CI = 11-60%) in a community setting, with stronger associations in a healthcare setting and with use of N95 respirators compared to surgical or cotton masks. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been completed on face coverings against COVID-19 or other coronaviruses (although one is currently underway [16] ). Observational studies are prone to confounding, and RCTs focused on influenza are inconclusive [13] . Epidemiological studies have also shown a negative association between mask prevalence and COVID-19 incidence at a city, state and national level [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

While the overall message from these models is that, as lockdown measures are relaxed, masks are likely to be effective if they are worn by a large percentage of the population, they often optimistically assumed that a large proportion of transmission events could be prevented with face masks by overestimating their efficacy and guided by evidence of the impact of masks on influenza transmission reduction [15] ; hence their results are likely to overestimate impact. Furthermore, with the exception of a few studies [36] [37] [38] [39] , many studies to date have used population-based models that do not differentiate between household, school, workplace and community contacts. Under the current policy of mandatory mask wearing in the UK, only the community contacts will be affected and untangling different layers of contacts is crucial in evaluating the impact of masks. In summary, existing modelling studies are likely to exaggerate the impact of face coverings.",

Here, we extend this work by calibrating Covasim, illustrated in Figures 1A-B , to recent data, to August 28, 2020 rather than June 17, 2020 as in [28] , taking in consideration the slower-than-anticipated reopening of society in the UK during July and August, and to explore whether extending mandatory mask use to secondary school students alongside its existing use in some community settings could contribute to reducing the risk of COVID-19 wave resurgence later this year. The most recent findings from the CoMIX studies suggest that the contact rate in England is increasing much slower than anticipated with an average of 4 contacts per person during July and August compared to around 11 contacts per day in pre-COVID-19 era (personal communication with authors of [30] and based on unpublished follow on work from [30] ). We anticipate that this will increase with reopening of schools but less than the anticipated 90% of the pre-COVID-19 contact rate previously modelled.",

This recommendation is on the basis that younger children may have lower susceptibility and potentially lower transmissibility than adults [41] . While the evidence is not conclusive, we anticipate the practicalities with younger children correctly obeying face coverings rules are more challenging than for older children. In addition, face masks are more likely to hamper the education of primary than secondary school children given the focus on learning basic speaking and social skills. Children over 12 years old in the context of the UK school systems attend secondary schools and recently, following WHO guidance [42] , the government has permitted schools to mandate mask wearing in communal areas (where high levels of social mixing and lower levels of social distancing may occur) [43] . Overall data on mask use in children is sparse, with a recent WHO document [40] suggesting that mask fit and compliance is likely to be poorer in children than in adults and hence mask efficacy levels based upon adult data may need to be adjusted. To account for this uncertainty in the compliance with mask-wearing and their efficacy, we simulate two levels of masks' effective coverage in schools and community settings (estimated as the product of the masks efficacy (per-contact risk reduction) and coverage (the proportion of contacts in which they are worn); see Methods). We aim to estimate the different combinations of testing and tracing levels necessary to avoid COVID-19 resurgence after September 2020 and a second COVID-19 wave later this or next year, accounting for community mask-wearing and scenarios with and without mandatory masks in secondary schools, including two levels of masks' effective coverage. The strategies we have explored have been discussed with members of scientific advisory bodies in the UK.",

Only with increased TTI coverage could a secondary COVID-19 wave be avoided. The necessary TTI coverage requires testing sufficient number of symptomatic people and then sufficient identification, tracing and isolation of their positive contacts.

We highlight that adoption of face coverings in schools, in addition to using in community settings, can help reduce a potential secondary epidemic wave, but, to do this effectively, the effective coverage of masks has to be assumed to be high (30% in our case). If it were lower, the reduction in the potential second wave would be smaller.

In our model, we have assumed that symptomatic infections account for 70% of onward-transmitted infections, as a number of other models have assumed [26] [27] [28] [29] and that development of symptoms is agedependent analogous to other studies [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

The transmission probability will be different for each of these four cases.

For example, the reports from NHS Test and Trace [50] summarised in Table 1 until end of August, report % contacts reached by complex (e.g. schools and workplaces) and non-complex cases (e.g. households) suggesting that complex cases have better tracing as they are usually in institutions where contacts identities are better known.

Specifically, this analysis does not assess future changes that may occur such as potential seasonality of the virus, reactive policies of, for example, intermittent local lockdowns or trade-offs in reopening society, or implementation of therapies to reduce severity of symptoms of COVID-19 related mortality or vaccination policies, thus making the model projections over the longtime period uncertain. But, since the scope of this analysis was to illustrate whether a resurgence of COVID-19 will occur later this or next year in a shape of a second epidemic wave, running the simulations until the end of 2021 was a necessity to illustrate this point and suggest when the potential peak may occur subject to the epidemic continuing on the current trajectory and under current conditions.",

We acknowledge that achieving this will be challenging, and especially so if the UK is faced with a second wave with possible test delays, test capacity being reached and the contact tracing system being overwhelmed. In addition, effective isolation is also important and the currently reported levels of isolation need to be improved [45] [46] .

These should be adjusted downwards to account for different mask types, since cloth masks, the kind most commonly used among the UK public [7] are less effective than the N95 ventilators used by some study participants [12] . The reviewed studies, mostly case-control, were also subject to potential biases that may have inflated the effect size; for example, people who wear masks may tend to be more careful, for is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

The education system in the UK consists of 14 school years (age 4-18 years) each of which start in September and finish the following July. There are seven years of primary school, with children entering reception aged 4 and leaving aged 11, followed by seven years of secondary school. Following discussion among the authors and with scientific advisors and policy decision makers in the UK, we decided to model the use of masks by secondary school students only, i.e. the last seven years of education. This implies that the coverage of face coverings in the school layer is at most 50%. The current masks policy is that masks are recommended in corridors and other communal \"hot spots' areas where there is a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission [47] . But this is implemented differently across different schools, and for simplicity we have assumed that the coverage of face coverings in the school layer is at most 50%. We note that this would be reduced if that that masks are not worn in classrooms and if students' use of masks is not perfect. As before, the efficacy of face coverings was estimated to be 25-70%, and to account for uncertainty, we modelled two efficacy values of 30% and 60%. Multiplying by a coverage level of 50% we derived an effective coverage of 15% and 30% describing lower and higher effective coverage of masks in schools.",

We thus assume across scenarios that 60% of the workforce will return with reopening of schools during school term-time, 10% of which will additionally work from home during the school holidays. We also assume that making the workplaces COVID-19 secure will also reduce transmission in the workplace, and hence model the transmission probability for the workplace layer to be 50% of the pre-COVID-19 level during term time and 40% during school holidays.",

Instead, under the scenarios of reopening of schools from September 2020, alongside society, and under different levels of TTI strategies, we simulated four scenarios describing two policies on face coverings and two levels of face coverings effective coverage.
