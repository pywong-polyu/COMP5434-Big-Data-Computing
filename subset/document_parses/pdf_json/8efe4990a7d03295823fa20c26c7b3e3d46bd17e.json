The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-M Pro ) cleaves the long polyprotein chains to release functional proteins required for replication of the virus and thus is a potential drug target to design new chemical entities in order to inhibit the viral replication in human cells. The current study employs state of art computational methods to design novel molecules by linking molecular fragments which specifically bind to different constituent sub-pockets of the SARS-CoV-2-M Pro binding site. A huge library of 191678 fragments was screened against the binding cavity of SARS-CoV-2-M Pro and high affinity fragments binding to adjacent sub-pockets were tailored to generate new molecules. These newly formed molecules were further subjected to molecular docking, ADMET filters and MM-GBSA binding energy calculations to select 17 best molecules (named as MP-In1 to MP-In17), which showed comparable binding affinities and interactions with the key binding site residues as the reference ligand. The complexes of these 17 molecules and the reference molecule with SARS-CoV-2-M Pro , were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations, which assessed the stabilities of their binding with SARS-CoV-2-M Pro . Fifteen molecules were found to form stable complexes with SARS-CoV-2-M Pro . These novel chemical entities designed specifically according to the pharmacophoric requirements of SARS-CoV-2-M Pro binding pockets showed good synthetic feasibility and returned no exact match when searched against chemical databases. Considering their interactions, binding efficiencies and novel chemotypes, they can be further evaluated as potential starting points for SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "ARTICLE HISTORY", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The recent pandemic of novel corona virus infection (COVID19) has put the world on alert. This is caused by a positive sense RNA virus of coronaviridae family and nidovirales order which is known to cause respiratory tract infections in mammals including humans. A recent form of the virus, the novel coronavirus has emerged in china and has been named as SARS-CoV-2 because of the acute respiratory distress syndrome developing with these cases in infections which become severe with course of time. This is a zoonotic corona virus mediated disease which is third incidence after SARS and MERS (Gu et al., 2020) The source has later been shown to have sequence homology as high as 96% with SARS-CoV of bats . According to the latest WHO reports (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen), 4234821 confirmed cases has been reported with 285913 deaths around a total of 166 countries which includes 70768 confirmed cases and 2294 deaths in India. This pandemic is spreading exponentially and has become an issue of serious concern for the whole world. In the absence of any specific drugs and treatment measures, WHO is emphasizing on hand washing, personal protection, use of hand sanitizers and social distancing and isolation for prevention of spread of disease and contamination. This has proven effective in some countries to curtail the spread and they are still in phase 1 and 2 of the epidemic spread. However, in certain parts of the world it has become an issue of major and immediate concern due to advanced phases of epidemic. Possible treatment strategies and methods have become urgent needs for the world. Various possible drug treatments have been used with some success and some negative studies. Repurposing the existing drugs as low hanging fruits is being used as the first strategy in search of a possible treatment for the disease. The various drugs tried so far are oseltamivir , systemic steroids in severe respiratory involvement which is still inconclusive (Khot & Nadkar, 2020) , Lopinavir/ Ritonavir with both positive (Bhatnagar et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020) , chloroquine (Sahraei et al., 2020) phosphate/Hydroxychloroquine . Also, some results have been seen with Ramdesivir (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2020; Ko et al., 2020) , Tocilizumab, RNA polymerase inhibitors like Favipiravir (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2020) and JAK-STAT inhibitors like Baricitinib, Fedratinib and ruxolitinib (Dong et al., 2020) . The 32 kb long RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al., 2020) codes for its structural proteins such as spike glycoprotein which facilitates the entry of the virus into the host cells through interaction with the host enzyme ACE2 (Hasan et al., 2020) , the nucleocapsid (Lu et al., 2020) , envelope and other membrane proteins and the non-structural proteins such as the chymotrypsin like main protease (Jin et al., 2020) which cleaves the long polyprotein chains to release functional proteins required for replication. Thus, these proteins can be exploited as potential drug targets and hunting for new chemical entities (NCEs) with fewer side effects is the need of the hour to combat COVID19 (Boopathi et al., 2020) . However, successful discovery of NCEs will hugely depend on proper understanding of the structure, interactions and dynamics of validated targets and the unexplored potential of their binding sites to bind new chemotypes (Boopathi et al., 2020) . Computational methods have become indispensable for infectious disease drug discovery in last few decades (Njogu et al., 2016) not only to understand the drug-target interactions (Choudhury et al., 2014; Njogu et al., 2016; Schuler et al., 2017) and delineate the structure activity relationship of small druglike molecules (Gahtori et al., 2019; Srivastava et al., 2012) , but also for screening huge chemical libraries providing a fast and less expensive alternative to the traditional high throughput screening (Choudhury et al., 2015 (Choudhury et al., , 2016 Murgueitio et al., 2012) . The recent literature reports several interesting computational approaches including computational drug repurposing on the TMPRSS2 (Elmezayen et al., 2020), reverse vaccinology (Hasan et al., 2019) , in silico screening of novel guanosine derivatives against MERS CoV polymerase ( (Elfiky & Azzam 2020 , Elfiky, 2020a , ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines, anti-viral phytochemicals and synthetic anti-virals against SARS-CoV-2 M Pro , ACE-2 and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Joshi et al., 2020; Elfiky, 2020b) , in silico investigation of natural product compounds against the substrate-binding domain b of cell-surface heat shock protein A5, which reported to be the recognition site for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Elfiky, 2020) , in silico study of binding potency of different Saikosaponins with targets NSP15 and fusion spike glycoprotein (Sinha et al., 2020) and computational evaluation of stilbene based compounds such as resveratrol, as anti-COVID-19 drug candidates acting through disruption of the spike proteins (Wahedi et al., 2020) . Among a plethora of computational drug design strategies, fragment based de novo design of molecules has gained immense popularity (Coutard et al., 2014; Hoffer et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2019; Loving et al., 2010) . Usually, fragment hits show very high binding affinity with the receptors pertaining to their size. As starting points, they provide profound opportunity for subsequent optimization leading to chemical entities with improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to molecules obtained as hits from high throughput screenings (Hoffer et al., 2011; Loving et al., 2010) . Another major plus point of fragments is the low molecular complexity as compared to that of drug-like molecules, and thus reducing the search space to be explored (Hoffer et al., 2011) . Further, possibility of an exponentially huge number of combinatorial molecules by linking high affinity fragments ensures novel drug like chemotypes. So, with experimental high throughput screenings, simultaneous development of new computational fragment screening strategies would surely prove useful to significantly reduce the number of molecules to be tested experimentally (Kanakaveti et al., 2020) . In this study, we have considered the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-M Pro ) as our target of interest for fragment-based design of new inhibitors (Jin et al., 2020) . As the protease binding pocket is a large cavity with three to four prominent sub pockets, it provides an interesting scope for screening fragments for these sub pockets and then linking them to design new molecules with optimal binding with the protease. With the arrival of the very first structure (6LU7) of this protein in PDB (Jin et al., 2020) , several groups have come up with interesting strategies such as artificial intelligence based de novo design (Bung et al., 2020) , repurposing existing drugs that can bind this protein or virtually screening large chemical databases to identify peptide like small molecules (Pant et al., 2020) , natural products such as Moroccan medicinal plants products (Aanouz et al., 2020) , against this protein (Islam et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020) , identification of Andrographolide as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease through in silico screening (Enmozhi et al., 2020) using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and PCA based quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) for pattern recognition of the best ligands (Islam et al., 2020) , to mention a few. Till date RCSB protein data bank (PDB) reports more than 80 structures of the SARS-Cov-2 MP binding more than 80 different fragment like molecules (https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb5R7Y/pdb). These fragments bind to a particular sub-pocket of the large binding pocket of SARS-Cov-2 main protease. These recent additions in PDB have further strengthened our idea of designing inhibitors through fragment linking.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 595, "end": 612, "text": "(Gu et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2027, "end": 2048, "text": "(Khot & Nadkar, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2091, "end": 2115, "text": "(Bhatnagar et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2116, "end": 2133, "text": "Cao et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2160, "text": "Muralidharan et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2175, "end": 2197, "text": "(Sahraei et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2279, "end": 2303, "text": "(Al-Tawfiq et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2320, "text": "Ko et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2379, "end": 2403, "text": "(Al-Tawfiq et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2473, "end": 2492, "text": "(Dong et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2535, "end": 2552, "text": "(Lu et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2721, "end": 2741, "text": "(Hasan et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2761, "end": 2778, "text": "(Lu et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2894, "end": 2912, "text": "(Jin et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3187, "end": 3210, "text": "(Boopathi et al., 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3434, "end": 3457, "text": "(Boopathi et al., 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3566, "end": 3586, "text": "(Njogu et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3639, "end": 3663, "text": "(Choudhury et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3664, "end": 3683, "text": "Njogu et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3684, "end": 3705, "text": "Schuler et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 3784, "end": 3806, "text": "(Gahtori et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3807, "end": 3831, "text": "Srivastava et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3974, "end": 3997, "text": "(Choudhury et al., 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3998, "end": 4023, "text": "(Choudhury et al., , 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 4024, "end": 4048, "text": "Murgueitio et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 4228, "end": 4248, "text": "(Hasan et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4332, "end": 4352, "text": "(Elfiky & Azzam 2020", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4353, "end": 4368, "text": ", Elfiky, 2020a", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4530, "end": 4550, "text": "(Joshi et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 4551, "end": 4565, "text": "Elfiky, 2020b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4766, "end": 4780, "text": "(Elfiky, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4894, "end": 4914, "text": "(Sinha et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 5074, "end": 5095, "text": "(Wahedi et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 5229, "end": 5251, "text": "(Coutard et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 5252, "end": 5272, "text": "Hoffer et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 5273, "end": 5292, "text": "Kumar et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 5293, "end": 5313, "text": "Loving et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 5639, "end": 5660, "text": "(Hoffer et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 5661, "end": 5681, "text": "Loving et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 5848, "end": 5869, "text": "(Hoffer et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 6251, "end": 6276, "text": "(Kanakaveti et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 6439, "end": 6457, "text": "(Jin et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 6791, "end": 6809, "text": "(Jin et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 6921, "end": 6940, "text": "(Bung et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 7086, "end": 7105, "text": "(Pant et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 7168, "end": 7189, "text": "(Aanouz et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 7213, "end": 7233, "text": "(Islam et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 7234, "end": 7253, "text": "Sarma et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 7371, "end": 7393, "text": "(Enmozhi et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 7559, "end": 7579, "text": "(Islam et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-M Pro More than 80 different crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2-M Pro bound to diverse ligands have been deposited in PDB till date.

Glide SP protocol was applied initially for fast screening of the fragments, which returned 40805 fragment hits with docking scores ranging from \u00c09.79 to \u00c05.55. 1974 top hits with SP docking score < \u00c07 were chosen for further study. The nearest atoms of two fragments binding to different sub-pockets and are that are pre-positioned with respect to each other were joined to form a new molecule. The potential bonds that can be formed between two fragments placed in the adjacent sub-pockets were identified. These potential new bonds were identified by based on i) the distance between the atom that remains in one fragment and the atom that leaves in the other fragment must be less than 1 \u00c5 after adjustment of the bond lengths in each fragment to the ideal bond length for the new bond, ensuring the right alignment of fragments, ii) the angle between the bond directions should be less than 15 for a right rotational alignment of the fragments and iii) the distance between the fragment centroids should be below 2 \u00c5 to make sure that the fragments do not occupy the same location in the receptor cavities ( Figure 1) . However, the fragments can have some overlapping regions and both internal and peripheral (H and halogen) bonds were considered for breaking to form a bond with another fragment. Once such potential new bonds are identified, the fragments were linked in three rounds. In the first round, pairs of fragments were joined and in the next rounds of joining, the resultant molecules from the first round are considered for joining based on the above criteria and so on. The fragments, having no atoms as close as 1 \u00c5, but are lying in adjacent binding pockets are still considered for linking by introducing methylene groups to each fragment, and then if the bond formation criteria are satisfied, the two fragments were joined by maximum two methylene linkers. The minimum and maximum fragments to be joined were set to be 2 and 4 respectively. The fragments were randomly sampled in several non-redundant trials in order to manage the huge number of combinations. The number of such trials were set to be 20 for this study. Once the fragments are joined, the resultant structures are subjected to energy minimization restraining all heavy atoms in the fragments except for the linker atoms with a restraint of 100 kcal/mol. The fragment linking process taking 1974 selected high scoring fragments pre-positioned in different subpackets generated 487 novel molecules which were further screened using several levels of screening filters.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 503, "end": 512, "text": "(Fig. S2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2197, "end": 2206, "text": "Figure 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Fragment screening and linking"}, {"text": "The 487 newly formed molecules were subjected to further screening using four different levels of filters.

It also significantly enhances strong binding of ligands with the target (Guterres & Im, 2020) . The generated 17 complexes were submitted to MD simulations for 50 ns in an aqueous environment to study the evolution of these systems with respect to time. The PDB structure 6LU7 binding the peptide inhibitor N3 was also subjected to MD simulations as the reference system. Various analyses were carried out on the MD trajectories to evaluate the stabilities of the complexes. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) was used to measure the average change in displacement of the whole protein-ligand complexes and the ligands solely for all 5000 frames in the trajectory with respect to the first frame. Figures 5a and  5b show the RMSDs of the protein (All heavy atoms) and protein (Ca atoms). RMSD of the protein in all systems indicated that the simulations have equilibrated, the fluctuations towards the end of the simulation are around some thermal average structures. Changes in RMSD values of the protein considering all heavy atoms and the Ca atoms in all proteinligand complexes were of the order of 1-3 \u00c5, which is normally acceptable for small, globular proteins. We performed Principal component analysis (PCA) to understand conformational distribution during the simulation time and investigate large-scale collective motions of the protein in protein-ligand complexes on the trajectories generated by our simulations. Essential dynamics (ED) analysis script of the Desmond program (trj_essential_dynamics.py) (Amadei et al., 1993) was used through command line for predicting the dynamic behaviours of a protein. This script which calculates the principal components of the protein C-alpha atoms. The resulting mode vectors were stored as atom level properties in the output structure, and the cross-correlation plots and per-frame conformational deviations projected onto the modes were also be generated ( Figure S3 and S4) . Projection of the motion for the protein in phase space along the PC1 and PC2 for all these complexes showed uniform distribution of the conformations throughout the simulations, while, the cross-correlation plots showed no significant difference in the inter domain motions in SARS-CoV-2-M Pro structure in the 18 complexes (including the reference structure). No highly anti-correlated movements were noticed among the binding site residues. In order to further characterize local changes along the protein chain, The Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) of each residue in each complex throughout the simulations were comparatively analysed (Figure 5c ). RMSF of most of the residues (except the N and C-terminal ones) in all the systems were found to be well below 2.5 \u00c5. The residues D47-P52, Y154, relatively high fluctuations, which are not involved in ligand binding. However, Q189-N193, which are involved in ligand binding showed slightly high flexibilities in the complexes with MP-In10, MP-In11, MP-In17 and the reference system, as they are part of a long loop L1, joining D2 and D3. These analyses, led to the conclusion that the simulations produced stable trajectories of the receptor structures, thus providing a suitable basis for further investigation with the structural evolutions of the ligands within the binding sites. First, RMSDs of the ligands with respect to the receptors were analysed for the 18 protein-ligand complexes throughout the simulations ( Figure  5d ). The ligand RMSD values were calculated when the protein-ligand complex is first aligned on the protein backbone of the reference and then the RMSD of the ligand heavy atoms were measured. As the RMSD of the ligands with respect to the protein were observed to be maintained below 4 \u00c5 for 14 complexes (MP-In1 to MP-In5, MP-In-7 to MP-In10, MP-In12 to MP-In14 and MP-In16 to MP-In17), indicating that these ligands bind stably inside the binding pockets.

In order to draw further observations on the stabilities of the ligands inside the binding pocket, the radius of gyration (RGyr), which measures the 'extendedness/compactness' of a ligand, and the solvent accessible surface area (SASA), corresponding to the surface area of the ligands accessible by the water molecules were calculated and analysed (Figure 5e and 5f ). Both RGyr and SASA values for the reference ligand N3 were pretty high as compared to the screened molecules owing to its size and peptide nature. MP-In11 shows an increased Rgyr after 20 ns, which eventually gets stabilized, due to torsional rearrangements leading to a higher RMSD. However, its SASA remains relatively lower as compared to others ligands indicating it remains embedded in the binding pocket. At the same time MP-In15 shows a stable Rgyr profile, but the SASA shows a sudden increase, correlating with its RMSD profile (Figure 5d) indicates that, the molecule diffuses out of the binding pocket. The RGyr and SASA of rest of the ligands showed stable profiles suggesting stable binding. The stabilities of the complexes were further examined in terms of MM-GBSA DG bind and ligand efficiencies, which were calculated for snapshots of the complexes taken at every 5 ns (10 snapshots per system were collected). Figure 5g and 5h show the MM-GBSA DG bind and ligand efficiencies of the 18 complexes including the reference system throughout the simulations.
