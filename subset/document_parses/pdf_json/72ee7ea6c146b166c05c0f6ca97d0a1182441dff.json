            "text": "Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) are infrequent, benign tumor-like lesions involving axial and appendicular bones. Approximately 85% of ABCs occur in the second decade of life, although it might affect any age group. ABC usually affects long bones, and the spine (vertebral bodies) is the second affected site. Although biologically benign, ABCs tend to grow aggressively, causing adjacent bone and soft tissue destruction. 1 ABCs are composed of two groups of cells: (i) osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells expressing receptor activator of nuclear kappa B (RANK) receptors, and (ii) neoplastic stromal cells expressing the RANK ligand (RANKL). The upregulated RANK-RANKL signaling axis can promote osteoclastdependent bone resorption in ABC, similar to giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB). 2 Due to the rarity of ABC, the optimal treatment choice remains a matter of debate. Surgery (surgical resection or intralesional curettage), radiation therapy, sclerotherapy, selective arterial embolization, and intralesional injections (e.g., calcitonin and methylprednisolone) are among the treatment strategies. 2, 3 The successful results of denosumab in the treatment of GCTB have persuaded clinicians to apply this strategy in treating the ABC. Denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody binding to RANKL, has been FDA approved for (i) prevention of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma and solid tumors, (ii) refractory malignancy-induced hypercalcemia, (iii) unresectable GCTB in skeletally mature individuals, (iv) bone loss in breast and prostate cancer, and (v) glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis. 4 However, denosumab is not yet FDA-approved for ABC because of its limited existing literature. 2 We report a challenging ABC case in the cervical spine, resistant to surgery, selective arterial embolization, and radiation therapy, with significant regression to the first dose of denosumab. In addition, we review the relevant literature.",

ABCs are infrequent (0.14 per 10 people) biologically benign tumors with aggressive behavior and a tendency for local recurrence. It is more common in young women aged <20 years. 1 ABC can potentially involve any bone in the body, but it usually involves appendicular bones (lower limb >upper limb). Vertebral involvement is only reported in 20% of cases. There are two types of ABC: (i) primary (~70%) and (ii) secondary, which occurs in a preexisting bone disorder (e.g., giant cell tumor, osteoblastoma, and fibrous dysplasia). 2 The most common symptoms of vertebral ABC are pain, swelling, and neurologic dysfunction (motor >sensory). Also, it might be detected incidentally in imaging or secondary to pathological fracture. 1 The macroscopic view of ABC typically consists of blood-filled cysts, enclosed in a subperiosteal shell of reactive bone. On the microscopic view, the classic pathological features are F I G U R E 2 H&E-stained tissue of resected specimen demonstrating (A) blood-filled cystic spaces (asterisk sign) \u00d7100, and (B) stromal giant cells (white arrow) in favor of aneurysmal bone cyst \u00d7200.

Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG2/ kappa) binding to RANKL and impedes osteoclast activation. The safety of denosumab has been shown in several clinical trials. Its most significant adverse effects are hypophosphatemia (32%), hypocalcemia (18%), and osteonecrosis of the jaw (1.5%). 4 Although limited, the published literature is encouraging for denosumab in ABC (Table 1) . Raux et al. 14 reported the clinical results of denosumab in five children with inoperable ABC (4 in the spine). Denosumab was given 70 mg/m 2 (up to 120 mg) weekly for 4 weeks and monthly thereafter. After a median follow-up of 24 months, pain resolved in all and neurologic deficit improved in three patients, with favorable toxicity profile. Imaging showed a decrease in cystic lesions, fluidfluid levels, contrast enhancement, and bone healing.",
