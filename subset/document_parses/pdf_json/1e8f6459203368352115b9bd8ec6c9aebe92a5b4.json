            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis that has the potential to exacerbate worldwide malnutrition. This study examines whether patients with a history of malnutrition are predisposed to severe COVID-19. To do so, data on 103,099 COVID-19 inpatient encounters from 56 hospitals in the United States between March 2020 and June 2020 were retrieved from the Cerner COVID-19 Dataset. Patients with a history of malnutrition between 2015 and 2019 were identified, and a random intercept logistic regression models for pediatric and adult patients were built controlling for patient demographics, socioeconomic status, admission vital signs, and related comorbidities. Statistical interactions between malnutrition and patient age were significant in both the pediatric [log-odds and 95% confidence interval: 0.094 (0.012, 0.175)] and adult [\u2212 0.014 (\u2212 0.021, \u2212 0.006] models. These interactions, together with the main effect terms of malnutrition and age, imply higher odds for severe COVID-19 for children between 6 and 17 years with history of malnutrition. Even higher odds of severe COVID-19 exist for adults (with history of malnutrition) between 18 and 79 years. These results indicate that the long-term effect of malnutrition predisposes patients to severe COVID-19 in an agedependent way.",

The health system each patient belongs to was also retrieved for statistical modeling purposes. According to the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), malnutrition is a clinical condition that may be associated with weight loss over time, inadequate energy intake compared with estimated needs, muscle loss, fat loss, fluid accumulation, and diminished grip strength [19] [20] [21] . ASPEN defines pediatric malnutrition as an imbalance between intake and nutritional requirements resulting in cumulative energy, protein, or micronutrient deficits which may negatively affect growth and development 21 . Diagnosis of malnutrition is often undertaken through special assessments by a dietitian. The most reliable diagnosis of malnutrition is therefore in the assessments by dietitians which may result in the selection of the appropriate diagnosis code for the patient. We chose to use the diagnosis codes for malnutrition because it is available and the most practical approach with multicenter electronic medical records databases. The definitions of malnutrition have also evolved over the years and biomarkers such as serum albumin or other laboratory data have been identified as insufficient for proper diagnosis. The use of more stringent criteria is infeasible for large multicenter studies. Small multicenter studies with access to appropriate nutritional assessments and malnutrition screening tools are the gold standard for diagnosis of malnutrition. Lastly, we grouped all 3 levels of malnutrition (severe, moderate, and mild) into a single category to avoid extreme class imbalance and to estimate the average effect of malnutrition across all 3 levels. Therefore, patients with malnutrition were identified using the International Classification of Disease Version 10, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes between E40 and E46 -these codes encompass severe, moderate, and mild malnutrition.",

As a result, a severity measure that is both clinically and statistically sound in both children and adults is required. A binary severity measure was selected as severe and mild COVID-19. Severe disease activity was defined as patients placed on a mechanical ventilator or patients who died. This ensures that we are less concern about differences in mortality due to the availability of mechanical ventilators and factors such as severity of illness at the onset of mechanical ventilation and quality of care issues relating to census. Patients who required mechanical ventilation or who died required invasive procedures to reduce morbidity. Other patients were classified as having had mild COVID-19. The outcome variable is therefore \"mild\" vs \"severe\" COVID-19.",

It is imperative to target communities at highest risk of both malnutrition and COVID-19 as COVID-19 has been shown to increase the incidence of malnutrition 10 and malnutrition is associated with more severe disease in patients of certain age groups. These communities may very well be overlapping as malnutrition and COVID-19 have been seen to disproportionately affect communities that are most vulnerable to health disparities 30, 31 . Another opportunity for improving the quality of care of at-risk community (such as those suffering disproportionately from malnutrition) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ is education to ensure that these patients take advantage of resources addressing food insecurity and do not delay care on developing symptoms of COVID-19 as such delays may further worsen disease outcomes 32, 33 . This deeper understanding of the interplay between malnutrition and COVID-19 disease severity underlines the importance of nutritional assessment and intervention across all patient populations, particularly those at risk for COVID-19. There were several limitations of this study. History of malnutrition was determined using diagnosis codes which may underestimate its prevalence. Furthermore, all diagnosis histories were determined by searching This may have an impact on the crossover effect in pediatrics observed at 5 years for pediatrics in the interaction between malnutrition and age. However, diagnosis codes remain the most reliable and potentially consistent estimate of malnutrition that cuts across both pediatric and adult medicine in a multicenter study. There was no way to fully establish the primary cause of death or use of mechanical ventilation in this large multicenter study. We grouped severe, moderate, and mild malnutrition to avoid statistical problems with small sample sizes especially when considering 2-way statistical interactions. While the degree of malnutrition is identified as part of nutritional assessments, we chose to group all levels of malnutrition into a single category to estimate average effect across all severity levels. We were, therefore, able to assess the average effect of malnutrition as a first step with the reasonable assumption that any effect found would be worse in patients with severe malnutrition. Lastly, we were unable to distinguish between chronic and acute malnutrition related to acute illness.",

The low number of deaths in children makes it statistically infeasible to separate children who died. Furthermore, there are several factors associated with survival of mechanical ventilation independent of COVID-19. These factors (such as severity of illness at the onset of mechanical ventilation) are exacerbated due to potential shortage of ventilators or unusually high census in the hardest hit areas of the country. A simplification, therefore, was to focus on the need of mechanical ventilation for survival encompassing deaths that may occur before a patient can be placed on invasive mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, a binary outcome reduces the complexity of the statistical model especially given the need for assessment of statistical interactions 17 .",

This study established that the long-term effect of (or preexisting) malnutrition is also a critically important piece of the puzzle. While the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to increased incidence of malnutrition, malnourished patients or patients at risk of malnutrition are also at risk of suffering more severe forms of the disease. Preexisting disparities and new disparities created by COVID-19 may increase health care risks. It is therefore critical that additional studies are carried out and that public health policies affecting patients most at risk for COVID-19 and malnutrition be carefully weighed, in what may be a double-edged sword for patients at risk of malnutrition.
