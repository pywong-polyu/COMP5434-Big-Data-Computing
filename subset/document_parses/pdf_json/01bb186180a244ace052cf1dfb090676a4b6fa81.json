Methods A total of 149 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were recruited in the study. For 4 years, all patients were supervised by a department clinician using telemedicine. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to assess internal consistency. By evaluating the scores of 41 retested patients 1 week later, the test-retest reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess the construct validity (r). Results A total of 149 patients (103 women, 46 men) with a mean age of 40.9\u00b110.9 years were included in the study. MS duration of the patients was 9.15\u00b16.24 years. Internal consistency of all items and the total score of the TSUQ were excellent (>0.80; ranged 0.971-0.974). On the other hand, the internal consistency of all items and total score of the TPQ was excellent, either (>0.80; ranged 0.878-0.890). The ICC of the TSUQ's and TPQ's total score was excellent (>0.80). The correlation between TSUQ and TPQ was strong (r=0.734, p<0.01). In addition, there was moderate relationship between the TSUQ and the Beck Depression Scale (BDS) (r=\u22120.363, p<0.01). On the other hand, there was low correlation between TPQ and BDS (r=\u22120.217, p<0.05). Conclusion The Turkish version of the TSUQ and the TPQ is valid and reliable in individuals with MS.",

During the advanced translation phase, the original English was translated into Turkish by four academicians, native speakers of TSUQ and TPQ, who have a good command of English. Expert committee members in the field identified and recorded linguistic and cultural problems. In the second phase, the expert committee members created correction notes of TSUQ and TPQ for translations and discussed. The English translations of both questionnaires were synthesized and finalized. In the third stage, both questionnaires were independently translated into Turkish by two native English translators. Original English versions of both questionnaires were rejected and compared with the English versions in the fourth step, regardless of whether the final Turkish versions were conceptually and linguistically correct. In the last stage, draft versions of both questionnaires were created for use in pilot testing. At the last stage, a pilot study was conducted to question whether the Turkish versions of TSUQ and TPQ are suitable for understandability. A pretest was conducted on a 5-point Likert-type scale with 30 Turkish-speaking elderly individuals. Understandability was excellent in the pilot study. Therefore, no additional changes have been made. The latest Turkish versions of TSUQ and TPQ have been created.",

Telemedicine services (e.g., medication modifications, monitoring of symptoms, exercise management, follow-up of relapses) conducted to the patients were carried out through several operators or through web-based applications, phone calls, messaging, teleconference, within the needs and possibilities of the patients. Socio-demographic and physical characteristics of individuals with MS were recorded. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of the patients was scored by the neurologist [26] . In the first evaluation, 149 individuals with MS completed by thoroughly answering all the items of the Turkish versions of TSUQ, TPQ, and Beck Depression Scale (BDS) [20, 21, 27] . Due to the psychological criterion of pleasure was questioned, convergent validity was investigated by comparing it to BDS. In addition, since the expectations and benefits of the patients from the telemedicine service were also questioned, it was thought that it would have positive effects on their psychological state. A retest evaluation was carried out for individuals with MS 1 week later. In the retest evaluation, 41 individuals with MS answered the Turkish versions of TSUQ and TPQ.",

In addition, it has been stated that telemedicine has vital importance in pandemic situations due to possible limited staff, limited outpatient working hours, and increasing outpatient needs [33] . In this study, psychometric properties of TSUQ and TPQ were analyzed in individuals who had been undergoing a telerehabilitation program for 4 years, but more intensively for the last 6 months, by the neurology outpatient clinic. In this way, it is proposed to provide an analysis to use these patients reported outcome measures in future studies safely. TSUQ is one of the most popular questionnaires frequently used in telemedicine studies. English and Spanish versions of the TSUQ are available [20] . On the other hand, TPQ is available only in its original English version [21] . The Turkish version of both questionnaires could greatly lead to clinical practice and other case-control or intervention trials, given the dramatic rise in telemedicine and telerehabilitation in recent years and the role of remote health services in the COVID-19 process [34] [35] [36] . The consistency of the telemedicine program and level of satisfaction could be compiled and tracked in a more detailed and systematic way using the quantitative data derived from patient reviews.

The TSUQ and TPQ were found to be appropriate in terms of comprehensibility in a pilot analysis. As a result, no other changes to the pretest were needed.
