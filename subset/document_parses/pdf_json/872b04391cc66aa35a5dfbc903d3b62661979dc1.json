Since May 8, 2020, the daily R0 is around one, Fig. 4 . Moreover, we noticed 31% reduction of its mean value from 1,41 to 0,97 between the last two months. The Algerian Age-Standardized Infection Fatality Rate we found is 0,88%. Based on that, we demonstrated that only 1,5% of actual infections were detected and reported before March 30, and 20% after March 31, Fig. 5 . Therefore, the actual infections burden is currently five times higher than reported. At the end, we found that at least 0,2 % of the population have been infected until May 27. Consequently, the acquired herd immunity to date is therefore not sufficient to avoid a second wave.",

And the denominator of NYC-IFR that represents the number of the already infected population is the result of the New York State antibody study (1,7 million people (19.9% ) in NYC had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 as of May 1, 2020) (New York State, 2020).

We used this value to compute the actual daily infections retrospectively. Thus, after taking into account 18 days to consider the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death, we presented graphically (Fig. 5 ) the fitting between daily reported infections and fatality-based retrospectively estimated infections. We have seen that the gap between the estimated infections and the reported infections was considerable between March 12 and March 30, 2020, knowing that the epidemic has started in the main outbreak in Blida, on March 01, 2020. We found that, only an average of 1,5% of infections was detected and reported among the total estimated infections (from February 25 to March 30, 2020), and an average of 20% for the duration between March 31 and June 14, 2020 (Fig. 5) .

So, we believe that, the found result of Algerian Age-Standardized Infection Fatality Rate (AS-IFR=0,88%) is more accurate than the reported case-fatality rate (7% until June 14, 2020), because, the latter is based only on reported cases as a denominator. In addition, the found value is in accordance with the IFR that are estimated worldwide between 0,5% and 1,5%, for instance; the IFR in France 0.7% (Henrik, et al., 2020) , in Italy 1.31% (Gianluca & Paradisi, 2020) , and in China 0,66% (Robert, et al., 2020) .",

Also, results from a serological study show that 19.9% of the New York population had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after three months and 15 days from the date of the first case (March 1, 2020) (NYC, 2020). The previously mentioned examples show that, the cumulative incidence of infections in Algeria, may be higher than 0,2%, even if it is the case, the herd immunity appears insufficient to avoid a second wave if all control measures are released by the end of the lockdown. It is also possible that the cumulative incidence is low because of the strong measures that the government has implemented since March 23, 2020 (Hamidouche 2, 2020).",
