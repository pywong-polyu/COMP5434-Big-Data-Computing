Based on micro-simulation model data representing the epidemiology in the United Kingdom (UK) for which high-quality data was available, the authors attempt to evaluate the population-level expected benefits and risks of regular use of low-dose aspirin therapy. The model focuses on adults eligible for low-dose aspirin treatment for primary or secondary CVD prevention, with the evidence assessment on the effect of aspirin for CRC prevention. The decrease in both fatal CVD and CRC events was more significant than the increase in catastrophic safety events, and this difference was more pronounced when low-dose aspirin was used. These findings are essential in initiating wide prophylaxis in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic, where environmental risks drive societies towards unhealthy diets and lifestyles.",
