The UK's LDKT activity falls behind that of many other countries, and there is evidence of socioeconomic inequity in access. We aimed to develop a UK-specific multicomponent intervention to support eligible individuals to access a LDKT. The intervention was designed to support those who are socioeconomically-deprived and currently disadvantaged, by targeting mediators of inequity identified in earlier work. We identified three existing interventions in the literature which target these mediators: a) the Norway model (healthcare practitioners contact patients' family with information about kidney donation), b) a home education model, and c) a Transplant candidate advocate model. We undertook intervention development using the Person-Based Approach (PBA). We performed in-depth qualitative interviews with people with advanced kidney disease (n = 13), their family members (n = 4), and renal and transplant healthcare practitioners (n = 15), analysed using thematic analysis. We investigated participant views on each proposed intervention component. We drafted intervention resources and revised these in light of comments from qualitative 'think-aloud' interviews. Four general themes were identified: i) Perceived cultural and societal norms; ii) Influence of family on decision-making; iii) Resource limitation, and iv) Evidence of effectiveness. For each intervention discussed, we identified three themes: for the Norway model: i) Overcoming communication barriers and assumptions; ii) Request from an official third party, and iii) Risk of coercion; for the home education model: i) Intragroup dynamics; ii) Avoidance of hospital, and iii) Burdens on participants; and for the transplant candidate advocates model: i) Vested interest of advocates; ii) Time commitment, and iii) Risk of misinformation. We used these results to develop a multicomponent intervention which comprises components from existing interventions that have been adapted to increase acceptability and engagement in a UK population. This will be evaluated in a future randomised controlled trial.",

It is the best treatment in terms of life-expectancy for most people with kidney failure [1, 2] .

Only 20% of those listed on the UK's kidney transplant waiting list receive a LDKT each year [9] , and certain groups of individuals with kidney disease appear to be less likely to receive a LDKT. Socioeconomic deprivation describes the disadvantage of an individual or group relative to others in society, as indicated by people's education, employment, income, and assets [10, 11] . In the UK the most socioeconomically-deprived people with kidney disease are 60% less likely to receive a LDKT than the least deprived [12] . Improving equity in living-donor kidney transplantation has been highlighted as a research priority by patients and clinicians [13, 14] . In this study we aimed to develop a multicomponent intervention to support those currently disadvantaged in accessing a LDKT and to increase LDKT numbers in the UK. This study follows our previous mixed-methods research to identify barriers to living-donor kidney transplantation, and to understand reasons for the observed socioeconomic inequity in the UK (Fig 1) .",

Patient activation describes the knowledge, skills and confidence a person has in managing their own health and health care [15] . Social support comprises the emotional, physical, practical, informational, and relational assistance available to a person [16] ; perceived social support describes what support an individual perceives is available and may not correlate with true available social support. Finally, health literacy describes an individual's ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information needed to make appropriate health decisions [17] . Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with a lack of LDKT knowledge [18, 19] , lower levels of patient activation [18, 19] , perceived low levels of social support [18, 19] , and lower health literacy [20] (Fig 2) .",

'Theory and evidence based' approaches develop interventions by combining published research evidence and existing theories. As indicated above we identified three existing intervention components from the published literature. One intervention (Home-based patient and family education) had been developed with respect to multisystemic therapy theory and had RCT evidence of effectiveness. One intervention (TCAs) had weak evidence of effectiveness from an observational study, and one ('the Norway model') had not been formally evaluated in research. 'Target population centred' approaches develop interventions based on the views of the people who will use them, and we employed the 'Person-Based Approach' (PBA) to do this. The PBA [31] is a method for optimising intervention materials to ensure they are as acceptable and engaging as possible and feasible for use. Through qualitative interviews we aimed to understand how different people may view and engage with the proposed intervention components, which components seem particularly relevant or attractive to them, and which may be rejected. The PBA involves the production of 'Guiding Principles' consisting of two elements: i) intervention design objectives, and ii) key features of the intervention that can achieve these objectives (Table 2 ).",

The intervention comprises components from existing interventions that have been adapted to increase acceptability and engagement in a UK population. Intervention resources have been produced after an iterative development process. We have gained insights into which of the intervention components should be discarded, and which aspects of the intervention should be fixed or flexible in the full trial [40] . The intervention has thus been developed and optimised prior to evaluation in the ASK trial: improving AccesS to Kidney transplantation (ISRCTN registry reference ISRCTN10989132 https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN10989132). The final intervention for trial is detailed in the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist [41] in S2 Table. The developed intervention may undergo further refinement following evaluation in the feasibility trial [42] . Through a mixed-methods process evaluation we will aim to understand people's experiences of and views on the intervention and resources at delivery in the real world, refining and adapting the intervention as necessary. We will also aim to understand how to optimise implementation and understand the influence of context on intervention delivery and effectiveness [30] . Table 5 .

We found that interventions delivered in one population may require modification before being adopted in other populations. The Transplant Candidate Advocate intervention component, previously evaluated in observational work in the USA, was not popular with participants and this component will not be part of our intervention. This finding may be because individuals in this UK population have different views to those of individuals in a USA healthcare population. However, to our knowledge, no qualitative evaluation of the Transplant Candidate Advocate intervention has been undertaken in the USA, and therefore the concerns participants raised in this study may not be population specific. This might be more likely given that the identified themes were not related to UK culture or the healthcare model (Vested interest of advocates; Time commitment; Risk of misinformation). However, some participants perceived the intervention components as belonging to another culture, and therefore not an approach that translated to the UK. Changing cultural norms was seen as possible and participants suggested time would be the biggest factor in models of care becoming established practice.",

In this study, one participant indicated that knowledge that other people were engaging in these activities ('something that people just did') may have change her own unwillingness to engage. The beliefs and attitudes of family members and friends contribute to perceived social norms. Our study findings emphasised the importance of the family on decision-making regarding donation and acceptance of a LDKT, something previously reported in numerous qualitative studies and a systematic review [45] . This finding highlights the importance of engaging with family members and friends even if they are unsuitable or unwilling to personally donate as they may still be influential on the decisions and actions of other potential donors and the transplant candidate, with capacity to affect the perceived social norms.",

The intervention was recognised as requiring dedicated resources, including professionals specifically employed to deliver the role. The process evaluation planned to run parallel to the trial will also allow us to evaluate both the capacity of the NHS to deliver the intervention and the impact of delivery on existing NHS services. This is essential to ensure an effective intervention is not rejected because of limited NHS resources, and to ensure an intervention effective at increasing LDKTs doesn't have a negative impact on another service. Related to appropriate allocation of limited resources was the question of whether there was evidence that the proposed intervention components were effective. No participants expressed strong beliefs that one intervention component would be effective, which suggests there is equipoise as to whether the interventions would work or not, important for recruitment to and delivery of an RCT [46] . In addition to effectiveness, given the significant required resources to deliver the intervention, cost-effectiveness information is crucial to guaranteeing healthcare funding for the intervention. A cost-effectiveness evaluation will be essential in the final full-scale trial, and information on cost-drivers will be evaluated in the feasibility trial.",

            "text": "This study provides an in-depth investigation of the views of people with kidney disease, family members, and healthcare workers towards potential interventions to improve access to living-donor kidney transplantation. Talking participants through the intervention components in qualitative interviews has allowed different perspectives to emerge compared with responses to closed or more abstract questions [47] . Participants shared their views on both the proposed intervention components and drafted intervention resources, and the work achieved the aim of developing a multicomponent intervention and resources for delivery. Theme saturation was reached, and patient and healthcare worker participants were purposively selected for maximum diversity to capture the views of a variety of stakeholders. There are some limitations: i) Only 4 family members participated. Recruitment was limited by two main factors. Firstly, family members could be recruited by patient participants inviting their family members which may have been difficult and akin to approaching them to consider donation. Secondly, the Covid-19 pandemic meant that family members were not allowed to attend hospital appointments with patients and therefore exposure to waiting room posters about the study was limited. ii) Although participants were sampled from two NHS trusts they were from one region of the UK. Although a diverse sample was achieved, findings may not transfer to other regions or other centres in the UK. iii) Interviews were carried out by a clinician (PKB), known to most of the healthcare workers. Although participants spoke freely we are unable to determine if this altered responses. PKB was not known to any of the patient or family participants. iv) Interviews were not undertaken with individuals who did not speak English, and study resources have only been developed in English. Whilst resources could be translated we do not feel that this will be sufficient adaptation for individuals who do not speak English. This intervention has been developed to particularly address variables that mediate socioeconomic inequity and may not address barriers that explain ethnic inequity in access to living-donor transplantation [48] , which differ from those being targeted here [49] . If the intervention proves acceptable, feasible and effective it will require formal adaptation for non-English speaking groups. This will require adaptation beyond simple translation of language, and will require cultural adaptation, as well as specifically addressing different barriers to living-donor transplantation. Translating intervention resources without additional cultural adaptation risks inappropriately discarding an effective intervention. Such cultural adaptation is required when evaluating an intervention in any new population: as illustrated in this study, interventions used in other countries do not automatically translate to a UK population.",

It gives that person the opportunity to possibly get a donor and for the information to be told amongst the family at the same time, so they all know the situation anyway.' (Patient/Male/40-49 years/Unemployed). 'Magnificent idea.' (Patient/Male/70-79 years/Retired). 'As an idea it sounds brilliant.' (Patient/Male/60-69 years/Unemployed). Intragroup dynamics. Participants suggested that group education was better than individual education due to intragroup dynamics enhancing the interaction. Participants reported that family presence might bolster confidence in asking questions: 'Yeah and I think if you're actually on home surroundings . . . that you know and you feel comfortable with I think you're more open and, not direct, but you'll be open in asking questions that are on your mind. Rather than keeping them back and thinking about them and think, 'Well, maybe I should have asked that, I should have asked that'. Because there'd be no need to because you'd have support of their family, the family are there with you.' (Patient/ Male/50-59 years/Full-time employment). Two participants also suggested that other group members might ask questions you'd not considered, which might trigger other members to ask other related questions: '. . .the question you don't know you're gonna have might come out during that time and things like that.' (Patient/Male/40-49 years/Full-time employment).A few participants expressed concerns about negative intragroup dynamics: '. . . you may have a family where then you've got the partners are split up. Then you've got other partners. So, they all live in different houses and again there may be internal-you know-friction.' (Nurse other/Female/50-59 years). 'I've got some of my family members who are very quiet, and they'd just listen to all of it and wouldn't actually say anything. Then I've got others that will just take over the whole thing,' (Nurse other/Female/50-59 years). '. . . there's that sort of peer pressure thing going on and perhaps that competitive, 'Oh they've offered, I'll offer' you know, particularly thinking about sort of young men and the, I don't know, testosterone-fuelled.' (Family member/Female/30-39 years/Full or part-time employment).One previous kidney donor highlighted that family group education lacked the intergroup dynamics that exist with group education of multiple families, suggesting that being educated in a small family group in the home meant the benefits of mixing with others with kidney disease and their families were lost:'Because there is something about if you've gone to the house and you meet the friends and family, okay it's still keeping whatever thoughts or beliefs are in that group. Whereas if you come out of your group and go to hospital you see a much broader cross section of people suffering and they've all got different questions and it broadens your mind to think outside your normal way of thinking.'

One healthcare professional highlighted that home visits may be particularly welcome in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic if people are worried about the risk of acquiring infections in the hospital environment: 'I think that the hospitals are going to be stigmatised and I think home therapy and home visits are going to be really, really helpful.' (Transplant physician or surgeon/Male/40-49 years). Burdens on participants. Seven participants expressed negative opinions about the home-based education model. They reported that a home visit may be associated with additional burdens on the participants, both the hosts and guests: 'I think it will be a pressure for them, if they are from a poor background with a hospital person coming. If you have a guest coming into your house you have the preparation and things, and then you have that unnecessary stress.' (Transplant nurse or coordinator/Female/40-49 years).",
