Many of the traditional aspects of applying to medical school -Medical College Admissions Testing (MCAT), volunteering or working in a hospital, studying for long hours, and, if one is lucky enough, interviewing with medical schools -have all been greatly affected by this global pandemic. Colleges and universities around the country, for fear of becoming hot spots for COVID-19, have mandated students to vacate campuses and resume classes virtually. This poses several challenges to the potential medical school applicant (Table) . Indeed, this pandemic may stimulate changes to medical education that were long overdue. 2, 3 One of the biggest components of applying to medical school is taking the MCAT.",

Common premed jobs, such as scribe positions and medical assistants, were suspended for months, as physicians have many times transitioned to working from home remotely. Similarly, many basic science laboratories were closed for a period of months, and premed research assistants were not allowed to perform any on-site activities. Nevertheless, new online opportunities have arisen. In many states, for instance, the virtual job of contact tracing to aid in the fight against COVID-19 presented a novel opportunity for premedical students. This unfortunate pandemic has provided prospective medical school students the chance to truly help in a situation that is unprecedented in our generation. Hopefully, these challenges induced by the COVID-19 pandemic might also allow for applicants to experience personal growth -not everything will go according to plan and learning how to adapt J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and overcome challenges is crucial, especially in the practice of medicine.

How do medical schools adapt now that in-person interviews clash with social distancing guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)? Like many others who are now turning to the virtual world, medical school interviews may be conducted online through systems such as Zoom or Google Hangouts. This new online direction may have disadvantages, such as inability to actually read people and have more natural conversations. On the other hand, many students may find the virtual interview to provide a more comfortable setting from which to be interviewedindividuals may be more secure and less anxious while in their own homes. Overall, prospective students may find the virtual interviews to be a less intimidating process while still being engaging. As this pandemic has demonstrated, telemedicine is effective and may very well continue to play a vital role in health care for many years. 2 By having applicants become familiar with the tele-based technology, medical schools will truly be creating physicians of the future.",

This worry is compounded given the current economic climate. Families and communities across the country are facing financial uncertainty as we are all still in doubt about the future. Minority communities, rural areas, and lower income families have been hit especially hard economically during this time, as well as facing a disproportionate amount of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Students who would have otherwise been unable to apply to certain schools may J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f now be able to overcome such a hurdle due to the absence of travel costs. Once again, the pandemic offers an opportunity to reassess the status quo in a way that may prove beneficial, particularly to socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. 2 This could turn out to be the biggest silver lining of the pandemic.",

Fears have been shared by the CDC director, as he has remarked that the country's health workers may be overwhelmed should there be a combined COVID-19 and influenza season. Unlike other disasters, no one currently alive has any experience with a pandemic. The wisdom of elders of the 1918 pandemic is lost other than in the written word. Thus, there is enormous collective social anxiety, and medical students -an anxious bunch under the best of circumstances -are under tremendous stress, a fact those involved in the selection process must acknowledge and try to mitigate. Nevertheless, medical students are also some of the most resilient young people, and this struggle with COVID-19 will only make them dream bigger, work harder, and achieve more.
