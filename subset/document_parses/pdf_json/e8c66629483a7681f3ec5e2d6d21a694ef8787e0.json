Nonstructural protein (nsp) 16 in complex with nsp10 catalyzes the final step of coronaviral mRNA-capping through its 2\u00b4-Omethylation activity. Like other methyltransferases, SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex is druggable. However, the availability of an optimized assay for high-throughput screening (HTS)",

Particularly, CoVs generate mRNAs with a type-1 cap structure to avoid identification and activation of host defence mechanisms [13] [14] [15] [16] . Coronaviral mRNA-capping starts with the removal of 5\u2032-\u03b3-phosphate from nascent viral RNA by nsp13. A Guanosine monophosphate is then attached to the 5\u2032-diphosphate by an RNA-guanylyltransferase to form GpppN-RNA. Subsequently, nsp14 methylates N 7 of guanosine, giving rise to a Cap-0. Ultimately, Cap-0 is transformed into a doubly methylated (Cap-1) structure by nsp16 9, 17 .",

Nsp16 is a member of the 2\u2032-O methyltransferase (MTase) family, catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to RNA substrates 20 . MTases are generally druggable with several highly selective and cell-active inhibitors of human MTases available 21 . The in vitro 2\u2032-O-MTase activity of nsp16 has been reported for Feline-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, nsp16 was significantly active only when in complex with nsp10 23 . Nsp16 alone is unstable, and nsp10-nsp16 complex formation is essential for its binding to SAM and RNA substrate 24 . The crystal structure of nsp16 has only been determined in complex with nsp10 26 . Several structures of nsp10-nsp16 from various CoV species are available as apo, and in complex with RNA substrate, SAM, or SAM analogues, which vastly enables the structure-based hit optimization 24, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Nsp10-nsp16 complex selectively binds and methylates longer CoV mRNAs and synthetic small RNAs with Cap-0 23 . Moreover, SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16 methylates N7-meGpppA-RNA, but not N7-meGpppG-RNA, which provides some selectivity over the host mRNAs 24 .",

The methylated RNA product was captured using SPA plates followed by recording the changes in CPM. Initial tests at 250 nM of nsp10-nsp16 complex, 2 \u03bcM RNA substrate, and 5 \u03bcM SAM indicated the protein complex is active with significant signal-to-noise ratio. The assay conditions were further optimized with respect to the pH of the buffer and the presence of several commonly used additives (Fig. 1) . The complex was most active at pH 7.5 (Fig. 1A) . Using this optimal pH, the effects of other buffer components were investigated. Although NaCl over a wide range of concentrations (10-100 mM) reduced the enzyme activity by about 30%, KCl had little effect on nsp10-nsp16 complex activity up to 100 mM, and MgCl2 slightly increased the signal (Figs. 1B-D) . However, presence of Triton X-100 as low as 0.002% increased the signal by more than 20% (Fig. 1E) . Tween-20 had a similar effect (Suppl. Fig. 1A) . The reducing agents, TCEP and DTT, had no significant effect on enzyme activity (Figs. 1G-H) . The presence of BSA at concentrations higher than 0.02% reduced the signal readout (Fig. 1F) . EDTA at concentrations as low as 50 \u00b5M considerably reduced the activity (Suppl . Fig. 1B) . Based on these observations, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.01% BSA, and 5 mM DTT was selected as the optimized buffer condition for SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-np16 complex MTase activity assays. Overall, the assay optimization led to 70% increase in assay signal over the starting assay conditions (Suppl. Fig. 1C) . The nsp10-nsp16 complex activity under the optimized conditions was not affected by DMSO up to 5% (Fig.   1I ).",

Initial assessment of the MTase activity at various concentrations of nsp10-nsp16 complex indicated reaction linearity up to around 250 nM of the protein complex (Supp. Fig. 1D) . At 250 nM of nsp10-nsp16 complex, using the membrane-based approach, apparent Km values of 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM and 1.6 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM were determined for SAM and RNA, respectively, with apparent kcat of 15.9 \u00b1 1.2 h -1 ( Figs. 2A-B) . For determining the Km of SAM, the concentration of RNA was kept at 5.6 \u03bcM, whereas when assessing the Km of the RNA substrate, SAM concentration was at 6.0 \u03bcM. To investigate if lowering the concentration of nsp10-nsp16 complex is possible without nsp16 inactivation due to complex dissociation, the kinetic parameters for SAM and RNA were also determined at 125 nM of nsp10-nsp16 complex. Using a SPA, the linear initial velocities were used to calculate the kinetic parameters (Suppl. Figs. 2A-B) . The apparent Km of 2.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM and 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM for SAM and RNA substrate respectively were determined (Figs. 2C-D) . The apparent kcat value was 26.9 \u00b1 0.3 h -1 . In this round of experiments, the concentration of the second substrates, SAM and RNA, were kept at 8.0 \u03bcM and 5.0 \u03bcM, respectively. These data indicated that nsp10 and nsp16 stay in complex at lower concentration and the integrity of the complex was not affected by further dilution of the protein complex. Therefore, all further assays were performed at 125 nM of nsp10-nsp16 complex.

However, administering these vaccines requires very specific handling protocols, such as extremely low storage temperature for some, which may not be easily achievable in many countries. Even if all conditions are met, it will take many months to complete the vaccination. In addition, these vaccines may not be effective on fast mutating coronaviruses. This necessitates antiviral development 36 . The 2\u2032-O-MTase nsp16 has been proposed as an appealing target for development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics 8, 11, 28, 37 . Deletion of SARS-CoV nsp16 coding-region resulted in a blockade of viral RNA synthesis 18 , and nsp16 mutants have shown a strong attenuation in infected mice 19 . It has been suggested that nsp10-nsp16 complex, through its mRNA-capping activity, helps the CoVs evade the host immune system 15 , therefore, any interruption in the activity of the nsp10-nsp16 could hinder the pathogenesis of CoVs through eliciting an immune response 13, 15, 16 . Inhibition of nsp10-nsp16 complex MTase activity by SAH (the product of the reaction), sinefungin (a SAM analogue) and aurintricarboxylic acid have been reported 22, 23, 38 . However, potent and cell-permeable nsp10-nsp16 inhibitors are yet to be developed. The availability of activity-based HTS-screening assays would greatly enabe drug discovery. Activity of SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16 complex has previously been assessed using a filter binding-based assay 22 . Most recently, an HTS RNA-displacement assay has been reported for SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex that will detect RNA competitive inhibitors. 31 The nsp10-nsp16 complex activity assays reported to-date are low throughput [22] [23] [24] 38 .",

Since around 10-fold molar excess of nsp10 is required for the maximum in vitro MTase activity of nsp16 23 , a 1:8 ratio of nsp16 to nsp10 was chosen to ensure a near maximum activity of the complex. The kinetic parameters of nsp10-nsp16 complex methyltransferase activity are presented for the first time. Thus, the Km of SAM and RNA were determined to be 2.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM and 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM, respectively. The ITC Kd values of 5.59 \u00b1 1.15 \u03bcM and 1.21 \u00b1 0.41 \u03bcM for SAM and RNA, respectively, were previously reported for nsp10-nsp16 complex from SARS-CoV 24 . The IC50 values for SAH and sinefungin determined in this study were consistent with previously reported values for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV nsp10-nsp16 complex. 22, 23 Testing a subset of potent and selective chemical probes for human methyltransferases did not significantly inhibit the nsp10-nsp16 complex activity, indicating that the assay has a very low rate of false positives and is well suited for HTS. Unlike RNA displacement assays, this methyltransferase activity assay is suitable in detecting both SAM-and RNA competitive inhibitors.",

The level of 3 H-methylated-RNA in each reaction was quantified by measuring the radioactivity level (CPM; counts per minute) employing both a highcapacity biotin-capture membrane-based approach and an SPA-based method. For the membranebased method, 12 \u03bcL of the quenched mixture was spotted on streptavidin-coated SAM2 \u00ae Biotincapture membranes. The membranes were washed twice with 2M NaCl (2 min each), rinsed with water three times (2 min each), and were allowed to fully air dry. Subsequently, the spotted squares were cut from membrane and placed separately into scintillation vials containing scintillant solution, MicroScint TM -O (PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA). Finally, the 3 H-methyl-RNA product was quantified using a Tri-Carb scintillation counter, PerkinElmer. In the SPA-based approach, the quenched mixtures were transferred into 96-well FlashPlates after adding 150 \u03bcL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0 in each well. To avoid saturation of beads in these plates with excess RNA substrate, only 6 \u03bcL of the quenched mixture was added to each well. 3 H-Biotin at different concentrations were used as control. After overnight incubation, the level of 3 H-methylated-RNA was measured by scintillation counting. Afterwards, the initial velocities were obtained from the linear portions of the reaction progression curves. The kinetic parameters were calculated using Michaelis-Menten equation by GraphPad Software.",
