Differential diagnosis with genetic cardiomyopathy can be difficult. The objective of this study is to identify patterns of clinical presentation and to assess invasive and non-invasive measures to differentiate patients with acute myocarditis from patients with dilated genetic cardiomyopathy. We performed a retrospective descriptive study of all paediatric patients (0-16 years old) that presented with new-onset heart failure with left ventricle ejection fraction < 35% in whom we performed an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) during the period from April 2007 to December 2020. The patients were classified into two groups: Group 1 included 18 patients with myocarditis. Group 2 included 9 patients with genetic cardiomyopathy. Findings favouring a diagnosis of myocarditis included a fulminant or acute presentation (77.8% vs 33.3%, p = 0.01), higher degree of cardiac enzyme elevation (p = 0.011), lower left ventricular dimension z-score (2.2 vs 5.4, p = 0.03) increase of ventricular wall thickness (88.8% vs 33.3%, p = 0.03) and oedema in the EMB. Seven (77.8%) patients with genetic cardiomyopathy had inflammation in the endomyocardial biopsy fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of inflammatory cardiomyopathy.",

The Dallas histological diagnostic criteria [6] have shown to have low sensitivity and high inter-observer variability [7] .

It has been reported that 50-60% of adults [8] [9] [10] [11] and 46% of children [8, 9] with dilated cardiomyopathy have evidence of inflammation or viral genome in the heart, suggesting previous viral myocarditis. These patients could benefit from immunosuppressive or antiviral treatment [8, [12] [13] [14] . Nevertheless, it is known that some patients with genetic cardiomyopathy can present inflammatory infiltrates [10, 15] and the presence of a viral genome in the myocardium has been found in patients without cardiomyopathy [16] . Still, these findings do not always imply an active infection. Differentiation between inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to a previous myocarditis versus genetic dilated cardiomyopathy might be very challenging, but it has important implications both for prognosis and to establish the appropriate treatment [17] .",

            "text": "Acute myocarditis can present with new-onset severe left ventricular dysfunction, and differential diagnosis with a genetic dilated cardiomyopathy should be considered. In our study, most patients from group 2 (66.6%) had a subacute clinical presentation (more than 15 days of evolution) whereas most patients from group 1 had a fulminant or acute presentation. Unlike what might be expected, the presence of a family history of genetic cardiomyopathy was infrequent. Troponin values were higher in patients with myocarditis, and left ventricle end-diastolic diameter was significantly lower in this group. These facts may be related to a more acute form of presentation. The presence of trabeculations that met non-compaction criteria was more common in group 2 (44.4%), but it was also seen in 2 patients (11.1%) from group 1 (p = 0.136). These 2 patients had a subacute presentation, with a history of PVB19 infection several weeks before heart failure and PVB19 PCR was positive in blood and heart samples. Genetic test was negative in both, and there was no family history of cardiomyopathy. Thus, LV trabeculations seen in these patients could be the result of a LV remodelling process. Hypertrophy of the septum or posterior wall of the LV was more frequent in patients with myocarditis (88.8% vs 33.3%, p = 0.03), and this finding is likely to be associated with myocardial oedema. In our experience, CMR sensitivity in paediatric patients with myocarditis is low in cardiomyopathic clinical presentation. This fact has been previously described in adult patients [21] . In our study, we could perform a CRM in only 14 patients due to hemodynamic instability on admission: 8 patients in group 1 and 6 in group 2. In the myocarditis group, 7/8 patients (87.8%) met at least 1 of the Lake Louise criteria, but only 3 patients (37.5%) met 2/3, a necessary condition for making the diagnosis. Interestingly, we also found 2 out of 6 patients in group 2 (33.3%) that underwent a CMR that also met 2/3 Lake Louise criteria for myocarditis.

In our experience, the rate of complications is low when performed in patients \u2265 6 months and \u2265 8 kg and the samples are taken from the right ventricular septum. Suthar et al. [17] published a remarkably interesting study in which they assessed the utility of non-invasive measures to distinguish myocarditis from other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy in paediatric patients. They establish the diagnosis of myocarditis based on Dallas criteria. In our experience, these criteria [6] are of limited use, as only 50% of patients with myocarditis fulfilled them. Despite this, some of our results are similar. In addition, we describe the most common findings in EMB. Current immunohistology criteria [8] have not been validated in the paediatric population. We observed a high rate of false positives, given that 77.8% of the patients with genetic cardiomyopathy presented \u2265 14 mononuclear cells/mm 2 with \u2265 7 CD3 lymphocytes/mm 2 in the EMB. One possible explanation for these findings could be that these patients had concurrent acute myocarditis. As previously described [10, 15] , an acute myocarditis presentation may be the initial manifestation of arrhythmogenic or dilated cardiomyopathies in children. In our opinion, a more plausible explanation is that myocardial inflammation can be triggered by acute clinical decompensation with severe cardiac dysfunction in individuals with genetic cardiomyopathy. This theory has also been proposed recently by Ammirati et al. [23] .",

Interestingly, a recent paper from Ukimura et al. reported that myocarditis secondary to influenza viruses could present a clinical picture of fulminant myocarditis with very mild histological changes [24] . In our study, 3 cases had influenza (patients 9, 10 and 13), and all of them had very mild histological changes. If those patients were excluded from the analysis, the number of lymphocytes/ mm 2 would have been significantly higher in the myocarditis group (53 (8-180) CD3/mm 2 vs 14 (0-24), p = 0.009). Then, the differences in both groups would become statistically significant. Myocardial oedema in the EMB was observed in 66.6% of patients in group 1 and none of group 2 (p = 0.001), suggesting that it could be a specific marker of myocarditis. On the other hand, myocyte hypertrophy was more likely in patients with genetic cardiomyopathy (5.5% vs 44.4%, p = 0.03).

Despite this, myocardial PCR only had a 50% sensitivity, with a 22.2% rate of false-positive cases. The detection of viral genome in the heart of patients without cardiomyopathy has also been previously described [16] . The usefulness of the blood PCR was greater in younger patients (Table 1) , especially in children under 5 years of age.",

Thus, familiar and genetic study is recommended in paediatric patients with acute and subacute new onset-heart failure. Acute myocarditis is a suspected diagnosis where no examination, by itself, is sensitive and specific enough. Using invasive and non-invasive measures may be useful to develop a predictive model to differentiate myocarditis from genetic cardiomyopathy.
