While this exam has traditionally been performed in person, with trained clinicians both eliciting and grading the reflex, this work seeks to enable the exam by novices. The COVID-19 pandemic has motivated greater utilization of telemedicine and other remote healthcare delivery tools. A smart tendon hammer capable of streaming acceleration measurements wirelessly allows differentiation of correct and incorrect tapping locations with 91.5% accuracy to provide feedback to users about the appropriateness of stimulation, enabling reflex elicitation by laypeople, while survey results demonstrate that novices are reasonably able to grade reflex responses. Novice reflex grading demonstrates adequate performance with a mean error of 0.2 points on a five point scale. This work shows that by assisting in the reflex elicitation component of the reflex exam via a smart hammer and feedback application, novices should be able to complete the reflex exam remotely, filling a critical gap in neurological care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Clear separation between the tendon and incorrect location is apparent up to about 50 Hz, which indicates that the 200 Hz sampling rate may be sufficient for tapping classification. A t-test confirmed (p < 0.001) that the mean power of the first 50 Hz of the spectrum was significantly different between the on tendon and off tendon conditions. There was a significant difference (p < 0.01) in the mean power from 50 to 400 Hz, but not from 100 to 400 Hz (p > 0.05). For the statistical tests, power in the respective bandwidths was computed for each tap, then the groups of 100 were tested against the null hypothesis that there was not a difference in the population means. The results of a \u03c7 2 test for the full frequency range are shown in the Supplementary Material. Although the reported results pertain only to the Achilles tendon, it is expected that other tendons produce similar acceleration profiles and frequency spectra.",

The ideal tool for communicating with the wireless IMU is a mobile application, as this is easily distributed, and does not require hardware beyond common mobile devices.

The SVM classifier is shown to be capable of detecting tapping location on the Achilles tendon with 91.5% accuracy from streamed acceleration measurements enabling instant feedback to novices attempting to elicit reflex responses. With the developed application, remote users know when they have hit the tendon correctly, and can then grade the response. Although novice performance is not perfect, the results indicate grading errors after a number of trials are relatively rare. Most importantly, out of a total of 175 novice graded reflexes, only a single response was more than 1 point away from the ground truth. The significant difference between errors in the 0 and 1 groups and the 2 and 3 groups indicates that areflexia or below normal reflexes are easier for novices to catch than the normal range. Although a larger sample size is needed, it is important to consider the range of conditions that can cause reflex responses to be on the lower end of the scale. Only a single reflex, the bicep tendon reflex, was evaluated, however it is expected that the novice performance in grading other reflexes would be similar.",
