While very valuable for long-term 'what-if' scenario generation, mechanistic approaches have several challenges in real-time forecasting of an emerging pandemic. The first drawback is that it the complexity of the model rises with the number of data sources being used. Hence, to manage the complexity, most models often use only one or two data signals (such as weather) along with the observed disease incidence (Shaman, Goldstein, and Lipsitch 2010) . Hence it is not trivial to extend these models to include various other data signals (like social media data). On the other hand, statistical approaches are fairly new in this space. They exploit correlations between various data sources and the forecast targets to learn a functional dependence between the two and use the learnt function to make predictions (Yuan et al. 2013) . There are several challenges in designing statistical approaches as well as we discuss later (see Sec 4). Most of the existing statistical approaches for epidemic forecasting (usually developed for influenza forecasting, including work by the authors (Adhikari et al. 2019) ) cannot be readily adapted for COVID forecasting due to several issues such as lack of data and poor data quality. Indeed there is hardly (if any) work on describing a completely data-driven approach for real time forecasting. Our goals. In this paper, we describe our framework DEEP-COVID (see Fig.1 ), the first purely data-driven deep learning (DL) model for real time pandemic forecasting in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (Reich et al. 2020) 1 and the official ensemble. Our real-time forecasts are showcased in the hub, the CDC website (CDC 2020) and the popular FiveThirtyEight website (538 2020). By our work, we aim to address a gap in the literature pertaining to using purely data driven approaches for emerging pandemics, with the following goals: G1. Coping with heterogeneous, scarce and noisy data: A DL-based model can ingest many heterogeneous signals that are more sensitive to what is happening on the ground, without laborious feature engineering. To fully take advantage of this, our framework is designed with careful consideration of data and modeling challenges faced in robust real-time forecasting with principled uncertainty estimation. G2. Bring a complementary forecasting perspective: A good ensemble needs diverse perspectives (Reich et al. 2019; Ray et al. 2020) . The overwhelming majority of the teams in the ensemble perform mechanistic modeling. By being the first data-driven DL method in the ensemble, DEEPCOVID brings a unique perspective closer to the observed data signals with minimal assumptions. G3. Excellence in short-term forecasting: The utility of statistical models in short-term forecasting is wellknown (Holmdahl and Buckee 2020) , which are useful to plan intervention and allocate resources. We demonstrate DEEP-COVID excels in this task by comparing to a strong baseline. G4. Enable communication to domain-experts: This is to ensure our framework gives explanations for its forecasts, which are very important for communication and interpretation by both the public and decision makers.",

For the predictive module, we use deep learning because it is a flexible, scalable, and efficient technology, and an excellent choice to model non-linearities. As mentioned before, explainability is a challenge in data-driven models. However, we want to understand and connect forecasts with epidemiological reasons.

Data pre-processing for real-time COVID forecasting brings several challenges primarily due to a novel emerging scenario. C1. Data collection: Collecting data in such a chaotic scenario is challenging because it comes from multiple sources (often collected by volunteers), is in different formats, some even changing over time (e.g. reported deaths from JHU), and unexpected hiatus. C2. Selection of signals: We carefully select signals that describe the different facets of the disease spread. To enable epidemiological observations about our predictions, this selection has to be driven by appropriate rationale. C3. Temporal misalignment: Since the signals are collected from multiple sources, they often have temporal misalignment. Some signals presented 1-2 weeks of lag due to delays in reporting from hospitals, public records and government officials; others have different temporal resolutions (days vs weeks). C4. Spatial misalignment: Some records are reported at specific spatial granularity and their conversion to higher geographical levels is non-trivial. C5. Missing values: Most prominently, our forecasting target, i.e., incidence hospitalizations, has not been reported in 11 states (CA, DC, TX, IL, LA, PA, MI, MO, NC, NV, DE). Our approach. To address C1, we developed a data extraction program personalized for each data format to convert them all to a standard format. For C2, we extensively searched for meaningful signals from an epidemiological perspective. The outcome of our search is summarized in Table 1 for the signals consistently used in our predictions. We collected the signals for 52 geographical regions: US National, the 50 US states and Washington D.C. We address the data misalignment in C3 as follows. For the lags in reporting, we downshift the signals. Our idea is to align all the signals based on their latest records since it is safe to assume that the latest records are more indicative for future targets. To address weekly/daily inconsistency, signals require different treatment depending on their nature. For example, since weekly hospitalization rate and CLI% ER visits have been recorded as percentages, we choose to consider the same value for daily incidence because it is not meaningful to transform it. For C4, signal 13 in Table 1 is recorded only at county-level, while other signals (6 and 7) contain records at the HHS region-level 2 . To provide a state-wise forecast model, we transformed the signal record state-wise by aggregating and de-aggregating, respectively. For this, it is crucial to consider the population of such geographic regions. Last, it is important to address C5 in a meaningful way. For 11 states with missing values, we had related signals such as hospitalization and ICU patients. We inferred missing values by leveraging these signals and making reasonable assumptions (such as effect of people's recovery and death in one week).",

Some of the challenges we encountered in designing the prediction module are: C1. Data Sparsity: One of the major challenges in forecasting emerging disease, specially at an early stage is data sparsity. Extracting enough information from the few available data points to ensure generalizable forecasts is a challenging problem. C2. Robust point and probabilistic forecasting: Forecasting disease in real-time is already challenging, and the problem is even more difficult in presence of data issues mentioned above. Hence, the questions we tackle in designing our framework are (1) how do we principally translate data noise to forecast uncertainty?; and (2) how do we ensure that our approach is robust to the noise and other data issues such that ensures reliable point and probabilistic forecasts? C3. Temporal consistency between the forecasts: Due to data sparsity we cannot hope to train deep networks enforcing temporal consistency such as LSTM and GRU. So the question is, how to design a neural architecture, which has few enough parameters to train from sparse data while ensuring temporal consistency between the forecasts? Our approach. See Alg. 1. When we started to participate in the CDC task (April 2020), there was 1 month of meaningful (non-zero) data; so it was unclear how to effectively train a recurrent neural network. Hence we opted to use a feedforward network with autoregressive inputs to incorporate short-term dependencies in the time series. To fully address C1, we also need to avoid overfitting, for which we empirically evaluated several number of layers & sizes for them.",

Thus, for each future incidence target, we obtain one single prediction per bootstrap sample so that we obtain a set of M predictions representing uncertainty in data (lines 7-10 in Alg. 1). Robustness of our point and probabilistic predictions are closely related to optimization. Optimizing the parameters of a neural network with sparse, noisy and heterogeneous data is challenging. In fact, we found that our optimization sometimes fell into local optima that returned absurd predictions. Hence, to improve robustness, we used batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015) to alleviate initialization problems. Besides that, we run the same optimization for several times and select the one that leads to lowest loss in the (training) data.",

Note: Cumulative counts is non-decreasing. Adding this restriction to our optimization problem would make it even more prone to get stuck in local optima. Therefore, for predicting cumulative deaths, once we get incidence predictions, we convert them to cumulative ones by aggregating the point predictions.

Real-time insights: With our interface, a user can understand which signals are driving the predictive behavior (e.g. trends, slope). In addition, we can reason about what is happening with this group of signals. Important insights can be that an important group of signals is displaying erratic or unreliable behavior. If such signals are found, then we might choose not to include it in our model or we might want to see if there are any issues with the collection, cleaning or transformations (i.e. send them back to the data module). Retrospective insights: Our interface also enables analysis of signal strengths in past predictions. We can evaluate how we could have done in the past given that we had removed some signals (using the training data available in that week). Therefore, we can understand which signals have a positive contribution to our performance and which others have a negative contribution, which ultimately informs our data module.",

For predicting the uptrend in Fig. 2(b) , using our explainability module, we found that impact of line-list, mobility and exposure were statistically significant (with \u03b1 = 0.05) and removing them one at a time did not change the uptrend, which suggests that signals from different groups are being utilized to predict the uptrend.

First is the lack of standard data reporting, even among traditional sources (e.g. several states do not report new hospitalizations, or report deaths in different ways causing different lags). This means that while some artifacts can be handled statistically (lags), some mild assumptions are also needed to do meaningful predictions (like for hospitalizations) which are still useful. Second, due to the chaotic situation, a purely data driven model needs to be regularly (weekly) updated to reflect the changing dynamics and data quality, to ensure good performance. Third, explainability is very important, as it can serve as a sanity check based on domain knowledge and also highlight why we are making forecasts at different points of the pandemic e.g. we found that testing and mobility data signals were most important for predictive performance on average. Finally, we also found that data revisions are pervasive, and even the ground truth can be revised (see appendix), which implies measures of performance may be unreliable till data stabilizes. As future work we plan to extend this methodology to handle such revisions, and also work more robustly at smaller scales (e.g. county level). Table 1 ) . We also collected a daily change of visits from Apple (signal 22), which indicates the relative volume of direction requests in the geographic map compared to January 13 across different US states. Mobility signals implicitly show the impact of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and change of policies adopted by different states. ",

Instead, there are other signals such as the current records of hospitalizations and ICU patients. However, assuming current hospitalizations as target T2 would affect our forecast by over-estimating incidences. Hence, our goal was to find a way to estimate T2 from the current hospitalizations for these 11 states. We tried a compartmental model based on recovered cases and deaths to address our goal. However, we found this challenging to do with the available data because recovered cases are not only considering people that was hospitalized, and the number of deaths is being reported with a different delay than hospitalizations (because they come from different sources). Therefore, as we could not include recoveries nor deaths, we assumed that after a week only a fraction \u03b2 of the current hospitalizations at time t \u2212 7 would stay in the hospital.

Table 2 : Contribution of signals in 1-4 wk ahead forecasting performance (retrospective analysis) for US National and four states. We present the t-statistic to measure the contribution (higher t-stat, higher contribution). Green indicates positive contributions, red negative contributions, and black non-statistically significant contributions. For instance, we analyzed mobility in predictions for US National and California, two regions where mobility was found to have a positive contribution (see Table2) . We considered two periods: (1) May to June, when stay-at-home orders were lift in most states, businesses reopened, and mobility signals increased; (2) July to August, a period when most mobility signals have already stabilized. We noticed a high contribution of mobility during (1) in both US National and California, and low or non-existing in (2). This observation suggests that data driven model needs to be regularly updated to reflect the changing dynamics of the disease spread.",

When we average this error over several past observations, we get a time series over revision weeks, which allow us to see how many revision weeks in average it takes for a signal to stabilize. In Fig. 5 , we can notice that even our ground truth target, reported death incidences (JHU), exhibit this issue, which implies measures of performance may be unreliable till data stabilizes. .

Line list signals (DS1): These signals are derived from records that report who, when and where facets of an infected person; thus, they are directly related to the disease spread. This type includes number of persons infected, hospitalized, and recovered (or deceased). Others report visits of emergency room (ER) due to influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms and COVID-like illness (CLI). Signal 8 represents the difference between the observed deaths (overall, not only COVID-related) from the expected deaths in during specific time periods.2. Testing signals (DS2): These type of signals reflect social policy (local leader's efforts for escalating testing) and social behavior, e.g. people with fever caused by any other disease may request to be tested for COVID. Here, we have signals that report number of tests (total and negative), number of emergency facilities and health care providers reporting data in DS1. The latter two are measures of the perceived importance of the disease by health care providers, as it has been previously observed in influenza forecasting (Brooks et al. 2015) .",
