In such situation, predicting as accurately as possible the future dynamics of the virus is a challenging problem for scientists and decision-makers. In this paper, four phenomenological epidemic models as well as Suspected-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model are investigated for predicting the cumulative number of infected cases in Saudi Arabia in addition to the probable end-date of the outbreak. The prediction problem is formulated as an optimization framework and solved using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The Generalized Richards Model (GRM) has been found to be the best one in achieving two objectives: first, fitting the collected data (covering 223 days between March 2 nd and October 10, 2020) with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE = 3.2889%), the highest coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0.9953) and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE = 8827); and second, predicting a probable end date found to be around the end of December 2020 with a projected number of 378,299 at the end of the outbreak.",

Although 29,378,739 individuals have recovered/discharged, 8,688,838 are reported as still active cases [1] . Several actions have been implemented by different countries ranging from total lockdown to social distancing measures in order to contain the virus and limit its spread [2] . Moreover, economic activities and health systems around the globe have been extremely affected which made the world in front of an unprecedented difficult situation.",

            "text": "Large attention is being paid by scientists from different backgrounds since they are hardly working on COVID-19 various aspects including the virus dynamics modeling. Several researches have been published aiming to predict the number of infected cases, the number of deaths and more particularly a probable end date in different countries and sometimes in different cities (provinces) inside the same country. As examples, we can cite references [3] for Saudi Arabia, [4] for Kuwait and [5] for India. The reported results have shown varying degrees of accuracy and reliability due to several causes including the quality and quantity of available information about the virus [6] . Suspected-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model as well as its variants have been used to predict the virus dynamics [2, 4, 7] . Although these models are continuous-time and the data of reported cases are available in discrete-time frequency (daily), several studies have considered SIR based on discrete-time frameworks [8] [9] [10] . The effect of containment and control measures has been also considered by using appropriate values of the model parameters. Moreover, time-series models such as autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) [11] [12] and its variants in addition to different artificial intelligence (AI) based models are facing luck of sufficient information both quantitatively and qualitatively [5] [6] 10, 12] . The logistic growth model and many of its variants have been utilized for predicting COVID-19 future in different countries. For example, the study in [3] have developed simultaneously SIR and logistic growth models for the case study of Saudi Arabia using data between March 2 nd and May 15 th , 2020. Unfortunately, by checking back their forecasted cumulative infected numbers and projected end date, it has been found that their projections were inaccurate since they expected a number ranging between 69,000 and 79,000 at the end of June 2020 as probable end date (the real number was 190,823 in June 30, 2020) [13] . The case study of Kuwait using logistic regression models has been examined in [4] . The predicted and real total infected numbers are checked and found to be different at the projected end date (predicted: 4,100, real: 17,700) [14] . Five-parameter logistic growth model has been used for reconstructing COVID-19 data in USA [15] . Results showed a good fit and a relatively accurate estimation of new infected cases as for April 4 th , 2020 but unfortunately the developed model has failed in predicting the end date since the virus continues its increase till today (October 16, 2020). The case study of India has been also investigated using logistic growth model in [16] . The developed model has been found to over-estimate the total number of cumulative infected cases by May 22, 2020 (predicted: 1 million, reported: 124,000). The drawback of the logistic growth model is that it is suitable only for modeling early stages of epidemics [17] . Combined models have been also considered for predicting COVID-19 [18] [19] [20] . A combination of logistic model with machine learning [18] , ANFIS with virus optimization algorithm [19] and Gaussian mixture model are examples of such frameworks reported to be efficient. As a conclusion, it is clearly observed that most of the developed models succeeded in fitting the historical data but faced difficulties in predicting the number of infected cases in the coming future.",

Moreover, few studies that considered using Richards model combined with a global optimization swarm intelligence technique (the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)) for predicting COVID-19 dynamics are available. For this aim, this study will focus on implementing phenomenological models, namely, generalized growth model (GGM), generalized logistic model (GLM), classical logistic growing model (CLGM) and generalized Richards model (GRM) to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 dynamics in Saudi Arabia. SIR model will be also implemented on the same dataset for comparison purpose. The main motivations behind this choice are summarized as follows: (i) this class of models is known to be robust, (ii) they include few parameters to be calibrated optimally and (iii) COVID-19 (like any other epidemic) should pass through an exponential growing phase at the beginning, should reach a peak and should exhibit a flat and stable curve which is well-captured by both CLGM and GRM. In this study, the identification of the models' parameters is defined as a minimization problem. The quadratic error between the cumulative infected cases and the reported infected cases is minimized by respect to the model parameters. The identification problem is then solved using the global PSO technique. The uniqueness and the stability of the developed models will also be investigated.",

Moreover, this model allows predicting a probable end date (found to be around the end of 2020). The SIR model is ranked in the second place after the GRM in terms of performance metrics. Both GRM and SIR models were valid according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov K-S test indicating that they provide forecasted and real (reported) infections derived from similar empirical distribution functions [29] . Both models provide also almost similar values of the coefficient of determination R 2 (0.9953 for GRM and 0.9926 for SIR). This result can be attributed to the fact that logistic models are rigorously derived from the simple epidemiological SIR model as reported in [9, 30] . The third-ranked model is found to be the GLM. In fact, it provided a probable end date near from the one provided by the best model (the GRM) but the number of infected cases at the end of the pandemic is higher than the one provided by the GRM. The GLM model is found to be valid according to the K-S test. The fourth model is CLGM. In fact, it yielded a final capacity of the virus almost near of the one issued from the best model (GRM) but an end date around the end of August, 2020 which is not true according to the current COVID-19 statistics in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the K-S test was non valid for the CLGM model. It should be noted that, according to the curve in Figure 4 , the CLGM has a chance to meet the end of the virus capacity since the real curve is still under the curve provided by the CLGM. The last model is the GGM. This model is found to be good in fitting data for the early stage of the epidemic but it becomes inaccurate in the coming stages [31] . Conceptually, the GGM model cannot capture the probable end of the outbreak since its curve will continue growing with time. In Table 3 , the actual and forecasted (by the GRM) cumulative number of infected cases are provided for the validation phase. The differences are relatively small which confirms the good fit performance of the GRM when applied to a dataset not used during the training phase. In Table 4 , the number of cumulative infected cases provided by the GRM as well as real reported numbers are compared. A relative error around 4% is found to characterize the model. Note here that the considered five days were not included in the model training and validation phases.",

As depicted in Table 5 , the four runs' parameters are extremely different which reflects relatively high variability of the growth dynamics of the epidemic. The situation of transmissibility is found to be changing. This fact is also clear in Figure 1 where it is shown that the curve of new infections presented four local peaks. Obviously, the coefficient of determination R 2 increases when the length of the sample used for training the GRM increases. This confirms also that using more data for training may allow detecting different dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore being able to explain the effect of the virus containment measures [39] and the efficiency of the social behavior including isolation like in the case of Brazil [40] .",
