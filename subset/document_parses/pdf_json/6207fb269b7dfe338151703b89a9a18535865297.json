Per findings of two studies performed under the given economically intense conditions, it is evidenced that the right answer to survival rests upon: (a) the entrepreneurs' personality traits and skills that affect the market and entrepreneurial orientations of SMEs, (b) the adoption of such orientations that keep impacting the firms' performance, and finally (c) the implementation of strategy relevant to reaching higher quality standards for products and services, combined with tactics relevant to downsizing, marketing actions, extroversion, and financial management.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The recent Greek financial downturn is one of the most notorious cases of a devastating crisis that is comparable to the crisis the world is facing due to Covid-19.

The current Covid-19 pandemic has already created unfavorable economic, social, and financial conditions similar to the Greek crisis of the late 2000s. For example, US GDP has shrunk by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2020 (Davidson, 2020) , while the GDP in the Eurozone shrank by 3.8% in the same period (The Guardian, 2020) . In this study, we convey useful managerial insights from SMEs who navigated and survived the prolonged and deep Greek financial crisis and address several issues that remain under-investigated in the literature. More specifically, we 1) explore the impact of specific personality traits and skills (need for achievement, optimism, locus of control, risk taking, and negotiation skills) on the Market Orientation (MO) and Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) of SMEs in times of economic turbulence; 2) examine whether important strategic orientations (i.e., MO and EO) continue to impact SMEs performance in times of financial crisis; 3) investigate the reasons as well as the tactics that helped SMEs manage the financial storm and survive; 4) explore the aforementioned relationships by applying the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.021 Received 1 May 2020; Received in revised form 19 May 2020; Accepted 21 May 2020 novel and robust Bayesian SEM approach in industrial marketing management and contributing methodologically.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 480, "end": 496, "text": "(Davidson, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 563, "end": 583, "text": "(The Guardian, 2020)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Research has highlighted the important roles of MO and EO as well as their impact on firm performance even during periods of financial crisis (Beliaeva, Shirokova, Wales, & Gafforova, 2020; Petzold, Barbat, Pons, & Zins, 2019) . Consequently, in times of downturns, not only is it imperative to acknowledge which factors actually stimulate firm performance but it is also urgent to identify the factors that impact these strategic orientations, especially as SMEs struggle to survive. Being among the few relevant research attempts in the field, our work goes beyond traditional business or environmental factors and concentrates on the entrepreneurs and explores whether their personality traits and skills directly affect the small firm's MO and EO. It therefore aspires to turn the focus on the entrepreneur, the key player of SMEs. In fact, our research meets the call by Rauch and Frese (2007) to put the individual back in the entrepreneurial and business research in order to closely examine his/her impact upon entrepreneurial success. Also, strategy researchers (e.g., Abell, Felin, & Foss, 2008; Felin & Hesterly, 2007; Teece, 2007) have highlighted the critical role of individuals in creating and sustaining competitive advantages and we add to this stream of research by showing that the microfoundations of SME capabilities are bolstered by the abilities and traits of individual entrepreneurs that affect strategic orientations.

Researchers have tried to identify the factors that affect the implementation of MO, primarily focusing on environmental parameters (Grewal & Tansuhaj, 2001) . MO is considered an important strategic choice that has a positive effect on business performance (Kohli & Jaworski, 1990; Matsuno, Mentzer, & E. Kottika, et al. Industrial Marketing Management 88 (2020 ) 352-365 \u00d6zsomer, 2002 Narver & Slater, 1990) . Indeed, a number of metaanalysis papers has supported this view (Cano, Carrillat, & Jaramillo, 2004; Ellis, 2006; Kirca, Jayachandran, & Bearden, 2005) . Also, it is noted that such positive effects in terms of various performance measures (e.g., new product success, market sales, market growth, and profitability), have been evidenced within a B2B context (Autahene-Gima, 1995; Pelham, 1999; Pelham & Wilson, 1996) . In fact, given such an array of favorable outcomes, it is argued that a strong MO culture should be cultivated in the B2B milieu (Fr\u00f6s\u00e9n, Jaakkola, Churakova, & Tikkanen, 2016) . Finally, relevant to the present paper's research scope, there is strong evidence that MO exerts a significantly favorable influence on business performance even under a crisis regime. For instance, via its competitor and inter-functional components, MO positively relates to marketing innovation and as such to the development and sustainability of a competitive advantage that helps the firm's survival (Naidoo, 2010) . Or for example, in additional research, dependent upon a SME manager's perception of the crisis intensity, MO has been found to be significantly impactful on a firm's growth sales, market share, liquidity as well as overall performance (Petzold et al., 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 314, "end": 339, "text": "(Grewal & Tansuhaj, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 440, "end": 464, "text": "(Kohli & Jaworski, 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 465, "end": 544, "text": "Matsuno, Mentzer, & E.

Grounded in its core dimensions of innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk taking, EO has been evidenced to entail a positive impact on firm performance (Covin & Slevin, 1991; Keh, Nguyen, & Ng, 2007; Matsuno et al., 2002; Rauch & Frese, 2008; Smart & Conant, 1994) . In fact, it is noted that such a positive impact in terms of various performance measures (e.g., sales growth, customer acquisition, success in competition, loyalty, and profitability) has been evidenced within a B2B frame (Chang, Wang, & Arnett, 2018; Chen, Li, & Evans, 2012; Hughes & Morgan, 2007; Reijonen, Hirvonen, Nagy, Laukkanen, & Gabrielsson, 2015) . Finally, as with MO and relevant to the scope of the current study, EO exerts a strong influence on business performance in crisis circumstances. In particular, according to the findings, EO components such as those of innovativeness and proactiveness help in securing the firm's profitability while attenuating the negative impact of the crisis upon the firm's operations (Soininen, Puumalainen, Sj\u00f6gr\u00e9n, & Syrj\u00e4, 2012) . Or for example, by considering the financial capital availability that a firm should have under a crisis regime, EO is shown to bear a positive impact on a firm's relevant indicators such as those of sales revenue and profitability among others (Beliaeva et al., 2020) . In all cases, like with MO, EO helps in orchestrating relevant firm capabilities.

The study reminds us that there are alternative methods for survival than focusing on financial stamina or competitive positioning of the firm which rely more on knowing what the unique advantages of the individual are. Thus, managers should keep in mind how they directly impact on important aspects of the SME strategy such as entrepreneurial and market orientations which, in turn, affect the business performance. In uncontrollable situations like the Greek financial crisis or the present Covid-19 situation that seems to be leading many B2B companies into a global recession, an increased self-awareness may direct the manager's attention towards aspects that to some extent can be controlled.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 280, "end": 345, "text": "Kottika, et al.
