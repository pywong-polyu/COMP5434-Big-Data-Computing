We assume that the organization consists of several types of professionals (researchers, engineers, testers etc.) and each project team must include at least one professional of each type. We study a dynamic simulation model, which defines a team creation process, based on the social graph of the organization. The greatest lower bound of the average utilization rate is found under (is based on) the assumption that each node in the social graph has a degree of at least \u03b4. This theoretical result is supported by a series of computer simulations.",

We use a simulation modeling approach to study the process of information distribution and team forming in response to that new opportunity.

For example, assume n 1 = n 2 = 15 and \u03b4 = 3, this has a balanced group of 30 workers in which everyone is linked to at least three potential collaborators. According to the reason above it may happen that only 6 teams are formed and the remaining 18 members are forced to be idle. The group utilization rate for this example is \u03c1 = 40%, which is far from intuitively expected \u03c1 = 100%, which is potentially reachable when the social graph is more dense.",

Then, each vertex a \u2208 A is connected to \u03b4 different vertices from B with equal probability, and vice versa. Each vertex b \u2208 B is connected to \u03b4 different vertices from A with equal probability. It may happen that some edges are created twice, so we remove the duplicates. Such a procedure guarantees that every researcher is connected with no less than \u03b4 engineers, and every engineer is connected with no less than \u03b4 researchers. As a result we have a random bipartite graph",

            "text": "As a result, we found the following.1. Typically, random simulation results are far better than the worst possible bound established, according to our theorem. For \u03b4 = 1, the average value of utilization rate \u03c1(n, \u03b4) is around 80%, while the theoretical minimum is below 10% for n > 20, see blue and dashed graphs on Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 . 2. Average \u03c1(n, \u03b4) increases with \u03b4, which complies with the intuition that adding more connections increases utilization, see Fig. 3 . The graphs show that for \u03b4 = 3 (each employee knows at least three colleagues from the other category), the average utilization is almost certainly greater than 80%. 3. For a fixed \u03b4 \u2208 {3, 4, 5, 6} average the utilization \u03c1(n, \u03b4) is rather stable and does not depend on n, see Fig. 4 . 4. At \u03b4 \u2265 3, the average value is about 90%, and with the increase of \u03b4, does not grow significantly. Therefore, for a high probability of getting on a team, it is enough for an engineer or researcher to have three contacts. This means a simple practical recommendation: build a team so that each specialist has at least three contacts with specialists with other skills.",

We generalized our previous results [8] for the greatest lower bound of the utilization rate. Simulation analysis gave us some ideas and possible directions for future research. In particular, we plan to consider different distributions of node degrees for this graph generation algorithm. Besides, it is interesting to study the generalization of this model with a larger number of skills and the evolving topology of social graphs.",
