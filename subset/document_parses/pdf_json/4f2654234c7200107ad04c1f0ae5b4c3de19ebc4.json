It is shown that the basic reproduction number R 0 does not act as a threshold value for the disease spread anymore, and there exists a sub-threshold value R * (< 1) such that: (i) if R 0 < R * , then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; (ii) if R 0 = R * , then there is a unique endemic equilibrium which is a nilpotent cusp of codimension at most three; (iii) if R * < R 0 < 1 , then there are two endemic equilibria, one is a weak focus of multiplicity at least three, the other is a saddle; (iv) if R 0 \u2265 1 , then there is again a unique endemic equilibrium which is a weak focus of multiplicity at least three. As parameters vary, the model undergoes saddle-node bifurcation, backward bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension three, Hopf bifurcation, and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension three. Moreover, it is shown that there exists a critical value 0 for the psychological effect , a critical value k 0 for the infection rate k, and two critical values 0 , 1 ( 1 < 0 ) for that will determine whether the disease dies out or persists in the form of positive periodic coexistent oscillations or coexistent steady states under different initial populations. Numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the existence of one, two or three limit cycles.

            "text": "Consider an infectious disease being transmitted person to person by direct or indirect contact in a population. The host population is divided into three classes S(t), I(t) and R(t), where S(t) denotes the number of individuals who are susceptible to the disease, that is, who are not yet infected at time t, I(t) denotes the number of infectious individuals at time t who have been infected and are able to spread the disease by contact with susceptible individuals, R(t) denotes the number of individuals who have been recovered from the infection and removed from the possibility of being infected again or of spreading at time t. Bifurcations in susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIRS) epidemic models with various incidence rates have been studied by many researchers, see for example, Alexander and Moghadas [1, 2] , Capasso and Serio [4] , Derrick and van den Driessche [7] , Hethcote and van den Driessche [11] , Hu et al.

In this paper we consider the following SIRS model with a generalized nonmonotone incidence rate: under the initial conditions S(0) \u2265 0 , I(0) \u2265 0 , R(0) \u2265 0 , where S(t), I(t) and R(t) denote the numbers of susceptible, infective, and recovered individuals at time t, respectively, b > 0 is the recruitment rate of the population, d > 0 is the natural death rate of the population, > 0 is the natural recovery rate of the infected individuals, > 0 is the rate at which recovered individuals lose immunity and return to the susceptible class. In the incidence rate function kIS 1+ I+ I 2 , k > 0 is the infection rate and kI measures the infection force of disease, 1 1+ I+ I 2 describes the inhibit effect from the behavioral change of the susceptible individuals when the number of infectious individuals increases, > 0 is a parameter which measures the psychological or inhibitory effect, and is a parameter satisfying > \u22122 \u221a such that 1 + I + I 2 > 0 for all I \u2265 0.",

[3] and Capasso and Serio [4] proposed a nonlinear incidence rate function taking psychological effects into account, which exhibits patterns showing in Fig. 1b , where the infection rate increases firstly and then decreases as the number of infected individuals increases. In fact, when a new infectious disease emerges, both the contact rate and the infection probability increase since people have very little knowledge about the disease. However, when number of infected individuals is getting larger and the disease becomes more serious, psychological factor leads people to modify their behavior and implement measures to reduce the opportunities of contact and the probability of infection. For instance, after the outbreaks of the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to avian influenza in the general populations, cross-sectional surveys conducted in Thailand and China show a high degree of awareness of human avian influenza in both urban and rural populations and a higher level of proper hygienic practice among urban residents by reducing their visits to live markets [19] . Also, during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , the aggressive measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, and isolation, were proved to",

By considering general parameter conditions, not specific parameter values as chosen in Zhou et al. [30] , we show that the basic reproduction number R 0 in model (1.1) does not act as a threshold value for the disease spread anymore, and there exists a sub-threshold value R * (< 1) such that: (i) if R 0 < R * , then the disease-free (a) (b) Fig. 1 a The graph of the nonmonotone infection force g 1 (I) = kI 1+ I 2 ; b the graphs of the generalized nonmonotone infection force g 2 (I) = kI 1+ I+ I 2 when = 3 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , k = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; (ii) if R 0 = R * , then there is a unique endemic equilibrium which is a nilpotent cusp of codimension at most three; (iii) if R * < R 0 < 1 , then there are two endemic equilibria, one is a weak focus of multiplicity at least three, the other is a saddle; (iv) if R 0 \u2265 1 , then there is again a unique endemic equilibrium which a weak focus of multiplicity at least three. In case (iv), sufficient conditions to guarantee the globally asymptotically stability or the uniqueness of a limit cycle for the model are given. As the parameters vary, the model undergoes a sequence of bifurcations including saddle-node bifurcation, backward bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension three, Hopf bifurcation, and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension three. Moreover, it is shown that there exists a critical value 0 for the psychological effect , a critical value k 0 for the infection rate k, and two critical values 0 , 1 ( 1 < 0 ) for that will determine whether the disease dies out or persists in the form of positive periodic coexistent oscillations or coexistent steady states under different initial populations. More specifically, it is shown that: (i) when > 0 , or \u2264 0 , k < k 0 and \u2265 0 , or k = k 0 and \u2265 0 , the disease will die out for all positive initial populations; (ii) when = 0 and 1 \u2264 < 0 , the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations; (iii) when = 0 and < 1 , the disease will persist in the form of a positive coexistent steady state for some positive initial populations; and (iv) when < 0 , k < k 0 and < 0 , or k = k 0 and < 0 , or k > k 0 , the disease will persist in the form of multiple positive periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states for some positive initial populations. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results, including the existence of one, two or three limit cycles, bifurcation diagrams and corresponding phase portraits.",

The existence of two limit cycles arising from the Hopf bifurcation of codimension two around \u1ebc (1, 1) in system (4.21) is given in Fig. 8 , which corresponds to the Hopf bifurcation of codimension two around E 3 (x 3 , y 3 ) for R * < R 0 < 1 in system (2.2).
