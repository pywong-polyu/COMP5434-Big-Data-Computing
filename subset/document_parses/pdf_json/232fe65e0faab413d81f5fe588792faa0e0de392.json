            "text": "The sector of fruit and vegetables is of absolute importance in Europe, where, with only 3% of the area under cultivation, it produces almost 21% of the value of total agricultural production in the European Union. Leading countries in this sector are Spain and Italy, which produce more than 45% of the European fresh fruit and vegetables [1] . Nevertheless, even though the daily consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables per capita in Europe increased by 4% in 2018, compared to 2017 levels (www.freshfel.org, accessed on 12 June 2021), it is still below the minimum daily consumption of 400 g recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). This behavior may be justified by the lack of correspondence between the quality desired by the consumer and the one that is actually perceived by the latter, by the price target, and, above all, by the reduced convenience associated with the consumption of fresh fruit, especially in industrialized countries where prepared foods are increasingly used [2] . It is precisely because of this evidence that the fruit and vegetable industry is progressively moving towards fresh-cut or ready-to-eat products. The IV range fruit and vegetable sector in Italy has a turnover of about EUR 750 million, involving about 200 processing companies and more than 2000 farms, with a growth rate of 5.9% in 2018. About 19.4 million consumers buy these products regularly, and they are also willing to spend more in order to have quality service and safer products. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer interest in those products that support the overall maintenance of health and wellness has increased, driving consumption toward safer and healthier foods. However, a higher service content corresponds to a greater perishability compared to the initial product: the damage caused during cutting operations produces a series of alterations (i.e., oxidative browning, loss of consistency and increased susceptibility to microorganisms, reduced nutritional value) that lead to a reduction in the useful life of the product, and that make it necessary to implement additional technologies aimed at obtaining a shelf-life compatible with commercial distribution [3] . In addition, COVID-19-induced supply chain disruptions have reinvigorated the drive for shelf lifeenhancing food packaging (www.freshfel.org, accessed on 12 June 2021). Several strategies are available to maintain the quality of IV range products: low temperatures (0-4 \u2022 C), heat (either used dry, between 35 and 40 \u2022 C, or in the form of brief immersion in hot water, up to 50-53 \u2022 C), and the use of modified atmospheres are among the most widely adopted physical systems (often in synergy), while chemical systems involve the inhibition of enzymes responsible for browning (polyphenol oxidase, PPO) or the removal or replacement of the substrates on which these enzymes act. However, in recent years, international research has been exploring innovative and sustainable technological solutions dedicated to the IV range sector [3] . Among these, an increasing number of scientific studies are focused on the formulation of edible coatings (ECs)-either simple or functionalized with natural compounds with high biological activity-designed to extend both the shelf life of fresh-cut products and their sensory and nutritional profile, which can even be enriched with these coatings, especially for the nutraceutical component [4, 5] . ECs are generally obtained from a triphasic mixture consisting of: (i) a high molecular weight biopolymer, necessary to form a continuous structural matrix with a good degree of cohesion; (ii) a plasticizer, which is essential to increase the flexibility and durability of the material; and (iii) a food grade solvent, which acts as a dispersing agent for the macromolecules. To realize the coating, a thin layer of edible material was coated directly on the food surface, applied in liquid form (film-forming solution/dispersion), usually by immersing (dipping) or spraying. Coating properties change depending on the material with which it is formulated. Each class of compounds has specific properties, advantages, and limitations. Generally, polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids are used as biopolymers in the formulation of an EC, used alone or in mixtures with each other [6] . Among these, polysaccharide-based ECs are the most studied [5, 7] , and alginate is one of the most evaluated for coating [8] .",

Among plant extracts, those from hop have recently gained great attention from the scientific community due to the presence of a plethora of bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, prenylflavonoids, bioactive pigments, and bitter acids [10] . The cultivation of hop, a dual-purpose cannabaceae, is continuously expanding worldwide, where 62,111 ha were cultivated in 2020, with an increase of 769 ha over 2019 (+1.2%) [11] . Even Italy in recent years has registered a growing interest from farmers towards the cultivation of this plant, driven by the sudden development of the craft beer sector. In 2020, the Italian surface invested in hops was equal to a little more than 52 ha, with a greater concentration of production areas in the northern regions [11] .",

            "text": "Hop cones contain several compounds that exert antimicrobial and antioxidant properties that have been exploited as preservative agents in the production of edible films [12, 13] or to reduce spoilage during cold storage of meat [14] . To the best of our knowledge, no application of hop extracts to extend the shelf life of fresh-cut fruit has yet been made. Besides, there are several literature studies about the evaluation of edible and functionalized coatings of different fruit species, including kiwifruit [15] . Kiwifruit cultivation is one of the most important fruit and vegetable sectors in Italy, being the European leader and the third largest producer in the world [16] . Kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) is highly appreciated by consumers due to its excellent nutraceutical profile, small caloric content, and high amount of vitamin C [17] . However, it is estimated that each year, due to size and appearance standards, about 15% of the crop is thrown away because the fruits are considered not suitable for direct consumption. In this context, the IV range processing of kiwifruit is an excellent solution to recover these by-products, which, due to inadequate shape or size, cannot be destined for the fresh fruit market. In this regard, Li et al. [18] demonstrated that the addition of polylysine (0.05%) to an alginate-based edible coating can preserve the pigments and morphological properties of fresh-cut kiwifruit, reducing microbial spoilage. Recently, sodium alginate (2% m/m) nanoemulsion coatings incorporated with ascorbic acid (0.5% m/m) and vanillin (from 0.5 to 1% m/m) showed the capacity to extend the shelf life of fresh-cut kiwifruit [19] .",

The spectrum was divided into five regions: aromatic, terpenes, sugars, aliphatic, and hop bitter acids. As for the latter, signals related to two alpha acids, cohumulone and humulone, were distinguished ( Figure 1B) . The assignment was confirmed by acquiring the 1 H-13 C HSQC experiment in which the chemical shifts of -CH 2 and -CH 3 groups of these two \u03b1-acids were measured. The contribution of each region, expressed as area percentage of the integrated NMR signals, is shown in Figure 2 . The bitter acid zone contributed 50% compared to all the other zones of the spectrum, thus demonstrating the abundance of these compounds in the extract. In particular, the ratio between cohumulone and humulone integrals indicated that the latter was present in the extract twice as much as the other \u03b1-acid. Figure 3 shows the weight loss (%) of fresh-cut kiwifruit subjected to different treatments during cold storage. For both untreated and treated samples, weight loss (%) increased almost linearly during storage time until reaching a maximum value at the end of the experimental trial. However, when evaluating the behavior of different ECs compared to the control, it can be observed that all treatments had a positive effect (p < 0.05) on weight loss, thus preserving water loss in the product. At the end of the trials (10d), CTRL samples showed the highest weight loss (2.5%; p < 0.05). In contrast, functionalized ECs showed the lowest mass loss (1.55 and 1.54% for ALG_HE_0.5 and ALG_HE_1, respectively; p < 0.05), indicating that not only the hydrocolloid but also the bioactive constituents play a role in preserving the samples from mass loss, in accordance with previous studies [28] .",

According to literature studies, TSS in fruits increases during storage while TA decreases [30] . Figure 4 shows the TSS content of samples analyzed during cold storage. The overall TSS of the analyzed samples increased gradually during storage to a different extent depending on the treatment applied (p < 0.05). The CTRL samples showed the highest TSS content (12.9 \u2022 Brix), reached after five days of cold storage, which remained constant until the end of the test. In contrast, no significant differences were found in kiwifruit slices coated with different HE-functionalized alginates up to the fifth day of storage (12.5 \u2022 Brix), when there was a slight but significant increase in TSS compared to previous values (p < 0.05), with no significant differences between the different concentrations of plant extract used (TSS at the end of storage: 12.65 \u2022 Brix for both ALG_HE_0.5 and ALG_HE_1 samples), according to literature data [19] . These features highlight the role of EC in reducing the rates of carbohydrate breakdown, delaying fruit ripening. As far as TA is concerned, no significant differences were observed between ALG_HE samples over the length of the cold storage, regardless of the concentration of the plant extract used (Table 2) . Besides, CTRL samples showed a decreasing trend in TA values, reaching the lowest value recorded during the test on the tenth day of cold storage (1.38 \u00b1 0.03% citric acid; p < 0.05). The pH significantly increased during storage for both untreated and alginate-coated samples (p < 0.05), although in the latter case there was a smaller increase. In contrast, no significant differences were found in the pH of samples coated with HE-functionalized alginate throughout the cold storage period, regardless of the concentration of plant extract used ( Table 2 ). These features highlight the effectiveness of EC in delaying fruit ripening by reducing acidity loss as a result of reduced respiratory metabolism during storage [30, 31] . Fruit color is an important index to evaluate the quality and ripening process during postharvest, but it is also an important extrinsic indicator in the consumers' perception of quality, making minimal color change desirable when applying a coating. In the present study, changes in flesh color of samples were monitored by measuring CIELAB coordinates L, a*, and b*.",

As for the coatings, all of the treatments tested were proven to be able to counteract the increase of the a* coordinate. However, ALG and ALG_HE_0.5 had a significant (p < 0.05) greener color and lower a* values compared to the other samples, highlighting the ability of these coatings to preserve samples from oxidative degradation. Interestingly, increasing the concentration of the plant extract did not produce a positive effect on the a* value, which was statistically similar to that of the control at the end of storage. A similar inverse dose response was also reported by Li et al. [18] , who treated fresh-cut kiwifruit with an alginate coating functionalized with increasing concentrations of poly-\u03b5-lysine. Figure 5c shows the effect of ECs on coordinate b* of the kiwifruit samples during cold storage.

In this study, the application of edible alginate coatings with the addition of HE at different concentrations was evaluated as a tool to delay quality and nutraceutical changes in fresh-cut kiwifruit. The results revealed the positive influence of adding hop cone extract to the alginate coating of freshly-cut kiwifruit on their physicochemical and nutraceutical traits during cold storage. The effect of HE was found mainly in its ability to retain the main classes of biologically active compounds (i.e., polyphenols, pigments), and especially in the retention of vitamin C compared to the control (preservation of more than 84% of kiwifruit initial AAC), the latter being one of the nutritional aspects of major importance in favor of a wider consumption of fresh kiwifruit. Among the hop concentrations tested, coatings containing 0.5% (v/v) HE demonstrated better pigments and vitamin C retention, nominating themselves as the best coatings among those tested. The presence of several bioactive compounds in HEs with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were able to preserve the freshness of the fruits, providing a valuable tool to prolong their shelf-life with respect to aspects related to the main quality attributes, nutraceutical parameters, and product appearance. However, the influence of coatings and plant extracts on the development of microbial load and on sensorial aspects related to taste and aroma still needs to be investigated in more detail.",

Further studies should also consider the exploitation of hop by-product to obtain these extracts, thus applying a circular economy approach. The industrial exploitation of the results obtained, which can also be validated on other fruits, could stimulate the consumption of fresh fruit with an optimal nutritional and antioxidant profile that would otherwise be lost, also in view of the fact that the sliced kiwifruit is one of the most used fruits in confectionery and food preparations (e.g., ready-made fruit salads). In addition, the production of ready-to-eat kiwifruit, capable of preserving high nutritional and nutraceutical characteristics over time, would be a valid alternative to exploit the benefits of less valuable fruits in terms of size and shape, which are currently considered wasteful and are poorly paid for, thus generating a positive economic impact on the entire production chain.",
