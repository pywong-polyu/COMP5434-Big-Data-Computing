            "text": "Purpose of Review To review the current state of knowledge on the newly proposed COVID Stress Syndrome. Recent Findings The syndrome consists of five inter-correlated elements: (a) fear of SARSCoV2 infection and fear of coming into contact with objects or surfaces contaminated with the coronavirus; (b) fear of socio-economic impacts of the pandemic; (c) fear of foreigners for fear that they are infected; (d) pandemic-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking; and (e) pandemic-related traumatic stress symptoms. A severe form of the syndrome, characterized by clinically significant distress and impairment in functioning, is the COVID Stress Disorder, which is regarded as a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. Several treatment options exist but further research is needed. Summary Research during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. The diagnosis of COVID Stress Syndrome should be made only after ruling out other disorders that could potentially account for the pattern of symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term course of the syndrome. Similar adjustment disorders may arise in future pandemics. Accordingly, understanding the COVID Stress Syndrome may facilitate efforts to understand and treat psychopathology in future pandemics.",

            "text": "It has long been observed that widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases such as pandemics lead to widespread outbreaks of fear [1\u2022] . Until quite recently, these fears were conceptualized narrowly as being something akin to simple mono-phobias. For example, during the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918, there were descriptions of \"flu-phobia\" [2] [3] [4] [5] . During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, when there had been only a single case of Ebola virus disease in the USA, researchers in the USA reported widespread \"fearbola\" [6] . In other infectious disease outbreaks, researchers documented fears of Zika virus disease, swine flu, and avian flu, all described as mono-phobias or highly specific forms of anxiety [1\u2022, 7, 8] . Similarly, during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers conceptualized and proposed to measure narrowly defined forms of coronavirus anxiety, called \"coronaphobia\" [9\u2022\u2022] .",

There were good reasons for questioning the monophobia assumption. Pre-COVID-19 research and case descriptions provided strong hints that pandemic fears might be part of a broader syndrome. Pre-COVID-19 studies showed, for example, that fears of infection were correlated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking, and research on previous outbreaks (e.g., SARS, Spanish flu) showed that fears could be associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms, particularly re-experiencing symptoms (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares) [1\u2022] .",

We sought to investigate whether was there a simple mono-phobia reaction, as had been assumed in previous research or was there a broader syndrome. To investigate this issue, we created the COVID Stress Scales [10\u2022\u2022] .",

Replicated factor analytic analyses, based on responses from samples totaling over 7000 people, showed that these six domains loaded on five factors, with the first and second domains (fear of infection and fear of fomites) loading on a common factor [10\u2022\u2022, 11] .",

The study on developing the COVID Stress Scales [10\u2022\u2022] was conceived in January and February, 2020, with data collection taking place during March and April, 2020. During that period, there was widespread media attention about COVID-19 in Canada and the USA, but relatively few cases of infection in those countries. Infection was largely restricted to China. Although it is possible that the time of data collection may have had some impact on the scores on the scales (e.g., the xenophobia scale), the patterns of correlates and factor restructure were replicated in studies in which data was collected at later times during the pandemic and in other countries [e.g., 11 ].",

Greater severity of scores was also correlated with a pre-existing (pre-COVID-19) diagnosis of a mental health disorder [12\u2022\u2022] , such as a pre-existing mood or anxiety disorder [13] . Greater scores were correlated with pre-existing health anxiety and greater perceived vulnerability to disease, but not with pre-existing general medical conditions [10\u2022\u2022, 12\u2022\u2022]. Higher scores were associated with greater pre-COVID-19 severity of various traits and symptoms, including disgust sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, obsessive-compulsive checking rituals, and obsessive-compulsive contamination concerns [12\u2022\u2022] . In summary, greater severity of the COVID Stress Syndrome was associated with premorbid psychopathology or vulnerability traits and with particular demographic features. The meaning of the demographic findings remains to be further investigated. It is likely that particular demographic groups were exposed to higher levels of particular stressors during the pandemic (e.g., financial stressors, racism), which likely increased the severity of COVID stress symptoms.",

In addition to investigating the COVID Stress Syndrome, we examined a second \"syndrome,\" defined as the COVID Disregard Syndrome. This was not a syndrome in the medical sense of the word, but rather a constellation of behaviors and attitudes that centered around the belief that the COVID-19 threat is exaggerated. The main results of the network analysis are summarized in Fig. 1 . The figure shows the links (regularized partial correlations) between nodes in the network (for all links, p < .003). The magnitude of the strength of connections among nodes is indicated by shorter, thicker lines, with positive associations in green and negative associations in red. As expected, the elements of the COVID Stress Syndrome (blue ellipses) were tightly linked together, as were the elements of the COVID Disregard Syndrome (yellow ellipses). The COVID Disregard Syndrome was negatively associated with hand and cough hygiene adherence and with the COVID Stress Syndrome. The COVID Stress Syndrome was associated with a range of pandemic-related phenomena, including avoidance of supermarkets and drug stores (for fear of infection), fear and avoidance of healthcare workers (also for fear of infection), use of personal protective equipment (masks, gloves, and visors), and panic buying and stockpiling of supplies in preparation for self-isolation. The COVID Stress Syndrome was also linked, to a lesser extent, with belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories (e.g., belief that the novel coronavirus was engineered as a bioweapon) and with COVID-19-related anti-vaccination attitudes (e.g., worry about unforeseen harmful effects of the vaccine). In summary, the result of the network analysis indicated that the COVID Stress Syndrome is linked to many different types of pandemicrelated phenomena, particularly those associated with fear, avoidance, and self-protective behaviors.",

This is not surprising given that many, if not most, forms of psychopathology are dimensional rather than categorical in nature [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .

A problem with this approach is that mean scores on the scales have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic; for example, rising and falling in response to the degree of threat (infection rate) occurs in the respondents' community [9\u2022\u2022]. It might not be possible to derive cut-off scores on the COVID Stress Scales in an absolute sense, but cut-offs can be derived based on how people in a given population respond at a given time (e.g., scores above the 90th percentile, assessed at a given time). Such an approach is justifiable if the COVID Stress Syndrome is conceptualized as an adjustment reaction (as discussed below), characterized by an excessive amount of distress in response to a given stressor. In other words, a COVID Stress Disorder could be diagnosed in people who have developed unusually intense distress, as compared to other people who have encountered the same stressor.",

Current approaches to diagnosing mental disorders, such as ICD-11 and DSM-5, require distress and/or impairment to diagnose mental disorders. A problem in diagnosing impairment during the COVID-19 pandemic is that a person might have impairment due to restrictions placed on his or her social and occupational functioning due to social distancing restrictions (e.g., lockdown, closure of places of work). Accordingly, in our research on the COVID Stress Disorder, we measured impairment as impairment in social or occupational functioning specifically due to one's distress about COVID-19; for example, being unable to fulfill one's occupational role due to severe COVID-19-related anxiety.",

However, the symptoms of the COVID Stress Disorder do not neatly fit into any one of these categories. COVID Stress Disorder is better conceptualized as a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. An adjustment disorder, as conceptualized in DSM-5 and ICD-11, is characterized by clinically significant (i.e., markedly distressing and/or impairing) emotional and behavioral symptoms arising in response to a life stressor that are not due to some other disorder and may be either acute or chronic. To illustrate, the ICD-11 definition of adjustment disorder captures, in a general sense, many of the features of the COVID Stress Disorder: Adjustment disorder is a maladaptive reaction to an identifiable psychosocial stressor or multiple stressors (e.g. divorce, illness or disability, socio-economic problems, conflicts at home or work) that usually emerges within a month of the stressor. The disorder is characterised by preoccupation with the stressor or its consequences, including excessive worry, recurrent and distressing thoughts about the stressor, or constant rumination about its implications, as well as by failure to adapt to the stressor that causes significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., Mood Disorder, another Disorder Specifically Associated with Stress) and typically resolve within 6 months, unless the stressor persists for a longer duration.

In such cases, patients could be advised to limit their exposure to disturbing media, that is, staying informed from reliable news services but not spending hours per day watching disturbing (and possibly exaggerated) social media or news media accounts of traumatic pandemic-related events. If this strategy is insufficient, then pharmacotherapy or cognitive-behavioral treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder could be considered. For example, trauma-related exposure therapy can be successfully implemented via telehealth by suitably trained clinicians [37, 38] .",

            "text": "Until very recently, pandemic-related fears were considered to be mono-phobias; that is, simple, excessive fear reactions. More recently, research shows that these fears are part of a broader syndrome, which can be conceptualized as a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. During COVID-19, research provides evidence of a COVID Stress Syndrome, which in its severe form is an adjustment disorder called the COVID Stress Disorder. In the months since the syndrome and disorder were recognized, a great deal of research has been conducted to further understand the nature and correlates of COVID-19-related distress. Future research is required to better understand the time course and optimal treatment of the syndrome and disorder. Adjustment disorders are not trivial conditions; they meet all the requirements of distress and impairment for mental disorders in general. A major assumption with adjustment disorders is that the psychopathology will abate in most cases once the stressor abates. With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was ongoing at the time this article was written, future research is needed to determine the extent to which the COVID Stress Syndrome (and Disorder) abate once the pandemic is over. Some cases may become chronic, although this remains to be investigated. But even if most cases abate once the pandemic is over, there is still a need to treat highly distressed people during the course of the pandemic. Research is also needed to evaluate the extent to which currently available mental health resources are beneficial in treating the COVID Stress Syndrome and Disorder. Further research is needed to firmly establish the boundaries of the syndrome (e.g., are there other core features that need to be included?) and to investigate whether the syndrome substantially varies across cultures and demographic groups. Additional measures also need to be developed and evaluated. Currently, the assessment of the COVID Stress Syndrome and Disorder is limited to self-report measures. Clinicianadministered interview methods could be developed to further evaluate the nature of COVID-19-related distress.",

Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term course of the syndrome. The COVID Stress Disorder is conceptualized as a pandemicrelated adjustment disorder. Similar adjustment disorders will likely arise in future pandemics. Accordingly, understanding the COVID Stress Syndrome and Disorder may facilitate efforts to understand and treat psychopathology in future pandemics.",
