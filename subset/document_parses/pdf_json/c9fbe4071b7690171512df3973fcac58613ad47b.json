Despite this, the numbers of children failing to complete school successfully remain stubbornly high at around 260 million globally. Marginal groupse.g. the poorest boys and girls, those with disability, some ethnic minorities, displaced childrenremain excluded and often benefit less from increases in access and progression than those enrolled in the core of national education systems. The World Bank recently declared a \"learning crisis\" based on data that shows very large numbers of young people failing to achieve minimum learning standards. This is despite the promises made thirty years ago at the World Declaration on Education for all to endorse the global Framework for Action: Meeting Basic Learning Needs (UNESCO, 1990) . The commitment to universal access and effective learning was subsequently reaffirmed at the World Education Forum in 2000 (UNESCO, 2000) . Since then progress in closing the educational gaps between Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and the rest of the world, and between countries in SSA, has been disappointingly slow 1 . This paper is in several parts. After this introduction the recent evolution of aid to education is described. Next a status report paints a picture of key aspects of the challenge of financing in SSA. The fourth section illuminates the basic arithmetic of educational financing in low and low middle income countries and includes estimates of shortfalls between current spending and what would be needed to meet targets set by the Sustainable Development Goals. The dilemmas this creates are the subject of section five. The rest of the paper looks forward with a special focus on needs for enhanced efficiency and effectiveness, and for fiscal reform to generate sustainable financing. The conclusions highlight how after five decades of development new approaches are needed which are designed to end dependence on aid and generate a political economy of education that depends on the development of fiscal states able to finance their own public goods.

The recently publicised \"learning crisis\" is partly a result of problems with aid effectiveness (World Bank, 2018) . Aid to education has not transformed efficiency and effectiveness over the last three decades in much of SSA. The World Bank itself noted that curriculum development to improve learning was central to strategies for development forty years ago (World Bank, 1980:35) . The newly defined learning crisis is unlikely to be resolved by more aid of the same kind as in the past. If the learning crisis is a result of chronic underfunding and inability to disseminate and diffuse the good practices that exist in all education systems to all schools and students then the resolution of the crisis lies inside education systems in LICs and LMICs and depends on endogenously addressing problems with efficiency and effectiveness. Development requires interventions that mobilise enhanced domestic financing. Aid that catalyses durable increases in efficiency and effectiveness has considerable utility. So does aid that nurtures fiscal reforms that are the only pathway to sustainable educational financing from domestic revenue. Filling financing gaps with aid and concessional loans in the short term is much less attractive than promoting system level transitions and fiscal reforms that make education affordable and subject to the normal political economy of national development investment decisions.

Any forward planning for achieving the SDGs related to education based on doubling or tripling the international resources available with new money, whether grant or concessional loans, has to explain where the financing would come from, how much it would cost, and how it would resolve problems of sustainable educational financing at levels sufficient to achieve the SDGs.

If GDP falls by 15 % or more as is predicted by the OECD then aid will contract even if it remains the same proportion of GDP.

External assistance has helped some countries in SSA transform their education systems. But in other countries, including many of the poorest, progress has been disappointing. It is generally thought good use was made of aid in Botswana in the 1960s and in Ghana in the late 1980s as both countries reconstructed and developed rapidly (Dollar and Pritchett, 1998:1) . Their education systems benefitted accordingly from large inflows of advice and finance.

Though these schools may be cost efficient they may have problems with the effective management of learning and with attrition. They may also have high costs to households as a result of large catchment areas. o Student teacher ratios in many SSA countries at secondary level average less than 20:1 but class sizes are often over 50. The teacher class ratio can be over 2.5:1. This is a large part of the reason why costs per student at secondary in much of SSA are typically three or more times those at primary level. No high enrolment country has such cost ratios. Fixing this could double access for little additional cost. o The costs to households of school attendance can be as much or more than the public costs. It increases steeply from primary to secondary school. If access is rationed by price it will be inequitable and socially inefficient. o Private schools can increase the amounts available to support public schooling if they reduce demand for places in public schools and the savings are translated into enhanced funding for mass school systems providing services to the less wealthy. However, schools financed from fees and charges will not be affordable to households at or near the poverty line and are unlikely to reach those in the third to fifth quintiles of household income without subsidy or very low teacher's salaries. o Subsidised boarding which is elective remains common in some SSA countries with high costs not necessarily justified by low population density and rurality. Cost should be borne by beneficiaries if boarding is elective. o Participation in higher education in SSA has doubled in the last decade and will probably do so again in the next decade. Public costs are high and have to be addressed if students from poor households are to participate. New pedagogies offer the promise of more efficient learning and teaching but remain exceptional rather than pervasive. o Higher education is regressively financed from general taxation. As many as 80 % of the students originate from less than 20 % of the secondary schools and most are from households in the top two quintiles of income. If no fees are charged richer households benefit disproportionately. If fees are charged they are likely to exclude those from poor households who survive to the end of secondary school. o Access to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) is limited and can be expensive; few STEM curricula and pedagogies are designed with a view to the costs or impact on the environment but they should be. A new wave of curriculum development is needed that takes full advantage of lower cost technologies of pedagogy and delivery that work effectively. o Much full time pre-career teacher education is inefficient. Many who are trained do not stay long in the profession especially at secondary level in shortage subjects. The \"half life\" of a trained teacherthe time it takes for half those who have been trained to leave the professioncan be as little as three years in STEM subjects. o The deregulation of teacher training has led to a surplus of teacher training output relative to available job in some countries with the burden of costs falling on individuals. Better methods are needed for managing supply and demand. o High stakes assessment leads to repetition and retakes, generates large additional costs e.g. for tuition, distorts learning and teaching, and has uncertain predictive validity. Managing learning with more use of formative assessment could increase achievement and reduce costs. o The sustainable development goals and commitments to slow climate change and diminish the rate of non-renewable resource depletion have yet to be translated into educational planning and development that minimises environmental impact in SSA. Poor school mapping and wide variations in quality are responsible for large amounts of transport related pollution and bronchial morbidity.
