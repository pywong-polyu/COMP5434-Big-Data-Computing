In response, schools have shifted into online learning in developed societies while the developing world struggles to opt for online learning due to limited infrastructure and capacity and religious beliefs, in some communities, that discourage online learning. However, there has been a significant increase in the use of Social Media (SM) observed across developing and developed societies and religious communities amid physical distancing. This study was conducted to explore the possibility of SM use in online learning by exploring teachers' attitudes in relation to the effects of physical distancing and increased SM use, SM knowledge and religious leaders' SM use. In a quantitative investigation method, the researchers used a questionnaire as a primary tool to collect the data from 252 teachers of both public and private schools. Partial Least Square Structural Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used as an analysis method to assess and measure the proposed model. The findings are significant to inform how physical distancing amid the pandemic has influenced teachers' attitudes to opt for social media use in online learning. The findings have implications for teachers worldwide, particularly in developing countries, to switch to online learning using SM under challenging situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "There has been frequent use of social media (SM) observed globally during the Covid-19 pandemic (Cinelli et al., 2020; Haman, 2020; Hussain, 2020; Limaye et al., 2020) . SM's effectiveness in natural calamities such as earthquakes, tsunami, floods, or any other human-made disasters like wars or riots is well known (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2016; Rosenberg et al., 2018; Saroj and Pal, 2020) . During such situations, according to Dufty (2012) , people have used smartphones, tablets, and other devices, to reach SM for real-time information and social exchange. Likewise, SM has remained integral to access to information and social interaction during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the more critical is knowing its use in online learning to cater to students' learning needs during school closure amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Research finds the use of SM effective to support active students' engagement, teachers' professional development and developing communities of learners (Anasi, 2018; Beemt et al., 2019; Buus, 2012; Harris and Rea, 2009; Ranieri, 2013, 2016; Vie, 2015) . Porto et al. (2011) also believe that SM's instructional use promotes teachers' ICT integration skills and inspires and encourages their students to continue learning using technologies. Its use in online learning may bring in a large proportion of 70% student population, which, according to UNESCO (2020) , are affected due to school closure amid the pandemic. Countries with nationwide closures have left 91.3% of their students out of learnings, as UNESCO reports. The absence of online learning may worsen the situations globally, particularly in countries like Pakistan, which according to Abbas (2020) , already suffers from 22.8 million out of school children in the age group of 5-16.",

However, SM use has not been well established despite its electronic communication and learning capability, as argued by Ige (2020) . Schools in developing countries, like Pakistan, have been struggling to switch to online learning due to their incapability and non-supportive infrastructures such as ICT resources, internet connectivity and teachers' incapacity (Adeogun, 2003; Adnan and Anwar, 2020; Ismail et al., 2020) . Certain religious and cultural beliefs are also perceived to support or hinder social media use in online learning. Almenayes (2014) also finds more religious individuals less likely to substitute online interaction for face-to-face interaction. The reasons consisted of fear of unfiltered expression and the interpretation of being immoral, and fear of reprisal for religious expression from the nonreligious in that space (Woodward and Kimmons (2018) .",

Social media has been interchangeably used with social networking, social computing, Web 2.0, and virtual social universes in terms of terminology. SM are collaborative online applications and technologies, enabling user-generated participation, connectivity, information exchange, and collaboration among the user community (Henderson and Bowley 2010: p. 239 ).

They need to be continuously learning to be able to use SM in online learning effectively.

Hood (2017) believes that teachers' engagement is defined mainly by the knowledge they require and the practices they need. However, according to Moran et al. (2011) , teachers' lack of SM related knowledge has demotivated them to use SM in online learning. The current spike of SM use during the pandemic, as observed by Limaye et al. (2020) , is considered to have increased teachers' knowledge of SM use in online learning as they are assumed to have regular interactions with SM. The researchers considered it worthy of knowing if teachers' regular use of social media during the pandemic influences their knowledge and, consequently, impacts their attitudes toward its use in online learning. The same has been hypothesized as below:",

As Wang (2010) inform, the bordering areas along Pak-Afghan borders were under the deep influence of Talibanization. Such interpretation, consequently, discouraged the use of sources involving any technological tools such as videos, animations and even pictures in teaching and learning.

In Bari (2014) words, there is a realization of the importance of electronic media, and social media cannot remain excluded by the conservative sects to shape public opinion as desired. Most importantly, the use of SM platforms like Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, and others, from religious sects for their religious campaign and teachings has been very apparent (Ibahrine, 2020) . Besides, as Brubaker and Haighm (2017) posits, SM users have been found to obtain spiritual and temporal benefits from faith-based content shared by others. Research, for example, Weaver and Stansbury (2014) and Al-Mosa (2015) though informs about religion to influence one's attitude and social values, however, it has not explored an indirect influence, such as the use of SM by religious scholars, and its influence on teachers' attitudes of opting it in online learning. The same in times of disasters and pandemic is rare. Since it is assumed that these scholars' interpretation has a more substantial influence on the masses, it would be worth considering whether the same has influenced teachers' attitudes toward MS use in online learning amid the pandemic. In this regard, the following hypotheses have been formulated and tested:",

Section one had the questions regarding teachers' demographics, such as age groups, gender, and the SM platforms they used (shown in Table 1 ). Section two recorded teachers' responses to know their attitudes towards SM use in online learning. The section included teachers' responses about physical distancing, SM use during the physical distancing, their knowledge of SM use in online learning and SM use by religious scholars. Physical distancing was measured by asking questions (PD1-PD4) regarding participants staying at home, avoiding public gathering and maintaining, and following physical distancing with others. SMD1-SMD4 aimed to know teachers' SM use during the physical distancing. Teachers' knowledge of SM use (SMK1-SMK-8) encompassed asking about SM integration capabilities as a pedagogical tool for online teaching. Their attitudes were measured through items (AT1-AT10). SMR1-SMR3 included asking about teachers' response about SM use by religious scholars. Section two used five Likert scales from (1) \"Strongly agree\" to (5) \"Strongly disagree\".",

The study finds no effect of SMR on teachers' attitudes of SM use in online learning; however, it positively impacts teachers' SM use amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The results indicated a significant impact of physical distancing (PD) amid the COVID-19 pandemic on teachers' use of SMD (H1), which means that the respondents were using SM more during the physical distancing. These results support Koeze and Popper (2020) and Limaye et al. (2020) , who have reported increased SM use amid the pandemic or crises. More importantly, teachers' use of SM during the pandemic was found associated with an increase in their knowledge of SM use (H3) and influencing their attitudes of SM use in online learning (H2, H4). It means that the more the teachers interact with SM, the more they learn about it, and they remain optimistic about its use for online learning. Teachers' frequent, meaningful engagement with social media may transform their knowledge with time and informing their attitudes. There appears to be frequent interaction of teachers with SM during the pandemic than before, which schools can build upon by encouraging SM's instructional use.",

It is quite evident through a significant relationship between teachers' SM knowledge and their attitudes towards SM use in online learning (H4). It could be rightly suggested that teachers must capitalize upon their knowledge about social media use in instructions to further transform their attitude to practical involvement in online learning by SM use Beemt et al. (2019) ; Buus (2012) . Schools, therefore, if expect active involvement of teachers in using SM for online learning, have to focus on how SM in the meantime could be used for teachers' knowledge through developing networks and collaboration with their peers. The results also support Wenger et al. (2011) , who found a close relationship between SM use for knowledge sharing and learning. These findings are significant for teachers' learning through knowledge sharing in an online community to form the community of learners (Harris and Rea, 2009) . The same could be further strengthened by providing more school-level support, as suggested by Ismail et al. (2020) , in helping teachers improve SM use by aligning it with students learning needs. School's role in supporting teachers' SM use could help strengthen teachers' online collaboration more specific and relevant to their own capacity needs. The analysis is in line with what Anasi (2018) suggests that SM has the potential for teachers' professional growth and development. In particular, teachers in developing countries like Pakistan with minimal ICT integration capacity, found by Ismail et al. (2020) , could be supported to overcome their fear and digital anxiety (Beemt et al., 2019; Kormos and Nijakowsk, 2017) . Subsequently, enhancing teachers' knowledge and skills of using digital tools and social media platforms, as Hoyos (2014) argue, will need them to understand their new roles in online learning and facilitate students in their learning despite the school closure.",

However, it is important to note that teachers' need to use it for pedagogical interaction rather than what Woodward and Kimmons (2018) considers as a monologic broadcast that is more one way and less interactive for learning.

As an online learning tool, social media has implications for schools having students left out from learning because of the pandemic. The implications are profound for countries like Pakistan, already struggling with an alarming number of out of school children and many more deprived of learning due to schools' closure. However, to meet SM use in online learning, teachers' knowledge of and frequent engagement with the SM platforms remains pivotal. Social media's significant effects on teachers' knowledge and attitudes call for supporting and encouraging teachers to use SM in their working environment. School-level support from headteachers in this regard could be of worth (Ismail et al., 2020) . Such support will be needed to provide access to necessary digital resources, creating opportunities for teachers' capacity building, continuous feedback, and mentoring (Jogezai et al., 2018; Mulenga and Marb an, 2020) .",

Online learning as an alternative to conventional face to face learning has severe implications for schools and the overall learning environment. However, the same may have implications for schools to investigate how they can accommodate both face to face and online learning modes concurrently applicable. The same will need schools to focus on teachers' capacity building and resource allocation and provision.",

This study remains limited in this regard, and future research needs to consider this very aspect. The study is also limited to the country's urban setting because internet connectivity is mostly available to populate urban areas (Kandilov and Renkow, 2010) . Therefore, the findings may not be generalized to the other parts. Further research considering the difference in terms of the urban and rural divide could be of interest. Research in other developing countries would be a significant contribution to validate the findings of the study.",

In addition, the increased SM use also had a measurable effect on their knowledge of SM, which consequently influenced their attitude toward its use in online learning. The influence of religious beliefs, reflected in the use of SM by religious scholars, deems supportive in the integration of SM as an instructional tool. The findings make it clear that there is a possibility of using SM in online learning amid schools' closure during a crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The use of social media could also be beneficial for countries that, according to Attwood et al. (2013) , are resource-poor and deprived of adequate ICT-supported facilities. Likewise, in countries like Pakistan, where schools, according to Ismail et al. (2020) and Jogezai et al. (2018) , exist with insufficient ICT infrastructure and incapable teachers, SM is phenomenal for online learning. It becomes imperative to positively shape teachers' attitudes of SM use in online learning into practical application through supportive policies to overcome students' deprivation from learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic and similar future crises.",
