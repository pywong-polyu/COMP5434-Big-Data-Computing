All PLHIV in T&T benefit from a national policy of subsidized HIV care and treatment, \"treat all\" was instituted in 2017 whereby all PLHIV are offered antiretroviral therapy (ART) regardless of CD4 count [8] and this has contributed in part to the number of incident cases of HIV in T&T in 2020 being less than 200.",

A cross-sectional study which used a convenience sample was conducted over the period September 2020 -June 2021, where all MSM 18 years and over attending the clinic received information about the study protocol and procedures and were asked to participate in the study after written informed consent. To protect patient confidentiality, each study participant was allocated a unique identifying number and a structured questionnaire was administered that collected socio-demographic information, alcohol and drug use, history of STIs, access to health care and sexual behaviours. A chart review was conducted to obtain data on the syphilis serology and HIV viral loads in the study patients.

These findings are similar to a retrospective analysis in MSM living with HIV conducted at the MRFTT in 2019 which found a high prevalence of syphilis of 41.3% [11] and patients with a previous history of treated syphilis were ten times more likely to be diagnosed with syphilis [11] . Similar results were demonstrated by Roth et al in a study of a Swiss cohort of MSM living with HIV where repeat episodes of syphilis were reported [15] and this was attributed to high risk sexual behavior and the high background rate of syphilis in MSM populations [15] . Thus, in MSM living with HIV in Trinidad, repeat episodes of syphilis may to play a role in the transmission dynamics of Treponema pallidum infection in this group of patients who may be core transmitters of syphilis [16] . In our study, most of the syphilis infections were asymptomatic (89.2%). This was also reported in the retrospective study of MSM attending the HIV Clinic in Trinidad in 2019 with 71.1% of these infections being asymptomatic [11] and by Branger et al [17] in an outpatient clinic in Amsterdam where routine syphilis screening conducted on 1,105 HIV infected patients identified 81 cases with syphilis, all among males of whom 94% were MSM with 33% of the infections being asymptomatic. A few studies have suggested that persons with past episodes of syphilis were more likely to be asymptomatic on repeat episodes [18, 19] possibly due to the acquired immune response resulting from past infection which may attenuate the clinical manifestations of reinfection with T. pallidum [19] . In our study, some of the MSM stated that since they were HIV infected, oral sex was used as a \"safer sexual method\" to reduce transmission of HIV, however studies have shown that there was a strong association between syphilis infection and unprotected oral sex [20, 21] .",

These findings are not consistent with data from most other studies which showed that MSM adopt safer sexual practices following disclosure [23] [24] [25] [26] . Disclosure of HIV status to their sexual partners by MSM may improve their psychological well-being as this may result in improved emotional support which may be associated with reduced anxiety and depression [27] , on the other hand disclosure of their HIV status may result in rejection by the sexual partner, stigma and isolation [27] .

Activities in the pilot intervention included six monthly screening and treatment of STIs, partner notification and treatment strategies, education on safe sex practices and risk reduction, adherence to ART and viral suppression, condom distribution and vaccination for HPV and hepatitis B. This pilot intervention, although only in place for a few months, may have contributed in part to the prevalence of syphilis among MSM living with HIV being reduced from 41.3% in 2019 to 28% in this study. However, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures may have decreased the opportunities for sexual activities in MSM and may have reduced the likelihood of access for diagnosis and treatment of syphilis and other STIs [3] . Missed opportunities with syphilis screening may have resulted in an underestimation in the numbers of MSM diagnosed with syphilis in this study.",

In addition, targeted prevention methods are important including behavioural risk reduction strategies, increased condom use, partner notification and treatment to interrupt the chain of transmission, substance abuse prevention programmes, pre-exposure vaccination (HPV and hepatitis B) and adherence to ART to maintain viral suppression and reduce the transmission of HIV.",

This was a cross-sectional study design with convenience sampling of self-identified MSM attending the HIV clinic so the results may not be generalizable to HIV infected population of MSM living in T&T. Limiting the study to MSM living with HIV may not be representative of the population of MSM (some of whom may be HIV uninfected) and may have biased the study results. During the COVID-19 lockdown measures, missed opportunities with syphilis screening may have resulted in an underestimation in the numbers of MSM diagnosed with syphilis in this study. Even though the self-administered questionnaire had no names or identifiers on it, some patients may not have felt comfortable disclosing their true sexual behaviours for fear of stigma or reproach by health care providers and this may result in bias and inaccuracy of data collected.",

The patients more likely to be diagnosed with syphilis were those who participated in sex with anonymous partners (OR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.03-4.26), those with a previous diagnosis of syphilis (OR 5.16 ; 95% CI, 1.03-25.83), those who used marijuana in the last 12 months (OR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14-3.96) and those who disclosed their HIV status to their sex partner (OR 2.23; 95% CI, 1.11-4.49). Repeat episodes of syphilis and sex with anonymous partners seem to play a role in the transmission dynamics of T pallidum infection among MSM living with HIV and a pilot intervention put in place in October 2020 may have resulted in a reduction in the prevalence of syphilis in this population. Thus combination prevention approaches including the expansion of the pilot intervention are urgently needed to reduce syphilis transmission. ",
