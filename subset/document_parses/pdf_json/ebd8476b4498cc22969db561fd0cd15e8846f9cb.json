The four criteria of Koch's postulates are: (i) The microbe must be found in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms. Based on the HPI-Outcome postulates, we lay out the integrative host-coronavirus interaction framework as shown in Figure 1 . Basically, the framework includes three major processes from the viral side and three major processes from the host side. For the coronaviruses, crucial processes include: viral entry to host cell, viral replication, and viral release from the infected cell. For the host, three responses exist: the na\u00efve response, the innate response, and the adaptive response. Initially, the host response to the coronavirus entry through a receptor-ligand interaction is na\u00efve since the host does not realize the danger and react to the virus by a routine procedure. At this na\u00efve host response stage, neither signalling molecules nor selected immune cell populations are yet present to coordinate an immune response. As signalling molecules are produced by infected cells (e.g. cytokines, interferons), the host will show a delayed innate responses to coronavirus infection. The innate immune response may or may not become effective and strong against the viral infection. Eventually, through a process of recombination followed by clonal selection in multiple immune cell subtypes, the host will mount an adaptive immune response more effective against the viral infection ( Figure 1 ). Each of the viral or host process includes many subprocesses and interactions. Dynamic hostvirus interactions can be used to explain disease outcomes according to their impact on these many subprocesses. If the viruses \"wins\", the result will be the viral survival and replication. If the host \"wins\", the host will eventually control viral replication and kill the viruses. To model and analyze the complex adversarial interactions between host and pathogen, we propose to apply ontology as an integrative and systematic platform due to the solid semantic logic behind ontology and its computer-interpretable nature.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 18, "end": 22, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 23, "end": 27, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 28, "end": 32, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 443, "end": 451, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1620, "end": 1628, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "\"HPI-Outcome postulates\" and its associated model for deep COVID-19 study"}, {"text": "We used ontology to represent coronavirus disease knowledge including the taxonomical structure of 9 coronaviruses in the NCBITaxon ontology, a taxonomy ontology based on the NCBI Taxonomy database 17 .

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a positive sense RNA virus in the coronavirus family (Coronaviridae) 2,3 . COVID-19 is the third well-attested outbreak of zoonotic (infecting across species) coronaviruses in the last 18 years. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China in 2002, and the SARS outbreak lasted for 8 months and caused in 8,098 confirmed human cases in 29 countries and 774 deaths 4,5 . In 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was isolated in Saudi Arabia from the sputum of a male patient who died from acute pneumonia and renal failure 6 . The MERS-CoV outbreaks resulted in 2,260 cases across 27 countries and 803 deaths 7,8 . Coronaviruses are important pathogens for humans and other vertebrates 9 . Prevalent coronaviruses cause agriculturally important diseases in animals and a cold-like illness in humans 10 . Examples of coronavirus-induced animal diseases are avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). A 2015 study estimated that IBV caused $3,567 in losses per 1000 birds on poultry farms in Brazil 11 .

(4) The microbe must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and be identical to the original causative agent.If we assume that we know the causal relation between a microbe and a disease, we are then asked to explain how the host-pathogen interaction (HPI) is causally associated with an outcome. Such outcomes can include hard endpoints (i.e. death,kidney failure) or intermediate phenotypic outcomes such as fever, reduced blood oxygen. In this case, we may propose a set of HPI-Outcome postulates that can explain how HPIs are linked to individual disease outcomes. Like Koch's postulates, our HPI-Outcome postulates include four criteria: (i) HPI motivation: The host (or pathogen) reacts to the pathogen (or host) to achieve their best possible outcome. Such phenomena explain the root motivation of the HPI and their associated outcomes. (ii) HPI-outcome causality: The host or pathogen outcomes are determined by the HPIs at the molecular and cellular level. As a result, the host or pathogen's genetic and phenotypic profiles (such as the direct and co-morbid susceptibility factors of the host) may affect such HPIs and thus disease outcomes. (iii) HPI role: The HPIs involves a network of molecular interactions at the interface of host and pathogen or within either the host and pathogen, and different molecules and interactions play different roles in determining disease outcomes. (iv) HPI interruption: An internal or external interruption of one or more H-P interactions critical to the HPI-outcome network may change the outcome. The external interruption can arise from drug or vaccine administration. The HPI-outcome postulates provide a set of very basic rules to guide our study of specific HPI mechanisms to explain disease outcomes. The first postulate explains the root motivation of the HPI behaviors and disease outcomes. Note that pathogens sometimes induce maladaptive responses in their hosts. For example, in the case of coronavirus, the evasion or hijacking of the host immune response is crucial to viral spread 25 . Hosts have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to detect and fight against viral infection, and immune evasion is a strategy by the virus to avoid a range of host responses. At some stage, the host will successfully mount an immune response. However, if immune evasion delays this immune response too long, the viral infection may be too widespread and the immune response itself can kill the host/patient 26 . The other postulates are also critical for HPI study. For example, the 2 nd postulate explains why comorbid conditions may affect HPIs and thus outcomes. While in vitro or labortary animal studies approximate in vivo human mechanisms, such studies may not reflect HPI-outcome causal linkages in the relevant host (e.g., human) because important HPIs leading to relevant outcomes may differ between hosts. According to the 3 rd postulate, each specific HPI initiates a dynamic interaction network and each interaction has its role in the network. The HPI may change a cascade of molecular interactions inside the host or pathogen. The roles of different molecules and interactions in the network should be carefully studied. According to the 4 th postulate, the HPI interruption may be performed by the host or pathogen naturally or can be initiated by the administration of a drug or vaccine.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "shows 35 manually curated hostcoronavirus protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which has been extracted from peerreviewed articles and stored in Victors, a virulence factor database we developed15 . These PPIs include a number of experimentally verified mechanisms. For example, all betacoronaviruses encode a spike (S) surface glycoprotein that binds to their corresponding host cell receptors and mediates viral entry to the host cells. Our annotated PPIs show that SARS-CoV uses its envelope spike (S) glycoprotein to bind to its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)32 . The S1 subunit of the S protein has a receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to ACE2. Letko et al. confirmed that human ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS-CoV-233 . In contrast, MERS-CoV S protein binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)34,35 . These interactions are essential for viral entry into host cells. More specifically, the viral S protein mediates the interaction with the host-cell receptor, even when the host receptor varies between viruses.Table 1shows many other targets or effects of potential interest.Using Ignet, our in-house centrality-and network-based literature mining analysis program 17 , we performed a preliminary gene-interaction analysis on PubMed abstracts related to coronavirus. In total 14,963 coronavirus-related PubMed abstracts were extracted.Figure 4illustrates the resulting gene interaction network, which identifies critical genes and their interactions with host factors including IFNG, TNF, ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL1b and IL-6. IFNG had the highest degree (number of interactions) at 27, suggesting its critical regulatory roles in the coronavirus pathogenesis. ACE2 directly interacts with viral proteins of three coronaviral strains (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV_NL63) and interacts with host-proteins that directly interact with other two strains (HCoV_229 and MERS). ACE2 is also highly connected with other genes identified by literature mining, which all strongly suggest its critical role in the pathogenic mechanisms. It is likely that patterns of interaction with ACE2 differ among coronaviruses, leading to differences in transmission and pathogenesis.In addition to PPIs, non-PPI mechanisms also exist. Non-PPI host factors, such as host lipids36 and nucleotides 37 , are also required for viral replication. Host lipids, such as lipid rafts and cholesterol, participate in the endocytosis process by which viruses attach to and infect cells. Many naturally derived substances, including cyclodextrin and sterols, could reduce the infectivity of many viruses, including coronaviruses, by interference with lipid-dependent attachment to human cells 38 . Nucleotide and nucleoside analogue inhibitors are chemically synthesized drugs used to treat both chronic and acute viral infections by causing premature chain termination, reduced replication fidelity, and depletion of pools of naturally occurring nucleotides 37 . For example, remdesivir is a monophosphate prodrug of an adenosine nucleoside analog that has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a non-human primate model of Ebola virus infection 39 and against human SARS-CoV-2 infection 40 .", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "illustrates how the human host interacts with SARS-Cov2 and how such interaction could result in hypertension.

The binding of the SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV2 to human ACE2 leads to the subsequent downregulation of ACE2.

Currently, these pre-identified PPIs and tissue-preferred gene profiles are stored in tables or databases that do not have a scientifically well-motivated associated ontology. Therefore, the use of this prior knowledge is labor intensive and difficult to automate. We can ontologically represent the domains from viral and host proteins, individual domain-domain interactions, and the tissue preference of each protein and domain. We expect that such a systematic ontology-based representation of this prior knowledge would facilitate the usage of both domain-domain interactions and tissue specificity studies, supporting additional interaction predictions and analysis.DiscussionThe contribution of this article is manifold.First, a set of host-pathogen interaction (HPI)-outcome postulates are proposed to provide a framework for deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions and their causal role in disease outcomes. The HPI-outcome postulates can be applied to fundamentally understand interactions between hosts (including humans) and coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2). Second, to use the HPI-outcome postulates, we proposed an integrative ontology-based framework to systematically model, represent, and analyze human-coronavirus interaction (HCI)-outcome relations, including coronavirus and host phylogenies, and literature mined and manually annotated host-coronavirus interactions, drugs, vaccines, and their intertwined relations. Third, examples such as a potential mechanistic link between the S-ACE2 interaction and blood pressure comorbidities illustrate applications of our integrative ontology-based framework. We demonstrate a structured, hierarchical representation of coronaviruses, hosts, phenotypes, and HCI interactions in terms of viral pathogenesis and host innate and adaptive responses. We showed that based on prior knowledge, we could develop computational predictions to predict new host-coronavirus interactions (HCIs) and extrapolate to hypothetical affects on different tissues and organs.We envision that our proposed integrative ontology-based framework could serve as a foundation for ongoing and deeper studies of the COVID-19 disease. We have initiated the development of the community-driven Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO), which can serve as a logic framework for the systematic representation of the HCIs, disease outcomes, and the relations between the HCIs and disease outcomes14 . CIDO is an interoperable with other ontologies, such as the community-based Ontology of Host-Pathogen Interactions (OHPI)15 . The communitybased CIDO can serve as an ontology platform for describing host-coronavirus interactions (HCIs) built from these HPI-postulates.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "Model of host-coronavirus interactions and their associated disease outcomes.

Based on the 64 chemical elements known, Mendeleev generated a periodic table to position these elements and predicted the deeper, underlying structure giving rise to their chemical properties. Similarly, we can accumulate all the existing evidence of HCIs and put these interactions into a HCI framework to identify periodic patterns, and use these patterns to predict strategies for drugs and vaccines. These patterns are represented through an ontology, which provides a periodic table-like framework. CIDO aims to become such an ontology.
