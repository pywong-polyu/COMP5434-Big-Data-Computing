We explore queer concerns in privacy, censorship, language, online safety, health, and employment to study the positive and negative effects of artificial intelligence on queer communities. These issues underscore the need for new directions in fairness research that take into account a multiplicity of considerations, from privacy preservation, context sensitivity and process fairness, to an awareness of sociotechnical impact and the increasingly important role of inclusive and participatory research processes. Most current approaches for algorithmic fairness assume that the target characteristics for fairness-frequently, race and legal gender-can be observed or recorded. Sexual orientation and gender identity are prototypical instances of unobserved characteristics, which are frequently missing, unknown or fundamentally unmeasurable. This paper highlights the importance of developing new approaches for algorithmic fairness that break away from the prevailing assumption of observed characteristics.",

In part, this stems from the unique challenges posed by studying sexual orientation and gender identity. Most definitions of algorithmic fairness share a basis in norms of egalitarianism (Barocas, Hardt, and Narayanan 2019; Binns 2018) . 2 For example, classification parity approaches to fairness aim to equalise predictive performance measures across groups, whereas anti-classification parity approaches rely on the omission of protected attributes from the decision making process to ensure different groups receive equivalent treatment (Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018 ). An inherent assumption of these approaches is that the protected characteristics are known and available within datasets. Sexual orientation and gender identity are prototypical examples of unobserved characteristics, presenting challenging obstacles for fairness research (Andrus et al. 2020; Jacobs and Wallach 2019) .",

For our discussion, we define 'queer' as 'possessing non-normative sexual identity, gender identity, and/or sexual characteristics'. We consider this to include lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, transgender, and asexual identities-among others. 3 The focus on queer communities is important for several reasons. Given the historical oppression and contemporary challenges faced by queer communities, there is a substantial risk that artificial intelligence (AI) systems will be designed and deployed unfairly for queer individuals. Compounding this risk, sensitive information for queer people is usually not available to those developing AI systems, rendering the resulting unfairness unmeasurable from the perspective of standard group fairness metrics. Despite these issues, fairness research with respect to queer communities is an understudied area. Ultimately, the experiences of queer communities can reveal insights for algorithmic fairness that are transferable to a broader range of characteristics, including disability, class, religion, and race.",

Researchers have proposed adversarial filters (Zhang et al. 2020; Liu, Zhang, and Yu 2017) to obfuscate sensitive information in images and speech shared online while reducing the risks of re-identification. Still, challenges remain . More research is needed to ensure the robustness of the adversarial approaches. The knowledge gap between the privacy and machine-learning research communities must be bridged for these approaches to achieve the desired effects.

Other algorithms designed to predict sexual orientation have suffered similar methodological and conceptual deficiencies.

Prediction algorithms could be deployed at scale by malicious actors, par-ticularly in nations where homosexuality and gender nonconformity are punishable offences. In fact, in many such nations, authorities already use technology to entrap or locate queer individuals through social media and LGBTQ+ dating apps (e.g., Culzac 2014) . Systems predicting sexual orientation may also exacerbate the pre-existing privacy risks of participating in queer digital spaces. There have been recorded cases of coordinated campaigns for outing queer people, resulting in lives being ruined, or lost due to suicide (Embury-Dennis 2020). These malicious outing campaigns have until now been executed at smaller scales. However, recent developments in AI greatly amplify the potential scale of such incidents, endangering larger communities of queer people in certain parts of the world. Facial recognition technology (Voulodimos et al. 2018 ) could be employed by malicious actors to rapidly identify individuals sharing their pictures online, whether publicly or in direct messages. Facial recognition could similarly be used to automatically identify people in captured recordings of protests, in queer nightclubs or community spaces, and other in-person social events. These possibilities highlight the potential dangers of AI for state-deployed surveillance technology. Chatbots have similarly been deployed to elicit private information on dating apps, compromising users' device integrity and privacy (McCormick 2015) . Existing bots are scripted, and therefore can usually be distinguished from human users after longer exchanges. Nonetheless, strong language models threaten to exacerbate the such privacy risks, given their ability to quickly adjust to the style of communication based on a limited number of examples. These language models amplify existing concerns around the collection of private information and the compromising of safe online spaces.",

For example, the phrase 'That's so gay' (Chonody, Rutledge, and Smith 2012) equates queerness with badness. Using the term 'sexual preference' rather than 'sexual orientation' can imply that sexual orientation is a volitional choice, rather than an intrinsic part of one's identity. Assuming one's gender identity, without asking, is harmful to the trans community as it risks misgendering people. This can manifest in the careless use of assumed pronouns, without knowledge of an individual's identification and requested pronouns. Reinforcing binary and traditional gender expression stereotypes, regardless of intent, can have adverse consequences. The use of gender-neutral pronouns has been shown to result in lower bias against women and LGBTQ+ people (Tavits and P\u00e9rez 2019) . To further complicate the matter, words which originated in a derogatory context, such as the label 'queer' itself, are often reclaimed by the community in an act of resistance.

The Troll Patrol project investigated the application of natural language processing methods for quantifying abuse against women on Twitter. The project revealed concerning patterns of online abuse and highlighted the technological challenges required to develop online abuse detection systems. Recently, similar systems have been applied to tweets directed at the LGBTQ+ community. Machine learning and sentiment analysis were leveraged to predict homophobia in Portuguese tweets, resulting in 89.4% accuracy (Pereira 2018) .

Yet there is a risk that benefits will be unequally distributed-and an additional risk that queer people's needs will not be properly met by the design of current systems. Information about sexual orientation and gender identity is frequently absent from research datasets. To mitigate the privacy risk for patients and prevent reidentification, HIV status and substance abuse are also routinely omitted from published data. While such practices may be necessary, it is worth recognising the important downstream consequences they have for AI system development in healthcare. It can become impossible to assess fairness and model performance across the omitted dimensions. Moreover, the unobserved data increase the likelihood of reduced predictive performance (since the features are dropped), which itself results in worse health outcomes. The coupled risk of a decrease in performance and an inability to measure it could drastically limit the benefits from AI in healthcare for the queer community, relative to cisgendered heterosexual patients. To prevent the amplification of existing inequities, there is a critical need for targeted fairness research examining the impacts of AI systems in healthcare for queer people.",

In some cases, the plan for data collection fails to incorporate questions on sexual orientation and gender identity-potentially because the data collector did not consider or realise that they are important attributes to record (Herek et al. 1991) . As a result, researchers may inherit datasets where assessment of sexual orientation and gender identity is logistically excluded. In other situations, regardless of the surveyor's intent, the collection of certain personal data may threaten an individual's privacy or their safety. Many countries have legislation that actively discriminates against LGBTQ+ people (Human Rights Watch n.d.). Even in nations with hardwon protections for the queer community, cultural bias persists. To shield individuals from this bias and protect their privacy, governments may instate legal protections for sensitive data, including sexual orientation (European Commission n.d.). As a result, such data may be ethically or legally precluded for researchers. Finally, as recognised by discursive theories of gender and sexuality, sexual orientation and gender identity are fluid cultural constructs that may change over time and across social contexts (Butler 2011) . Attempts to categorise, label, and record such information may be inherently ill-posed (Hamidi, Scheuerman, and Branham 2018) . Thus, some characteristics are unobserved because they are fundamentally unmeasurable.

Substantial challenges are posed by the sensitivity of group membership information and its absence from most research datasets, as well as the associated outing risks associated with attempts to automatically derive such information from existing data (Bjarnadottir et al. 2019; Ehrenfeld et al. 2019; Young, Yu, and Wang 2017) . Consensually provided self-identification data, if and when available, may only capture a fraction of the community. The resulting biased estimates of queer fairness may involve high levels of uncertainty (Ethayarajh 2020), though it may be possible to utilise unlabeled data for tightening the bounds (Ji, Smyth, and Steyvers 2020) . While it is possible to root the analysis in proxy groups (Gupta et al. 2018) , there is a risk of incorporating harmful stereotypes in proxy group definitions, potentially resulting in harms of representation (Abbasi et al. 2019) .

Adversarially Re-weighted Learning (Lahoti et al. 2020) aims to address this issue by relying on measurable covariates of protected characteristics (e.g., zip code as a proxy for race). This approach aims to achieve intersectional fairness by optimising group fairness between all computationally identifiable groups (Kearns et al. 2018; Kim, Reingold, and Rothblum 2018) . Distributionally robust optimisation represents an alternative method for preventing disparity amplification, bounding the worst-case risk over groups with unknown group membership by optimising the worst-case risk over an appropriate risk region (Hashimoto et al. 2018 ). These methods have helped establish a link between robustness and fairness, and have drawn attention to the synergistic benefits of considering the relationship between fairness and ML generalisation (Creager, Jacobsen, and Zemel 2020) . Other adversarial approaches have also been proposed for improving counterfactual fairness, and by operating in continuous settings, have been shown to be a better fit for protected characteristics that are hard to enumerate (Grari, Lamprier, and Detyniecki 2020) .",

Youth with disabilities more frequently suffer from adverse mental health due to bullying, and people of all ages with physical disabilities are at higher risk for depression (King et al. 2018; Turner and Noh 1988) . Therefore, individuals with disabilities may benefit from insights on the interaction of unobserved characteristics and mental health. Lower-income and lower-class individuals also suffer from worse mental health, particularly in countries with high economic inequality (Liu and Ali 2008) . Fairness for class and socioeconomic status is also an important consideration for employment, where class bias in hiring limits employee diversity and may prevent economic mobility (Kraus et al. 2019 ).",

This may frequently be the case for disability status and class, for example. Individual fairness-a set of approaches based on the notion of treating similar individuals similarly (Dwork et al. 2012; Jung et al. 2019 )-could potentially promote fairness across multiple demographics. These approaches entail a handful of challenges, however. The unobserved group memberships cannot be incorporated in the similarity measure. As a result, the similarity measure used for assessing individual fairness must be designed carefully. To optimise fairness across multiple demographics and better capture the similarity between people on a fine-grained level, similarity measures will likely need to incorporate a large number of proxy features. This would be a marked divergence from the proposed measures in most published work. Counterfactual and contrastive fairness metrics come with their own set of practical implementation challenges.",
