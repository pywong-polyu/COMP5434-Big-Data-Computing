Although the degree and duration of vaccine efficacy as well as the efficacy against new virus variants remain unconfirmed (Hacisuleyman et al., 2021) , widespread vaccination can contribute to establishing herd immunity against COVID-19. While the required proportions of individuals with immunity could vary by country (e.g. due to demographic structure and frequency of human contact), it is estimated that approximately 70% of the population needs immunity to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, which would require more than 30 million deaths worldwide due to natural infection (Randolph & Barreiro, 2020) .",

The above-mentioned working group developed the 'three Cs vaccine hesitancy model', which comprises confidence, complacency, and convenience, indicating that historic, socio-cultural, environmental, health system/institutional, economic or political factors, as well as personal perception and vaccine/vaccination characteristics matter towards vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, from a utilitarian perspective, voluntary vaccinations can deviate from the social optimum due to the positive externalities of vaccinated individuals; hence, Pigouvian subsidies, external regulations, or strategies to improve vaccine awareness is needed, depending on the nature of vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccines (Bauch et al., 2003; Chen & Toxvaerd, 2014; Liu et al., 2012) . Therefore, it is important to understand the reasons of those who tend not to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, in addition to strategies to raise the vaccination rates. In the following section, we review the literature on the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.",

These studies suggest that many empirical papers find that older people compared to their younger counterparts and men compared to women are more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Older people are susceptible to the disease and while men and women can decline vaccination for different reasons, the differences in perceived risks, efficacies, and knowledge may mediate these gender differences (Truong et al., 2021) . In addition to age and gender, educational attainment is identified as the most frequent predictor, with higher acceptance among people with higher education levels (Wang et al., 2021) . While highly educated individuals can be vaccine-hesitant because of the influence of social groups and other authorities, education may play an important role in understanding disease severity and vaccination benefits (Truong et al., 2021) .",

Based on the health belief model, by modifying socio-demographic factors, individuals can decide whether to vaccinate as a reflection of their personal beliefs about a disease and its preventive measures, such as susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy (Carico et al., 2021; Champion & Skinner, 2008) . A systematic review identifies that vaccine acceptance is higher among those with greater perceived risk, threat, vulnerability, and susceptibility to infection (Al-Amer et al., 2021; Troiano & Nardi, 2021) . Furthermore, the beliefs about the vaccine are predictors of vaccine hesitancy, including mistrust in its safety or efficacy and conspiracy beliefs, which can be induced by a low health literacy and negative information in the media (Al-Amer et al., 2021) .",

Time preference affects one's vaccination intentions because individuals will benefit from the vaccination in the future, despite having to bear its present costs. Therefore, those discounted future benefits would lead them to decide not to vaccinate. Moreover, the attitudes toward risks are attributed to vaccination decision-making, that is, risk-averse individuals would feel conflicted between the risk of infection without vaccination and the vaccines' side effects. This would explain why younger people tend to be vaccine-hesitant, considering they are less likely to develop symptoms than their older counterparts (Poletti et al., 2021) and have more frequent side effects (Menni et al., 2021) . In addition to individuals' attributes and beliefs, vaccine characteristics are important determinants of vaccination intention, being highly relevant to individuals' perceptions and preference for vaccines. In particular, individuals prefer vaccines with higher efficacy, longer duration of disease protection, and safety (i.e. none or few adverse effects) (Al-Amer et al., 2021; Motta, 2021) .",

Aiming at a better understanding of the population for COVID-19 vaccines, public organisations disseminate information about the efficacy and safety of vaccines (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021b; World Health Organization, 2021a). Additionally, a study suggests that emphasising the benefits of vaccination and inducing feelings of vaccine ownership are useful (Ashworth et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2021) , thus suggesting the importance of information campaigns. In some countries, the convenience of vaccination locations is enhanced by providing these services within the areas of citizens' daily lives, such as train stations and supermarkets (Biesemans, 2021; The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 2021). Furthermore, the incentives toward vaccination attract the attention of some policymakers (Volpp & Cannuscio, 2021) although their effectiveness remains inconclusive and may depend on how incentives are given (Kluver et al., 2021; Kreps et al., 2021; Serra-Garcia & Szech, 2021; Sprengholz et al., 2021; Walkey et al., 2021) .",

Meanwhile, the evidence on how to increase COVID-19 vaccine acceptance remains scarce. In alignment with the policies in several regions, the evidence on communication strategies and the incentives for reducing vaccine hesitancy have gained increasing attention, as discussed above, while the effectiveness of vaccine passports in raising vaccine acceptance has been limited. While countries such as Israel, France, and Italy attempt to utilise vaccine passports, other countries may also consider similar schemes to return to a 'normal life'. If so, it is immensely important to accelerate herd immunity by reducing avoidable vaccine hesitancy, to which the benefits of the vaccine passports may contribute. Therefore, we assess the effectiveness of easing public health restrictions after vaccination by vaccine passports based on our analysis of a conjoint experiment.",

In Japan, compared to Western countries, the COVID-19 mortality rate is much lower (World Health Organization, 2021b) , and government responses to the pandemic are less stringent (Hale et al., 2021) ; hence, the attitude of the Japanese population toward the vaccine and vaccine passports availability may differ from other countries.

Following the definition of vaccine hesitancy (MacDonald & Sage Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy, 2015), we operationally defined those who were undecided and unwilling to vaccinate as vaccine hesitant.In instances where respondents hesitated to vaccinate, we additionally asked them about the reasons for the unacceptance of a vaccine and asked them to indicate if each reason mattered to them. Referring to previous investigations(Nguyen et al., 2021;Nomura et al., 2021), we identified 18 items, such as concerns about the vaccine's side effects, safety, efficacy, and other reasons.",

Based on our findings, several policy implications can be drawn. First, information campaigns to convey accurate messages are extremely important to enhance the understanding and remove vaccine mistrust. Utilising behavioural insights, better designs on how to best communicate with people to enhance vaccine uptake are considered (Ashworth et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2021; Gesser-Edelsburg et al., 2015; Penta & Baban, 2018). Second, emphasising benefits other than health (e.g. the relaxation of public health restrictions), if applicable, may enhance vaccine acceptance. Even under the concerns about breakthrough infections, the overall public health benefits may be in surplus if and only if a rise in vaccine acceptance largely reduces severe symptoms and the mortality rate from infection given the confirmed safety of the vaccine by contributing to the establishment of herd immunity against COVID-19. The continuous evaluations and careful consideration of the efficacy, duration of effectiveness, and side effects of the vaccine, as well as potential public health impacts and ethical issues of vaccine passports are indispensable. With the uncertain duration of vaccine efficacy and the efficacy against new virus variants, it",
