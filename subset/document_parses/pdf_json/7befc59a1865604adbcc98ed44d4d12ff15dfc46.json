Compared with the top ten global causes of death in 2010, there were only lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis remaining in 2016, and the mortality of diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis decreased by almost 1.5 million [2] . However, the World Health Organization announced that contagious diseases are now spreading throughout the world much faster due to the highly mobile and interconnected world. The international spread of disease threatens public health security; some examples include pandemic influenza, polio, drug-resistant tuberculosis, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [3] . According to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, there were 346 confirmed SARS cases, and 73 of the cases were deceased patients. Ever since, Taiwan's government and hospitals have gained much experience, established a public health response mechanism, and reformed the hospital infection control strategy [4] . The mechanisms and strategies include (1) developing monitoring stations at harbors and airports in Taiwan, (2) in compliance with the World Health Organization (WHO) hand hygiene campaign, (3) implementing quality improvement projects for infection control inspections in the hospital accreditation system, and (4) acquiring healthcare workers who are pursuing continuing education for infectious diseases every year [4] [5] [6] .",

Prevention and control measures are essential, particularly the training and preparation of healthcare workers. Since Taiwan had the first case of COVID-19 on 21 January 2020, all hospitals have set up temperature monitoring systems and followed the protocol for prompt recognition and isolation of patients presenting with fever or respiratory illness.",

The area of each branch is spread evenly across Taipei, and all the general branches could provide comprehensive care for Taipei citizens. Among those branches, the HePing branch was the main hospital taking care of the patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and was sealed off during that period [6, 12] . Taipei City Hospital also has the responsibility to participate in infection prevention and control programs and take care of Taipei citizens. Although all healthcare workers must complete at least four hours of continuing education courses per year focusing on infectious diseases, there was a lack of sessions focusing specifically on the emerging contagious disease. Continuing education programs for COVID-19 were mostly held by each specialty. There is limited research focusing on how an institution knows the knowledge gaps among different healthcare workers. After that, the hospital can build an integrated continuing education program to improve the health workers' ability to protect themselves from infection; diagnose, treat, and care for patients; and keep updating their knowledge during this rapidly changing pandemic era [13] . This study aimed to use validated questionnaires to identify the knowledge gaps experienced by healthcare professionals in different specialties and develop an integrated continuing education model for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic to educate different hospital staff categories on the basics of COVID-19.",

            "text": "This study was a cross-sectional study conducted in February 2020 in Taipei City Hospital. Ten multiple-choice questions (MCQs) were developed to identify and confirm the knowledge gaps of each job category, as well as the professional knowledge and care skills required in the follow-up, through written examinations, which were used to design the follow-up curriculum reinforcement steps. The MCQs underwent two development stages: the generation of items by an infection specialist and expert evaluation. An infection specialist initially designed ten MCQs, which included the basic knowledge of COVID-19 (Q1, Q3), the epidemiology of COVID-19 (Q6), the criteria for reporting suspected cases of coronavirus (Q2, Q5), the timing of hand-washing and the disinfection mechanism of dry hand sanitizers (Q4, Q7), selecting the essential personal protective equipment (PPE) (Q8), and the medical student affairs in the hospital (Q9, Q10) ( Table 1 ). Based on the learning objectives, nine attending teaching physicians assessed items for clarity and relevance on a 4-point ordinal scale. We calculated item-level Content Validation Index (CVI) scores. The overall CVI from the expert review of these ten MCQs was 0.98. Then, these ten MCQs were published on the digital learning platform together with the follow-up online learning course and handouts so that information was accessible to all colleagues. In response to the abovementioned ten questions, the Department of Education and Research provided an e-learning course with handouts taught and organized by the infection specialist. The process was monitored until all the participants had completed the multiple-choice questions 100% correctly ( Figure 1 ). There were 6512 employees in the hospital. Within one month of the online test and curriculum offering, 5533 staff had completed the test, with a completion rate of 84.97%. Four thousand seven hundred twenty-eight healthcare workers responded to the pre-test, and 2618 healthcare workers answered the pre-test 100% correctly. Those who did not answer the pre-test 100% correctly or did not participate in the pre-test could take repeated post-tests after learning through the online teaching materials. Eventually, 5214 staff passed the test (pre-test or post-test with 100% correct answers). To identify the knowledge gaps among different healthcare workers, we classified the employee into three categories: (1) physicians, (2) nurses, and (3) others. The category of physicians included attending physicians and residents, while nurses included nurse practitioners and registered nurses. We categorized clerks, interns, physiotherapists, technicians, and other healthcare workers in the hospital as \"others\" because they have little chance of direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. The pre-test respondents' characteristics, including the gender, age, and length of service time in Taipei City Hospital, were statistically significant within each job category ( Table 2) . We calculated the passing rate in the pre-test with different cut-off scores for each job category and analyzed the knowledge gaps between different job categories. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei City Hospital (TCHIRB-10906015-W). This study was conducted by analyzing datasets, and the raw data were de-identified. Therefore, the Research Ethics Committee agreed to waive the informed consent due to minimal risk within the study. All methods were carried out according to the Taipei City Hospital Research Ethics Committee's relevant guidelines and regulations. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables, and the significance level was equal to or less than 0.05.",

The proportion of physicians answering eight and nine out of 10 questions correct is higher than that of nurses and others, whereas others' percentage of answering all ten questions correct was 57.15%. Physicians have the highest correct rate for most of the questions, particularly Q6, the epidemiology of COVID-19. In contrast, others have a higher correct rate on the criteria for reporting suspected cases of coronavirus (Q2, Q5). All staff has a low correct rate for Q8, \"personal protective equipment recommendations for healthcare workers in the triage area\", which is 76.85% for physicians, 77.28% for nurses, and 76.98% for others (Table 4 ). After controlling for gender, age, length of service time in Taipei In response to the possibility of healthcare workers being exposed to the virus by caring for suspected patients of COVID-19 or supervising procedures at the hospital entrance, the Infection Control Center conducted training sessions to educate all hospital staff on how to put on and take off protective clothing. The hospital Infection Control Center led the donning and removing PPE training program and provided information on the selection and use of PPE for infection prevention for different situations. The Infection Control Center invited healthcare workers and administrative staff as well as hospital volunteers to participate in the training program because they might also be exposed to cases when assisting people in the following procedures for entering the hospital. The instructors demonstrated how to don and remove PPE correctly, and then, all participants were asked to practice within the proper social distance and received feedback from the instructors. For those who might need detailed instructions or staff who could not attend the training program, the Infection Control Center provided online videos and posters with detailed instructions on putting on and removing PPE. For staff who needed more practice putting on and taking off PPE, the Infection Control Center provided this at each unit's request. Information on the selection and use of PPE for infection prevention was provided. Participants were allowed time to practice and familiarize themselves with the correct way to don and remove PPE. Given the possible shortage of clinical protective materials, the attending teaching physicians reviewed the timing of and occasions for using surgical masks, N95 masks, and protective clothing. The evidence-based literature was translated into Chinese and made available to the hospital's decision-makers and colleagues on April 13th to reduce unnecessary use and waste masks.",

The government set up fever screening stations at the airport, took anti-epidemic actions against human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, and conducted the organization of medical infection control materials timeously. The promotion of epidemic prevention measures was reinforced to cultivate good health habits among the people [14] . All of these, along with the transparency of epidemic prevention policies, ensured that Taiwan's coronavirus outbreak remained relatively stable. The Department of Education and Research in Taipei City Hospital continued updating online learning materials, which are based on the most important updated peer-reviewed published articles. Nine attending teaching physicians helped to search, translate, and take notes for those articles in the local language (traditional Chinese) for other colleagues to read easily. The attending teaching physicians continued reading and highlighting the latest international COVID-19 literature. From January 24th to mid-July 2020, they had read and summarized more than one hundred essential articles and translated them into traditional Chinese. The easy-to-read Chinese materials were posted on the hospital website, the Taiwan Society of Health-System Pharmacists website, and LINE APP communication software groups (LINE) for reference by relevant medical colleagues nationwide. The attending teaching physicians also categorized the foci of these articles into nine subject areas: epidemiology, diagnostic methods, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical features of adults, clinical features of pediatric patients, clinical features of pregnant women, the latest treatment modalities, epidemic prevention, and ethical issues, hospice care, and teaching. Nine attending teaching physicians created online audio-visual teaching materials using the Pecha Kucha reporting mode (\"a fast-paced presentation format consisting of 20 slides set to proceed automatically every 20 s\") [18] . They posted the files onto the digital learning platform in the hospital for those who could not study synchronously.",

In this way, the department could understand the knowledge gaps in pandemic prevention in different categories and make individualized teaching arrangements for different categories. Compared with previous studies investigating the knowledge gaps between different healthcare professionals [19] [20] [21] , this study revealed that physicians performed better than others among most of the ten basic questions. Nurses were less knowledgeable about administrative procedures, such as reporting suspected cases. The correct rate on the PPE recommendations in the triage area was poor for all categories. Thus, the Department of Education and Research carried out training sessions on administrative circulars for COVID-19, PPE recommendations for triage areas, and other relevant education for different categories.",

First, the pre-test in this study failed to achieve a 100% answer rate or a 100% pass rate, which might be due to the busy workload of clinical staff and the short follow-up period of one month. There was no control group or sampling method in this study, and the results of the MCQs might not be generalizable. In addition, the MCQs' use has certain limitations, such as timesensitive questionnaires due to the ever-changing situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, response bias, and lack of understanding. Although the placement of essential journal highlights in the local language in cloud folders was the most useful from the yearly satisfaction surveys, which type of education/training interventions was the most useful needs to be investigated in future studies. Nonetheless, through the hospital-wide course announcements, the continuous placement of test questions and learning files on the digital learning platform, the continuing education course reminder system, the placement of journal highlights in cloud folders, and the use of the digital learning platform on mobile phones, accessible outside the hospital, we expect to be able to increase the learning opportunities for healthcare workers in the hospital, even at a fragmented time, such as that experienced during the coronavirus pandemic",

We designed and validated ten MCQs to identify knowledge gaps among healthcare workers. All healthcare workers needed to be more familiar with adequate wearing the PPE, which is one of the most critical parts of preventing COVID-19. The Department of Education and Research continued updating the online learning materials based on the most essential updated peer-reviewed published articles. The attending teaching physicians helped to search, translate, and take notes on articles in the local language (traditional Chinese) for other colleagues to read easily. We expect to increase learning opportunities for healthcare workers, even during uncertain times such as the current coronavirus pandemic through (1) the hospital-wide course announcements, (2) the continuous placement of test questions and learning files on the digital learning platform, (3) the placement of journal highlights in cloud folders, and (4) the use of the digital learning platform on mobile phones accessible outside the hospital.
