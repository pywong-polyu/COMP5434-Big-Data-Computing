We further study how to choose the parameters of the sums properly to solve the problem. Moreover, we show that the sums have some advantages in data fitting over the classical Prony exponential sums. Namely, we prove that the parameters of our sums are a priori well-controlled and thus can be found via a stable numerical framework, in contrast to those of the Prony ones. In several numerical experiments, we also compare the behaviour of both the sums and illustrate the above-mentioned advantages.",

There exist numerous state-of-the-art analytical and numerical methods for solving the corresponding data fitting problems, see the overview in [2, 5, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] . One of the main challenges in the area is that the exponential data fitting is ill-conditioned in many cases [10] . Among other things, this can be connected with the behaviour of exponential sum parameters (such as \u03bc k and \u03bb k in (1)). In particular, one can find in [6] a family of g whose corresponding parameters of (1) tend to infinity thus making the interpolation process divergent.",
