Brazil is currently the second leading country in number of cases of COVID-19, while S\u00e3o Paulo state accounts for 20% of total confirmed cases in Brazil. The aim of this study was to assess environmental and social factors influencing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the expanded metropolitan area of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Firstly, a spatial analysis was conducted to provide insights into the spread of COVID-19 within the expanded metropolitan area. Moreover, Spearman correlation test and sensitivity analysis were performed to assess social indicators and environmental conditions which possibly influence the incidence of COVID-19. Our results reveal that the spread of COVID-19 from the capital city S\u00e3o Paulo-its epicenter in Brazil-is directly associated with the availability of highways within the expanded metropolitan area of S\u00e3o Paulo. As for social aspects, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be both positively correlated with population density, and negatively correlated with social isolation rate, hence indicating that social distancing has been effective in reducing the COVID-19 transmission. Finally, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be inversely correlated with both temperature and UV radiation. Together with recent literature our study suggests that the UV radiation provided by sunlight might contribute to depletion of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.",

Furthermore, using graphical analysis, we have observed a consistent trend in all analyzed cities, with increases of confirmed new cases of COVID-19 associated with decreases in social isolation rates (Fig. 2) . Our results corroborate data from recent literature, as Ahmadi et al. (2020) found a significant correlation between COVID-19 cases and intra-provincial traffic in Iran. Using the Spearman correlation test, significantly negative correlations were found between COVID-19 infection rate and UV radiation in all cities with available UV data (5 out of 9 analyzed cities) (Table 4) ; furthermore, the sensitivity analysis pointed out UV radiation as a significant variable (Table 5 ). These findings are consistent with recent literature; for example, Ahmadi et al. (2020) have found the lowest COVID-19 infection rates in provinces with high solar radiation. Furthermore, Schuit et al. (2020) have demonstrated that the influenza virus in aerosols decays more rapidly under simulated sunlight than under dark conditions, and concluded that their results are in accordance with epidemiological data reporting sunlight levels to be inversely correlated to influenza transmission. More importantly, Sagripanti and Lytle (2020) have recently predicted the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by solar UVB in densely populated cities in the world. The authors have estimated that during the winter season in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, a 41-min exposure to sunlight around solar noon would be required to achieve 90% inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus, while a 13-min exposure to sunlight around solar noon could achieve 99% inactivation during the summer season. Therefore, recent literature corroborates our finding that the UV radiation provided by sunlight potentially reduces the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.",
