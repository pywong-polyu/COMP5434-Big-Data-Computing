Specifically, T-cellmediated immune responses to AAV vectors are related to loss of efficacy and potential liver toxicities. As post-translational modifications in T cell epitopes have the potential to affect immune reactions, the cellular immune responses to peptides derived from spontaneously deamidated AAV were investigated. Here, we report that highly deamidated sites in AAV9 contain CD4 T cell epitopes with a Th1 cytokine pattern in multiple human donors with diverse human leukocyte antigen (HLA) backgrounds. Furthermore, some peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples demonstrated differential T cell activation to deamidated or non-deamidated epitopes. Also, in vitro and in silico HLA binding assays showed differential binding to the deamidated or non-deamidated peptides in some HLA alleles. This study provides critical attributes to vector-immune-mediated responses, as AAV deamidation can impact the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of AAV-mediated gene therapy in some patients.",

            "text": "Human gene therapy (GT) using viral vectors has shown great promise as a treatment avenue for rare and monogenic disorders that lack alternative treatment options. In GT, recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors are among the most commonly used vectors due to their ability to transduce a wide range of dividing and non-dividing cells, diverse tissue tropism, and episomal expression. Natural infection with AAV is nonpathogenic, but exposure to rAAV vectors in large quantities by unnatural routes can present safety issues. Currently, rAAV accounts for 24% of the viral vectors used in clinical trials worldwide, 1 with more than 100 investigational new drug (IND) submissions for rAAV-based products in the past few years. 2 Furthermore, a number of rAAV gene therapy programs have matured to advanced clinical development 2 or have been approved for licensure. 3, 4 While the number of rAAV-vector-based clinical investigations has been rapidly increasing, significant challenges remain due to the inherent immunogenicity of the rAAV capsid, which largely dictates the interaction of the rAAV with the host immune system. To this end, several studies have shown that engagement of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system 5, 6 with rAAV impacts the safety and efficacy of the gene therapy. 7 This, in part, is due to widespread exposure of humans to naturally occurring AAV, resulting in pre-existing immunity in 30%-60% of the human population, which typically varies by age and country of residency. [8] [9] [10] While humoral immune responses to AAV could be controlled or predicted by measuring pre-existing AAV antibody titers in the serum before or during clinical trials, cellular immune responses to rAAV have been challenging. Deleterious capsid cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses have been involved in loss of efficacy and potentially liver toxicities. A loss of factor IX transgene expression and transient mild elevations of liver enzymes in circulation were correlated with CD8 + T cell responses against the rAAV capsid in the first liver-directed gene therapy trial with rAAV. 7, 11 It was later shown that transduced cells present capsid-derived epitopes to cytotoxic CD8 + T cells via major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I). 12 Recent clinical trials using rAAV also indicated that high abundance of CpG motifs in the vector resulted in failure to achieve sustained expression, owing to capsid-specific CD8 + T cells. 13 MHC class I and class II molecules have evolved to bind short peptides and present them to circulating T cells and trigger an immune response. 14 The recognition of these peptides by T cell receptors (TCRs) can be highly specific to a point where any minor change in the peptide-MHC complex interaction can drastically affect T cell activation. Post-translationally modified epitopes can alter the molecular fingerprint of the interacting surfaces in TCR/peptide/MHC complexes, potentially affecting immune reactions in an unanticipated manner. 15, 16 Specifically, asparagine deamidation, which is the most common spontaneous post-translational modification, 17 can result in an irreversible sequence change from asparagine (N) to aspartic acid (D) or to isoaspartic acid (iD). Such changes in amino acid sequences may alter MHC binding or TCR recognition and thus have a significant impact on immune recognition. 18, 19 It has been reported that deamidation of six asparagine sites in an anthrax toxin vaccine significantly diminished vaccine efficacy. 20 A converse impact has been demonstrated in a murine autoimmune model of cytochrome c (Cyt C), where modifications of \"D\" amino acid to \"iD\" amino acid induced a dramatic T cell response and resulted in epitope spreading and an autoimmune response that was cross-reactive to the native Cyt C protein. Furthermore, it has been suggested that deamidation could influence antigen processing and presentation 21, 22 or trigger strong auto-reactive B and T cell responses. 23 Recent studies have demonstrated that recombinant AAV capsids undergo high levels of deamidation. 24, 25 Giles et al. 24 found that the highest levels of deamidation in rAAV occur at asparagine residues where the N+1 residue is glycine (i.e., NG pairs) and that deamidation of the rAAV is comprehensive and is not serotype specific or impacted by the manufacturing system. Furthermore, they showed that deamidation also affects capsid assembly, which altered the in vitro transduction efficiency in human-liver-derived Huh7 cells. 24 Considering that reported T cell epitopes in rAAV contain NG pairs, 26, 27 it is important to elucidate whether naturally occurring deamidation has any impact on the immunogenicity of rAAV. In this study, we explored the immunological consequences of rAAV deamidation. HLA bindings and T cell reactivity to AAV9-derived peptides that were deamidated or non-deamidated (wild type [WT]) was compared using HLA molecules and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Among multiple donors, two of the four NG sites in AAV9 contain CD4 T cell epitopes with a Th1 cytokine pattern. Some PBMC samples had differential T cell activation to deamidated or WT epitopes. This differential response was also observed in peptides derived from other AAV serotypes and was highly impacted by the HLA makeup of the individual. HLA binding assays confirmed the preferential binding of the deamidated or WT peptides to some HLA molecules, including HLA class II DRB1*03:01 and DRB3*02:02. These results indicate that naturally occurring deamidation can significantly affect the immunogenicity of rAAV gene-therapy products.",

In order to identify deamidation sites in the AAV9 capsid and compare the magnitude of deamidation among the capsid subunits as well as among lots stored for different lengths of time, three lots of purified rAAV9 were produced. Intact viral capsid was denatured and separated by gel electrophoresis 11, 25, and 83 days after purification ( Figure 1A ). Gel bands were excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. Tryptic peptides were extracted from the gels, filtered, and analyzed for deamidation by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Figure 1B shows a total of four distinct major deamidation sites within VP1, with more than 30% deamidation observed in AAV9 capsids that were produced 25 days prior. This deamidation rate was decreased in rAAV produced 11 days prior and was increased an additional 2-fold in rAAV produced 83 days prior. These four sites also coincide with NG sites in AAV9 VP2 and VP3 proteins. No other major differences in these deamidation sites were observed in the common amino acids among VP1, VP2, and VP3. Of note, N57 and N94 are only present in VP1, which has a longer sequence than VP2 and VP3. These data suggest that there is a correlation between the level of deamidation and the time elapsed since the production of the AAV product.",

To start, 27 HLA class I and 27 HLA class II alleles, representing the most common specificities in the human population and commonly shared binding specificities (i.e., supertypes), 28, 29 were submitted for binding prediction to the IEDB, and the percentile rank of each peptide to each allele was recorded. A peptide was considered as an immunodominant promiscuous binder if more than six alleles showed the upper first percentile of binding strength in HLA class I and five alleles showed the upper 10 th percentile of binding strength in HLA class II predictions (Figures 2A and 2C, red) . This analysis respectively identified 14 and 9 class I and class II potential binders. The majority of the binders were predicted in the VP3 region of AAV9 that is common to VP1, VP2, and VP3, 30 with only two class-I-predicted binders and no class-II-predicted binders in the VP1 unique sequence.",

The prediction score for a peptide-allele pair is given in terms of the percentile rank of the predicted binding strength of 9-mer or 15-mer peptides with or without deamidation. Thus, there were 9 or 15 possible deamidated peptides in which asparagine was converted to aspartic acid. Examples of variant sequences are shown in Figure S1 . Figures 2B and 2D show the minimum percentile rank among the 9 or 15 possible deamidated peptides for each allele. HLA class II binding prediction showed promiscuous and differential predicted binding to WT and deamidated peptides. Major class II binding was observed in peptides surrounding N329 and N452 and their deamidated forms. Both were predicted to be most promiscuous for HLA-DRB alleles, with 12 and 11 alleles of the 27 predicted alleles to bind <10% to N452 and N452D, respectively. Interestingly, N512 was predicted to bind with <10% to only two alleles, while the deami-dated form N512D was predicted to bind with <10% to six alleles (Figure 2D ). Four alleles (HLA-DRB1*03:01, HLA-DRB3*01:01, HLA-DQA1*01:01/DQB1*05:01, and HLA-DQA1*05:01/DQB1*02:01) had a striking decrease in percentile rank, which indicates increased binding to N512D compared with N512 from 26%, 39%, 13%, and 19%-3.8%, 3.5%, 3.9%, and 9.7%, respectively. One allele, HLA-DRB3*02:02, showed a converse trend with higher binding to WT N512 (1.5%) predicted than to deamidated peptide (5%).",

However, differential binding that may result in high-affinity presentation of WT or deamidated peptides was observed in HLA- To confirm the binding affinity experimentally and examine the impact of isoaspartic acid on the binding, four sets of 9-mer and four sets of 20-mer peptides were synthesized. Each set includes a WT and two deamidated peptides (aspartic acid or isoaspartic acid forms). The sequences and purity of peptides are shown in Table  S1 . The binding affinities of 9-mer peptides to 12 HLA class I and 20-mer peptides to 12 HLA class II were assessed by comparing the peptide-MHC complex stability to that of positive control peptides. Figures 3A and 3B show that some HLA class I presentation molecules, such as HLA-A*02:03 and HLA-B*15:01, and class II molecules, such as HLA-DRB1*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01, bind with higher stability to WT peptides. On the other hand, other HLA class I presentation molecules, such as HLA-A*02:01, HLA-B*44:02, and HLA-B*44:03, and class II presentation molecules, such as HLA-DRB1*03:01 and HLA-DRB3*02:02, show preferred binding to the deamidated N512 peptides. Most parts of these data were correlated with our in silico prediction. For example, HLA-A*02:03 had very strong binding to WT peptides N452 and N512 but weak binding to the deamidated peptides. Conversely, HLA-DRB1*03:01 had no binding to the WT N512 peptide but had very strong binding to the deamidated peptide. Of note, no major binding was observed between any HLA and peptides that contained isoaspartic acid when compared with the blank control (p > 0.05). These in silico predictions and experimental binding data implicate that deamidation could increase or decrease T cell activation.",

To phenotype the cellular subsets involved in the immune response to the peptides at the deamidation site, expanded PBMCs were restimulated with the four WT peptides for 24 h, followed by flow cytometry analysis. Measured IL-2, IFN-g, and TNF-a secretion in CD4 T cell, CD8 T cell, gd T cell, and natural killer (NK) cell subsets is shown in Figure S3 . Figures 5A-5D show a representative response of one donor after restimulation with peptide N452. In agreement with the ELISpot results, we found that peptide N452 triggered cells to produce cytokines (Figure 5A ). To identify the cells that were responding to peptide stimulation and producing cytokines, the absolute number of each subset after gating on the cytokinesecreting cells was analyzed. Figures 5B-5D demonstrate that the number of cytokine-producing CD4 T cells was significantly increased by peptide stimulation. Similar CD4-mediated responses against peptide stimulation by other peptides with several additional donors were further confirmed ( Figure S4 ). In addition, multiparametric analysis permitted the precise characterization of this CD4 T cell subset as that of CCR7 \u00c0 CD45RA \u00c0 effector memory (EM) cells ( Figures 5E-5G) . 31 This suggests that T cells that were activated are almost exclusively CD4 EM cells.",

We further investigated whether the deamidation of other NG sites impacts the immune response against AAV. Binding affinities of peptides at seven NG sites derived from other serotypes for 27 recommended HLA class I or class II alleles were predicted using the IEDB analysis tool. Peptides with N264, N383, N540, N546, and N718 regions were predicted to be strong binders (the upper first percentile), with at least four different HLA class I alleles ( Figure S8 ). In addition, peptides in the N383 and N540 regions were predicted to strongly bind with HLA class II alleles ( Figure S9 ). Peptides were then synthe-sized with either WT or deamidated forms (Table S5) , and HLA binding stability of the peptides to 12 HLA class I and 12 HLA class II was assessed. Figure S10 displays that some WT peptides strongly bind to HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:03, HLA-A*23:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*15:01, HLA-DRB3*01:01, and HLA-DRB3*02:02, while some deamidated peptides preferentially bind to HLA-B*44:02. Specific T cell responses to particular peptides were measured using IL-2 and IFN-g secretion ELISpot assays with PBMCs from four healthy individuals. The immune responses against peptides at the deamidation sites in other AAV serotypes were similar to those of AAV9. N718 peptide, derived from AAV1 and AAV6, had a decreased IL-2 response after stimulation with WT N718 peptide, but not with deamidated N718D peptide. Whereas 20-mer peptides at the N540 region derived from AAV8 displayed enhancement of IL-2 secretion, stimulation with deamidated peptides resulted in much lower secretion ( Figure S11 ).

The choice of alleles was determined by binding core coverage and MHC molecule availability. 28, 29 Indeed, the HLA binding assays corroborated several of the in silico predictions. For example, peptide N452 was predicted to bind with high affinity to most HLA class II DR alleles, but not to most HLA class I. More specifically, only HLA class I A*02:03 was predicted to bind with ranking of <1%. In vitro HLA binding showed a very similar result in that 9/12 of HLA class II DR alleles had >40% binding to class II but only a single HLA class I allele.",

This shares a similar concept with the known predisposition of individuals with HLA haplotypes DQ2 and DQ8 (HLA-DQB1*02:02 and DQB1*03:02) to develop celiac disease as a response to deamidated Gln in gliadins from dietary wheat gluten. Mapping of the immunodominant T cell epitopes in complex with HLA DQ2 and DQ8 revealed that the deamidated Gln residues induce strong binding of the peptides by acting as high-affinity anchors. 16, 40 In addition, very few responses were observed after stimulation with peptides that contained isoaspartic acid. This is consistent with the notion that many non-natural amino acids have diminished binding to MHC molecules. 41, 42 Immune-mediated liver toxicities are a major concern during AAV gene therapy clinical trials. 7, 43, 44 To monitor AAV-targeting T cells that are associated with these liver toxicities, many investigators use cellular T cell activation assays. 45 These assays often involve PBMCs isolated from patients' blood, followed by restimulation of the cells with overlapping peptides that span the entire AAV VP1 amino acid sequence. 46, 47 Our findings, however, suggest that some individuals responded to the deamidated peptides, but not to the WT peptides. The absence of deaminated peptides in these cellular T cell activation assays could result in a potential failure to detect critical and relevant immune response in these individuals.",

After 24 h of refolding, the refolded MHC complexes were transferred to a microplate and stressed with 4 M urea. After 3 h, the plates were developed as a conventional ELISA with a conformational specific antibody. In each plate, a reference peptide was used. This peptide is known to bind with high stability to the given allele and was used as a 100% reference. Hence, peptides that gave the same signal in the ELISA as the reference peptide were given a stability of 100%. The MHC II assay was carried out in the same manner. The only difference was that b2m was omitted and both the alpha and biotinylated beta chains were urea denatured and diluted to nanomolar concentrations in refolding buffer containing 2 mM peptide. Final concentrations of b2m, MHC I heavy chain, and MHC II alpha and beta chains were carefully adjusted to ensure the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio between samples with peptide and no peptide. For MHC II, a mixture of hemagglutinin (HA) 306-318, CLIP, and PADRE (YKYVKQNTLKLAT, PVSKMRMATPLLMQ, and AKFVAAWTLKAAA) were used as reference peptides.",
