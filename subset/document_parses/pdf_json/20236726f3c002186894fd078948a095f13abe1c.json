Earliest recommendation to prevent the spread of SARS-nCOV-2, as with previous contagious pathogens, was frequent and effective hand hygiene practices. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines 4 for maintaining hand hygiene is frequent hand wash using soap and water for at least 20 s especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one's nose. When soap and water are not available, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends sanitizing non-visibly soiled hands with an alcoholbased hand sanitizer (ABHS) containing 80% v/v ethanol or 75% v/v isopropanol. ABHS is widely considered to be effective to reduce or eliminate bacterial/viral load, but with variable compliance rates. 5 The alcohols-ethanol, isopropanol, and n-propanol-as used for disinfection are commonly applied in the form of hand rub rinses, gels, and foams.",

The change in moisture content was not observed as the SC layer is known to act as \"responding membrane\"33 and the body supplies more water from deeper skin layers as the concentration in SC goes down. The biological markers from tape stripping suggest a significant increase in protein content which is a marker of loosened skin integrity and a significant increase in cytokine marker which suggests higher degree of inflammation. All these instrumental measurements on the skin of human subjects re-validates the deleterious effect of repeated alcohol exposure to the skin. Coconut oil is known to act on the skin via predominantly three mechanisms: (1) Occlusive Layer formation 34 as the reinforced first line of defense against external aggressors like water, surfactant, and alcohol; (2) Internal Occlusion of the penetrated oil-that is, coating of the skin from inside 35 -help avoid the loss of moisture and adds to the resistance from external aggressors; and (3) Penetration inside the skin and strengthening the lipids bilayer which is proven asincreased resistance to alter the lipid packing structure from orthorhombic to hexagonal.36 As it can be seen from the present study, the pre-application of virgin coconut oil on skin helps (1) maintain the transepidermal water loss, (2) maintain the moisture levels, (3) keeps in check the protein content from tape stripping, and (4) manages the cytokine content at the original levels.

WHO Skin Self-Assessment Scale 26 was used as the objective metric for recording the changes at the end of 15 days intervention period. A significant reduction (\u221211.8%) in moisture content was observed in the group with only the ABHS application while a significant positive shift (+15.4%) was recorded for the group with overnight VCO application. For appearance, intactness, and sensation, the shift was not significant. Further, the self-assessment ratings for subjective hand feel parameters-like soft, supple, moisturized, protection, and safety-also exhibited a positive shift for all the subjects using VCO as overnight treatment. VCO application, as seen from the instrumental studies, helped reinforce the skin barrier against the harmful effects of ethanol penetration and thus, maintained skin barrier integrity both from inside and outside. The protective benefits of VCO regular application were confirmed in the statements ratified by the consumers which refers to VCO usage as remedy for dry hands, deep care, deep nourishment, overnight repair, overnight pampering of hands, protection for next day sanitization, etc. Perceptive assessment of the duration of protection was also included in the questionnaire. The subjects rated the VCO protection duration ranging from 2 to 24 h with an average protection of around 11 h. Coconut oil skin protection mechanism of penetrating the stratum corneum and strengthening the skin lipids was also investigated in vivo using FTIR, inspired by similar studies in the past on the effect of ethanol on SC. 38,39 An exaggerated protocol of applying ethanol on the lower portion of palm and keeping it wrapped with cotton gauge for 15 min was administered to cause exaggerated damage to SC in terms of leaching out of lipids by alcohol.
