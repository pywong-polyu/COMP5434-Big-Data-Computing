The most common investigational diagnostics of this disease are RT-PCR and serology testing. The objective of this work was to validate two commercial kits for the detection of IgM and IgG using lateral flow immunoassay tests and to study the effect of the combination of both serology kits for better detection of immunoglobulins. A total of 195 patients presenting with respiratory symptoms suggestive of infection with SARS-Cov-2 were subject to serology and molecular testing. Two lateral flow immunochromatographic assay kits were used: the Healgen Scientific for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and the Raybiotech for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. Sensitivity and specificity of each kit alone and in combination were determined and compared. The limit of detection, inter and intra test variations, as well interfering substances and cross reactivity were also studied for both kits. The results show sensitivities for IgM detection varying between 58.9 and 66.2% for the kits alone and 87.7% of the combination of both kits. IgG detection was not significantly affected by this combination. Both kits manifested high specificities (99.2-100%). Both kits showed high clinical performance in terms of cross reactivity and interfering substances. Our results suggest using combinatory testing for the serology of COVID-19 after a full evaluation study, assessing all the parameters affecting their clinical performance before deciding on this combination.",

            "text": "PCR testing only helps determine whether a person has an active infection at the time of testing (Tahamtan and Ardebili, 2020) . Unfortunately, it does not help determine who had an infection in the past. It also does not help determine which people who have been exposed to COVID-19 will develop active infection during the two weeks after exposure. In some people, the virus can only be found by PCR for a few days at the beginning of the infection, so the test might not find the virus if the swab is taken more than a few days after the illness starts. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) testing of SARS-Cov-2 (IgM/IgG) is intended for use as a screening test helping in the identification and diagnosis of human subjects who developed antibodies as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure. Any reactive specimen with the IgM-SARS-Cov-2 or IgG-SARS-Cov-2 must be confirmed with alternative testing method(s). It is not yet confirmed if the antibodies produced during this infection will be enough to yield immunity and whether this immunity is long or short. The serology testing should not be used alone to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in blood a few days after the infection. The production of IgM typically happens 3-5 days post infection, IgG of course are produced at a later stage; this is known as seroconversion. Negative results do not exclude the possibility of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this reason, the combination of both serologic and molecular testing to detect the virus is necessary. Cross reactivity of IgM and/or IgG may occur as a result of a previous exposure to other SARS viruses. The serology testing of SARS-CoV-2 (IgM/IgG) is currently permitted only for use under the Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization (EUA) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019ncov/cases-in-us.html).",

            "text": "The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been ongoing since the end of 2019. Unfortunately, in the absence of a successful vaccine and a standard efficient treatment, this virus remains invincible in many ways. Lockdown of societies and prevention measures only hope to contain the transmission of the disease until further notice. In this context, massive testing remains a good strategy to identify carriers of the virus. In view of the shortage of material and resources, RT-PCR tests should be part of the algorithm of testing and not the only test. Serology tests investigating the development of IgG and IgM in patients who have been potentially infected is another good addition to the algorithm. Unfortunately, many parameters including the onset of the disease, incubation period, symptomatology, and immunity status of the patient put some limitations on these serological tests regarding their sensitivity and specificity (Haveri et al., 2020) . A negative IgM, negative IgG test can be interpreted as no evidence of an increase in human IgM and IgG production against SARS-CoV-2. This negative or non-reactive result might indicate a state of no infection or an incubation period of the virus. In the case of suspicious exposure, the patient should be advised to repeat the test in 7-10 days (Pal et al., 2020) . A negative result can also be due to a delayed immune response by the patient. A test showing positive IgM and negative or non-reactive IgG can indicate an early stage of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The absence of IgG indicates that the patient had not developed acquired immunity yet. A positive IgM and IgG result suggests either an active or an early recovery stage of the infection with SARS-CoV-2. A negative IgM and positive IgG generally indicates a late stage or a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that an acquired immunity has developed to the virus.",

IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 generally become positive (detectable in serum) between day 5 and 7 following infection but may occur later. This is the same for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 that generally become detectable 10-14 days following infection (Huang et al., 2020) .",

As well as any other testing, the sensitivity and specificity of paper-based assays determines their performance (Tan et al., 1999) . Sensitivity assesses and measures the ability of the test to correctly detect the target-substrate. In this context, it is very important to determine the limit of detection (LoD) which can directly affect positively or negatively the sensitivity of the test in question (Wang et al., 2013; Farka et al., 2017) . The LoD corresponds to the lowest concentration associated with a positive detectable signal. Several parameters can influence the LoD, such as the affinity of the antigen and antibody, as well as the physical properties of these molecules. In addition, the paper substrate properties, number, printed detector molecules, immunoprobe stability, readout method, and competition with free target molecules are all parameters that can influence the quality of the lateral flow immunochromatography test.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the specificity of a technique relates to the probability of yielding a false positive result. Similar to sensitivity, it is defined by many parameters and factors including the cross-reactivity and nonspecific binding to the immunoprobe. On the other hand, fluidic properties of the paper strip as well as sample preparation are important parameters affecting paper assay performance (Hristov et al., 2019) . It is expected that different manufacturers will produce different products with different performances. When two tests are used for the same sample, there is the possibility of agreement or disagreement on the result. While agreement between tests is considered to \"dramatically improve the predictive value of a testing program, particularly in low prevalence environments\" (Blueprint for testing plans and rapid response programs-partnering with states to put America back to work https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/ 04/Testing-Blueprint.pdf), the disagreement can also be used to dramatically improve the agreement of LFIA with RT-PCT tests, as shown in our paper. This effect has been significantly high with IgM (Tables 3-8 ) and was insignificant with IgG. Our results suggest that in view of the differences in material and production, and in view of the high specificity of immunoglobulin detection (yielding low levels of false positive results), it is to our advantage to use more than one kit for the detection of immunoglobulins and consider the positive result where the disagreement occurs. The reason why this is true for IgM and not for IgG might be due to the high specificity, smaller size, and higher number of IgGs as compared to IgMs. In any case, the combination of more than one kit should be only advised if this is confirmed by method evaluation and validation.",
