            "text": "While a central focus of current COVID-19 prevention is the promotion of social distancing, differences in people's abilities to socially distance may contribute to COVID-19 health disparities. Mobility measures from mobile phones suggest that high-income areas dramatically decreased their mobility in March and April of 2020 in response to stay-at-home measures whereas the poorest areas showed an increase in mobility. 7 This mobility discrepancy may partially be due to individuals in lower paying jobs being more likely to work outside of their home. 8 Additionally, people in lower paying jobs are also more likely to have high levels of in-person interaction in their jobs 9 and less likely to work in jobs that provide personal protective equipment (PPE) 10 or labor protections such as paid sick leave. 11 The relationship between different workplace conditions and health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic may have similarities with the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009. It was estimated that 8 million working individuals who were infected with H1N1 did not take any time off work, resulting in H1N1 transmission to up to 7 million coworkers. 12 Higher incidence of H1N1 was reported among individuals who did not have paid sick leave. 13 The risk of disease transmission in the workplace suggests that workplaces and labor protections should be central to COVID-19 response plans. 14 Labor protections are particularly minimal in the United States (US) overall and in particular for lower wage workers, contributing to their economic fragility. The United States is one of the few highly developed countries without a national paid sick leave policy. 15 For example, only 51% of workers in the bottom quartile of the wage distribution have paid sick days compared with 92% in the top quartile. Similarly, only 62% of service workers have paid sick leave compared with more than 91% of workers in management and professional occupations. 16 The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCA) was implemented on April 1, 2020 and was intended to temporarily cover the employer's cost of paid sick leave for employees who get COVID-19. The law, however, does not include companies with more than 500 employees and small companies can claim exemptions. 17 Conservative estimates suggest that only 47% of private sector workers are covered under this law. 18 Due to lack of worker legal protections and the current economic crisis, many individuals who do have paid sick leave may still not choose to take sick days out of fear of losing their job and the anticipated challenge of finding a new job, especially in a climate of high unemployment rates. 19 The implications of job loss or income loss are severe for many individuals in the United States with 40% of adults reporting that they cannot afford an unexpected expense of $400. 20 Using a best practices approach to crowdsourcing, we assessed what socioeconomic factors were associated with an individual reporting an intention to still go to work when they felt sick from COVID-19. We hypothesized that working while sick may be one pathway leading to the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 among low-income communities and communities of color.",

Additionally, individuals needed to have a 97% or higher approval rate and have completed at least 100 MTurk tasks. To increase reliability, attention and validity checks were embedded throughout the survey. 23 We repeated questions to ensure consistency and included survey questions that had very low probability, such as the frequency of deep-sea fishing in Alaska and the number of appendages removed. We also reviewed the amount of time for completing the survey and the completeness of the data. Individuals who failed these checks were not included in the analysis.",

To address increased food insecurity, the FFCA increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for adults without children, added benefits to adjust for children no longer receiving free or reduced school lunch, and allowed states to increase individual's benefits to the maximum benefit level. 17 While these provisions may have mitigated food security issues to some extent, these provisions are temporary, do not apply to those ineligible for SNAP, and don't increase benefits for those already receiving maximum benefits who are likely in greatest need of additional support.

Sustainable and systemic solutions that guarantee paid sick leave beyond the COVID-19 pandemic will increase preparation for a future health crisis and provide protection for other infectious disease outbreaks. Especially in times of financial crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a hybrid model of employer mandates and federal government coverage for paid sick leave may be pertinent in order to reduce the financial burden on individual employers, as demonstrated by hybrid guaranteed sick leave policies in many European countries such as Norway and Spain. 15 One limitation of this analysis is that the study population was majority non-Hispanic white, preventing detailed analyses of racial differences within and between levels of socioeconomic status. While this is typical in other crowdsourcing samples, 21 understanding the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities in COVID-19 is crucial to effective COVID-19 policymaking. Additionally, the outcome assessed is a subjective measure of an intention to still work when sick from COVID-19 due to financial strain. Future research should assess documentation of continued work after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Further, we relied on self report to define the study population as individuals working outside of their home, and we classified occupational and essential worker categories manually. Individuals may have been misclassified. We followed best practices guidelines for data collection to enhance the survey validity and included validity checks in the survey, but it is possible that survey questions were answered inattentively and are subject to social desirability bias, compromising internal validity. There is no indication however, that MTurk participants are more likely to engage in disingenuous behavior than other convenience sample participants. 39 This analysis demonstrates that worrying about food may be linked to individuals continuing to work when sick from COVID-19. This finding suggests a need for improved quality, coverage, and access to federal benefits around food access and paid sick leave, and increased worker protections to reduce COVID-19 transmission and health disparities. While these specific policies are most important during active COVID-19 transmission, maintaining expanded labor protection policies beyond the COVID-19 pandemic will prevent workplace transmission of other infectious diseases and begin to address some of the fundamental causes of current racial and socioeconomic health disparities in other chronic and infectious diseases. Further research is needed to understand how individuals of low socioeconomic status and of color may experience compounding structural barriers to adhere to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines. Research into the current use of expanded social and workplace benefits and barriers to their use would improve the reach of these policies and the likelihood that those in greatest need are aware and able to access them.",
