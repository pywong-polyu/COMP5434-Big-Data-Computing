Cluster sampling method was used and 193 medical team members were engaged. Eysenck personality questionnaire, symptom checklist-90 and self-made scale were used to evaluate the medical team members' personality, mental health level, personal protection and risk of infection. The levels of personal protection and risk of infection may have an influence on medical team members' mental health. Medical team members with low personal protection may more likely to be obsessive-compulsive (t = 3.20, P < 0.01), anxiety (t = 2.00, P < 0.05). Medical team members with high risk of infection may have multiple types of mental problems. Medical team members with higher introversion, higher psychoticism and neuroticism characteristics were more likely to be in low level of mental health. These results could help us to find out the target population of mental protection before military operations other than war.",

Except battlefield medical treatment during war, aviation medical team would also play an important role in military operations other than war, such as medical assistance after the disaster and control of major epidemic diseases. In fact, the military medical team always is the premier emergency rescue force deployed to the frontline [1, 2] . Due to the strike of disasters and unpredictable security risk, stress reaction would happen to medical team members, which may in turn induce negative emotion such as anxiety, depression and fear. To some extent, the continuous stress event may induce serious psychological problems and mental diseases among medical team members during performing military operations other than war [3] . In order to sustain medical team members' working performance in a normal level, mental health service during the mission period is of great importance. Additionally, psychological screening before mission is indispensable. Using psychological scales, to investigate the mental health levels and influence factors among medical team members could help to identify the person with overstress reactions. The target of mental health service would emerge and the direction of mental protection would then show. These quantitative data could help to maintain medical team members' mental health and normal performance.",

The questionnaire was based on personality type theory, included four dimensions as introversion-extroversion, psychoticism, neuroticism and validity. There were 88 items, participants required to rank whether the symptom described in each item was occurred on him. The version of the questionnaire used in the current study was adult version, which had been confirmed to have high reliability and validity in previous study by other researchers. Symptom checklist-90 was developed by L. R. Derogatis in 1975 and included 90 items [5] . There were nine factors, such as somatizaiton (SOM), obsessive-compulsive (OBS), inter-personal sensitivity (INT), depression (DEP), anxiety (ANX), hostility (HOS), phobic anxiety (PHOB), paranoid ideation (PAR) and psychoticism (PSY). Participants required to rank the level of their symptoms in the lasted week from 1 to 5 point. 1 refers to none, 2 refers to mild, 3 refers to medium, 4 refers to mild severity and 5 refers to great severity. The global severity index (GSI) \u2265 160, positive symptom total (PST) \u2265 43 or any of the nine factors \u2265 2, and then the participant's result is positive, which mean his mental health level is low. Previous study had indicated SCL-90 got a high reliability and validity [6] . Additionally, self-made scale was used to evaluate the medical team members' personal protection and risk of infection.",
