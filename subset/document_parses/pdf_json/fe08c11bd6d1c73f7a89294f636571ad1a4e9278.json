So, it is possible to diagnose lung infection using imaging techniques. Although a chest computed tomography (CT) scan has been shown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis, chest X-ray is more widely available across the hospitals due to its considerably lower cost and faster imaging time than CT scan. The advancements in the area of machine learning and pattern recognition has resulted in intelligent systems that analyze CT Scans or X-ray images and classify between pneumonia and normal patients. This paper proposes KE Sieve Neural Network architecture, which helps in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. This architecture is achieving an accuracy of 98.49%. This noninvasive prediction method can assist the doctors in this pandemic and reduce the stress on health care systems.",

It has been declared as a pandemic by WHO [11] . The rapid escalation of COVID-19 virus with 2,397,216 confirmed cases and 162,956 confirmed deaths covering 213 countries, areas or territories, (As on 21 April 2020, 2:00 AM CEST) [12] is presenting a huge challenge to the governments across the world, as new cases are being emerged and many new hotspots are evolving on daily basis. 1 -ALPES.ai 2 -Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sreenidhi Institute Of Science and Technology * This paper has been initially uploaded to ResearchGate Preprint Server DOI: 10.13140/RG. 2.2.19689.44645 According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), \"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.\" [9] . This COVID-19 is also called the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [7] [18]. Coronaviruses (CoV) belongs to a family of viruses that cause colds such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). This COVID-19 virus is new to human beings and has not been previously identified in humankind. It is said that this virus outbreak is due to the contamination of the virus from animals to humans [8] . According to studies, [8] [9] the SARS-CoV virus is contaminated from musk cats to humans, and the MERS-CoV virus is contaminated from camels to humans. But, the COVID-19 virus is presumed to be contaminated from bats to humans [9] . The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or through cough and sneezing [9] . This led to the transmission of the virus from person to person and caused the rapid spread of the epidemic and had become a pandemic. In this war against COVID-19, all the countries have united together and are fighting against the pandemic. But, this is never about winning at this war, it is about survival. Survival of mankind on earth.",

There are many more such countries with low testing rates [19] . But it is essential to increase the testing rate to curb the spread of COVID-19. [15] . Also, some of the eye-opening statistics of India are that 67 percent of the Indian population resides in rural areas and 90 percent of medical imaging facilities are in cities, That makes only 10 percent of imaging facilities spread across small towns in the country [28] .",

To draw the initial planes, collect the random data point pairs of size dimension (n) and substitute them in the above equation (1). 5. Now, a new plane is drawn in 'S' space by passing through the midpoints of each and every neighbor pair that was collected above. This new single plane is sufficient to separate all the neighbors in 'S' space. 6 . Also, whenever a new plane is added, orientation vectors (OV) of all the existing points in 'S' space are also updated with respect to new hyperplane generated and this process is continued until each and every training point is covered. This ends the process of training the classifier. This is the only algorithm [1] which has the advantage of incremental learning. That is, if the new points are given for training, the algorithm starts separating these points from where it has previously stopped and OV gets updated accordingly. There is no need to retrain the whole model.",
