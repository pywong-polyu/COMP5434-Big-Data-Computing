Additionally, mitigation strategies such as monitoring for symptoms, social distancing, safer at home, and the wearing of masks caused our institution to implement significant operational changes to our usual practice. This included screening patients and staff for symptoms, rescheduling routine medical visits, postponing procedures, converting face-to-face visits to telephone or video visits, and changing visitor visit policies.

Staff from XTEC recognized that care providers had empathy for their patients, but communicating that sense of empathy back to the patient was often lacking. In response, XTEC created 60-to 90-minute face-to-face training sessions with a 6-month sustainment curriculum customized to the various roles across our institution. The cognitive component of empathy is perspective-taking (3), and this was paired with contrasting courtesy and empathy and empathic reflective listening statements. Reflective listening involves mindfully paying attention to what the communicator feels and believes, so that an empathic reflective response can be formulated, allowing the speaker to feel understood. The efforts that began in 2016 laid the foundation for our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In most situations, we recommend a legitimization statement such as \"anyone in your situation would feel the same way\" to follow.

Our institution set up a Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) to oversee COVID-19 efforts. All of the resources our unit created were vetted through HICS. We created a template with consistent components that incorporated key messages, tips, and scripting language for each request. The consistency and continuity of utilizing the template allowed HICS to quickly recognize that the initiatives were coming from XTEC. Our response time to get final documents to HICS was less than 24 hours for each request from various units. Finally, it was vital to have a very structured tracking process. We met daily to debrief learnings, track requests, and craft a summary report to senior leadership.",

Another opportunity we identified was to have resources posted to our institution's internal COVID-19 website, which was the point of information sharing for all things COVID-19 related. Often the resources developed were not easily accessible or were not able to be posted to the website at all because of competing priorities. The final opportunity was our lack of ability to track how often our scripts were utilized.
