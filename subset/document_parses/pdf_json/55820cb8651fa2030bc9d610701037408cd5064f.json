The exposure variable was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic evaluated in different ways. Two time points were used: (a) the period of the first case described in Brazil (February 2020) and (b) the period of exponential growth (April). Also, months within the exponential growth (April and May) were compared with the respective months in 2019. The results of exponential growth were stratified by Brazilian Regions are as follow: South, Southeast, Central-west, North, and Northeast. Due to data overdispersion, a multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial regression was used to analyse the longitudinal associations between the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of dental procedures. Analyses were performed using the STATA 16.0 software (https://www.stata.com).",

This reduction was similarly observed in all procedures, and these results are consequence of social isolation, quarantine, and health and sanitary recommendations to reduce the activities in dental care, in order to avoid the disease contamination. 3 Even though children have low risk of death due to COVID-19, considering the unspecific and milder symptoms in children, and considering the wide period of incubation (from 2 to 14 days), child patients and parents should be considered as possible SARS-CoV-2 carriers. 4 Although the decrease was significant considering the beginning of pandemic, when the pandemic started to grow exponentially the treatments reduction was dramatic. When comparing the months of April and May, when the pandemic was spreading out of control, to the same months of last year, the observed decrease in paediatric procedures was even more remarkable. Also, the decrease in paediatric treatments was different among Brazilian regions, with a higher reduction in the Southeast Region, which is the country's richer region, with more working dentists and one of the region's most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

January 2019 to May 2020 to better oral health in Brazil was the inclusion of dentistry in the Public National System and the dental care coverage being expanded to the entire country. 1 Indeed, the negative impact of the pandemic could compromise the maintenance of the good results observed over the past decade. 7 Therefore, efforts to reduce the pandemic's negative impact in child oral health should be emphasized, such as the tele-dentistry for primary health care, 8 which could be adapted for preventive approaches. A recent National online survey demonstrated that dentists in the whole country have significantly reduced their time in clinical practices, reducing the number of patients cared in daily basis and mostly relying in urgency and emergency care. The reduction was significantly higher for dentists working in public dental services than in private dental clinics. 3 Yet, dental urgencies still require clinical care and, for that, considering the high risk incurred by the dental office, dentists should adopt rigid infection control procedures and favour the use of minimally invasive approaches, specially avoiding the use of equipment that generates aerosol, which increases the potential for contamination. 9-11 A survey carried out with Brazilian dentists showed that they are incorporating new protective equipment in their routines and relying on health organizations and professional associations on how to effectively prevent the contamination. 3 Despite precautions must be taken during the pandemic, the maintenance of children oral care is essential, especially considering the occurrence of dental pain and it's negative impact in the children oral health-related quality of life. 12 Public policymakers should strongly consider to coordinate children oral care within the Public Health Systems, with the adequate and needed protection, at least for urgency and emergency care, as children on SUS are those with the higher burden of dental diseases 13, 14 and also more vulnerable to the effects of pandemics. This situation is alarming once the Pandemic in Brazil has already claimed more than 120 000 lives, with the country experiencing more than 1000 deaths/daily in the past 2 months 2 and there is no signal of relief in the near future.",
