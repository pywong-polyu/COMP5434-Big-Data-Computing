Many patients report low health-related quality of life comparable to that of other disabling chronic health conditions such as congestive heart failure. 3 In turn, healthcare providers caring for individuals with POTS often find themselves with insufficient time and financial resources to support these often high-need individuals.",

The workshop consisted of 4 hour-long sessions created and presented by a partnership of physicians and patients. Each session was structured as a 30-minute didactic PowerPoint presentation followed by a 30-minute community discussion. Participants had the option to remain anonymous and/or turn off video. The sessions were free to participants, easy to implement, and reproducible, with preprepared materials on each topic. We repeated the 4-part workshop twice with 10-15 patients in each group.",

Patients reported that they received a more thorough understanding of their illness, learned about clear action items that can be incorporated in their daily life to improve symptoms, felt empowered to make changes, and formed a community with other POTS patients with whom they could share struggles, tips, and successes. The provider responses were also overwhelmingly positive; they felt that smallgroup sessions were an effective and efficient way to educate patients about POTS. Providers also commented that they learned strategies from the participants that informed future patient care. Limitations included the small sample size, the homogeneity of the groups (composed primarily of young white females), and difficulty quantifying the subjective measurement of the impact of the intervention on health outcomes. Empowerment-based group education invites social interaction, peer support, and modeling, and has been shown to improve outcomes in chronic health conditions including diabetes. 4, 5 Extending this concept to the virtual platform allows greater accessibility to those with health conditions such as POTS that can be unpredictably disabling. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the virtual platform offered a welcoming, safe space to gather with peers and providers. The virtual workshop can be used on a small scale within practices to provide additional support to patients and/or on a larger scale through online support groups to distribute helpful information to the POTS community. It is a costeffective and efficient way for providers to educate and empower patients, while encouraging patients to learn from and support one another.",
