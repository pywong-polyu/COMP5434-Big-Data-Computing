            "text": "In the last two decades, the availability and the use of digital games has increased immensely [1, 2] . Especially for young people, gaming has become an attractive leisure activity. With a lack of alternative activities, the time spent gaming has significantly increased among adolescents under lockdown conditions in Germany [3] . Digital games are created to generate high user engagement and to address specific interests of children and adolescents [4] , such as discovering and creating new worlds, accomplishing complex tasks, and testing social roles in a virtual context [5] . However, intrapersonal and interpersonal risk factors can lead to an uncontrollable use of digital games that results in personal, social, and academic difficulties [6] . Adolescents are considered to be especially at risk, as their brain is still in the process of intense maturing and particularly vulnerable to external influences [4] . Accordingly, between 1.2% and 5.9% of adolescents in Europe, Asia, and Australia use digital games in an addictive manner [7] . A major step towards a uniformed and internationally agreed concept to describe problematic use patterns was taken by including criteria for internet gaming disorder (IGD) in the appendix of the Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 in 2013 [8] . Accordingly, an IGD is assumed if more than four out of nine criteria referring to gaming on the internet, or on any electronic device have been met in the past 12 months: (1) preoccupation with gaming, (2) withdrawal when not playing, (3) tolerance, (4) unsuccessful attempts to reduce or stop gaming, (5) giving up other activities, (6) continuation of gaming despite problems, (7) deceiving or covering up gaming, (8) gaming to escape adverse moods, and (9) risking or losing relationships or career opportunities due of excessive gaming. Furthermore, gaming disorder (GD) will be included in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) produced by the World Health Organization (WHO), as a new diagnosis coming into effect in January 2022 [9] .",

The co-treatment of comorbidities is rarely focused on [12] . Evaluation studies are usually based on a quantitative study design and have mainly been conducted in the Asian region. Within these, treatment effectiveness is often defined by a significant reduction of digital media use times and addictive symptoms [6] . Moreover, only very few randomized controlled trial studies exist [29] [30] [31] . In general, CBT has been shown to be an effective treatment [20, 21] . Alternative treatment programs, such as virtual reality therapy (VRT), might be considered effective regarding reduced problematic gaming symptoms but could not be shown to be superior to CBT [29] . Li and Wang [30] showed that CBT achieved significantly higher treatment effects than basic counseling on total Cognitive Distortions Scale (CDC) scores, all-or-nothing thinking scores, and online comfort scores. Marginally better treatment outcomes for CBT were found for short-term thinking scores. Nielsen et al. [31] showed that multidimensional family therapy (MDFT) keeps families in treatment with more success than family therapy as usual (FTAU). Treatment was completed in all MDFT cases and 70% of FTAU cases. However, a potential heterogeneity of CBT approaches regarding contents and settings, the lack of RCT studies, cultural sample differences, different underlying concepts of IGD, inconsistent use of instruments to measure the primary outcome, low case numbers, and/or high drop-out rates make it difficult to draw conclusions on the general effectivity of treatments and to derive recommendations for clinical practice.",

The CWEP is a 3-month theoretically based preventive and treatment program offered by a non-governmental organization for adolescents in Singapore which includes individual, family, and group elements covering time management, social support, and family-based strategies. According to the study results, counselors played an important role in dealing with gaming-related issues in individual, family, and group settings. For example, rolemodeling healthy video game habits, developing alternative activities, and addressing parental needs were seen as helpful.",

The patients were professionally introduced to the IGD group (setting and content) before and in more detail within the first session they attended. The IGD program was integrated in the regular local inpatient and day-clinic (partial inpatient) treatment for adolescents with substance-related and behavioral addictions and mental comorbidities. This included individual psychotherapy sessions (once to twice a week), psychopharmacological medication if indicated, weekly cross-disorder group psychotherapies (open-topic group, groups on emotion regulation and social competence), occupational and sports therapy, adjacent experiential and individual pedagogical offers, clinical school classes, family support by IGD-specific parental therapeutic groups, individual family therapy sessions, and social counselling.

The guidelines for the adolescents included 16 questions, which can be assigned to five main topics: 1. current state of knowledge about psychoeducational contents and individual pathological gaming pattern, 2. effective, helpful, and less helpful therapy contents, 3. suggestions for program alterations and additions, 4. general conditions of therapy (group setting, content presentation, task processing), 5. handling of homework. The guidelines for the expert interviews comprised 13 questions. They can be assigned to four categories, similar to those of the patients' interviews: 1. requirements for the participants and the leader of the therapy, 2. general conditions of the therapy, 3. effective and particularly demanding contents of the therapy, 4. form of presentation of the contents. The interview guides are attached in Appendices A and B. All interviews were carried out in German. Since the interviews took place during the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, they were held face-to-face in compliance with the hygiene guidelines or by telephone (with four patients). On average, an interview lasted 22 min (M = 21.6, min = 14, max = 30, SD = 5.1). The interviewer was a psychologist and not part of the treatment team of the patients. Before the interviews began, the interviewer gave a brief introduction explaining the general conditions of the study. This included the voluntary participation, content and aim of the study, the permission to record the interview for the transcript, and the anonymity of stored data. The interview guidelines were followed chronologically. In-depth questions were added if appropriate.",

Based on the initial category system developed, the first coding process of the entire material was carried out. Care was taken to ensure that each coding unit addressed only one category. Text passages that were ambiguous were excluded from the analysis and interpretation. The final differentiated category system was assigned to the coded text passages.

Problem awareness could be supported by helping patients to familiarize themselves with the diagnostic criteria of IGD and to consider which criterion applies to them. The vicious circle of IGD should help the participants to reflect on how the disorder emerged and persisted in their individual case. Regarding the most important psychoeducative contents, the experts mentioned the provision of information about long-term negative consequences of IGD and the explanation of gaming mechanisms that promote addiction. In addition, a therapeutic diary should be kept by the patients to encourage reflection on their usage times. The development of social competence was seen as especially important therapy content. According to the second expert, this could be practiced within the group setting. Moreover, patients' deficits in perceiving and dealing with negative emotions should be addressed. Control mechanisms, especially in dealing with craving, should also be focused on. Furthermore, building up alternative, non-digital activities to gaming were indicated as essential. In the last group therapy session, patients should be guided to reflect on the past therapy weeks to appreciate the progress they had achieved. Prevention strategies for possible relapses were also named as a relevant aspect to be considered within the last group session. Finally, a farewell ritual should complete the group therapy, as many digital games have no end and saying goodbye is a rare topic in patients' everyday life.",

Among adolescent patients, age is the first factor that needs to be considered. According to the WHO, adolescence covers [41] the period from 10 to 19 years. Different levels of maturity require different approaches in interaction and content presentation, as the experts interviewed emphasized. However, according to the professionals, different age groups provide the opportunity, e.g., for older adolescents to act as role models and take responsibility for the younger patients. Based on the patients' interviews, three core symptoms of IGD were highlighted: escaping stress and negative emotions, neglecting school and family obligations as well as other leisure activities, and losing control over gaming time. However, patients also described gaming as a safe place for trying out new roles and for experiencing positive peer interactions that cannot be obtained in real life. Two prominent aspects can be seen in the context of adolescent developmental tasks: identity formation and peer group integration. A recent prospective meta-analysis could identify problems in the attainment of developmental tasks including identity development and peer group membership to be associated with internalizing and externalizing psychological symptoms in a bidirectional way [42] . On the one hand, higher psychological symptoms predicted lower success and progress in the attainment of developmental tasks. On the other hand, failures with task attainment could be identified as risk factors for psychological symptoms. Hence, special attention should be paid to positive gaming experiences and adolescents' attempts to achieve developmental tasks in the digital world. Taken together, perceived negative consequences of gaming might enhance change motivation, while positive associations with gaming most likely reduce change motivation if no alternatives are provided. Paulus et al. [6] identified low self-esteem, social isolation with poor interpersonal relationships and few or no real-life friends, impaired social functioning, and limited offline leisure activities as risk factors for developing and perpetuating IGD. Moreover, each of the patients interviewed suffered from mental comorbidities (most frequently, affective disorders and ADHD). A significant rate of comorbid symptoms in a clinical sample of adolescents with IGD was also described by Torres-Rodr\u00edguez et al. [43] . At this stage of research, only the PIPATIC program by Torres-Rodr\u00edguez et al. has placed a deliberate focus on the co-treatment of comorbidities [12] and could be shown to be superior to standard CBT [13] . Concordant with this finding, the experts of the current interview study stressed the consideration of comorbidities in conducting the group therapy, as they influence the patients' abilities to follow group contents and to actively participate. Consequently, patients' individual characteristics and needs should be targeted with regard to the content and setting of an IGD group intervention.",

Furthermore, parents of affected adolescents should be actively involved in therapy [12, [26] [27] [28] . This is in line with international opinions on the inclusion of parents as an important treatment component to address IGD-associated negative family aspects [45] . The experts of the current study stated that involving parents in the therapeutic process can have a positive impact on symptom reduction in affected adolescents by different mechanisms. Thus, our results are consistent with the findings of Lo et al.'s qualitative study where interviewed experts described family involvement as challenging but essential for successful interventions for internet addiction, including IGD [33] . For this, parents must learn to set appropriate limits and expectations. Positive intrafamilial communications and interactions should be promoted for better family functioning. Besides this, another aspect that might deserve attention comes from individual CBT with anxious children [46] . It assumes that parents' therapy expectations influence therapy outcome in children and adolescents by modulating parental support and adherence. Moreover, an association between problematic family factors, such as parental psychopathologic burden and stress, and reduced active therapy participation of the child was assumed by the authors. Regular meetings with parents, in which adolescent group therapy contents are shared transparently and support offers are made, could be useful for this matter.",

The latter (e.g., achieved through mutual exchange between patients) was also identified as one out of three effective treatment factors by the patients. This is in line with findings from a review that used a systematic PubMed search to discuss factors for effective group CBT in depressive adolescents [24] . Accordingly, a successful treatment outcome is associated with the presence of peers as a source of feedback, role model, and practice partner in dealing with symptoms and improving social skills. As adolescents with IGD often show reduced social competence [6] , social skills training is a common component of IGD intervention programs and was defined as important by patients and experts. The experts also mention positive effects of interactive social skills training on therapy motivation in general. Together with a positive group atmosphere, this might make shy and socially insecure or anxious patients feel more comfortable in the group and trust their peers. This is the prerequisite for being able to be open, talk about difficulties, and try out new strategies. Correspondingly, most patients interviewed preferred a closed group setting rather than an open group setting in order to get to know and trust the other adolescents better. In (partial) inpatient settings this is often hard to realize.",

Furthermore, patients and experts mentioned feedback and rewards for success as desired factors to increase motivation. This reflects elements of classic CBT and might be realized by, e.g., verbal reinforcers and token programs for accomplished tasks including therapeutic homework and conscientious keeping of gaming or mood diaries. Homework was considered to be important for the repetition and consolidation of therapy content by the interviewed experts and previous therapy studies [28, 50] . By keeping a diary on mood, gaming and other activities, self-observation and self-awareness to gain situational control could be enhanced. However, since it requires special attention to problematic states and actions, building up of therapy adherence might be disturbed, especially within the first weeks [51] . This might be a reason why many patients of this interview study were not motivated to complete homework. Here, accompanying single individual therapy sessions (e.g., before the start of the group program, half the program, and after the last group session) might be beneficial. Moreover, inpatients reported that they would not see any benefit in completing the diary since their daily structure on the ward was highly structured and access to digital devices was limited. Hence, the form of the diary should be adapted to the individual situation, so that a personal benefit could be derived. In the view of the experts interviewed, identification with the group, reminders, therapeutic support, and rewards could support motivation and adherence. In their systematic review, Lee et al. [46] reported a moderate correlation between homework compliance and therapeutic relation in an individual CBT setting on anxiety disorders, as a further issue that might need to be considered.",

It can be assumed that participants who had been in the treatment for at least eight weeks were more experienced with the program, which might have led to a more elaborate reflection on it. Although inpatients and patients at the day clinic attended the same IGD program and comparable therapies in general, the biggest difference between both groups was the time spent at home during treatment. Consequently, the possibility to transfer therapy contents to the home environment varied significantly. Thus, day-clinic patients had to take more personal responsibility for their gaming behaviors, which might have led to different views on the relevance of program topics. The minimum patient's age was 12 and the majority of patients were 16 to 17 years old at the time of the treatment. Future studies should include a higher proportion of younger adolescents for a larger emphasis of their needs. As only one female patient was interviewed, the results were dominated by the experiences of male patients. The gender ratio for IGD patients is in line with the literature [53] , but future studies should include more girls.",

On the other hand, an environment can be built in which peers act as guided feedback providers, role models, and practice partners in dealing with symptoms, trying new functional behavior, and improving social skills. Potentially effective group intervention programs for adolescents with IGD should not only address up-to-date CBT-based therapy content (such as psychoeducation, daily structuring with alternative activities and reduced gaming times, emotion regulation and social skills training) and parental involvement. They also need to consider patient characteristics (including age and maturity, personal traits and comorbidities) as well as a functional group setting to create a motivating atmosphere in a safe, structured, appreciative, adaptable, and supportive environment.",
