Thus, demand of personal protective equipment continues to increase, consequently an increase in infectious equipment pollution. Most of these wastes threaten the environment and increase the spread of diseases. This paper provides a research hypothesis whether effective medical waste management would prevent the possible impacts of coronavirus disease 2019-related waste issues on environment at the city level. To confirm this hypothesis, installation of waste treatment centre is addressed. Then, by incorporating uncertain waste generation amounts utilizing Jimenez method, a pickup routing is addressed to decide the pickup routes between the waste treatment centre and residential area. This study is first to assign the optimistic, realistic and pessimistic scenarios of the uncertain waste generation using time series analysis method and waste generation formulation. Also, L-type matrix is used to define, assess and prioritize the environmental and operational risks on waste generation formulation and to provide risk reaction strategies. Practicality of these approaches is illustrated in the case of Turkey. The computational results reveal the effectiveness of the integrated method, which ensures practical and theoretical insights controlling the waste generation to prevent virus propagation for health authorities.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread across the globe; thus, mortality rates have been increased (WHO, 2020) . COVID-19 also brings about the change in waste generation and composition, disposal and waste management on waste process (Van Fan et al. 2020) . Waste management sector consisting of waste production, waste treatment and disposal and challenges to the industry (Haque et al. 2020 ) is also affected. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a good option for protecting medical workers and public against COVID-19 (Cook 2020) because COVID-19 has unknown characteristics and the solution is time-consuming and costly. Protective materials can be divided into two groups: protective materials (gowns, gloves, medical mask and face shield) used by health care professionals dealing with direct care of patients and medical masks for people who experience respiratory symptoms. The most critical issues confronting people are the alarming shortage and wastage of PPE. Medical equipment such as mask, glove and other tools should be available for all people in the epidemic outbreaks. Shortage of medical supplies can boost the death rate and cause the severe losses of the human lives (Govindan et al. 2020 ). An increasing demand for medical equipment (Kargar et al. 2020 ) is directly linked with the medical waste. The use of PPEs increases both the amount and density of the medical waste (Singh et al. 2020a, b) . The pandemic management involves the fulfilment of preparation before disaster or after disaster to mitigate the negative impacts. Medical wastes produced during the COVID-19 have gained increasing attention . PPE, mask, glove and face shield bring about the huge contribution to waste amount (Ilyas et al. 2020) . The coronavirus also remains on materials for days (Nzediegwu and Chang 2020) . Therefore, an optimal management of PPE is important to control the outbreak. Infectious personal protective equipment (IPPE) should be organized with the measures linked Editorial Responsibility: Samareh Mirkia. with collection, treatment and burial to mitigate all risks (Korkut 2018) . Medical waste such as contaminated mask and glove, called as hazardous waste, should be separated from the domestic waste (Zambrano-Monserrate et al. 2020) . Since huge demand for protective material is predicted to boost suddenly in Turkey, medical waste will increase suddenly. Eco-friendly alternatives to enhance effective waste management system can ensure a sustainable world (Fadare and Okoffo 2020) . The contribution of this paper is the demonstration of effective waste management system including location and routing decisions in IPPE management under uncertain environment. In addition, although three scenarios of the fuzzy parameters are allocated based on the historical data in the Jimenez method, Holt-Winters (HW) model and waste generation (WG) formulation is used to assign these scenarios, which is the scientific novelty in the presented paper. For WG formulation, most influential risks on IPPE waste generation are evaluated to provide risk reaction strategies. Also, in the second stage, both the mathematical modelling approach and the heuristics developed are used to compare the results. As far as we know, this presented study is first to provide the integrated IPPE waste treatment centre (WTC) location and pickup routing problem (PRP) considering prediction of uncertain waste amount. The main aims of the presented study are determination of the WTC location, solving pickup routing problem regarding uncertain waste amount, forecasting the uncertain WG, and determination of the most influential risks on IPPE waste generation, to provide risk reaction strategies utilizing the WG outcomes.",

In this section, preliminary works related to this paper are presented to show the research gaps. Up to date, some studies related to the novel coronavirus are conducted, but generally in the medical subjects. Infectious medical waste for the COVID-19 pandemic was studied by Yu et al. (2020) and Kargar et al. (2020) . However, many papers have been carried out related to the reverse logistics problems, but for a pandemic outbreak, to our knowledge, no papers have provided a framework related to IPPE waste management. Yu et al. (2020) presented mathematical modelling in a reverse logistics for medical waste in the COVID-19 pandemic. They decided some optimum locations and transportation planning. Budak and Ustundag (2017) addressed mixed integer modelling to decide some location decisions aiming at minimum cost. Their study covered the pickup, distribution and disposition of medical waste. Liu et al. (2020) used a heuristic to determine the waste storage placement. Also, transportation modelling for medical waste between hospital and storage placements was developed with the ant colony-tabu hybrid algorithms. Mantzaras and Voundrias (2017) addressed a model that decides the waste treatment locations, waste volume, distribution vehicles and vehicle routes. They used two software applications to solve this problem and observe that major share of the cost is related to the treatment installation cost. Nolz et al. (2014) presented a mathematical formulation for the stochastic IRP considering pickup of medical waste, mitigation of medical risk, etc. Heuristic solutions were also provided for methods on real-world study. Chauhan and Singh (2016) provided health care waste disposal location problem utilizing multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Yazdani et al. (2020) and Gergin et al. (2019) addressed a waste disposal location problem using a new best-worst method and a clustering algorithm, respectively.",

They obtained the steam sterilization as the most optimal medical waste disposal technique. Xiao (2018) developed a new MCDM tool to assess the optimal treatment technology for the health care waste. D numbers were used to deal with human judgement due to the various uncertainties. Steam sterilization was provided as the optimal technology to handle this waste. Makajic-Nikolic et al.

To make these decisions scientific sound, integrated solution approaches should be carried out. Thus, a combined problem including location and PRP regarding uncertain WG is proposed in this paper. Figure 1 depicts a representation of two stages of presented problem. In the first stage, location problem regarding demand-weighted distances and installation costs is solved.

In this analysis, location results and total costs utilizing MIP solver are demonstrated in Table 4 . Total cost is computed for each distance, number of vehicles and WTC. The results show that total cost increases with the number of vehicles and WTC. At the distance constraint for 20-100 km, changes on the total cost, number of WTC and vehicles are investigated. One WTC is required to cover all area within 100 km since the city is not enough large and installation of the second WTC is costly. 125-150 km restrictions are not more influential on the total cost. In Table 5 , routes and waste quantities for each node are obtained using MIP solver. The total waste obtained is shared to the nodes based on the population and density. The starting and end point of the routes is WTC. Routes are generated for the pickup process regarding capacity of the vehicles and the amount of the waste and presented in the following: Vehicle 1 follows the route as WTC-2-4-WTC, Vehicle 2 follows the route as WTC-1-3-7-WTC, and Vehicle 3 follows the route as WTC-6-8-5-WTC.",
