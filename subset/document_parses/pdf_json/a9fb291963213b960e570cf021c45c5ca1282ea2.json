Recently, city authorities, transport logistic designers, and policymakers have tasked researchers/ entrepreneurs to innovate in shared mobility systems. This paper proposes a Blockchain-Enabled Shared Mobility (BESM) architecture that allocates seats to residents/tourists in a shareable vehicle based on air quality and COVID-19 information of traveling locations. BESM involves smart city authorities, vehicle owners, hospital authorities, and residents using permissioned-blockchains to collaboratively decide on allocating travel seats. Experiments were carried out at the IoT Cloud research laboratory to manifest the allocation of seats. For instance, BESM excluded in allocating seats to asthma patients and limited the number of travelers in the cities where COVID-19 cases or pollution levels were higher in numbers using BESM. The pollution levels of cities were monitored using air quality monitoring sensors or predicted using a few prediction algorithms such as Random Forests (RF), Linear Regression (LR), Quantile Regression (QR), Ridge Regression (RR), Lasso Regression (LaR), ElasticNet Regression (ER), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Recursive Partitioning (RP). In succinct, the article unfolded the primordial importance of the proposed BESM architecture for promoting efficient shared mobility aspects in smart cities.",

Notably, using deprecated vehicles, poor-quality fuels, and delirious driving practices could adversely increase air pollution rates in cities, especially in traffic-congested cities. When fuel burns, NO 2 is formed which acutely affects the humans' lung functions. Consequently, the asthma and bronchitis patients avoid urban living or city trips; besides, the patients are driven to lung or similar cancer diseases-a long-standing health concern to the urban residents. In addition, air pollution due to the emission of NO 2 from vehicles remains a toxic element to plants which reduces the growth rate of plants or crop productions.",

Details Collection/Verification-Second, the latitude l sc and longitude lo sc of the smart city locations that the traveler would travel using the shareable vehicle V i of capacity S c are collected. This depends on the preference given by the traveler to reach a destination on the vehicle. Similarly, the information of a traveler T sc , namely, the personal identification number is collected from smart city registries; besides, the current COVID-19 situation C s for the given location or traveling locations is collected. 3. AQ j Measurement/Prediction-Third, for the given l sc and lo sc of the smart city and the entire route of the journey, AQ j parameters such as NO 2 , SO 2 are either measured using sensors or predicted using previous values of nearest locations of a region. Typically, air quality monitoring sensors are connected to cloud services or edge services through microcontrollers such as Arduino UNO and gateways. There are no monitoring sensors in some locations due to several reasons such as network or cost issues. In fact, it is not possible to provide monitoring sites in all possible locations of a widely spread region, especially in developing countries. Hence, prediction services need to be adopted for identifying the air quality parameter values. In order to predict the air quality parameter values, BESM utilizes several prediction algorithms such as LR, QR, RR, LaR, ER, RF, SVM, and RP algorithms. A detailed discussion on the prediction algorithms is discussed in Sect. 4. 4. Travel Decision-Fourth, the traveler requests BESM to allot a seat in the shareable vehicle. The request is initiated as a blockchain transaction. This transaction is verified based on the input provided to the blockchain network such as traveler details, air quality values of the entire path of the journey, and the traveler/resident's health concerns. Chaincodes are executed on the peers of the blockchain network, where the policies of smart city officials, tourists/resident willingness, hospital permissions, and vehicle owner consent are collectively approved in order to validate the seat allocation of a shareable vehicle. 5. Anomaly Records-In general, vehicle owners might attempt to increase the number of travelers in their vehicle V i ; smart city officials or governments prefer to vary allocation policies in a dynamic fashion depending on various scenarios; hospital authorities might provide wrong recommendations; and, so forth. Anomalies of variations A v , if noticed, need to be issued as transactions in blockchains. For instance, a smart city official could inspect the over-crowded vehicle and raise an anomaly against the vehicle owner. This transaction would be recorded as an anomaly record in the blockchain database B d similar to the traveler seat allocation transaction. The participants of BESM verify each transaction before they were recorded into the database.",

The last two columns of the table express the time required for conducting the entire validation processes and prediction processes of algorithms. The validation processes, for example, include tidying data, splitting data into training and testing datasets, establishing models for the training dataset, and predicting data for the testing dataset. The prediction processes avoid splitting processes and testing 50 percent of data as carried out at the validation processes. As observed in Table 2 , the time required for creating training models to train SO 2 and NO 2 was comparatively higher than the respective time for predictions. The validation and prediction times of SVM, ER and RF were higher than the other algorithms-notably, SVM had experienced 26.4 seconds for predicting the dependent variables. Succinctly, the prediction accuracy result of RF was better than the other algorithms of consideration as shown in Fig. 4 .",

This work proposed a novel BESM architecture based on permissioned blockchains. BESM included smart city officials, travelers/residents, hospital management, and vehicle owners while allocating seats for travelers/residents collaboratively; it allocated seats in shareable vehicles based on air quality values and COVID-19 situations of the traveling locations of residents/travelers. The proposed mechanism was experimented at IoT Cloud Research Laboratory and manifested using four demonstration-oriented case studies. In the future, researchers could observe the emotions of travelers based on facial recognitions while allocating seats in a shareable vehicle.",
