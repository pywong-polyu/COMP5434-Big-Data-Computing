            "text": "Objective We aim to demonstrate that a chest X-ray (CXR) scoring system for COVID-19 patients correlates with patient outcome and has a prognostic value. Methods This retrospective study included CXRs of COVID-19 patients that reported the Brixia score, a semi-quantitative scoring system rating lung involvement from 0 to 18. The highest (H) and lowest (L) values were registered along with scores on admission (A) and end of hospitalization (E). The Brixia score was correlated with the outcome (death or discharge). Results A total of 953 patients met inclusion criteria. In total, 677/953 were discharged and 276/953 died during hospitalization. A total of 524/953 had one CXR and 429/953 had more than one CXR. H-score was significantly higher in deceased (median, 12; IQR 9-14) compared to that in discharged patients (median, 8; IQR 5-11) (p < 0.0001). In 429/953 patients with multiple CXR, A-score, L-score, and E-score were higher in deceased than in discharged patients (A-score 9 vs 8; p = 0.039; L-score 7 vs 5; p < 0.0003; E-score 12 vs 7; p < 0.0001). In the entire cohort, logistic regression showed a significant predictive value for age (p < 0.0001, OR 1.13), H-score (p < 0.0001, OR 1.25), and gender (p = 0.01, male OR 1.67). AUC was 0.863. In patients with \u2265 2 CXR, A-, L-, and E-scores correlated significantly with the outcome. Cox proportional hazards regression indicated age (p < 0.0001, HR 4.17), H-score (< 9, HR 0.36, p = 0.0012), and worsening of H-score vs A score > 3 (HR 1.57, p = 0.0227) as associated with worse outcome. Conclusions The Brixia score correlates strongly with disease severity and outcome; it may support the clinical decision-making, particularly in patients with moderate-to-severe signs and symptoms. The Brixia score should be incorporated in a prognostic model, which would be desirable, particularly in resource-constraint scenarios. Key Points \u2022 To demonstrate the importance of the Brixia score in assessing and monitoring COVID-19 lung involvement.",

We searched our institutional electronic health record for eligible patients, and our study population was obtained from a cohort of 2498 patients admitted at the hospital because of signs and symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 pneumonia (inclusion date between March 4, 2020, and April 11, 2020) ( Fig. 1 ). Inclusion criteria were as follows: available CXR reporting the severity index expressed by the Brixia score, positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by RT-PCR), and outcome classifiable by death during hospitalization or discharge to home care or to rehabilitation. Exclusion criteria were as follows: age < 18. The Brixia score divides each lung into three regions, from apex to base (right: ABC; left: DEF), and classifies parenchymal findings as normal (0), interstitial changes (1), interstitial and alveolar changes with interstitial predominance (2) , and interstitial and alveolar changes with alveolar predominance (3) . Consequently, the Brixia score generates an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 18; in addition, a string of 6 digits was added to each report to detail the value assigned to each region (Fig. 2) .",

In this model, a significant prediction of the outcome was observed for age (p < 0.0001, OR 1.13), H-score (p < 0.0001, OR 1.25), and gender (p = 0.01, male OR 1.67). This model ) showed that A-, L-, and E-scores (singularly combined with age and gender) correlated all significantly with the outcome. In the three models, the A-score (admission CXR) was less predictive than the L-score, the lowest value obtained during hospitalization (AUC 0.814 vs 0.823, with 95% CI of 0.77-0.85 and 0.78-0.86, respectively). The model using the E-score obtained the largest value (AUC 0.890, 95% CI 0.86-0.92). The AUC of L-score and A-score did not show a statistically significant difference (p > 0.05), while AUC obtained with the E-score showed statistically significant differences compared to those with the L-score (p = 0.0001) and A-score (p = 0.0001). In order to explore the weight of CXR worsening after admission, an increase of the H-score > 3 points (compared to A-score) permitted to achieve an AUC of 0.893.",

As a consequence, the population under investigation is a selection of most severely ill patients, i.e., all affected by pneumonia and respiratory distress of variable intensity. In addition, many of the younger patients accessed the hospital after failure of home treatment (under the supervision of general practitioners), when substantial deterioration of the clinical conditions occurred.",

The string of the six values composing the score helps the radiologist in the comparison of serial CXR, facilitating the interpretation of the report of the previous reader and providing consistent criteria of assessment. On the other hands, the summed score offers to the referring physician an immediate picture of the evolution of the disease, clearing any possible misinterpretation of a descriptive report. Though the score was rated by several radiologists in the hospital, a high interobserver agreement (0.82) was demonstrated in a cohort of 100 patients [9] .",

In 953 patients, the highest value reached by the score was significantly higher in deceased patients as compared to that in discharged ones. The median value of each of four different reference values of the score (representing time points or peaks in the clinical course) was significantly different (and progressively higher) in discharged and deceased patients. Wong et al recently described a scoring system for CXR findings in COVID-19 patients [11] . That score applied a simplified approach based on the percentage of lung parenchyma affected in each lung, resulting in score values ranging from 0 to 8. In our opinion, the Brixia score, though maintaining a reasonably easy and schematic approach, provides a more sophisticated panel of information, including the type of lung damage, its zonal distribution, and a larger range of total values, which may better grade the severity of lung involvement. According to the Multinational Consensus Statement of the Fleischner Society on the role of imaging in the COVID-19 pandemic, in patients with moderate-to-severe features of the disease, imaging is an essential part of the clinical decision-making about the intensity of care and support, even more so in a resourceconstrained environment. We believe that the more refined information provided by the Brixia score may efficiently serve this purpose. Resource constraints add a further complication to the difficult management of the peak of the epidemic: a rational use of the resources requires, among other factors, predictive models able to stratify the prognosis of patients. On one hand, data of our series confirmed the shared knowledge that males are more severely affected by COVID-19 and age predicts the outcome. On the other hand, the Brixia score provided additional insights: the significantly different values in H-and Lscores between discharged and deceased patients suggest that if the score exceeds the value of 9 or does not drop below 7, a worse outcome can be expected.",

However, it is not clear which comorbidities may impact on the outcome and which relative weight should be assigned to the different disease entities [12, 13] . Moreover, the causes of death in the 276 patients died during hospitalization were not recorded, because, at the peak of the epidemic, the local institutional guidelines and the logistics did not permit diagnostic autopsies.

Many clinical and laboratory data are missing in a significant number of patients, and thus, they could not be implemented in the statistical analysis.
