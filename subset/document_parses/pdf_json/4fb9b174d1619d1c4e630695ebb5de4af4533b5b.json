To a large degree, this has resulted in the extension of the study terms, and deferral of exams and graduation dates. COVID-19 lockdown has exhibited serious repercussions for dental education. While theoretical courses have still been delivered online during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of hands-on courses such as restorative dentistry has been challenging while instructors and students self-isolate at home without access to dental equipment. The duration of this teaching interruption is still uncertain, and dental colleges must keep in mind the possibility of a second or third wave of COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary for dental colleges to look for a reliable and robust, yet inexpensive, solution to ensure the continuation of practical skills in dental education (Solana, 2020) .",

This device can fill the existing gap for fully remote or physical-distancingaware teaching and learning in dentistry. The DenTeach platform consists of an instructor workstation (DT-Performer), a student workstation (DT-Student), advanced wireless networking technology, and cloud-based data storage and retrieval. This platform has high efficiency and is able to procedurally synchronize the instructor and the student with real-time video, audio, feel, and posture (VAFP).

Specifically, mentors conduct a procedure that offers the students the opportunity of observing, then assisting, and finally performing that procedure under the supervision of their mentor. Students learn the nuances of required skills through working on artificial materials, cadaveric organs, animals, and case observations, and receive qualitative feedback on their performance from their mentor (Collins et al., 1991) .",

Additionally, in the field of dentistry, this traditional model is time-consuming, and the training process is slow and lacks quantitative measures to assess aspects of technical skills. As a result, trial and error often constitute a major part of learning psychomotor skills for a student. To provide students with continued learning and training education in times of unprecedented crisis like COVID-19, decreased training hours, and increased training efficiency, there is an increasing demand to develop a portable intelligent teaching-learning platform capable of providing remote teaching and learning delivery and quantitative evaluation of dental performance.",

One important aspect of instrument handling is the ability to use the instrument (such as the dental handpiece) to effectively, yet safely, accomplish the dental goal. There are several tactile skills that should be understood and learned by students. Most importantly, a student should know how to hold the dental handpiece (orientation and position of the handpiece), comprehend how fast the drill should rotate, perceive the level of vibration produced by the handpiece during the performance of a dental task (acceleration and jerk) and receive adequate alerts once a task is performed improperly. The tactile skills listed above may vary depending on the type of tooth, the region of the oral cavity, or conducted tasks.",

By using force sensors, the force applied by the dentist is measured and used as a reference signal to be compared with the force applied by the student. Moreover, audible signal patterns are retrieved and audibly displayed utilizing an acoustic display unit such as loudspeakers, which means that screams of pain are played if the calculation shows that the tip of the drill invades the area of the nerve'. Additionally, the position of the force-application point of the tool is localized by means of a navigation system, such as a camera and other optical systems.",

            "text": "In the work of Ranta et al. (2007) , a training system has been presented using haptic-enabled simulations of dental procedures to provide the sensorimotor involvement needed for dental training. To provide tactile feedback combined with a realistic visual experience, the system integrates an off-the-shelf haptic stylus interface for simulating the movement and feel of the tooltip with a 3D stereoscopic display. The haptic stylus enables the dental student to orient and to operate simulated dental tools. Working on a virtual model viewed in a stereo display, dental students can use a simulated pick to probe a tooth or a simulated drill to prepare a tooth for cavity repair. The touch feedback is simulated by representing these dental instruments as force-to-a-point tools, which map to haptic simulation procedures executed on a computer workstation that also provides the visual display. Hayka and Eytan (1997) invented a visual-audio-feeling simulation system for dentistry that comprises a dental handpiece with a drill for drilling a cavity in a tooth. A 3D sensor, attached to the dental handpiece, provides the system with the position and orientation of the drill whereas a data processing unit and a display unit simulate the drill end. The system further controls the flow of compressed air operating the drill, and thus controls the drill's speed. This imitates the sound and handfeeling associated when drilling through tooth layers of different hardness. Kuchenbecker et al. (2017) developed a simulator to educate dental students in caries detection; the simulator allows dental faculty to share, record, and replay the tactile vibrations felt through a dental hand instrument. This simulation approach is assessed by asking experienced dental educators to evaluate the system's real-time and video playback modes. The simulator uses an accelerometer to sense instrument vibrations and a voice coil actuator to reproduce these vibrations on another tool.",

Quantitative vibrotactile data measured during the performance of dental tasks on human teeth remain largely unavailable. Therefore, in addition to developing advanced intelligent dental simulators to reform the traditional noviceexpert apprenticeship model and improve teaching and learning performance, there is a strong demand for systematic quantitative evaluation of dental performance using KPIs. To this end, Wang et al. (2011) developed a haptic-based dental simulator, and preliminary user evaluations on its first-generation prototype have been carried out. Based on the detailed requirement analysis of periodontics procedures, a combined evaluation method including qualitative and quantitative analysis was designed.

To help dental institutions continue delivering education remotely, a compact and portable teaching-learning platform, DenTeach, has been developed for remote teaching and learning. The platform includes an instructor workstation (DT-Performer), a student workstation (DT-Student), advanced wireless networking technology, and cloud-based data storage and retrieval. By providing real-time video, audio, feel, and posture (VAFP) information, the platform synchronizes the operations of the instructor and the student. Besides, the platform can provide quantitative KPIs of the student to both the instructor and the student to evaluate the student's skill level. DenTeach follows and expands on the traditional noviceexpert apprenticeship model of instruction to enhance dental training programs. It has been developed for use in teaching, shadowing, and practice modes. In teaching mode, the student can perceive how the instructor is conducting the dental operation through tactile feedback obtained from the dental tool of the instructor's workstation. In shadowing mode, the student can watch, feel, and repeat the tasks alone by downloading the augmented videos. In practice mode, students can use the system to perform dental tasks and have their dental performance skills automatically evaluated in terms of KPIs. A case study was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the device, and the results show that a combination of KPIs, video views, and graphical reports in both teaching and shadowing modes can effectively help the student understand which aspects of their work need further improvement.",

            "text": "DenTeach is a useful invention for pedagogical and professional purposes, which can be used for training and educating students in both clinical/laboratory and remote (i.e., home) settings due to its compact and portable size. This device facilitates both fully remote and physical-distancing aware teaching and learning in dentistry. Additionally, the DenTeach platform can be useful during the pandemic recovery phase, when dental schools are allowed to return to normal operations. Once dental schools are reopened, there will be a surge in teaching, practicing, and exams. DenTeach can be used to increase the efficiency of the training process, thus allowing dental schools to clear the backlog of activities faster. Before the second wave of COVID-19 hits, decision-makers at dental colleges may want to ensure they have adequate resources to continue teaching and testing from a remote location and minimize the backlog of deferred activities. DenTeach can be used as an effective remote training tool. Moreover, the application of DenTeach could be further extended to other fields of health sciences such as general surgery and neurosurgery where a drill is used to conduct a task.",
