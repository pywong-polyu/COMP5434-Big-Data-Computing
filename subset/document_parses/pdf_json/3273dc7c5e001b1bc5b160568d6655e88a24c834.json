At the ancient society, drawings and other visual representations were used to investigate the world and also to record the historical events. Data visualization has significantly contributed to invention and discovery throughout human history (Crapo, Waisel, Wallace, & Willemain, 2000) . The invention of computer technology makes the huge change on the way of visual representation of data. Data analyst has become quicker and more accuracy using computer graphical data visualization. Data visualization has become an important part of research in many fields including algorithms, human perception, animation, computer vision and so on. Data visualization is usually associated with the field of computer science in the contemporary society. As an emerging field, it is considered a sub-classification of visualization and is regarded as \"the science of visual representation of 'data'\" (Friendly, 2009, p. 2) . The technology of data visualization has evolved from using hand drawing in the earliest stages, to \"photo-etching\", to using computer technology, such as computing graphics and software (Friendly, 2009) . In particular, the development of computer software has advanced the application of data visualization, allowing users to manipulate a substantial amount of data for exploration and analysis in an easier and more affordable way. In this book, data visualization that focuses on the communication for understanding data rather than any other approaches is considered as traditional data visualization.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 324, "end": 367, "text": "(Crapo, Waisel, Wallace, & Willemain, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 972, "end": 994, "text": "(Friendly, 2009, p. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1200, "text": "(Friendly, 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Concept of Data Visualization"}, {"text": "Traditional data visualization has a number of advantages.

Manovich (2010) defines it as \"a transformation of quantified data which is not visual into a visual representation\" (p. 20). According to Friendly (2009) , data visualization refers to \"information which has been abstracted in some schematic form, including attributes or variables for the units of information\" (p. 2). Data visualization involves an information exchange that includes the messenger, the receiver, and the message (Kirk, 2012) . Kirk (2012) defines data visualization as \"the representation and presentation of data that exploits our visual perception abilities on order to amplify cognition\" (p. 17). It emphasizes that the design of data visualization requires representing data in an effective and efficient form. Visual representation of data is a key element for these definitions. The purpose of data visualization identifies patterns inside the graphic through exploring and analyzing data. Thus, Bikakis (2018) defines data visualization as the following: Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format, and a data visualization tool is the software that generates this presentation.

Many examples can be found in research, in particular in scientific study. The primary data can be numbers and people, for example, when \"an experiment is conducted to know the effect of certain fertilizer doses on the yield or the effect of a drug on the patients, the observations taken on each plot or patient\" are the primary data (Agarwal, 2006, p. 3) .

The different forms of data visualization present a different visual effect, which can help to identify the problems or issues. It is also important to select the types of data visualization for a variety of disciplines or research fields. Although information visualization and scientific visualization are two different research fields, the forms of visualization are certain similarity. The visual forms of two visualizations are often overlaps. Table 2 .1 presents the main forms of data visualization. Those forms of representation are also called \"visualization techniques\" (Cawthon & Moere, 2007; Fayyad & Grinstein, 2002) , which have been developed to optimize selecting and creating the most effective and efficient transformation of data into information (Senay & Ignatius, 1990) . As represented within the table, the common forms of data visualization refer to trees, scatter plots, charts, tables, diagrams, and graphs. Selecting forms for data visualization is dependent on the type of data. Bertin (1977) suggests that data visualization primarily deals with two fundamental types of data, including data values and data structures. Ware (2012) proposes a similar suggestion that data can be split into entities and relations, in which entities refer to visualizing objects, and relations refer to structures and patterns relevant to entities. For example, people can be referred to as entities or a flock of birds can be referred to as a single entity. A house is built up by many different parts that have a structural relationship. Similarly, data usually has an attribute that is an emergent property of entities and may not exist independently. For example, the color of a car becomes an inseparable attribute of the car. Thus, traditional data visualization requires considering the type of data with regard to the entities, relation and its attributes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 705, "end": 728, "text": "(Cawthon & Moere, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 729, "end": 754, "text": "Fayyad & Grinstein, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 891, "end": 915, "text": "(Senay & Ignatius, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1145, "text": "Bertin (1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1285, "text": "Ware (2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 574, "end": 581, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "The Forms of Traditional Data Visualization"}, {"text": "Information visualization, which listed in Table 2 .1, has become an emerging area in the last decade.

It attempts to present all the objective data required to enable the users to make some kind of decision (Wildbur & Burke, 1998) .

For example, a timetable, a signing system and most maps fall into this first category. This organized information can let users freely to extract only that information which they need for a given purpose.

Humans often use trees as a symbol to represent classification of the natural world (Lima, 2011) . In visualization, tree can also refer to \"Tree-Map\" visualization (Johnson & Shneiderman, 1999) . The hierarchical structures involve two types of information, which include structural information correlated hierarchy and content information correlated each node. For example, the branched schema of trees has been used for organizing family ties, social structures, and species evolution. The Tree of the Two Advents by Joachim of Fiore in 1202 is an example of trees that illustrates key characters and institutions of the Christian salvation history. This tree displays key figures from top to bottom, repeating Jesus Christ, Ozias the Prophet, Jacob the Patriarch, and Adam. The image of Christ dominates the whole trees and the lower branches link the image of Jacob to the twelve tribes of Israel. The Christ in the middle links twelve branches that represent twelve churches (Lima, 2011) . Figure 2 .2 presents a Tree-Map of architecture history in 1896. The Tree-Map was produced as a schematic diagram with what Banister Fletcher recognized as the tree branches of architectural styles. It was published in the first edition of Fletcher's Architecture book. The author highlights a cross-cultural and historical evolution of architectural styles through a series of successive branches (Flood, 2012) . The Tree-Map shows the evolution of the various architectural styles in five periods including Peruvian, Egyptian, Greek, Assyrian and Chinese and Japanese.

Nonhistorical styles, grouped together, are decorative additions, they supplement the proper history of architecture that is based on the logic of construction. (Morrison, 2015) The visual metaphor of the tree is often used to represent a network of nodes that consists of root nodes and subordinate note within its branched schema in the field of data visualization. Trees are one of the most useful forms to depict data by starting from a root node and then tracing down to its subordinate node until all nodes have (Spence, 2007) . Trees can take various forms, such as TreeMap, Space-Tree, and StarTree, suitable for different data or information (Cawthon & Moere, 2007) . The forms of trees have been used in many fields to represent data, including business and healthcare, amongst others. Spence (2007) presents a typical example of a tree map, which effectively displays a large amount of data for identifying patterns and tendencies (see the Status of Companies in Different Fields in the website of Smartmoney.com).
