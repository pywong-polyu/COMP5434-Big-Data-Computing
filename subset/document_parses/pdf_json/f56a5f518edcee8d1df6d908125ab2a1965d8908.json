Both substitutional and interstitial doping of pure metallic phases can give profound effects such as altering electronic and transport properties, lattice parameters, phase transitions, and consequently various physicochemical properties.

This article provides an overview of the recent developments regarding the catalytic properties and characterisation of such systems. In particular, the structure-activity relationship for a number of important chemical reactions is summarised and the future prospects of this area are also explored.",

The space group and atomic arrangements of the intermetallic phase are different to that of the pure parent metal.

This type of doping is usually characterised by gradual changes in lattice parameter with dopant concentration, 8 and may precede a discrete phase transition to an intermetallic compound, 9 which can be demonstrated by the boron-palladium binary system. 8, 9 The formation of solid-solution alloys or intermetallic compounds can be explained from a thermodynamic perspective (eqn (1)): 10",

When the properties of the constituent elements are very close, DH f is close to zero or slightly negative. Therefore, the disordered structure (DS f > 0) is favourable, and hence a negative DG f is obtained, but the ordered structure cannot be explained in terms of entropy. Nevertheless, if the electronic properties of the constituent elements are very different, a highly negative DH f is sufficient to compensate for the entropy loss, leading to a negative DG f . However, in the case where the elements have similar properties, the doped structures can form both ordered and disordered structures, resulting in intermediate properties between the behaviour of intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys. Ordered alloys are called Kurnakov-type intermetallic compounds, and their transition to disordered structures can be driven by enhancing the contribution of \u00c0TDS f . 11 Therefore, the driving force in the formation of solidsolution alloys (entropy-driven) and intermetallic compounds (enthalpy-driven) are different. However, it is worth noting that this equation fails to consider the factors of strain, defects etc. 10 Overall, this classi\ue103cation is essential because solid-solution alloys and interatomic compounds behave differently even if the elemental composition and stoichiometry are the same.",

            "text": "Unlike substitutional alloys, in order for the formation of interstitial alloys to occur, the size of the foreign species needs to be sufficiently small to diffuse into the interstitial sites. The conventional interstitial alloys are metal hydrides, 20 carbides, 21 borides 22 and nitrides, 23 among others. These light elements, from the \ue103rst period of the p-block and below, o\ue09den have small atomic radii and dominant s-p orbitals, and o\ue09den occupy the largest available interstitial site: the octahedral hole in facecentre-cubic (FCC) and hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) structures, and the trigonal prismatic hole in hexagonal structures. The crystal structure is governed by geometric and electronic factors. The geometric factor is based on H\u00e4gg's rule, 24 which uses the ratio of dopant atomic radius (r X ) to that of the host metal atomic radius (r M ) for the interstitial alloy formation. When the ratio (r X /r M ) is less than 0.59, the structure of the interstitial alloy will be simple, such as the aforementioned FCC, HCP and hexagonal structures. When the ratio (r X /r M ) is greater than 0.59, an interstitial alloy with a more complicated structure will be obtained, for instance chromium carbide, Cr 3 C 2 . 25 The second factor that governs crystal structure is the electronic effect. The nature of metallic bonding in interstitial solidsolution transition-metal alloys (d-orbital dominated) is remarkably different to the pristine metal due to orbital mixing between the foreign atoms and host metal system, such as the s-p orbitals of the dopant element and the s-p-d orbitals of the metal elements. In light of the Engel-Brewer theory of metals, 26, 27 it was suggested that the structure adopted by a metal or interstitial solid-solution alloy is dependent on the sp counts as follows: 26 BCC: sp 0.5 HCP: sp 0.7-1.1 FCC: sp 1.5-2 It can be found that increasing p-orbital mixing can induce the structural transformation from body-centre-cubic (BCC) to HCP to FCC. Additionally, accommodating foreign atoms in a metal structure can result in lattice expansion of the host structure, which is indicative of interstitial solid-solution alloy formation due to repulsive electrostatic interactions. 28 The size of solute is a main contribution for the formation of the interstitial solid-solution alloy. As depicted in Fig. 3 , the atomic radii of hydrogen, boron, carbon and nitrogen are rather small. However, the atomic radius of Li is relatively large, comparable to some transition metals such as silver (165 pm). Hence, lithium atoms are observed to substitute silver atoms instead of inhabiting interstitial sites in the structure. 128 Hence, it is expected that incorporating light elements with smaller atomic radii into transition metals are more likely to form interstitial solid-solution alloys. In addition to the effect of size, the similarity of the electropositivity and crystal structure of the two components needs to be taken into account when considering interstitial solid-solution systems. 29 Since each research group has its own notation for solidsolution alloy systems, this mini-review will express binary systems with the host metal (M) \ue103rst, and the dopant element (N) second. Substitutional doping and interstitial doping will be expressed in superscript as follows: M-sub N and M-int N. Solidsolution phases that are reported as a speci\ue103ed composition are expressed as M m N n . Unclear solid-solution phases are expressed as M m N x , where x denotes that the atomic ratio remains unclear. In bimetallic systems that have been doped with a light element, the two host metals will be separated by a dash. Note that some material labels in this mini-review differ from the original ones in the literature.",

It should be noted that not every case will obey this rule. In recent work on the Au-int C system, doping does not induce any appreciable change in diffraction. 40 Expansion or contraction due to substitutional modi\ue103cation is usually interpreted using Vegard's rule, 17 which states that the concentration of a substitutional dopant is linearly correlated with the variation in the lattice parameter. However, it should be noted that Vegard's rule does not have a sound theoretical basis, as is o\ue09den admitted by literature, with many exceptions reported. 41 Compared to laboratory-source X-rays, those from a synchrotron source have many improved properties, for example brightness, focus area, divergence, and energy bandwidth. Additionally, much higher energies can be achieved. Highly collimated and intense X-rays allow the collection of high-resolution X-ray data, particularly for diffraction. For example, in our recent work, the re\ue103nement of high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRD or SXPD) patterns demonstrated the coexistence of FCC and HCP phases in Pd-int B NPs. 6 Other characterisation by synchrotron radiation Other experiments carried out at synchrotron-radiation facilities include the following. Use of the X-ray pair distribution function (XPDF) and the corresponding re\ue103nement can probe the local structure, distortion and site occupancy for disordered systems. 6 Also useful in characterising non-crystalline systems, extended X-ray absorption \ue103ne structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) can determine the chemical composition, electronic state, environment and local structure, regardless of long-range order. 31 For example, the use of XANES spectra is capable of detecting the Pd-C bonds of carbon-containing molecules adsorbed at the surface of Pd NPs. In studies of the Pd-int H phase, Lamberti et al. 42 used in situ and in operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to demonstrate the differences in structural and electronic con\ue103guration between the core and shell regions of the NP, due to hydriding at different temperatures and hydrogen pressures.",

However, it is rather challenging to directly visualise light elements such as hydrogen, carbon, boron, and nitrogen within the metal lattice due to their low atomic number and hence low electron-scattering ability, which is in stark contrast with highly scattering metal atoms. 46 Furthermore, for light-element dopants, additional care must be taken to avoid beam damage when using intense electron beams. In an investigation of an interstitially boron-doped palladium catalyst, Pd-int B, our research group used the emerging electron microscopy technique of ptychography to visualise boron at the octahedral sites of the Pd metal framework. 6 Along with other supporting techniques and simulations, certain atomic columns observed by microscopy were interpreted as interstitial boron atoms. In 2020, Gan et al. 47 reported that the use of a differentiated and integrated differential phase contrast technique (dDPC and iDPC) in aberration-corrected STEM can even directly visualise atomic columns of hydrogen that correspond to interstitial tetrahedral sites in the Pd-H system, which was also supported by the simulated dDPC images. On the basis of the result, they claimed that hydrogen can also occupy tetrahedral interstitial sites, which is in agreement with previous NPD studies 48 and theoretical calculations. 49 Electron microscopy is o\ue09den associated with two spectroscopic techniques that yield elemental mapping information. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy can yield elemental composition information, and specialises in the detection of heavy elements. Meanwhile electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is additionally able to probe the local chemical environment and oxidation state, and specialises in the detection of light elements. Recently, our research group used EELS to map the boron distribution within Pd NPs and estimated the site occupancy of boron at octahedral sites to be approximately 0.2. 6 However, the PDF re\ue103nement proposed that the average site occupancy across the whole sample was much lower at $0.05; hence it was shown that interstitial boron is distributed unevenly across the sample. The dopant was shown to be present as atomic boron within the lattice by the observation of the B K-edge at 188 eV, rather than an energy of 194 eV and 203 eV which is indicative of boron oxides (Fig. 4 ). 6 ",

Therefore, is it crucially important to understand how the foreign light elements that occupy interstitial sites alter the surface atomic and electronic structure of a catalyst. In recent decades, computational simulations have become an important tool since they can disentangle complex phenomena and provide information that experiments cannot provide. Hence theoretical simulations are needed for the correlation of structure with chemical properties, which has repeatedly supported experimental testing and characterisation. N\u00f8rskov et al. conducted pioneering research into the role of subsurface carbon in palladium during selective hydrogenation by conducting DFT calculations. 52 They identi\ue103ed the absorption energies of carbon at different sites in the Pd metal framework, and showed that the adsorption energy of a methyl group varies as a function of carbon coverage. It was found that the binding of methyl groups is substantially weakened if the carbon resides at the subsurface layer of Pd (111) . As indicated, the presence of light elements can expand the unit cell, which can lead to lattice strain. Yang et al. 53 compared the electronic effect induced by lattice strain and electronic interaction in the presence of boron atoms during their computational analysis of the hydrogenation of CO to methanol. As demonstrated in Meanwhile the alloying effect can broaden the d-band of palladium. Due to the orbital mixing of p-states of the boron, the d-band centre of the palladium is shi\ue09ded down, hence weakening its chemisorption. In addition to being used for assessing the surface-adsorbate interaction, and strain-alloying effect, DFT has also been used to predict the propensity of light-element accommodation to be interstitial or substitutional, thereby allowing prediction of new chemical and catalytic properties. For example, the experimental report by Ma et al. 55 showed that doping boron into copper improves catalytic stability for the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate; however the experimental structure still remains uncharacterised. Mushrif et al. used DFT calculations to correlate the stable microstructure of Cu-B with catalytic performance. 56 It was found by calculating the binding energy of boron at different sites on the Cu (111) surface that the most stable site is the octahedral site of the \ue103rst subsurface layer (\u00c0486 kJ mol \u00c01 ). As previously indicated, the role of light elements such as boron or carbon in the palladium subsurface can signi\ue103cantly promote catalytic performance. DFT was also used by Illas et al. to investigate C incorporation in subsurface sites of Cu, Ag and Au by using a supercell slab model and a well-shaped nanoparticle model. 57 They reported that the most stable carbon site for the (111) surfaces of Cu and Ag is at the interstitial site, which is also true for their nanoparticle. In contrast, for the Au(111) slab surface, carbon is most stable chemisorbed on the surface, rather than integrated into the structure. For Au NPs however, carbon becomes more stable at the interstitial sites, which is partially due to the low coordination of the site in this morphology.",

The presence of boron can expand the Pd lattice, which strengthens the adsorption of formate ions and decreases the activation energy of the formic acid dehydration by changing the adsorption geometry for formic acid to an H-down orientation. Continuing from this work, Studt et al. used DFT calculations to investigate the effect of boron dopants on formic acid decomposition over a Pd catalyst. Boron was found to preferably occupy the octahedral sites of Pd (111) , which formed the active site.

According to the DFT calculations reported by Wang et al., they concluded that Pd-BO 2 assemblies and neighbouring palladium atoms are responsible for the superior catalytic activity; this effect is in addition to the effect of subsurface boron atoms. They also noted that other boron oxide species might exhibit good catalytic activity, even at low concentration (Fig. 7f) .",

Furthermore, they attempted to rationalise the effect of boron on the Pd metal system in terms of electronic and bifunctional promotion (Fig. 8d) . Incorporation of boron into metal lattices can not only modify the surface electronic properties of Pd by weakening the strength of adsorption of poisoning ethyoxy intermediates that are generated during the electrocatalytic Selective hydrogenation of alkynes. Partial hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is an important reaction in the industrial \ue103eld of organic synthesis, 79 since alkene-based compounds are the key feedstock for plastic production. 80 Unmodi\ue103ed Pd metal catalysts are unable to yield alkenes with high selectivity, owing to the presence of b-PdH x which can accelerate the conversion rate but causes over-hydrogenation. 81 The strategy of subsurface modi\ue103cation to tune selectivity can be dated back to 2008. 82 In 2014, our research group was \ue103rst to modify the sublayer of Pd metals by incorporating B by using BH 3 $THF in the partial hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene, phenylacetylene, and 3-hexyn-1-ol. 37 The selectivity to alkene products was much improved in comparison with the Lindlar catalyst, 5% PdPb/ CaCO 3 . As suggested by DFT calculations (Fig. 9a and b) , the boron atoms occupied the thermodynamically-favourable octahedral sites. An effective overlap of d-and p-orbitals between boron interstitial atom and palladium resulted in reduced strength of adsorption for the alkene products, increasing the selectivity, in addition to blocking the formation of the unselective b-PdH x phase.",

Monometallic cobalt NPs exhibit one of two possible phases, namely HCP and FCC, which are dependent on their size and the temperature employed in the preparation. 86 The cobalt HCP-FCC phase transition occurs at around 700 K. 87 Cobalt NPs with FCC phase are most commonly reported, which can be mainly attributed to the particle size effect. As illustrated by the work of Shimada et al., 88 particles with FCC structure are energetically more stable below 20 nm. 89 Treatment with ammonia gas or other N-containing sources can incorporate nitrogen at the octahedral sites of cobalt, which can allow the formation of Co 4 N; though to a lesser degree, nitrogen can also reside at the tetrahedral sites, leading to the formation of Co 5.47 N and CoN. The type of interstitial hole that nitrogen occupies is governed by the synthetic method. CO 2 hydrogenation. Hydrogenation of CO 2 to hydrocarbons is a useful chemical process for forming useful fuel products while removing a highly harmful greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. Effective non-noble-metal-based catalysts are in strong demand.

The modi\ue103ed Co catalyst exhibited higher ORR activity and stability in an alkaline environment compared with commercial Pt/C, exhibiting an onset potential of 0.85 V vs. RHE. 92 N\u00f8skov and Siahrostami et al. investigated the effect of the structure of CoN on catalytic activity by conducting DFT calculations on the rock salt and zinc blende structures. 93 The authors suggested that the presence of a cobalt oxide layer on CoN could lower the over-potential signi\ue103cantly. In particular, the (111) facet of CoN with a layer of CoO was considered to be the most active surface for the ORR. Additionally, Zhang et al. reported that CoN decorated on nitrogen-doped graphene exhibited exemplary stability and methanol tolerance under acidic conditions. 94 In the same year, Wang et al. evaluated Co 5.47 N supported on porous nitrogen-doped carbon for the application of ORR. This system can exhibit an acceptable catalytic activity, with an onset potential of \u00c042 mV vs. SCE. 96 Huang et al. later reported that conducting a single-step preparation increased the activity of the catalyst. 97 Sun et al. 98 and Wu et al. 99 synthesised Co 5.47 N in complex architectures by adding a third component. They concluded that the interaction between N and Co can enhance the catalytic activity. Additionally, Hou et al. reported that FeN (zinc blende structure) catalysts can be bound onto nitrogendoped graphene through p-p stacking and oxygen-containing functional groups. Interaction between the support and the Fe-int N catalyst can result in a synergistic effect which enhances the catalytic activity and stability. 100 Oxygen evolution reaction.

In comparison with other catalysts, CoN-based nanomaterials exhibit superior activity in OER, as shown by a lower overpotential at 10 mA cm \u00c02 , a smaller Tafel slope, and better stability in an alkaline solution.

However, recently hydrogen has also been found to be a promising element to incorporate into metal systems to tune their catalytic activity. Recently, palladium hydride (Pd-int H), an interstitial metal hydride, 107 has increasingly received attention for a wide range of catalytic applications. There are two well-known structures of Pd-int H: the a-phase that has a composition of approximately PdH 0<x#0.03 and exhibits a slightly higher lattice parameter than pure palladium (3.889 A), and the b-phase that has a composition of approximately PdH x$0.58 , whose formation is observed by a sudden increase in lattice parameter to 4.018 A. 108 Sometimes, a-PdH x and b-PdH x phases can coexist in the region of the phase diagram(0.03 # x # 0.58). 109, 110 The distribution between the octahedral and tetrahedral sites has been shown to be dependent on the depth from the surface, and hence highly dependent on particle size and shape. 48 Elsewhere it has been found by NPD that the occupancy of tetrahedral sites in both the aand b-phases increases when the host Pd framework is alloyed with other metals. 111 Recent work on the utilisation of Pd/C in the electro-hydrogenation of dinitrogen demonstrated that the in situ formation of Pd-int H can catalyse the hydrogenation. 112 Herein, other recent catalytic applications are detailed.",

In 2015, Huang et al. reported that thermodynamically stable and catalytically active b-PdH 0.43 NPs can be prepared by a one-step synthesis. 113 They initially prepared Pd NPs with various shapes (nano-polycrystals, nanotetrahedra and nano-cubes) based on a reported method, 114 and then converted them to b-PdH 0.43 (Fig. 13a-f ). The nanopolycrystals and nano-tetrahedra supported on carbon both with and without hydride were tested in the electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in an alkaline medium. The hydride-compound exhibited higher activity than the pristine Pd catalyst (1.228 mA cm \u00c02 vs. 0.886 mA cm \u00c02 ), which can be attributed to the weaker CO binding on PdH 0.43 ( Fig. 13g and h) . In 2019, Choi et al. prepared (100)-faceted b-PdH 0.4 cubes and (111)-faceted b-PdH 0.4 octahedra to investigate the correlation between the catalytic performance and shape/facet/ composition. Again, the presence of hydrogen at interstitial sites can increase the catalytic activity and stability, which is the consequence of shi\ue09ding the d-band centre down from the Fermi level with respect to the unmodi\ue103ed Pd system. Furthermore, the b-PdH 0.4 cubes showed the highest MOR activity among the catalysts. 115 In 2020, Li et al. employed machine learning of stochastic surface walking to \ue103nd the Pd-int H surface that yielded the lowest energy pathway. 116 They found that at high hydrogen pressure the well-de\ue103ned phases Pd 2 H and Pd 4 H 3 appeared. They suggested that a-phase PdH 0.03 is simply pure Pd with a surface covering of hydride, and that the b-phase PdH 0.03 is a mixture of Pd 2 H and Pd 4 H 3 . The surface that yields the highest selectivity was predicted to be Pd (111) and the poorest to be Pd 4 H 3 (100) , which was supported by their experimental results, in which selectivity was increased by increasing particle size to diminish the Pd 4 H 3 (100) . It was also suggested that bimetallic alloys of palladium, such as PdAg, have increased selectivity due to the inhibition of the Pd 4 H 3 phase.",

As stated cationic Li is small enough to be placed in the interstitial hole, but neutral Li is too large for interstitial accommodation, hence favouring substitutional modi\ue103cation on the crystal surface. For instance, our research group reported that Pd-int Li NPs can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of Li(OAc)$2H 2 O in the presence of Pd/C. The presence of cationic Li at the interstitial site, caused by the large difference in electronegativity between Li and Pd, can almost totally inhibit the formation of the unselective b-hydride phase, which would facilitate overhydrogenation beyond the more valuable alkene products. 124 Ammonia synthesis from N 2 /H 2 . Ruthenium is an effective catalyst for Haber-Bosch thermal ammonia synthesis from N 2 / H 2 . 125 Doping Ru with Li species has recently been shown by our research group 126 to confer the strongest promotion effect in comparison to other alkali and alkaline earth metal dopants (Fig. 15a ). Li has no signi\ue103cant p-or d-orbital character, but can reduce the metal framework via mixing of p-or d-orbitals, causing a downshi\ue09d of the Ru d-band; this is analogous to the behavior of [Ca 24 Al 28 O 64 ] 4\u00c0 (e \u00c0 ) 4 electride. 127 In addition to electronic promotion of the ruthenium metal, Li can also act as a structural promoter. Exposed substitutionally doped Li on the surface can selectively block the N 2 dissociation step-site as well as stabilising the partially negatively charged dinitrogencontaining intermediates and associated transition states on the terrace sites (Fig. 15b) . Thus, the remarkable low-pressure ammonia synthesis rate is attributed to the electronic promotion and surface stabilisation by Ru-sub Li.",

Incorporation of lightelements using recent synthetic methodologies such as forming multi-component alloy nanoparticles by fast nonequilibrium heating of their aerosols could be an exciting direction. 128 On the other hand, some advanced structural characterisation techniques are still in the early stages of development and are difficult to access.
