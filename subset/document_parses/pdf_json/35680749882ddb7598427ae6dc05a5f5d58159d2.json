With the decline in demand, supply, and workforce the industries are driven into the gloom. The concerned research objective is to explore the factors which impact manufacturing throughout the world during the epidemic of Covid-19. Further, it delineates the usage of advanced digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), and internet of things (IoT) to bring on solutions/approaches to evolving to pandemic-constrained manufacturing. An overall of twelve key factors is determined from extensive literature reviews which are categorized into challenges and solutions. Here, ISM methodology has been used to establish the interrelationship among identified twelve challenges and solutions. Further, MICMAC analysis has categorized them according to their driving and dependence power. The consequences display the absence of autonomous factors whilst efficient supply chain, centralized decision making, product diversification, and JIT along with revenue generation turn out to be significant dependant factors. The facilitators like digital technologies are the pre-cursors to the ultimate solution of revenue generation and termed preliminary solutions. The outcomes of this research will suggest eventual policy recommendations for industry leaders to progress manufacturing within Covid-19 constraints. It will offer a sturdy base for manufacturers around the world to tune to the new digital transformation of the production scenario.

Digital technology is the backbone in achieving the target of revenue generation of manufacturing organizations in the coming days. However, some industries like electronics, smart phones, and automobile sectors have been adopted digital technology for process automation and efficient supply chain to gain revenue through customer satisfaction. Hence it is very much needed to examine the key factors that are accountable for energizing the manufacturing industries nowadays. This study extracted twelve key factors through critical literature reviews that are influencing the manufacturing industries during Covid-19. Finally, the interrelationship between these factors is leading to an interpretive structural model with seven levels as shown in The limitations of this research are the potential future scope for other researchers.",

In the future, more factors regarding the performance of the manufacturing sectors can be added to obtain a more clear view of this study. Statistical modeling and a fuzzy approach may be used to get more dimensions of the factors. No doubt, the critical findings of this study will be a guideline to realize the weightage of digital technology to the stakeholders of manufacturing sectors to achieve revenue in the post-covid industrial era.",

Third, a list of key factors that are pre-cursors to revenue generation in industries was prepared and sent to the experts for final evaluation. The experts used the five-point Likert Scale (0 for No influence; 1 for very low influence; 2 for low influence; 3 for high influence; influence) to eliminate the factors which possess low rating and no influence on revenue generation in industries[67]. We had the privilege of talking to 15 experts from an online webinar interaction regarding the \"Make in India\" theme held at KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha during the Covid pandemic. They enlightened us with their opinions which formed the basis of our data (key factors) for the ISM model. Out of fifteen experts, nine from different industrial sectors like automobile, electronics, chemical, textile, and six from academia with minimum associate professor level have been chosen for the study. Selected industry experts are having vast experience in manufacturing, supply chain, quality control, project management, human resources, and R&D management field. Similarly, academia has been selected based on their research regarding disruptions in the supply chain, productivity management, quality improvement, and digital technology application field. The number of experts selected for this research is sufficient as ISM does not put a limit on the sample size of experts. Moreover, researchers in the past have also considered a similar sample size. Thus, the number of participation of experts for this study is adequate as per the views of past researchers ([68];[69]).",

Therefore ISM is a suitable tool for this J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f purpose. The choice of the framework is suitable as this methodology provides a means, by which a group can impose an order on the complexity of the items. ISM offers a variety of advantages such as the experts' subjective judgments and their knowledge base is incorporated most systematically and provides ample opportunity for revision of judgments. Computational efforts involved are very less for objectives (items) ranging in ten to fifteen numbers and it can be used as a handy tool in real-life applications. But there are a few limitations to ISM such as it does not determine the intensity of relationships. Moreover, the results obtained through the ISM model may be influenced due to biased judgments of the experts, which can be alleviated by experts' experience and depth in giving unbiased opinions. So, ISM is a robust method for our research in identifying and building a model to describe the challenges and solutions to industries for revenue generation as a strategy to the post-covid era of industrial paradigm.",

Results and Discussion This research seeks to investigate and establish a structural relationship among the key factors affecting manufacturing industries during Covid-19 using the ISM framework. MICMAC analysis entails the valuable insights of identified key factors through their driving powers and dependence. The critical outcomes of this research are stated hereafter. No such factor resides in the independent quadrant. The autonomous factor constitutes low driving power and weak dependence. It is inferred that there's no unfocused factor that exists in the identified key factors of the study which in turn manufacturers are focusing on all the factors with equal importance. Factors like revenue generation (F5), product diversification and JIT (F4), efficient supply chain (F7), and centralized decision making (F3) are falling under the dependent quadrant. These factors having high dependence power with low driving powers. They are set up at the peak level of the ISM hierarchy which is shown in",

            "text": "This result represents that revenue generation (F5) is the long-term focus and desired objective of the study which can be achieved by product diversification and JIT (F4). Similarly, product diversification and JIT (F4) may be executed by an efficient supply chain (F7) and centralized decision making (F3). These are the solutions for manufacturing industries during Covid-19.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f There are three factors like F1, F6 and F9 are visible in the linkage quadrant.These factors are having high driving with high dependant power which is considered as unstable factors. Any modifications to these factors will influence other factors and also feedback on themselves. The outcome reveals that the significance of artificial intelligence (F1), the significance of the internet of things (F6), and the significance of big data analysis (F9) are unstable in manufacturing industries as per the interpretation of MICMAC analysis. In this study, these factors have been termed as initial solutions as shown inTable 1and these factors are leading all the solutions like product diversification and JIT (F4), efficient supply chain (F7), centralized decision making (F3), and eventually revenue generation (F5). Hence digital technology is considered as the vaccine for manufacturing industries during Covid-19. The factors like F8, F2, F10, F12, and F11 are categorized as driving factors or independent factors due to their more driving power with less dependent power. These short-term-focused factors are placed at the bottom of the ISM hierarchy and taken into consideration as strategic orientation factors. Covid-19 (F8), lack of resources (F2), transportation constraints (F10), lack of operational performance (F12), and unavailability of the buyer (F11) are the real challenges during Covid-19 and are considered for immediate attention to driving other factors toward accomplishing the favored objective like revenue generation. It is essential to enhance constantly independent factors like Covid-19 (F8), lack of resources (F2), transportation constraints (F10) will enhance the performance of manufacturing sectors during the pandemic. The discussion elucidates several lessons learned that are highlighted as: \uf0b7 Covid-19(F8) is the short-term focused factor that has forced the manufacturing industries throughout the world to rethink the strategy of their operations. \uf0b7 The challenges to be addressed due to F8 are the independent or driving factors such as lack of resources (F2), transportation constraints (F10), lack of operational performance (F12), and unavailability of the buyer (F11). These require high priority immediate focus to be resolved to attain the ultimate long-term goal of revenue generation (F5). \uf0b7 The high driving and high dependence power or unstable factors are the linkages between \"problem\" and \"solution\" factors. These provide the platform J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to bring about solutions for the immediate problems under Covid-19. These are the significance of artificial intelligence (F1), the significance of the internet of things (F6), and the significance of big data analysis (F9). These are termed the \"initial solutions\" in the ISM model proposed. \uf0b7 The dependent factors are the solutions or the objectives that need to be achieved to bring forth the \"final objective\" of revenue generation (F5). These are the solution aspects of the model. These are centralized decision making (F3), efficient supply chain (F7), product diversification and JIT (F4), and Revenue generation (F5). Hence it is summarized that digital technology like the significance of artificial intelligence, the significance of the internet of things, and the significance of big data analysis is the key initial solution of the challenges like Covid-19, lack of resources, transportation constraints, lack of operational performance and unavailability of buyers. The unique interpretation of ISM analysis in this research illustrates the following: \uf0d8 This paper interprets the result where inputs like the pairwise relationship between the factors based on expert opinion. \uf0d8 The contextual relationship entails the influencing nature of the factors, such as the significance of AI, IoT, and big data are leading the centralized decision making to make supply chain efficient where most works of literature are prioritizing strategies, time to recovery, time to restore and performance impact to build supply chain efficient ([84],[85]). \uf0d8 The outcomes of MICMAC analysis communicate that significance of AI, IoT, and big data are in the linkage phase which indicates that these technologies are still in an unstable zone for most of the manufacturing industries. Where some past authors have not considered the significance of these digital technologies for manufacturing competitiveness in Covid-implications of the research are evident. The industries which are collapsing under the pressure of the novel corona virus have to reinstate themselves by modifying their strategies. This model will aid in their visualization of the pathway to initiate the change. The managerial implications for the research are: \uf0b7 The model is a solution to tackle the lack-luster and struggling scenario of manufacturing industries \uf0b7 Digital technology is the apparent rescuer to mitigate changes in strategy \uf0b7 Revenue generation is the practical goal to the survival of any industry, to which managers are committed; this research may act as a catalyst to reinforce implementations. The resources that are represented by 4M's (Material, Men, Machine, and Money) are being squeezed by the pandemic. Under such circumstances, it turns into an",

            "text": "In this ISM, revenue generation is located at the peak of the hierarchy and termed as level 1 which is most dependent on other factors. Hence, revenue generation is considered as the desired goal of the study and the long-term focus factor. On the otherJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f end, the impact of Covid-19 is placed at level 7 which influencing other factors with its strongest driving power. Hence, Covid-19 leads to resource constraints. Transportation constraints ultimately drive towards the unavailability of buyers due to a lack of operational performance. Then, MICMAC analysis was performed. The recognized factors are categorized into four distinct clusters, based on their driving and dependent power. The results of the study reveal the nonexistence of independent factors. There are four dependent factors, three linkage factors, and five independent com driving factors as shown in Figure 3. The identified independent factors such as Covid-19 (F8), lack of resources (F2), transportation constraints (F10), lack of operational performance (F12), and unavailability of the buyer (F11) are the real challenges cum drivers of manufacturing sectors during the pandemic scenario. Therefore, immediate care should be taken to these challenges. Similarly, factors like revenue generation (F5), product diversification & JIT (F4), efficient supply chain (F7), and centralized decision making (F3) are dependent factors cum real solutions to the manufacturing industries during an epidemic environment. But the policymakers should more concentrate on digital technology factors such as the significance of artificial intelligence (F1), the significance of the internet of things (F6), and the significance of big data analysis (F9) which are unstable in nature. Therefore digital technology factors are the initial solutions to the real challenges like lack of operational performance and unavailability of the buyer during Covid-19 and a solution provider to achieving revenue through product diversification with just-in-time production, efficient supply chain, and process automation. This research has a deep impact on the manufacturing industries of the world that are searching for various ways to enhance their production and revenues during the novel pandemic situation. The model is a formidable way to visualize the problem and its associated solutions through the application of the latest technology to get back to the track. The renewed strategies that could be devised for which this research is a precursor will definitely solve the problem in all types of industries. The variety of applications of the same concept will cater to the needs of different industries. The outcomes of the interpretive structural model provide valuable information and deep insights to the stakeholders of manufacturing sectors regarding the significance of digital technology factors. The advanced analytics and digital technology gave new insight into the flexibility of data storage. The significance of AI, IoT and big data are all opening the gates to the amalgamation of digital technology.

            "text": "The conditions, nature, and outcomes of global economic development are inextricably linked to technical advancements and scientific progress at all levels, from individual industries to national economies, influencing billions of people worldwide. The processes of \"digitalization,\" the penetration of new technologies, and the principles of completing both routine and innovative tasks based on the Internet in areas such as retail, housing and car rental, workspace organization (cloud solutions, etc.) are becoming increasingly popular, and they have already made and are continuing to make significant changes to traditional social relations systems. The methodological foundation of work is a set of scientific knowledge methods in the form of general scientific and special research procedures.The following research methods were employed to attain the defined aim and complete the tasks: critical analysis, scientific abstraction, and generalization of modern theoretical studies' scientific experience; analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, system analysis, and expert method. The blockchain's constant and unchanging, permanent nature allows, among other things, to use the blockchain as a bank, \"storing\" data in it, owing to the presence of tens of thousands of computer nodes on the network (to break and compromise with it, theoretically, with computing power would be unthinkable). Many retail chains will be able to incorporate ready-made blockchain solutions into their delivery processes in the future, enhancing customer confidence while cutting expenses associated with the usage of a relatively inefficient paper accounting system. Using a single personnel database on the blockchain, which will be cryptographically protected, processes such as job search and hiring may be substantially simplified and made more transparent.The Covid-19 data collected in the form of epidemiological data, clinical data, or genetic data are managed and processed through AI, machine learning, and deep learning to find solutions to combat Covid-19 such as prevention, diagnosis, therapeutics, and hospital operation[1]. To sum up the benefits of digital technology as a savior to Covid-19 are significant in multiple ways. It can help plan the activities and provide a better experience in healthcare sectors and industries without imposing risks to workers[25]. The smart supply chain can be beneficial to provide service in time especially in the healthcare and industrial domain[17]. The issue of training can be accomplished by virtual reality and it helps perform daily life work during the lockdown. Digital technology is also useful for risk assessment of demand trends, innovations, and product diversification[26].Many recent pieces of research have focused on the importance of digital technologies to solve the problems of social, economic, and environmental crisis due to Covid-19 and its impacts, but none of them have chalked out the model to revive the manufacturing industries from this precarious situation. This gap is addressed in the research which intends to develop a model to delineate the clogged channels of revenue generation within the organization due to Covid-19 impacts. It may be considered as a survival strategy as the model attempts to address the crisis of 4M's (Men, Material, Machine, and Money) and constraints like transportation during the pandemic and elucidates a pathway to create revenue for the best interest of the organization. Thus, the research addresses the following research questions:RQ1:To identify the factors which may influence the revenue generation in dependence power of the influential factors. The outcomes of ISM are utilized as an input to MICMAC investigation.
