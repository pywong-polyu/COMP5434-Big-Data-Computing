A promising approach for vaccine development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated virus. this approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses, for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RnA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus. Our analysis identified the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimization and suggests a roadmap for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, which can be generalizable to other viruses.",

As of June 9, 2020 there have been 6,931,000 confirmed cases and 400,857 deaths from COVID-19 worldwide 1 . Given the urgency to combat this pandemic, multiple efforts to develop effective vaccines are underway. A relatively recent approach for vaccine development, first proposed by Coleman et al. in 2008 for the attenuation of poliovirus 2 , has been used for the attenuation of dozens of viruses, and more recently for bacteria 3 . This approach accomplishes viral attenuation through codon pair deoptimization and appears to be promising for vaccine development, particularly against emerging viruses, as it does not require extensive virus-specific knowledge. It does, however, require knowledge of the viral genome sequence and extensive characterization of its codon and codon pair usage attributes.",

It is thought that preferred codons correspond to more abundant tRNAs, and therefore, are translated more efficiently 6 . Similarly, there is bias in codon pair usage, with certain codon pairs occurring at a much different frequency than would be expected based on the codon usage 5 . Codon pair usage also appears to affect translation efficiency 6 , although the mechanism is not entirely clear, and it has been argued that dinucleotide usage, particularly CpG dinucleotides, may be the driving force in determining viral sequence fitness, while codon pair bias may be a secondary effect of altered dinucleotide frequency 7 . CpG dinucleotides are known to stimulate immune responses and inhibit virion production through their interaction with toll like receptor-9 (TLR9) 8 and the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) 9 . For these reasons they are commonly used as vaccine adjuvants for many viruses including coronaviruses 10 .",

However, it is worth noting that viral codon usage often does not closely resemble the codon usage of their hosts 12, 13 , a phenomenon that is not well understood. In this regard, a thorough characterization of codon, codon pair and dinucleotide usage of SARS-CoV-2 can provide useful information regarding expression potential of the viral genes and the fitness of the virus in its human or other hosts. Furthermore, it has been shown that viral attenuation can be achieved through extensive changes in codon pair usage of viral genes 2 . Since the mechanism of viral attenuation through codon pair deoptimization is not entirely clear, this in-depth analysis is necessary to guide the development of new vaccines. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a large genome of about 30 kb encoding multiple proteins 14 . Translation of a positive-stranded RNA from the initial infectious virus particles generates (among other proteins) a virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replicase). This replicase is necessary for viral replication and subsequent generation of viral subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs), from which the synthesis of structural and accessory proteins occurs 14 . ORF1ab, which encodes the replicase polyprotein (among other proteins) occupies about two thirds of the 5\u2032 prime end of this genome 14, 15 . A \u2212 1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) occurs half-way through ORF1ab, allowing the translation of ORF1b 14 . The efficiency of the frameshift thus modulates the relative ratios of proteins encoded by ORF1b and the upstream ORF1a and is critical for coronavirus propagation. Frameshift efficiency (ranging from 15 to 60%) in \u2212 1 PRFs is commonly regulated by pseudoknotted mRNA structures following the frameshift, and the conservation of a three-stem pseudoknot in coronaviruses has been previously characterized 16 . Following ORF1ab, are the spike (S), ORF3a, envelope (E), membrane (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, nucleocapsid (N) and ORF10 genes. The S protein promotes attachment and fusion to the host cell, during infection 17 . In the case of SARS-CoV-2, S binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 15, 18, 19 . The E protein is an ion channel and regulates virion assembly 20 . The M protein also participates in virus assembly and in the biosynthesis of new virus particles 21 , while the N protein forms the ribonucleoprotein complex with the virus RNA 22 and has several functions, such as enhancing transcription of the viral genome and interacting with the viral membrane protein during virion assembly 23 . Many of the other ORFs have unknown functions or are not well characterized 24 , as their presence is not consistent across all coronaviruses.",

We have taken advantage of our recently published databases, which include genomic codon usage statistics for all species with available sequence data, and transcriptomic codon usage statistics from several human tissues 4, 5, 28 . We further analyzed each viral gene in terms of its codon characteristics and used an array of codon usage metrics that informed us of the potential of each gene sequence to contribute to the deoptimization of the virus. In the case of ORF1ab, we further examined the structure of the mRNA in the region following the frameshift, finding the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA to exhibit a similar pseudoknotted structure to known coronaviruses. We identified two viral genes, S and N, that represent valuable targets for deoptimization to generate an attenuated virus. In the future we plan to continue this in silico study with an experimental investigation of deoptimized virus and test whether the deoptimized S and/or N proteins are immunogenic, produce epitopes that are neutralizing, and result in antibodies that are escape-resistant. We believe, that our combined analysis can be used as a pipeline to guide codon pair deoptimization for viral attenuation and vaccine development or a posteriori to evaluate the effectiveness of the attenuation of a viral sequence.",

Over 5,000 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes are currently accessible in GenBank, with various mutations. To determine which SARS-CoV-2 sequence was most appropriate to use, we retrieved all the published sequences of the virus available in NCBI's SARS-CoV-2 data hub (5,064 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes); after excluding incomplete and low-quality sequences and CDSs with insertions or deletions, we calculated the percent difference in codon usage between these and the reference sequence. The average percent difference in codon usage was ~ 0.08%, or ~ 8 codons/10,000, clearly showing that variation in sequences is not significantly affecting overall codon usage. This degree of mutation between strains is corroborated by a recently published study 29 , and is encouraging as it suggests that escape mutants are unlikely to develop, even for viral genes that have the highest selection pressure such as the S protein. Furthermore, we examined genetic diversity data from Nextstrain 30 , accounting for 4,675 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. From these sequences, there are 293 codon positions (~ 23% of the S gene) with reported Shannon entropies, i.e. with a documented mutation at that position. Among all other genes, there are 2,328 such positions (~ 27% of all non-S genes), indicating a higher percentage of mutated codons outside of the S gene.",

Codon pair data inherently contain the codon usage data and therefore are better suited than codon usage data for this type of comparison. As expected, SARS-CoV-2 codon pair usage closely resembles the codon usage of the coronoviridae family, while it is quite distinct from the codon pair usage of the human genome (Table 1) . Bat (Chiroptera) and pangolin (Pholidota) from which the virus may have been transmitted to humans, as well as dog (Canis lupus familiaris) to which the virus is feared may be transmitted next, were included in the analysis. We find that these species have a similar codon usage when compared with human; therefore, viral tropism cannot be inferred based on codon usage data alone (Table 1) . Since SARS-CoV-2 infects bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes and our recent findings show that transcriptomic tissue-specific codon Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:15643 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72533-2 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ pair usage can vary greatly from genomic codon pair usage 28 , we also examined the transcriptomic codon pair usage of the lung and how it compares with the SARS-CoV-2 codon pair usage. Rather surprisingly, the codon pair usage in the lung was more distinct from SARS-CoV-2 codon pair usage than the Homo sapiens genomic codon pair usage. The transcriptomic codon pair usage of kidney and small intestine, tissues that are also susceptible to the infection, are similarly distant from SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) . Recently, it was argued that some degree of dissimilation in codon usage between the virus and the host may be beneficial to the virus, as it does not severely impede host gene translation 11 .",

Viral gene codon usage properties. We next sought to examine each viral gene separately in terms of their codon and codon pair usage. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and codon pair score (CPS) are commonly used metrics to describe the codon and codon pair usage bias, respectively. RSCU expresses the observed over expected synonymous codon usage ratio, while CPS is the natural log of the observed over expected synonymous codon pair ratio using observed individual codon usage 2,38 . In our analyses, RSCU and CPS are derived from human genomic codon and codon pair usage frequencies. For ease of comparison, we used ln(RSCU) to measure the codon usage bias. The average CPS across a gene is referred to as codon pair bias (CPB) of the gene 2 . The average ln(RSCU) and CPB of each viral gene was calculated and compared with host genes average ln(RSCU) and CPB (Fig. 5) . The average RSCU, ln(RSCU) and CPB of each viral gene appear www.nature.com/scientificreports/ in Table 2 . ORF10 was strikingly the least similar gene to the human genome in terms of both its codon and codon pair usage, followed by the E gene. These genes provide little opportunity for deoptimization, since their sequence is already far from optimal. On the other hand, genes S and N are more similar to human in terms of their codon pair usage. To explore further the potential for codon pair deoptimization, we plotted their CPS across their sequence (Supplemental Figure 2 and Fig. 6 ). As seen in these figures all viral genes use mostly rare codons (ln(RSCU) < 0); however, it is striking that ORF6 and ORF10 use almost exclusively rare codons, while ",

            "text": "We performed a comprehensive characterization of the codon, codon pair and dinucleotide usage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the intention to identify the best targets for codon pair deoptimization in order to design an attenuated virus for vaccine development. Genes N and S were singled out as the best potential targets for deoptimization, due to the relatively high CPB among the viral genes. Furthermore, they are structural proteins with known functions, which will facilitate subsequent studies. Currently, most published attempts of viral attenuation through codon pair deoptimization do not discuss the strategy for selecting which genes to deoptimize. Although codon pair deoptimization has been proven successful for viral attenuation 2,39,40 , the mechanism is not clear. In addition, it is reasonable to assume that for every successful published deoptimization attempt, there may be several unsuccessful and therefore unpublished ones. Similarly, there have been successful attempts to generate attenuated viruses through codon deoptimization [41] [42] [43] [44] . Understanding the mechanism that leads to viral attenuation requires a thorough characterization of the viral sequence and of the consequences of sequence changes. There are several factors that may contribute to the efficacy of deoptimization strategies. In changing the codon pair usage, the dinucleotide frequency and the GC content are altered; mRNA secondary structure and translational kinetics are also perturbed. Further, the CpG content is changing, leading potentially to altered immunogenicity. It is likely that codon pair (or codon) deoptimization leads to reduced expression, either due to changes in transcription, mRNA stability, or translation www.nature.com/scientificreports/ efficiency 45, 46 . Alternatively, it is possible that deoptimization may lead to perturbed cotranslational folding 47 , resulting in altered protein conformation. In the case of the S protein, this may lead to decreased binding affinity for the ACE2 protein, thus affecting viral fitness. A number of parameters were considered in determining which proteins could be targets for codon pair deoptimization. It has been shown that deoptimizing one third or less of the virus is sufficient to attenuate the virus, and more extensive deoptimization may lead to a completely inactive virus 48 . ORF1ab takes up about two thirds of the virus; therefore, its size may make it an unsuitable target. Furthermore, altering its RNA sequence is likely to disturb the pseudoknot that is responsible for frameshifting. Since we have identified the sequence that is responsible for the frameshift, a partial codon pair deoptimization is possible. However, ORF1ab is essential for genome replication, which also does not support its capacity as a codon deoptimization target.",

The E gene also has a very low CPB; interestingly, although ORF10 has both positive and negative CPS across its sequence, E has mostly negative CPSs, which make it unsuited for codon pair deoptimization. ORF7a is unusual, as it has the highest RSCU of the viral genes, but a rather low CPB (it uses preferred codons in unusual combinations). Although ORF7a is not the most compelling target for codon pair deoptimization, if a codon deoptimization strategy is attempted, this gene should be considered. It should, however, be noted that since it overlaps for a few nucleotides with ORF7b, any sequence changes should be considered in coordination for both genes.",

The S protein, which binds to the cell-surface receptor and induces virus-cell membrane fusion, has the highest CPB score of all viral proteins, leading to significant flexibility for codon pair deoptimization. It should be noted that although protein S is a surface protein and is expected to be under pressure to avoid the immune system, an examination of the variants that have emerged over the past few months indicates that the S gene does not appear to mutate at a faster rate than other SARS-CoV-2 genes. The N protein, which forms the ribonucleoprotein complex with the virus RNA, is the most conserved and stable protein among the coronavirus structural proteins. It uses mostly codon pairs with intermediate frequency; thus, it could be substantially codon pair deoptimized. The next step, which is beyond the scope of this in silico study, is to construct the deoptimized virus and test its infectivity, ability to replicate, and whether it retains any pathogenicity. The study should investigate whether deoptimized S and/or N proteins are immunogenic, produce epitopes that are neutralizing, and result in antibodies that are escape-resistant. While testing the fitness of the virus, our strategy of selecting targets would be tested and validated, which could lead to better understanding of the factors that make codon pair deoptimization successful in generating attenuated viruses. While these planned steps are essential in the experimental validation of our strategy, we aimed to provide the scientific community with the framework that would allow anyone to independently proceed towards engineering a codon deoptimized SARS-CoV-2 for vaccine development.",
