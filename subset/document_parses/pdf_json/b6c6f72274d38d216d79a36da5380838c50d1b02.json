Generally, the missing electron densities point towards the intrinsically disordered nature of the protein region. This curiosity has led us to investigate the C terminal cytosolic region of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in isolation. The cytosolic regions is supposed to be from 1235-1273 residues or 1242-1273 residues depending on what prediction tool we use. Therefore, we have demonstrated the structural conformation of cytosolic region and its dynamics through computer simulations up to microsecond timescale using OPLS and CHARMM forcefields. The simulations have revealed the unstructured conformation of cytosolic region. Also, in temperature dependent replicaexchange molecular dynamics simulations it has shown its conformational dynamics. Further, we have validated our computational observations with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy-based experiments and found its signature spectra at 198 nm which is also adding the analysis as its intrinsically disordered nature. We believe that our findings will surely help us understand the structure-function relationship of the spike protein's cytosolic region.",

So far, based on Uniprot database, approximately two hundred structures have been reported using Xray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy techniques. However, these structures consist of S1 subunit of spike but lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic C-terminal regions present in S2 subunit or with missing electron densities in cytoplasmic region. The distal S1 subunit Figure 1) . The C-terminal domain of S1 is the receptor-binding domain or RBD, has a receptorbinding motif (RBM) which interacts with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), chief target receptor of SARS-CoV-2 on human cells [3] . RBM is present as an extended loop insertion which binds to bottom side of the small lobe of ACE2 receptor. The S2 subunit (residues 686-1273) has a hydrophobic fusion peptide, two heptad repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (Figure 1 ). states, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. Based on prediction of transmembrane region in the spike protein by CCTOP, a consensus-based predictor, the boundaries of all domains have been defined. As per CCTOP prediction, the transmembrane region of spike lies within the residues 1216-1241, and so, the cytoplasmic region of spike has been used in this study with the residues 1242-1273.",

            "text": "As of yet, cytoplasmic domain of spike protein is the least explored region despite of such extensive research in pandemic times. It is of particular importance as it contains a conserved ER retrieval signal (KKXX) [4] . In SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, a novel dibasic KLHYT (KXHXX) motif present at extreme ends of the C-terminus plays a crucial role in its subcellular localization [5] [6] [7] . Also, deletions in cytoplasmic domain of coronavirus spike are implicated in viral infection in recent reports [8] [9] [10] [11] . SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike having a deletion of last ~20 residues displayed increased infectivity of single-cycle vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-S pseudotypes [8, 9] . Contrarily, short truncations of cytoplasmic domain of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) spike protein (\u25b312 and \u25b3 25) had limited effect on viral infectivity while the long truncation of 35 residues interfered with both viral-host cell membrane fusion and assembly. Importantly, it is also shown to interact with the membrane protein inside host cells [10] . In our previous report, the cytoplasmic tail is predicted to be a MoRF (Molecular Recognition Feature) region (residues 1265-1273) by a predictor MoRFchibi [7] . The MoRF regions in proteins are disorder-based binding regions that contribute the binding to DNA, RNA, and other proteins. In the same report, it is also found to contain many DNA and RNA binding residues [7] .",

Long MD simulations up to microseconds or milliseconds are incredibly insightful to study structural conformations occurring at the nanoscale level. We have recently explored various regions of different SARS-CoV-2 proteins through computational simulations and experimental techniques that are very well correlated [28, 37] . This study performed 1 \u00b5s MD simulations of C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of spike protein (1242-1273 residues) to understand its dynamic nature. As obtained from structure modelling through PEP-FOLD, the model contains two small helices at both terminals with residues 1243 CLKGC 1247 and 1265 LKGV 1268 (Figure 4A & 4B) . According to 2struc webserver [38] , these helices contribute to 12.5% of total secondary structure while rest of the region is constituted by turns and extended coils. The secondary structure prediction of spike C-terminal tail region contains a strand of five residues 1262 EPVLK 1266 , as predicted by PSIPRED webserver [17] (Figure 4C ). ",

In a good correlation with computer simulations, the spike cytoplasmic region has been confirmed to be disordered with a signature negative ellipticity peak at 198 nm (Figure 12) . Further, we have also investigated the gain-of-structure property of spike cytoplasmic region. For this purpose, we have employed a well-known secondary structure inducer, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). TFE weakens H-bonds between NH and CO of the protein backbone with surrounding H 2 O and if observed to stabilize the intra-chain H-bonds during secondary structure formation [42] .

Contrarily to TFE, on addition of SDS, no significant change in disordered nature is observed. As evident from Figure 13C and 13D. not much gain in negative ellipticity at 208 nm and 222 nm is detected using CD spectroscopy.

Crowding conditions can substantially affect several thermodynamic processes such as protein folding, change of conformation, and protein aggregation, etc. [44] . ne The existence of IDPs/IDPRs was established based on non-existing electron density of some regions in proteins during crystallography [12, 46] . This unmapped electron density of characterized protein was later described as intrinsic disorderness of proteins. With increasingly published articles and revelation of presence of IDPs in frequently studied living systems, IDPs have been found prevalent in all three domains of life [46] . For a long period, the structure elucidation of transmembrane regions was not feasible due to their complex process of purification and crystallization [47] . It was also reported in a study on survey of disordered regions in eukaryotic proteins that the water-soluble cytoplasmic tails of membrane spanning proteins constitute intrinsic disorder [48] . These disordered regions are generally rich in certain residues such as proline, glycine, lysine and serine, and contains hydrophobic residues to form a core while folding [49] .

Additionally, in another simulation run of 1 \u00b5s, the cytoplasmic region with residues 1235-1273 have also shown a large part to be disordered and a small beta strand in few frames. As observed, the residues 1257 KFD 1259 have shown propensity to form beta strands in simulations. Nevertheless, in REMD simulations, it adopted \u03b2 -sheets at rising temperatures with time demonstrating its gain-ofstructure property. However, we also tried to get the synthesized peptide of residues 1235-1273 of spike but due to multiple cysteine residues it was not feasible.",

The water-soluble peptide of spike residues 1242-1273 at 25\u00b5M concentration exhibits a prominent negative peak at approximately 198 nm in far-UV CD spectra which defines the unstructured nature of a protein. Further, in presence of helix inducer solvent, TFE, the peptide adopts helical structure. However, SDS micelles in surroundings of peptide generates little changes in the peptide structure which may signify its inability to gain fold. In presence of crowding agents like sucrose and PEG (8000), conservation of disordered structure indicates that no -intra chain forces are acting in between the residues. Based on this combination of facts, we have interpreted that spike C-terminal cytosolic tail (residues 1242-1273) as an intrinsically disordered region.",

Given its extreme importance in functioning of spike protein, the structure and its dynamics has been investigated here. The advancement in computational powers and excessive improvements in forcefields have empowered structural biology. Newly developed algorithms and their userfriendly approach allow correlating the outcomes with experimental observations. In this article, we have identified the transmembrane region in spike protein by employing distinguished web predictors. This cleared the composition of amino acids forming cytoplasmic domain. Further, the secondary structure and disorder predisposition analysis demonstrated it to be highly disordered. We have demonstrated the structural conformation of cytoplasmic domain (1242-1273 residues) of spike protein at a microsecond timescale using computational simulations. As revealed, this domain is purely unstructured or disordered after one microsecond and have not gained any structural conformation throughout the simulation period. Experimental outcomes also confirm the intrinsic disordered state of cytoplasmic domain of spike. The intrinsic disordered nature of peptide is shown in presence of macromolecular crowders. Based on our previous study [7] , cytoplasmic tail of spike glycoprotein has molecular recognition features therein which needs to be explored further. In this study, the multiple conformations during the simulation process adds up to even more interesting speculations.",

Secondary structure analysis using PSIPRED web server.After analyzing the disorder propensity and secondary structure composition, we performed a rigorous simulation of cytoplasmic region (residues 1242-1273) to understand its atomic movement and structural integrity. A total of 1 \u00b5s simulation was done after 50,method-based energy minimization. It has been observed that the structure of spike C-terminal cytoplasmic region remains to be unstructured throughout the simulation. Based on mean distance analysis, the peptide simulation setup showed massive deviations up to 7.5 \u00c5 which does not attain any stable state (Figure 5A). As shown infigure 5B, mean fluctuation in residues is observed to be within the range of 1.6 -6.4 \u00c5. The intramolecular hydrogen bond analysis demonstrates the highly fluctuating trend portraying no stable helical or beta sheet conformation adoption by the residues(Figure 5E). The secondary structure timeline (Figure 5C & 5D) also reveals the disordered state of spike C-terminal cytoplasmic region during the 1 \u00b5s simulation time (none of the frames captured \u03b1 -helix or \u03b2 -sheets) which is further depicted in the snapshot of 1 \u00b5s frame in figure 5F and the trajectory movie upto 1 \u00b5s (supplementary One microsecond MD Simulation analysis of spike C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (1242-1273) using OPLS 2005 forcefield: A.

In modelled structure, the helical propensity in cytosolic region was shown by 1237-1245 residues. Using above described OPLS 2005 forcefield parameters, the all-atoms explicit solvent MD simulation was carried out for 1 \u00b5s. The trajectory analysis has been shown in supplementary figure 1, the cytosolic region has revealed majorly unstructured region along with a small \u03b2 -strand of two residues 1258 FD 1259 after 1 \u00b5s. The upward trend of RMSD values illustrates the highly deviating atomic positions and fluctuating RMSF shows the change in structural property of residues (supplementary figure 1A & 1B). Also, the decreasing number of hydrogen bonds demonstrates the breaking of helices in the structure (supplementary figure 1C). The time-dependent secondary structure element analysis illustrates that a total of 15% secondary structure was formed that includes mainly alpha helix and small percentage of beta strands (supplementary figure 1D & 1E; red: alpha helix and blue: beta strands). After huge structural transitions, the structural composition of last frame of simulation is shown with a small beta strand of two residues and other regions to be disordered (supplementary figure 1F).

Here, according to our observations, in presence of either of the crowders at high concentrations up to 300 g/L (generally 80-400 g/L in cells [45]), no change in secondary structure is observed. At all concentrations of PEG 8000, the negative ellipticity at 198 nm is seen to be similar to disordered spectra with only a minimal shift in wavelength. Whereas, in presence of another crowder, sucrose, an increment in negative ellipticity from -2 deg cm 2 dmol -1 to -55 deg cm 2 dmol -1 is observed with increasing concentrations up to 300 g/L which demonstrates the disorderedness in the peptide. Also, a minimal shift in wavelength from 198 nm to 194 nm is detected. Overall, no noticeable changes are observed in spike cytoplasmic region in presence of crowders (Figure 14). These results are indicative of absence of weaker hydrophobic forces and electrostatic interactions among residues. These observations clearly explain that the spike endodomain or cytoplasmic domain is intrinsically disordered even under macromolecular crowding conditions.",
