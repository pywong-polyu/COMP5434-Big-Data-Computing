[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] By sequencing 20,453 SARS-CoV-2 genomes dating from March 2020 to early February 2021, we recently demonstrated all major variants of concern (VOCs) or interest (VOIs) are circulating in metropolitan Houston (population 7 million). 4 These variants emerged in Houston in late December or early January. In the aggregate, the variants constituted only 1.1% of strains causing COVID-19 disease among patients in the eight Houston Methodist hospitals geographically dispersed throughout the metropolitan region. We identified 230 patients infected with a VOC or VOI, including 23 cases caused by B.1.1.7, a VOC reportedly increasing in frequency in several regions of the United States. 5 Given their potential to detrimentally alter the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and disease in individual patients, we tested the hypothesis that VOC and VOI are increasing in disease frequency in metropolitan Houston. We also sought to determine if any of the VOC/VOI caused an unusually severe clinical course.",

To gain additional insight into these B.1.1.7 cases, we examined available patient metadata. Compared to non-B.1.1.7 cases, there was no significant difference in patient age, gender, median length of stay, or mortality (Table 1). However, significantly more patients with B.1.1.7 were hospitalized. Nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with the B.1.1.7 VOC had significantly lower Ct values (frequently used as a proxy for virus load) compared to non-B.1.1.7 cases, suggesting higher virus loads on initial diagnosis (Table 1). This finding is consistent with increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7. Discussion. Our genome sequence data document a very rapid upward trajectory of VOC B.1.1.7 cases in metropolitan Houston.
