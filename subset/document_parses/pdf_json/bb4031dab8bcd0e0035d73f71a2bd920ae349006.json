This study aimed to evaluate the level of adherence to SCMs and associated factors among smokers and ex-smokers in Australia. Method: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Australia. Descriptive statistics were used to present the overall characteristics of participants. Cross-tabulation with Pearson's chi-square test was performed to evaluate the possible associations between factors. To explore barriers and facilitators of adherence to SCMs, logistic regressions were conducted. Results: Among 201 participants, 57 (28.4%) were found to be adherent to SCMs. The odds of being adherent were found to be higher among participants with good social support (AOR = 3.28, 95% CI of 2.30-6.27). Participants who did not experience anxiety symptoms had higher odds of being adherent to SCMs as compared to smokers who had anxiety symptoms (AOR = 4.41, 95% CI of 3.64-14.68). Having previous experience of using SCMs improved adherence four-fold (AOR = 3.87, 95% CI of 1.11-13.44). Level of nicotine dependence showed a direct association with adherence (AOR = 3.53, 95% CI of 1.40-8.95). Not relapsing while on the medications improved adherence (AOR = 2.88, 95% CI of 1.21-6.88). Conclusion: In a study of smokers and ex-smokers in Australia, the self-reported level of adherence to SCMs was found to be low. Adherence was associated with social, psychological, and medication-related factors. Smoking cessation interventions are recommended to include strategies that can address medication adherence.",

The age of the participants was collected as a continuous variable and categorized into two classes: as young and middle-aged adults (18-55 years old) and older adults (>55 years old). A previous study using this age group classification illustrated a significant difference in adherence between the age groups [22] . The Australian Statistical Geography Standard-Remoteness Area guideline was used to classify geographical remoteness by using participants' postal codes [23] . The 2016 socioeconomic index for areas (SEIFA) created by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to evaluate the relative socioeconomic disadvantage (IRSD) was determined using postal codes [24] . At an Australian national standard of 1000, a score of lower than 1000 indicates relatively greater socioeconomic disadvantage, and a score of >1000 was categorized as \"nil/no\" socioeconomic disadvantage [25] . The educational level was split into four categories: never attended formal education, completed primary education, completed secondary education, and completed college and above. Marital status was collected as married, never married or separated/divorced/widowed. Geographical remoteness was measured in five classes: major cities, inner regional, outer regional, remote, and very remote in Australia.",

The majority of participants (85.6%) had at least one previous quit attempt, of which 65.2% had used smoking cessation medications during their previous quit attempts. The vast majority (71.6%) of participants used NRT in their recent quit attempt, whereas varenicline and bupropion were used by 19.9% and 8.5% of participants, respectively. Around 72.6% and 54.7% of participants believed smoking cessation medications were safe and effective, respectively. Relapse during a quit attempt characterized by smoking for more than two days per month while on the smoking cessation medications was reported by 64.2% of the participants. Among the participants, 82% reported craving for a cigarette during their quit attempt. The presence of other smokers at home during their quit attempt was reported by 41.3% of the participants. The chi-square test showed a possible association between adherence to smoking cessation medications and the extent of nicotine dependence, previous use and type of smoking cessation medication, forgetfulness, and relapse of smoking (Table 2) .

In a 2021 meta-analysis that included studies conducted mainly in the USA and UK, 26% of participants were found to be adherent to NRT. The meta-analysis showed higher rates of quitting among participants who were adherent to the medications and recommended that smoking cessation programs should consider ad-herence as one of the core components of the intervention [7] . In a study conducted among Korean smokers, 28.2% of participants used Varenicline for the recommended duration [33] . Adherence was reported to be higher in randomized controlled trial participants, at 61% and 74% among users of NRT [7] and bupropion [8] , respectively. RCT participants are likely to be more motivated to quit and obtain the necessary medication-related information, which may have contributed to this disagreement [7] . This could be due to various factors of smokers and health care providers, such as lack of time, lack of training, and motivation [34] . A study conducted in the UK showed disparities between the expressed needs of smokers and the health care providers' beliefs regarding the support required for adherence to NRT [35] . There is also a substantial discrepancy in asking about smoking status and assisting smokers to quit which may have affected the rate of adherence to the medications [34, 36] . Smoker-related factors associated with adherence to smoking cessation medications are discussed in the following paragraphs.",

Studies that reported an inverse association between nicotine dependence and adherence reported lower rates of quitting among individuals with more nicotine dependence and argue smoking status has a mediating effect between adherence and nicotine dependence [17, 40] . This may be due to fear of compound toxicity from the medication and the smoke [16] . Participants may also start to doubt themselves, and this may affect their self-efficacy, which could reduce their motivation to use the medication and quit smoking [41] .

The 2020 Australian Institute of Health and Wellbeing (AIHW) report indicated that a higher proportion of females than males (22% compared with 18%) had experienced symptoms in the previous 12 month period [47] . Symptoms of depression during quit attempts were reported to be as high as 40% in other studies [48] . Moreover, this study included participants who had experienced a quit attempt in the previous 12 months, in which time the COVID pandemic imposed a significant mental health challenge [49] . The experience of anxiety symptoms during a quit attempt negatively affected the rate of adherence to smoking cessation medications. Participants with no symptoms of anxiety had a four-fold increase in the odds of adherence. Similarly, other studies have also indicated the detrimental effect of psychological symptoms during quit attempts on adherence to medications [10, 11, 50] . This effect could be mediated by a higher level of relapse among participants with mental illnesses as compared to individuals with no psychological symptoms (24% vs. 12%) [51, 52] . Integrated interventions directed at smoking cessation and improving mental health have demonstrated an improved adherence to treatment and quitting [53] .",
