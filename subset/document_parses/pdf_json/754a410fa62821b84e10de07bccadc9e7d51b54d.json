There is a vast number of people without access to care because of economic, geographic, and cultural barriers as well as limited availability of clinical experts who could help advance our understanding of mental health. Objective : To create an open, configurable software platform to build clinical measures, mobile assessments, tasks, and interventions without programming expertise. Specifically, our primary requirements include: an administrator interface for creating and scheduling recurring and customized questionnaires where end users receive and respond to scheduled notifications via an iOS or Android app on a mobile device. Such a platform would help relieve overwhelmed health systems, and empower remote and disadvantaged subgroups in need of accurate and effective information, assessment, and care. This platform has potential to advance scientific research by supporting the collection of data with instruments tailored to specific scientific questions from large, distributed, and diverse populations. Methods: We conducted a search for tools that satisfy the above requirements. We designed and developed a new software platform called \"MindLogger\" that exceeds the above requirements. To demonstrate the tool's configurability, we built multiple \"applets\" (collections of activities) within the MindLogger mobile application and deployed several, including a comprehensive set of assessments underway in a large-scale, longitudinal, mental health study.",

            "text": "Of the hundreds of products we researched, we found 10 that met our primary requirements above with 4 that support end-to-end encryption, 2 that enable restricted access to individual users' data, 1 that provides open source software, and none that satisfy all three. We compared features related to information presentation and data capture capabilities, privacy and security, and access to the product, code, and data. We successfully built MindLogger mobile and web applications, as well as web browser-based tools for building and editing new applets and for administering them to end users. MindLogger has end-to-end encryption, enables restricted access, is open source, and supports a variety of data collection features. One applet is currently collecting data from children and adolescents in our mental health study, and other applets are in different stages of testing and deployment for use in clinical and research settings. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the flexibility and applicability of the MindLogger platform through its deployment in a large-scale, longitudinal, mobile mental health study, and by building a variety of other mental health-related applets. With this release, we encourage a broad range of users to apply the MindLogger platform to create and test applets to advance health care and scientific research. We hope that increasing availability of applets designed to assess and administer interventions will facilitate access to health care in the general population. . We thank the companies and organizations that responded to questions about and provided demonstrations of their products. We thank Rangle.io for their help in refactoring MindLogger's mobile app code base and Alpine Security for conducting penetration tests of the entire code base. We thank Paul Mitrani and Stephanie Samar for clinical feedback during the development of MindLogger applets, and volunteers Chynna Levin, Mairav Linzer, and Benjamin Vogel. Finally, we would like to thank all of our colleagues and collaborators around the world who have encouraged and helped guide the development of MindLogger in anticipation of using it for their many different data collection, research, clinical, and other endeavors!",

            "text": "The global burden of mental illness is staggering. Epidemiologic studies indicate that 75% of all diagnosable psychiatric disorders begin prior to age 24 [1] and the lifetime prevalence of a severe disorder among children and adolescents is 21.4%. The most common diagnoses during childhood are anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and mood disorders [2] . Despite their high prevalence, only about 50% of children with a mental health disorder receive treatment (CDC, NIMH). Adults as well as children remain untreated even though effective treatments exist. The World Health Organization has reported large median treatment gaps for alcohol abuse and dependence (78%), generalized anxiety disorder (58%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (57%), depression (56%), dysthymia (56%), panic disorder (56%), bipolar disorder (50%), and schizophrenia (32 %) [3, 4] . There is a general dearth of mental health resources, especially in low-to middle-income settings [5] and for disadvantaged youth [6] , and there are many barriers to care that do not involve finances, insurance, and availability of treatments [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Simply scheduling an appointment in the U.S. can be difficult [8] , and wait times may take months [8] , [11] . Additional barriers include concerns about stigma and privacy, as well as exceptional circumstances when telehealth is the only option, such as with the current COVID-19 crisis.",

However, the abundance of inaccurate and misleading information on the internet makes it difficult to evaluate credibility of information sources, veracity of claims, and effectiveness of recommendations and therapies. In addition, there are many scenarios where obtaining data or care without access to the internet or a computer is important. Furthermore, receiving scheduled notifications at any time and any place (\"experience sampling\") can be critical for realistic assessment and effective intervention. In the context of these requirements, mobile devices with dedicated applications offer a better way of receiving vetted, curated content, and of communicating relevant information without having to sit in front of a computer or find the right person to talk to at the right time.",

General health practitioners in particular struggle to serve the needs of their local communities. Better assistance is needed to identify mental health issues during checkups to ensure that these concerns are caught early on and that patients benefit from referral to a specialist. Health organizations struggle to provide broader assistance to the vast majority of people around the world who have limited or no access to mental health resources. They need better tools to scale up mental health efforts that reduce or remove face-to-face interaction to inform, assess, and provide therapy. Digital and mobile tools are especially important to reach people who need care and are in remote areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged conditions, and/or in situations where there is profound stigma surrounding mental illness. Telehealth options that involve video teleconferencing with a therapist are becoming more prominent, as evidenced by new companies that promote internet-mediated talk therapy. However, these services require the time and attention of expensive and limited human resources, and therefore do not scale as well as digital, mobile, and remote resources that do not require human interaction. The current COVID-19 crisis has made it starkly apparent that telehealth, with or without human interaction, may at times be the only option for seeking and receiving care. This pandemic is having a widespread impact on mental health, from the anxiety and stress related to the helplessness, fear, and uncertainties of the crisis itself to the isolation and loneliness of home confinement and social distancing. The need for remotely-administered information, assessment, and therapy will only grow as nations have been forced to discover the extensive possibilities of these novel technologies.",

Study participant recruitment efforts are usually restricted to individuals who can be evaluated in person and provide written consent, which drastically reduces the size and scope of study samples. For data to be relevant, robust, and replicable, it is important to frequently sample from large and diverse populations, a task which is difficult to accomplish by conventional methods. Off-the-shelf, internet-based tools such as mobile applications for collecting data do not meet the needs of most scientists who must configure their data collection tools to reach the right populations and address specific questions of scientific and clinical relevance. Even tools that are configurable often require considerable mobile application software engineering expertise that is outside of most laboratories' capabilities. For laboratories that attempt to create their own mobile application from scratch, it is the authors' experience that they often turn to outsourcing for development of the application only to find that it is far more costly than anticipated, and requires consistent maintenance and upgrading to keep up with changing software dependencies, operating system versions, and hardware, let alone the changing requirements of the research itself [personal communications].",

Although many studies do include subjective symptom ratings with passive monitoring, most of this work is based on retrospective reporting of symptoms over the past week or month. Gaining insight into the directional associations between events and psychological states and their association with sleep and physical activity can be enhanced through concomitant administration of tools that simultaneously capture descriptions of symptoms of mood, cognition, and other subjective experiences, which remain the core components of psychiatric disorder criteria. These active methods of experience sampling include explicit self-reports that may range from occasional and detailed survey instruments to more frequent, brief and in-the-moment questionnaires that are referred to as \"ecological momentary assessment\" (EMA).",

We gathered information about products with desired characteristics over the last three years through clinical and research collaborators and colleagues. To extend this search we conducted three queries in Google's search engine (without quotation marks or Boolean operators): (1) \"digital electronic data capture systems\", to broadly identify any electronic tools for capturing data; (2) \"mobile phone software sensor data collection\", to identify mobile data collection software that may involve sensors; (3) \"alternative to qualtrics\", to identify alternatives to one of the most prominent products that enables online customization of surveys (though Qualtrics itself does not currently have a mobile app). We visited the websites of the first 20 search results from each query (not including advertisements) and identified candidate products. For example, if a website listed the \"Top Ten Apps for\u2026\", we would include these ten apps in our initial set of candidates. We then filtered this set by the following inclusion criteria: the candidate product had to (a) be in current use, (b) have (Android and iOS) mobile apps, and (c) have an administrative user interface for creating and scheduling times and days for recurring, customized questionnaires, where end users receive and respond to scheduled notifications via an iOS or Android app on a mobile device. Where there was any ambiguity, we contacted the company/organization to clarify, scheduled an online demonstration, and requested a free trial to explore the product. We excluded products that do not currently fulfill the above requirements or for which we could not receive a demonstration or trial without a legal agreement. We also excluded products that require SMS, email, or other modes of communication outside of their mobile application to send and receive notifications. Since the type of notification is important in experience sampling applications, we identified which products can deliver local operating system notifications or push notifications, where an end user receives notifications in their mobile device's notification bar at scheduled times, and a tap on a notification takes them to their scheduled activity within the mobile app. Local operating system notifications do not require an internet connection at the time that the notification is to be received, whereas push notifications do, and both of these are distinct from simple in-app notifications, which require the end user to be using the app to see their notifications.",

Customization is important to ensure that content, language, and presentation can be adapted and updated to meet the specific needs of a given population of intended end users, and to expand the scope of possible dimensions to assess, analyses to perform, and inferences to make. Privacy and security is a central concern, especially as we conduct research involving a triply vulnerable population of end users: (i) child and adolescent (ii) patients with (iii) mental health and learning disorders. Data access, encryption, and deletion capabilities are the primary considerations in this domain. \"Accessible\" can mean many things; here we refer to whether and how the administrator can access the product, its source code, or its data. The degree to which a product is affordable will often determine the degree to which it is adopted. Possibly the most stringent accessibility criterion one could have is for the software to be open source. Open source software is important because the product does not live or die with a given company, provides an opportunity for anyone to build on and improve the software, and it is open to greater scrutiny to ensure quality of the software, accuracy of any claims made about the software, and transparency of clinical and scientific practices that use the software. Each of the above characteristics offers a competitive advantage, but they should be considered together. For example, a company offering a free product could store or transmit user data insecurely.",

These findings demonstrated how EMA is a particularly well-adapted tool for assessing affective dynamics as well as emotional reactivity following daily life events. The value of combined passive and active monitoring in this study further showed bidirectional associations between energy, motor activity, and sleep, and unidirectional associations between activity and mood, suggesting that increased activity could be used as an intervention for depression [51] . Using the novel analytic approach of fragmentation for testing the stability and instability of emotional states in this study showed greater instability of energy and attention in people with a history of bipolar I disorder, whereas those with bipolar II disorder or major depression exhibited greater fragmentation of mood and anxiety [52] . Although these findings were primarily based on adult samples, the inclusion of a substantial subset of offspring ages 10-18 of parents with mood disorders and controls provided compelling evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical significance of EMA in youth. Therefore, the goal of the present initiative was to create a version of the EMA in MindLogger, with updated content (particularly with regard to sleep, positive/negative thoughts, food/drink, internet, and social media questions), enhanced with clarification of the content, inclusion of colorful images, and formats adapted for children and young adults to encourage engagement [53] .

Reading disability is the most common learning disability, affecting 10-15% of school age children [70] . It incurs major functional impairments at all stages of life. A wealth of data documents lifelong disadvantages in educational and occupational attainment. Current evidence-based reading interventions largely rely on services by trained specialists, either in well-resourced classrooms or clinical settings. As such, under-resourced schools (or countries) often are unable to provide reading interventions for their students. The significance of this dilemma is compounded when considering that children of lower socioeconomic status, and children with other serious comorbid behavioral health conditions, may have more severe or complex reading disability profiles [71] [72] [73] . Thus, the children most in need are the least likely to have access to evidence-based treatment.",

We have built a prototype of the applet and will pilot it at the Richmond University Medical Center in St aten Island, New York. The initial screening questionnaire assesses internalizing and externalizing symptoms, issues of attention and hyperactivity, depression and suicidal ideation, disordered eating behavior, and experiences of bullying. It also collects demographic information about the child and parent. Children with a clinically-significant level of symptoms are prompted to complete additional questionnaires to collect more detailed information. We have piloted a similar questionnaire in several New York City-based pediatric settings and have found it to be an effective tool for identifying children at risk of a serious mental health disorder. The MindLogger platform will create a much more streamlined process and user-friendly experience, increasing the probability of adoption by more pediatric practices and clinics.",

This tool is a daily tracker of mood, targeting behavioral urges and specific behaviors and using coping skills to manage these emotions, urges, and behaviors. Our Dialectical Behavior Therapy applet ( Figure 9 ) will enable therapists to create a digital DBT diary card with a patient to include specific treatment targets for that individual. It will allow patients to set notification reminders to complete the diary card on a daily basis. The patient's device will automatically update with the new targets and schedule, allowing the user to progress in the therapy without having to change the way the data is retrieved. Both patients and therapists will have access to the diary card data to guide treatment planning and sessions.",

Our review is not exhaustive with regard to either the products that could possibly be used for experience sampling or the range of features that these products support. Existing products include an impressive assortment of non-overlapping features and complement each other in ways that reflect the different niches/markets for which they were intended. Limitations of our search for existing tools include: (1) our search queries and Google's searching algorithm may not reflect the optimal search criteria for some relevant products; (2) product websites are sometimes unclear and incomplete and may even misrepresent the capabilities of their products; (3) some companies did not respond to questions even through their own website's question/support page. Products are also adding features over time, and some companies or organizations offer paid services to build in desired features. Our comparison should be seen as a snapshot of the current state of a subset of features provided by software products intended for experience sampling.",

We prioritized clinicians' and researchers' needs and users' experience during development, aligned technologies to meet these priorities, and are on track to achieve the full feature set we set out to include. One limitation of MindLogger is that it currently does not support passive data collection, or interaction with peripheral devices. This was intentional to reduce concerns about surveillance in an app whose first use-case was for assessing children and adolescents. However, in the future we do intend to support passive monitoring of location and behaviors, and communication with other devices, so long as these are opt-in by the end user and there are clear reminders to the end user concerning what data are collected and how they will be used. Another potential limitation lies in its core strength: By making MindLogger flexible, modular, cross-platform, and configurable to help meet the unforeseen needs of future applet builders and users, the creation of variants of even well-vetted instruments is likely and will necessitate their careful validation.",
