SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 through direct lysis of infected lung epithelial cells, which releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and induces a proinflammatory cytokine milieu causing systemic inflammation. Anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents have shown limited therapeutic efficacy. Soluble CD24 (CD24Fc) can dampen the broad inflammatory response induced by DAMPs, and a recent randomized phase III trial evaluating impact of CD24Fc in patients with severe COVID-19 has shown encouraging clinical efficacy.",

By contrast, CD24Fc-treated patient samples demonstrated blunted systemic inflammation, with a return to homeostasis in both NK and T cells within days. A single dose of CD24Fc significantly attenuated systemic IL-10 and IL-15 cytokines, and diminished the coexpression and networking among inflammatory cytokines associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS. Our clinical and immunological data supports further development of CD24Fc as a novel therapeutic against severe COVID-19.",

Following infection, unconstrained viral replication leads to cell lysis and the release of DAMPs. Recognition of these molecules by neighboring cells produces a pro-inflammatory milieu through the release of cytokines (such as IL-6 and IL-10), which recruit and activate monocytes, macrophages, and T cells 2 . In severe COVID-19, this pro-inflammatory feedback loop results in a persistent and harmful response that leads to structural damage of the lung. The resulting cytokine storm can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure 3 . While DAMPs can drive systemic inflammation in various settings, whether it occurs in COVID-19 remains unknown.",

We developed a 25-marker flow cytometry panel to examine the intricacies associated with effector cell (NK and CD4 + /CD8 + T cell) activation and differentiation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and CD24Fc treatment (Table S2 ). Using our unbiased clustering approach, we identified eight distinct clusters within CD8 + T cells from COVID-19 and HD samples (Fig 2A-C) . At baseline, COVID-19 samples showed enriched frequency of clusters 4, 5, 7, and 8, which express markers of activation; HD samples were skewed towards cluster 1, which exhibits naive phenotype (Fig. 2D-E) . To analyze the impact of CD24Fc on CD8 + T cell activation, we generated UMAP contour plots for each treatment group (Fig 2F) , and analyzed changes to cluster proportions over time (Fig 2G) . CD24Fc treatment correlated with a modest increase in cluster 1 frequency over time, whereas placebo-treated patients showed marked decline. Conversely, the proportion of cluster 8 cells (a population whose expression pattern is suggestive of highly activated CD8 + T cells) were stagnant in CD24Fc-treated patients, compared to the marked increase seen in placebo group (Fig 2G) .",

Known markers of T cell activation (T-bet, Ki-67, CD69, TOX, and GZMB) were significantly increased in baseline COVID-19 patients compared to HD (Fig 2H) , supporting our hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases peripheral T cell activation. To create a unified cell-level activation score, we used PCA to implement dimension reduction of the cell-by-activation marker expression data for all baseline COVID-19 and HD cells. The first principal component (PC1) loadings of each activation marker were used as coefficients in a linear model for defining the activation score (Table S3) .

Notably, we found that inter-cytokine correlation and connectivity was lower in non-ICU patients than ICU patients (Fig S4) . These data suggest that increased blood cytokine network correlation and connectivity are associated with increased COVID-19 disease severity and ICU treatment, while mild disease (without the need for ICU treatment) is characterized by lower correlation and connectivity. Therefore, decreased correlation and connectivity of the cytokine network in CD24Fc-treated patients are likely evidence of therapeutic efficacy.",

These data indicate that distinct cytokines are highly heterogeneous in terms of their interconnectedness with other cytokines (centrality) in healthy individuals. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, cytokine centralities become more uniform and subsequent CD24Fc treatment abrogates this effect (Fig 4J) . Centrality scores for individual markers are shown in Table S4 . Comparing baseline COVID-19 patients with HD allowed us to identify the immune cell populations driving pathogenesis.

IL-15 promotes activation and expansion of NK and CD8 + T cells 33, 34 . Thus, CD24Fc may blunt NK and CD8 + T cell activation by suppressing IL-10 and IL-15 production. Since IL-15 also promotes activation and recruitment of neutrophils to site of inflammation, CD24Fc may suppress COVID-19-associated neutrophil activation and/or neutrophilia 35 . Furthermore, CD24Fc may limit viral replication by suppressing IL-10 production, which has been shown to enhance viral replication of HIV, HCV and HBV 36 . In conclusion, the data presented here offer unique immunological insights that underscore the clinical findings of the SAC-COVID trial. These results strongly support further investigation of CD24Fc for various inflammatory conditions including COVID-19. Our unique cytokine centrality analysis and cellular activation index also warrants further study as a prognostic tool for guiding therapy in COVID-19 and other systemic inflammatory conditions. .

Using these correlation coefficients, a density plot between 30 plasma cytokines (Panel H; D1 vs placebo, p=0.07; D1 vs CD24Fc, p<0.001; placebo vs CD24Fc, p<0.001) was constructed. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to evaluate equality of densities between groups. Analysis of connectivity (Panel I) and centrality analysis of cytokine network (Panel J) display the cytokine expression relationships within each group. Network connectivity plots display highly correlated connections for each cytokine (i.e., node degree) and evaluated using paired t-test. Centrality analysis of cytokine network used eigenvector centrality score that considers global network connectivity and correlation coefficients between cytokines (HD vs D1, p<0.001; D1 vs placebo, p=0.08; D1 vs CD24Fc, p<0.001).

Given the proposed mechanism of action and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesized that CD24Fc reduced the hyperactive systemic immune responses in infected patients leading to accelerated return to homeostasis. Using deep immune profiling of longitudinal samples combined with sophisticated bioinformatic analysis, we uncovered the effects of CD24Fc on the systemic host immune response. Overall, we found that CD24Fc treatment blunted immune cell activation across several compartments and facilitated return to a more normal phenotype following SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

CD24Fc may preferentially block the differentiation of mature B cells into effector plasma cells, resulting in relatively fewer plasma B cells (cluster 6) and more matureB cells (cluster 8). Alternatively, CD24Fc treatment may reduce the systemic burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which would limit the number of plasma cells due to accelerated recovery. As previously shown, higher neutralizing antibodies can reflect severity of disease 27 . In either scenario, the correlation between decreased circulating plasma cells in CD24Fc-treated patient samples suggests significant immuno-modulatory roles in this treatment. Aberrant and rapid increase in a broad-spectrum of pro-inflammatory cytokines, known as a cytokine storm, plays a central role in pathogenesis of ARDS and other severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection 28 . Unlike the cytokine storm associated with immunotherapy, which can be effectively treated by antibodies targeting IL-6R, treating COVID-19 with the same antibodies has shown limited success. Our longitudinal analysis revealed a broad-spectrum up-regulation of systemic cytokines in patients with severe COVID-19. More importantly, CD24Fc treatment cause rapid and sustained reduction of most of the 30 cytokines/chemokines tested. Among them are known COVID-19 therapeutic targets such as IL-6 and GM-CSF.

Notably, CD24Fc treatment reduced systemic cytokine levels and diminished correlations and connectivity in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, thus reshaping the systemic cytokine network towards a less tightly co-regulated state characteristic of homeostasis. Based on analysis of the global cytokine landscape, we conclude that CD24Fc mitigates the exacerbated host systemic inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. This conclusion was corroborated by the decrease of cytokine correlation and connectivity in patients with mild COVID-19 infections as compared to patients with severe disease that required an ICU treatment.
