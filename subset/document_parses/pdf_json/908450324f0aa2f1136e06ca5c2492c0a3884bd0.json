However, those who reported that their disease improved during this period were those who participated in exercise, whose pain had improved, and who were able to manage their stress. Conversely, in the small sample of individuals who reported significant worsening of their disease during this period, the majority did not exercise or reduced their exercise, and reported worsening pain and had difficulty managing stress. Studies have shown an association between increased stress and decreased physical activity; therefore, it is not surprising to see an association between increased exercise and improved sense of health. 13 T A B L E 2 Differences in perceived stress by diagnosis, sex, age, and ambulatory status Individuals under the age of 30 y reported significantly more stress than those between the ages of 30 and 60 (3.6; P = .01; CI = 0.72-6.5); and those who were over 60 y of age (6.7; P < .0001; CI = 4.0-9.8).",
