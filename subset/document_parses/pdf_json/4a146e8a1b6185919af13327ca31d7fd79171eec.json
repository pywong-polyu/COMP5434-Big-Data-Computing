As in the UK, it is indicated for adults (18- year-olds) [1] . This decision has been accompanied by statements from 22 EU countries \u2500all except 5\u2500 recommending not to use this vaccine in individuals between 55 and 70-year-old ( Table 1 ). The national health authorities of 22 countries had to explain to their citizens that the decision was based on the lack of vaccine efficacy data (see below). This undermined the confidence in the EU vaccine review and assessment process and adds to the growing issue of vaccine hesitancy in countries that account to close to 95% of total EU population. Could a different EMA recommendation have helped to mitigate vaccine hesitancy?",

The EMA, however, considered that ''the risk-benefit balance is favorable to recommend the granting of the conditional marketing authorization\" [1] .

In the whole population there were 64 COVID-19 cases among vaccine recipients and 154 cases in the control group, yielding a 59.5% vaccine efficacy. Among the elderly, there were 2 COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 6 in the placebo group. In older adults there were 8 and 9 COVID-19 cases reported in the vaccine and control groups, respectively [2] . These numbers fully support the EMA statement that no vaccine efficacy can be estimated for 56-year-olds. Then, why it has been authorized in the EU for adults with no age limit? The EMA considers that ''protection is expected, given that the immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines\" [2] . In other words, the decision not to limit the indication to up to 55-year-old individuals was based on a presumed efficacy, rather than on an observed (estimated) efficacy. The EMA could have waited to extend the indication to 56year-olds until accrual of more COVID-19 cases from ongoing clinical trials or from the large (N = 30,000) placebo-controlled trial that is running in the USA and some centers in four South American countries and France (NCT04516746) whose results are expected in March 2021 [3] . These trials, however, could face the problem of losing participants since, to comply with participants' rights [4] , placebo recipients are being offered an authorized vaccine [5, 6] .",

This would have had three consequences. Firstly, the product label would have been based on actual efficacy data. Secondly, since each country is autonomous on how to deploy the vaccine, each country could have decided the administration to older adults or elderly following the national 'official recommendations' (see below). And thirdly, the conditional marketing authorization granted could have been readily updated if new data become available supporting the use of the vaccine in 56-year-old individuals \u2500something that could happen in April/May 2021 if the large placebo-controlled RCT renders positive results in this population group.

Following 'official recommendations', the health authorities of each country may limit the use of an authorize vaccine to a specific age group, or conversely, broaden its limits. This latter could be considered as an off-label use of a vaccine based on, for example, epidemiological or operational reasons, that could be implemented for a given time in a territory. An example of this latter is currently taken place in the UK: following health authorities' decision, patients could receive a second dose with a different brand if the same vaccine the individual received first is not available [7] \u2500even when there is absolute lack of evidence on the interchangeability of the authorized vaccines [8] . Another example could happen if an EU country decides to delay the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine dose beyond three weeks [9] , which is the interval recommended by the EMA [10] , even if delaying it up to six weeks is supported by the WHO [11] . After showing that seropositive individuals have a robust antibody response after one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine [12, 13] , implementing this approach in any EU country [14] will be an off-label use of vaccines authorized with a two-dose schedule.",

Unfortunately, the situation with this vaccine in the EU could be worse if the currently ongoing trials are not able to show a benefit in vaccine efficacy in 56-year-old individuals [19] .
