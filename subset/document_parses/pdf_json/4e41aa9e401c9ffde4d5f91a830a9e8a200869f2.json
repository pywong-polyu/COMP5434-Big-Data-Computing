            "text": "In the Spring of 2020, we launched a rigor and reproducibility curriculum for medical students in research training programs. This required class consisted of eight, 2-h sessions, which transitioned to remote learning in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. The class was graded as pass/fail. Flipped classroom techniques, with multiple hands-on exercises, were developed for first-year medical students (MD/PhD [n = 9], Clinical and Translational Research Pathway (CTRP) students [n = 9]). Four focus groups (n = 13 students) and individual interviews with the two instructors were conducted in May 2020. From individual interviews with instructors and focus groups with medical students, the course and its components were favorably reviewed. Students thought the course was novel, important, relevant, and practical-and teaching strategies were effective (e.g., short lectures, interactive small group exercises, and projects). Most students expressed concerns about lack of time for course preparation. Sharper focus and streamlining of preparation work may be required. Pre-and post-student self-assessments of rigor and reproducibility competencies showed average post-scores ranging from high/moderate to strong understanding (n = 11). We conclude that rigor and reproducibility can be taught to first-year medical students in research pathways programs in a highly interactive and remote format.",

The NIH has called for a change in culture that includes both improved transparency as well as rigor and reproducibility. 11 This requires shifting values toward process as opposed to outcomes; focusing on research protocols, ethics, and quality of study design 3 and reporting. Focusing on the process would encourage taking the time to assure high quality study designs. The NIH has reached out to the scientific community to take action. 8 In response to this call, we obtained NIH funding via an administrative supplement to our Medical Scientist in Training Program for a curriculum project aimed at first-year medical students enrolled in research programs (MD/ PhD and Clinical and Translational Research Pathway [CTRP] ). This paper describes the curriculum developed and our experiences with our first class of trainees.",

Additional materials were identified and evaluated for appropriateness for inclusion as assigned or recommended preparation for class. Specific goals and objectives for each class were defined, and PowerPoint overviews with note pages were developed for instructor use. Trainees were assigned preparatory work, including required readings (1 or 2 articles from the literature) and/or podcasts, web-based learning modules, or video content. Optional resources were provided for those interested in deeper exploration. We then considered how to structure interactive classroom exercises to support classroom learning. Table 1 depicts the topics covered, the goals and learning objectives for each class, and the estimated time students will devote to preparation. From this extensive process, we finalized a list of competencies for the pre-and post-self-assessments. No curriculum approval process was required. Table 2 summarizes the interactive exercises. Most require breaking out into small groups (4-5 students) for discussion (e.g., 15 min), with time for the groups to report back to the class with a summary of discussions. These activities were developed to build on the knowledge acquired from the required preparation. For example, in the first session, students were assigned one article. 10 In their small groups, they were challenged to discover which of the NIH proposed ideas to improve rigor and reproducibility of research were implemented, identify new strategies developed since the article, and discuss why some ideas failed to be implemented. Discussion questions were provided. Next, groups selected a stakeholder perspective and discussed the pros and cons of each recommendation from their perspective. Through this discussion, trainees were challenged to think about the nuanced perspectives related to the topic. Examples provided showed the connection among didactics, theory, and practice. Before the class on quality control, trainees completed an assignment to (1) obtain a standard operating procedure, manual, or protocol from their research laboratory (or a classmate if they have not been assigned to a laboratory), (2) reviewed it, and (3) observed the practices in the laboratory. During in-class small group discussions, trainees shared what they learned from this exercise and discussed deviations from protocols (if any) and how the laboratory could improve processes.

Semistructured interview guides were used (Tables S2,S3) . Focus groups were recorded via Zoom, video-teleconferencing with a digital recorder as back-up (average length: 66 min; range: 45-85) and a research assistant taking notes in two focus groups. Audio was professionally transcribed. Participants did not review transcripts or findings. We used simple thematic analysis (themes derived from the data) and coded by C.D. using NVivo software. 18 We achieved saturation, as many comments were repeated in later focus groups. Participants received a $10 gift card. The authors also observed the debates and project presentations. The interviewer used techniques designed to elicit both positive and corrective feedback. She was unfamiliar with the students and one instructor. Participants knew that C.D. is faculty and had a role in designing the course. Students conducted pre-and postself-assessments of competencies (Table S4) . Quantitative analyses included descriptive statistics (means and SDs) and paired t-tests with p values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Table S1 shows that 44.4% of class participants were women and 16.7% were from racial/ethnic groups under-represented in the biomedical sciences. Grade point averages (GPAs), Science GPA, and Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores were similar between the student groups. Table 1 shows that the average time on Blackboard was less than the expected preparation time. Because materials were meant to be downloaded rather than read online, we could not estimate the actual student preparation time. Table 4 shows that overall, the course and its components were very favorably reviewed by both students and instructors via data collected in focus groups and in-depth interviews. Among students, course content was seen as novel, important, relevant, and practical-and teaching strategies were generally seen as effective. Students particularly appreciated short lectures and interactive small group exercises. A review to reduce redundancy was requested.

            "text": "RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY TRAINING students can improve their competency in scientific rigor and reproducibility. The students in the class conducted research across the clinical and translational research spectrum, although there were more basic scientists than clinical researchers. Our mixed method evaluation provided evidence of enthusiasm for the course materials from instructors and students, effectiveness of the curriculum, and areas for improvement. We designed the curriculum with the goal of training reflective practitioners skilled in both knowledge and ways of thinking about rigor and reproducibility across the translational research spectrum. Although two research ethics courses are currently offered at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, neither addresses the core competencies covered in the rigor and reproducibility class, neither uses debate as a learning experience, and neither had students work in teams on projects. We believe the curriculum is well-suited for all graduate students. We developed educational modules using a reflective learning framework. 19, 20 Trainees were provided opportunities to talk, listen, read, write, and reflect as they approached content through problem-solving exercises in small groups, simulations, and case studies, all of which require trainees to apply what they are learning. 21 We used the reflective practice approach because we thought it would help medical students hone transformative (double loop) learning skills. 12, 22 Although the reliance on a static frame of reference (\"single loop learning\" 23 ) meets the professional needs when theory and knowledge are constant and challenges/dilemmas are predictable, it falls short in clinical and translational research because theory and knowledge are dynamic and challenges facing the field are unpredictable. 23 In this class, students did not see the same problems twice. Exercises allowed them to apply knowledge in one field to the current problem at hand. The exercises also required reflection on each topic. This learning paradigm allowed the trainees to improve their ability to critically analyze a problem based on experience, knowledge, critical thinking, and intuitive knowledge developed through previous reflections. 24 Each student participated in a scientific debate, a collaborative learning exercise, which provided the students with an opportunity to practice scientific argumentation. A social process in which trainees build, question, and critique claims using evidence, 25 debates provide opportunities for students to hone the 4 elements of scientific argumentation: (1) evidence (use of high-quality evidence), (2) reasoning (articulate how evidence supports claims), (3) social interaction (build off other's ideas), and (4) competing claims (critique and alternative explanations). The debaters presented their reasons and evidence to persuade the rest of the class. Participants sharpened their thinking and speaking skills through preparation and participation in the formal debate. The trainees not only learned more about the topic, but also had opportunities to further develop persuasive speech skills, increase collaboration skills, and apply conflict resolution abilities.",
