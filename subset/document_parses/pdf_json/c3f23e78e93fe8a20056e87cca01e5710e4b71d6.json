P2Ps are different from traditional client/server data networks, where the performance mainly depends on a small number of powerful servers. In P2Ps the role of each peer is treated as the same. Each peer can not only serve as a server to provide network services for other peers, but also serve as a client to obtain services from others, thus avoiding the impact of server failure in the traditional networks. They can generate multiple routes between service providers and customers, thus improving the network throughput and routing optimization Wang et al. (2019) . In recent years, many research scholars have carried out studies on P2Ps and applied them into various scenarios, e.g., distributed storage Yan et al.

In fact, each peer has a certain level of satisfaction when it requests a network service, which can be described as a form of utility function. Based on the shapes of utility functions, network services can be classified into two categories (Lee et al. 2005; Hande et al. 2007; Li et al. 2015 . One type is the traditional data services, such as file download and upload, which are not very sensitive to the bandwidth requirements. These services are elastic in their bandwidth requirement intervals. Usually a concave utility function is used to describe peer's satisfaction for acquiring an elastic service. The other type is related to delay or bandwidth sensitive multimedia services, such as realtime streaming video service. These services are known as to be inelastic in their bandwidth requirement intervals. They usually have high requirements for bandwidth resource so as to guarantee certain level of QoS. The utility function for an inelastic service is often nonconcave, e.g., sigmoidal or general.",

Firstly, resource allocation for elastic services mainly concentrates on resource pricing strategies, e.g., Eger and Killat (2007a, b) , Kumar et al. (2011) , Koutsopoulos and Iosifidis (2010) , Li and Sun (2016) and . In this type of research, a resource pricing scheme is proposed to balance the resource requests and provisions, thus service providers adjust their bandwidth allocation according to the difference between the prices provided by service requesters and the prices charged by service providers, and finally achieve a weighted fairness among service requesters. Since the utility functions of elastic services are usually concave, then the resource allocation problem for elastic services is a convex optimization problem, which can be solved through the first order Lagrangian method. Besides resource pricing mechanisms, reputationbased methods are also used to encourage cooperation amongst selfish peers so as to promote each peer to provide resource for others and achieve efficient resource allocation, e.g., Satsiou and Tassiulas (2010) , Gupta et al. (2016) and Goswami et al. (2017) .",

Thus, how to achieve effective resource allocation for inelastic services becomes very important, which is also a crucial challenge and difficult problem. For example, P2P multiparty conferencing applications are considered in Chen et al. (2012) , where a problem of utility maximization for resource allocation is formulated. In order to solve the nonstrictly concave optimization problem, a primal-dual distributed algorithm is presented and proven to converge to the global optimum under the proposed sufficient conditions. Resource allocation for inelastic services are also investigated in Li et al.

As for the scenario with both elastic and inelastic services, the utility maximization model for resource allocation is also an intricate and difficult problem.",

P2P networks can provide elastic services such as file sharing and downloading. For the resource allocation of this type of services, in order to reduce the \"free-riding\" due to the peers' selfish nature, many scholars proposed incentive mechanisms to encourage each peer to provide its own upload bandwidth for others, such as resource pricing, reputation-based schemes, and so on. Eger and Killat (2007a) presented a resource pricing scheme to achieve a fair bandwidth allocation among service requesters. They further expanded the scheme to achieve a weighted fairness among service requesters, such that service providers could adjust their service rates and offered prices (Eger and Killat 2007b) . Later, Koutsopoulos and Iosifidis (2010) considered bandwidth allocation in a star topology P2P network where the peer access link to the backbone is the capacity bottleneck. They developed the problem of maximizing total network utility through controlling the bandwidth allocation for download and upload of each peer, respectively. Then Kumar et al. (2011) considered computing resources shared by users in P2Ps and proposed a resource pricing and allocation scheme. Pacifici et al. (2016) considered cache bandwidth allocation for P2P file-sharing networks which is formulated as a Markov decision process, and proposed three approximations to the optimal cache bandwidth allocation policy, so as to minimize inter-ISP traffic. Recently, Li and Sun (2016) and applied the first order Lagrangian method and low-pass filtering scheme to design a novel scheme of resource pricing and allocation. Antal and Vink\u00f3 (2016) investigated max-min fair bandwidth allocation in BitTorrent communities and proposed an algorithm to realize max-min fairness bandwidth allocation in multi-swarm P2P content sharing community. considered fair bandwidth allocation of access links in P2P file-sharing networks and developed a coupled network-wide utility maximization model which aims at achieving several kinds of fairness among requesting peers.",

They designed various objective functions for the upload bandwidth allocation problem and showed how optimal solutions could be computed using a bipartite flow network. Rohmer et al.

Mostafavi and Dehghan (2016) considered bandwidth sharing and allocation in helper-assisted P2P streaming using non-cooperative game theory and double auction, and proposed an algorithm to reach significant performance improvements in terms of utility per selling helpers. They Mostafavi and Dehghan (2017) also considered resource allocation for HD live streaming and proposed a decentralized, stochastic approximation helper selection mechanism which is adaptable to supply and demand pattern of various video channels. Recently, Li et al. (2017) also developed a utility maximization model for resource allocation of P2P inelastic services. In order to resolve the intrinsically difficult nonconvex optimization, they presented a heuristic algorithm using PSO to achieve the optimal resource allocation.",

            "text": "P2P networks support a wide variety of network services. Each peer who acquires a service will receive a certain level of satisfaction if the service is provided with a certain amount of resource. The utility function derived from economics is found useful to describe the satisfaction of a peer when acquiring a service. According to the different shapes of utility functions, they can be divided into two categories: elastic services and inelastic services (Lee et al. 2005; Hande et al. 2007; Li et al. 2015) . The former one mainly refers to traditional data services such as file uploading and downloading services in P2P file-sharing networks. The utility functions for this type of services are generally concave. The latter one is mainly related to multimedia video and audio services such as P2P multiparty conferencing services and VoIP over P2P networks. This type of services are usually very sensitive to granted resources and the QoS will drop drastically if resources are below a certain threshold. They usually have non-concave utility functions, such as sigmoidal functions. The shapes of utility functions of elastic and inelastic services are generally illustrated in Fig. 1 . We adopt the utility functions proposed for resource allocation of services in IP networks (Lee et al. 2005; Hande et al. 2007; Li et al. 2015) . If a peer acquires an elastic service s, it will have a concave utility as follows and if it acquires an inelastic service r, then it will have a sigmoidal utility as follows where y is the service rate, w is the willing-to-pay of the peer, a and b are parameters of the inelastic service. We find that for inelastic service r, there is a demarcation point y 0 that divides the utility function into a convex part and a concave part, that is, d 2 U r (y)\u2215dy 2 > 0 if y < y 0 , and d 2 U r (y)\u2215dy 2 < 0 if y > y 0 .",

On the other hand each peer can also provide one or several services for others. Therefore, each peer acts as both a service customer and a service provider. In P2P networks, each peer uses its access link not only to obtain services from other peers, such as downloading files, but also to provide services for other peers, such as uploading files. Therefore, the upload bandwidth of a peer becomes a rare resource in the network, and other peers will compete for the upload bandwidth so as to obtain services.

We find that the number of peers does not influence the convergence speed of the resource allocation scheme. The aggregated utility increases gradually with the number of peers but, in almost all cases, the optimal value is achieved within the same number of iterations (e.g., 200 iterations).

Similar to the results for only elastic services in Sect. 5.2.1, the optimal objective can be finally reached in almost the same number of iterations. However, it appears to converge slower than that in the case for only elastic services. This is rather expected. When considering only elastic services, the service customers have the same structure of logarithmic utility functions and run the separate update steps in parallel.

Especially, P2Ps have well supported online video conferencing applications (e.g., Tencent meeting, Zoom) in 2020 due to the epidemic of COVID-19. However, it is a crucial challenge and difficult problem to achieve reasonable and effective resource allocation for peers who acquire both elastic and inelastic services. In this paper we concentrate on resource allocation for both elastic and inelastic services in P2P networks, and formulate the utility maximization model for peers who request these services. The utility maximization model is an intractable and difficult nonconvex optimization problem, since the inelastic services have non-concave utility functions. In order to obtain the optimal resource allocation, we approximate the utility maximization problem to an equivalent convex optimization problem by applying the successive approximation method, and design a gradient-based resource allocation scheme to achieve the optimal solution of the approximations. The proposed scheme is proven to converge to an optimal solution of the primal utility maximization model which also satisfies the KKT conditions. Numerical examples verify the convergence of resource allocation scheme for both elastic and inelastic services. For further research work, we will investigate the resource allocation of multiclass applications in edge computing which builds on P2Ps.",
