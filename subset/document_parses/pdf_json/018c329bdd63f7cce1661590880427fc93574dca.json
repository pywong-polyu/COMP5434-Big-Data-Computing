Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate potential mechanisms relating to the maintained intervention effect on television viewing at two long-term follow-ups in the Melbourne Infant Feeding Activity and Nutrition Trial (INFANT). INFANT was a cluster-randomised controlled trial. At the 2and 3.5-year follow-ups, a total of 262 infant/mother pairs had complete information. Television viewing was assessed via a questionnaire at both follow-ups and six potential mediators were measured post-intervention (i.e. 15 months after baseline). Causal mediation analysis was conducted. At the 2-and 3.5-year follow-ups, the positive impacts of INFANT on maternal television viewing knowledge were maintained (B = 0.34 units; 95% confidence interval (CI 95 ): 0.21, 0.48). An indirect effect of the intervention on reducing children's television viewing time was observed at the 2-and 3.5-year follow-ups (B = \u221211.73 min/day; CI 95 : \u221222.26, \u22123.28 and B = \u22124.78 min/day; CI 95 : \u22129.48, \u22120.99, respectively) via improved maternal television viewing knowledge.",

            "text": "There are ongoing debates between clinicians, researchers, policy makers, and parents regarding the benefits versus risks of children's screen time exposures [1] . Screens (e.g. television, tablets, and smartphones) are ubiquitous in today's society and pre-school-aged children are well exceeding the recommendation of 1 h or less per day [2] [3] [4] . A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found strong evidence for associations between high amounts of screen time with overweight and obesity and shorter sleep duration in toddlers and preschoolers [5] . Furthermore, with regards to sleep duration and screen time, another systematic review and metaanalysis has also found unfavourable associations in infants and toddlers [6] . Excessive screen time has also been found to be associated with poor dietary outcomes, worse motor and executive function development, more aggressive behaviours as well as worse emotional and behavioural outcomes in children aged 0 to 7 years [5] . Since lifestyle behaviours, which include screen time, have been shown to be established within the first 2 years of life and track into the pre-school years [7] [8] [9] [10] , there is a need to promote healthy screen time habits early in life.",

With regards to screen time, INFANT targeted parental knowledge through the provision of information about screen time recommendations as well as discussion with participating parents that there are no proven benefits of screen time for infants and its potential detriments to aspects of development. In addition, alternative ideas for non-screen-based activities (e.g. active play ideas appropriate for the age of the child) as well as strategies for limiting screen time were provided [14] .

The sixth mediator was future expectations of parents relating to their child's television viewing habits when they are older and it was derived from two questions.

Descriptive statistics were used to present the baseline characteristics of the participating children and mothers at the 2-and 3.5-year follow-ups. Causal mediation analysis was conducted for potential mediators for which there was a statistically significant intervention effect at 20 months [20, 21] . Figure 1 illustrates the hypothesised mediating pathways. Intervention effects on potential mediators were assessed by fitting linear regression models for the potential mediators when the infants were 20 months old (i.e. post-intervention), while adjusting for child sex, maternal education, and the baseline mediator value (a path). Separate linear regression models were fitted to test the effect of each potential mediator when the infants were 20 months old, on television viewing time at 3.6 and 5 years of age, while adjusting for treatment group, child sex, maternal education, and the baseline mediator value (b path). Following the causal inference approach to mediation [20, 21] , b path models initially included an interaction term between the treatment group and the potential mediator, to allow that the effects of the mediator on the outcome may differ across treatment groups. When the p-value for the interaction term was \u2265 0.05, the interaction term was omitted. Causal mediation models with selected potential mediators were run using the Stata package medeff [22] using Fig. 1 Illustration of the hypothesised mediating pathways 5000 simulations. All models were fitted with cluster-robust standard errors to account for clustering of participants in the parent groups. All coefficients presented are unstandardized. Stata (Release 15, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used to conduct all analyses and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the participating children and mothers at the 2-and 3.5-year follow-ups. A total of 262 infant/mother pairs had complete information at both the 2-and 3.5-year follow-ups. Table 2 presents the results of models assessing intervention effects on potential mediators (a path). There was strong evidence of an intervention effect on the intervention group's television viewing knowledge when compared to the control group (B = 0.34 units; CI 95 : 0.21, 0.48), but limited evidence of intervention effects on the remaining potential mediators.",

            "text": "To date, no interventions in young children have investigated the potential mechanisms related to sustained intervention effects regarding television viewing. In school-aged children and adolescents, two systematic reviews investigated mediating mechanisms in obesity prevention interventions; however, too few studies have been conducted with regards to sedentary behaviour (including screen time) to draw clear conclusions [23, 24] . With regards to behaviour change, knowledge alone is usually not enough to evoke sustained change [25] ; however, it is likely that a lack of knowledge may limit or prevent behaviour change from occurring. As the first years of a child's life have been found to be when parents are most receptive to information regarding how to best guide their child [26] , this could be the time to target parents and provide them with important information regarding screen time usage. In the current study, parents in the intervention group received information regarding television viewing when their child was approximately 4-19 months of age. This low-dose intervention was enough to increase maternal television viewing knowledge and subsequently reduce children's television viewing time with the effect maintained at both long-term follow-ups. Thus, as maternal television viewing knowledge remained higher in the intervention group compared to the control group, the sustained impact on knowledge is likely what led to the reduction in television viewing at both follow-ups. Furthermore, as INFANT was based on the anticipatory guidance approach [14] , it could also be hypothesised that the indirect intervention effect on television viewing via improved maternal television viewing knowledge at both follow-ups could be due to the knowledge gained during the intervention provided the parents with the tools to handle situations regarding television viewing when their child was older.",

            "text": "Interestingly, at the 2-year follow-up, we found that the intervention had a moderating effect on facilitating television viewing (e.g. turning the television on). In the control group, facilitating television viewing was positively associated with television viewing time, whereas no association was observed in the intervention group. Even though the intervention had no discernible impact on facilitating television viewing (a path), it appears that the intervention has reduced the impact of facilitating television viewing on television viewing time. The Table 3 Estimated effects of potential mediators on children's television viewing time (b path) at the 2-and 3.5-year follow-ups (n = 262) Abbreviations: CI 95 , 95% confidence interval a Presented as summary scores b Adjusted for child sex, maternal education, and the baseline mediator value c Where there was evidence of an interaction between treatment group and the potential mediator at the p < 0.05 level, separate effects estimates are presented for the intervention and control groups lack of an association between facilitating television viewing and television viewing time observed in the intervention group may be due to the mothers' increased knowledge of screen time recommendations. In a cross-sectional study by Goh et al. [13] , increased parental knowledge regarding screen time recommendations was associated with lower levels of screen viewing in infants. Furthermore, in European preschool-aged children parents, being knowledgeable regarding screen time guidelines was associated with low television viewing [12] . Thus, in the current study, it can be hypothesised that the increased maternal knowledge from INFANT led mothers to more effectively limit television viewing. This study employed a strong cluster-randomised controlled trial design with assessment of intervention effects at two additional follow-ups. A further strength of this study is the broad range of potential mediators assessed. Furthermore, the use of a score for each potential mediator rather than an individual question is another strength. The use of parentreported television time is a potential limitation; however, the questions used have been found to have acceptable reliability [18] . Furthermore, when the study was initiated in 2008, other types of screen time (e.g. tablets and smartphones) were not as prevalent as they are today and thus this study focused on television viewing. Finally, the small sample size, the fact that the sample had a higher proportion of mothers with greater educational attainment, as well as the inclusion of only first-time parents limits the generalizability of the findings.",

As no other interactions were found by treatment group, the remaining results are not stratified. Lower television viewing time was observed in children of mothers with greater television viewing knowledge (B = \u221233.92 min/day; CI 95 : \u221257.51, \u221210.33). Additionally, lower television viewing time was observed for those whose mothers expected their child to have similar television viewing habits to their own (B = \u221234.01 min/day; CI 95 : \u221258.14, \u22129.88). Finally, higher television viewing time was found in children with more access to items or an environment that promotes screen time (B = 7.69 min/day, CI 95 : 0.01, 15.36). For the 2-year follow-up, only television viewing knowledge met the criteria (i.e. a statistically significant a path) to be included in the causal mediation analysis. No statistically significant direct effect (c' path) or total effect (c path) of the intervention on children's television viewing was found (B = \u22124.06 min/day, CI 95 : \u221233.08, 25.52 and B = \u221215.80 min/day, CI 95 : \u221242.82, 11.06, respectively). However, a statistically significant indirect effect of the intervention on children's television time viewing, via improved maternal television viewing knowledge, was observed (B = \u221211.73 min/day; CI 95 : \u221222.26, \u22123.28).",
