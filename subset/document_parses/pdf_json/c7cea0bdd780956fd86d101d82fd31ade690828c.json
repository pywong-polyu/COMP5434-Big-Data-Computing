            "text": "Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug and an inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Once it enters the cell, it is rapidly converted by esterases into different nucleoside metabolites. The pharmacologically active triphosphate form has a half-life of 11 h, and there is another dephosphorylated nucleoside metabolite (GS-441524) that has a half-life of 20-25 h. The nucleoside metabolites compete with Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for incorporation into viral RNA, causing premature chain termination and inhibition of viral replication. GS-441524 has potent in vitro inhibitory activity against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV1, and SARS-CoV2. 4, 5 The most common reported side effects of Remdesivir are elevation of hepatic enzymes, rash, anaemia, renal impairment, and diarrhoea. 6 The ACTT-1 trial reported a 1.1% incidence of cardiac arrest and 4% atrial fibrillation in the Remdesivir group (compared to 1% and 2%, respectively, in the placebo group). 2 There have been two prior case reports of patients who developed severe bradycardia following the use of Remdesivir. 7 ......................................................................................... heart rates improved following discontinuation of Remdesivir. Patients with COVID-19 have also been noted to have bradyarrhythmias, likely due to viral myocarditis, hypoxia, or damage to the pacemaker cells from inflammatory cytokines, 9 however, the timing of bradycardia in our case indicates contribution from Remdesivir. He also scored 3 points on the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale, indicating possible probability of adverse drug reaction (total score 1-4). 10 Our patient had a history of atrial fibrillation. He was not on any AV nodal blocking agents or negative chronotropic agents during or prior to his hospitalization. The QRS complexes in Figure 2 were narrow compared to the baseline ECG (Figure 1 ). This could be due to slow junctional escape rhythm with normalization of RBBB conduction or ventricular escape rhythm resulting in matched conduction delay and narrow QRS complexes. The fact sheet for EUA for Remdesivir recommends against coadministration of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate with Remdesivir due to risk of reduced antiviral activity. 11 There are no known interactions of Remdesivir with any of the other medications the patient was on.",

One postulated mechanism is possibly related to Remdesivir's affinity towards the RNA polymerases and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in cardiotoxicity. 12 Another possible explanation is related to Remdesivir's resemblance to adenosine triphosphate. Adenosine causes coronary vasodilation through its action on A2A receptors on cardiac cells. Additionally, it has a short-lived effect on the A1 receptors on cardiac cells, causing blockage of AV nodal conduction. 13 Remdesivir may influence the AV node through this mechanism, given its status as a nucleoside analogue. In our case, the patient developed severe bradycardia within 24 h of administering Remdesivir, implying a temporal relationship. Moreover, the AV block resolved spontaneously after 48 h of discontinuation of Remdesivir, consistent with the pharmacokinetics of its active metabolites.",
