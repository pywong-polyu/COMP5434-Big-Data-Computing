The first case series was described by Huang et al. [2] where 41 patients were admitted to Jin Yin-Tan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Of the 41 confirmed cases, 98% had fever and 76% had a dry cough, all developed pneumonia. Deep sequencing of lower respiratory tract samples identified the viral genome to be from the coronavirus family and this was named . Cellular access is gained through a spike protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2), and viral uptake is promoted by the type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) [3] . Lauer reported a median 5.7 days to fever onset (CI 4.9-6.8 days), and 97.5% of cases had a fever within 12.5 days (CI 8.2-17.7 days of exposure) [4] . Importantly, COVID-19 often takes a prolonged disease course with viral load in throat and nose declining after the first week as antibody titres rise [5] . This can result in nucleic acid testing becoming negative after the first week, though neutralisation and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are readily detectable in nearly all cases [6] . Asymptomatic carriage of COVID-19 was estimated to be 15% in general population [7] and Sutton et al. [8] reported that positive rate of 13.7% (29/210) among asymptomatic group and 87.9% (29/33) of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic at presentation.",

Testing also enables early isolation and rationalisation of personal protective equipment (PPE). Thirdly, identification of viral carriage could allow closer monitoring both during and after delivery, consideration of low molecular heparin for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, and longer term follow-up.",

These included women who were required antenatal and postnatal admission to the obstetric wards, women attending the main delivery unit and birth centre, and women attending for elective Caesarean Section or cerclage insertion. All staff members received training prior to obtaining swabs. Samples were processed using the SAMBA II machine (Diagnostics for the Real World, Chesterford, UK) [11, 12] . Data were extracted for population demographics and symptomatology. Symptoms were defined as fever and or cough in line with Public Health England's advice at the time. Patients who were asymptomatic were defined as women who lacked a fever and/or cough from the time of testing to discharge. Turnaround time was defined as the time the swab was collected, to the time a result was uploaded onto the electronic hospital record. Where time entries were missing, electronic hospital notes were retrieved to check for a record of sample collection and availability of results. These were computed separately.

We were also able to demonstrate a high acceptability of COVID-19 screening amongst our maternity population with only 3% declining to be tested. Thirdly, ours is the first study to demonstrate the utility of point of care testing in an unselected cohort of pregnant women attending a large UK maternity unit. Whilst the data are reflective of our maternity service, laboratory services were also processing samples from patients attending the accident and emergency department, and medical and surgical wards within a national health service. We were still able to achieve a short turnaround time of five hours. This allowed for changes to be made within postnatal care pathway, and escalation of the use of personal protective equipment. Testing of newborns could have also been performed had it been required.",

As the pandemic evolved, advice and guidance were issued to pregnant women in the UK, who may have adopted behavioural changes that minimised interaction with the general public. Additionally, home working and minimising the commute to work could have protected them further. Interestingly, the proportion of asymptomatic carriers did not correlate with the regional infection rate. Possible explanations include variations in mask wearing, local test and trace strategies, movement control orders and specific advice on \"shielding\" in pregnant women [34] .",

Obstetric and non-obstetric face-toface clinic appointments were changed to phone appointments where possible, thus reducing footfall within the hospital premises. Staff working in clinical areas were required to wear personal protective equipment in the form of a surgical mask, gloves and aprons as a minimum, and FFP3 masks for aerosol generating procedures. Thus, pregnant women attending hospital should also be reassured, not only that asymptomatic carriage of COVID-19 is low, infection within the inpatient setting is low.

In contrast, GeneXpert PCR testing has been previously been validated on a much smaller cohort of less than 50 women [35] . We did not perform radiological investigations to look for manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia, as some others have clinical diagnosis criteria as well as laboratory diagnosis [36, 37] . Women could therefore have a negative NP or OP result for COVID-19, but have radiological changes. However, the likelihood of this is low. Although we had a high acceptability rate, we did not explore women's and staff views on screening for COVID-19, thus further research is required to evaluate this. For example, there may be a need to develop tests which are acceptable to women in labour, or training for hospital staff in contact tracing where women simply declined to be tested. In the interest of patient safety, we would suggest a conservative approach to patient pathways for women who decline testing so as not to result in contagion within the hospital setting.",

Indeed, Allotey et al. have subsequently demonstrated that only 5% of asymptomatic pregnant and recently pregnant women with COVID-19 exhibit altered sense of taste [34] .

However, given the high infectivity of COVID-19, asymptomatic screening within a hospital setting will remain an important component so as to avoid nosocomial infection, prevent patient-to-staff infection, and to rationalise the use of full personal protective equipment. Another disadvantage is testing capacity, given that each machine can only handle only one test at a time, and each run lasting 1.5 h. Our unit has mitigated this by running 20 machines simultaneously. Additional barriers have been manufacturing enough machines, reagents and cartridges for testing. Nonetheless SAMBA II has been procured by NHS England and is being implemented in over 100 sites nationally.",
