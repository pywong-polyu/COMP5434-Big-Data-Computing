Among the numerous affected animals, cats are one of the most susceptible species. However, little is known about viral pathogenicity and transmissibility in the case of variants of concern (VOCs) in animal hosts, such as the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant first detected in India. Here, we have identified the B.1.617.2 (Delta) VOC in a cat living with a COVID-19 positive owner. The animal presented mild symptoms (sneezing) and a high viral load was detected in the oropharyngeal swab, suggesting that an active infection was occurring in the upper respiratory tract of the cat. Transmission from the owner to the cat occurred despite the human being fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. This study documents the first detection of B.1.165.2 VOC in a cat in Spain and emphasizes the importance of performing active surveillance and genomic investigation on infected animals.",

            "text": "Since December 2019, a new virus denominated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has threatened the entire world. This virus, the causative agent of the disease named COVID-19, is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, Beta genus (1) . The viral genome includes 13 open reading frames (ORFs) and four major structural proteins: the surface Spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, the matrix protein (M), and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (2) . Following the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, the emergence of new variants of the virus has kept the world on tenterhooks. Among the numerous variants, some of them have been proved to be even more hazardous than the original strain. These variants, denominated as variants of concern (VOCs), present higher transmission rates and a more effective evasion of the host immune system, which makes it more difficult the adequated control of the disease. The first determined VOC was the B.1.1.7 (20I/N501Y.V1), which was identified in England (3) . After this event, a second variant with the N501Y mutation was first detected in South Africa, named B.1.351 (20J/N501Y.V2) (4) , and lately, the P.1 variant was reported in Brazil (20I/N501Y.V3) (5) . Despite their hazardous properties, vaccination implementation helped to control the damages caused by these variants. However, since late March 2021, India started experiencing an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases reaching more than 400,000 cases and 4,000 deaths reported each day in early May 2021 (6) . These fatalities were associated with a new lineage, the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, that was first detected in India in December 2020 and became the most commonly reported variant in the country by mid-April 2021 . The delta variant is characterized by the spike  protein mutations T19R, 157-158, L452R, T478K, D614G,  P681R, and D950N . Several of these mutations may alter host immune response and increase viral replication, leading to higher viral loads and increased transmission rates (7) . Currently, the Delta variant has been replaced by a new heavily mutated variant known as B.1.1.529 (BA) (Omicron) (8) , first reported in South Africa on November 24, 2021 (9) . This new variant has dominated the current epidemiologic scenario, replacing the present Delta prevalence around 4.2% in Spain (10).",

            "text": "Although the concern regarding the delta variant in the human population is widely documented, little is known about the transmission capacity and the effects of this variant in animals. Due to the zoonotic origin of the COVID-19 disease, numerous experimental and field studies have been conducted in order to explore the extent of the infection in animals and to elucidate their role as reservoirs (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Concretely, efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission between owners and their pets has been demonstrated worldwide (16) (17) (18) . Among the different animals affected, cats have been shown to be one of the more susceptible species (19) . One proof of this is the high number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences retrieved from cats submitted to the GISAID website, which corresponds with 119 sequences from different parts of the world. In addition, several studies have reported natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 in this species (15, 17, 18) . We cannot dismiss, therefore, the potential role of cats as intermediate hosts of the virus, which may trigger the development of new mutations in the viral genome. Moreover, genomic surveillance in infected pets has evidenced animal infection with at least one VOC, the B.1.1.7 alpha variant (20) (21) (22) . These events highlight the importance of performing genetic investigations on samples from infected cats in order to understand the transmission and evolution of the virus in these hosts.",

First, initial tree(s) were obtained automatically using the neighbor-joining and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using maximum composite likelihood and then choosing the topology with a better log-likelihood value. For modelization of differences in the rate of evolution among different sites, a discrete gamma distribution (two categories, +G parameter = 0.059) was used.

The cat presented light symptoms of the disease (sneezing) and was sampled during the quarantine period of its owner. Molecular analysis was performed in several samples from the cat and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-qPCR, following a genomic investigation from the positive sample (oropharyngeal swab). Thus, the phylogenetic assay revealed that the sequence from the cat presented the mutations proper of the B.1.617.2 (delta) VOC. It is also noteworthy that transmission between the infected human and the cat occurred despite the owner having a complete vaccination schedule. This finding alerts us about the high transmission capacity of this VOC, which avoided all the boundaries and jumped from the owner to the pet. The animal also developed neutralizing antibodies, which demonstrates that an active infection occurred following an effective immune system response.

In addition, vaccine effectiveness seems to be decreased in the case of infection with this variant, as some reports have evidence (32, 38) . This fact may explain that the owner of the infected cat reported in this study was able to transmit the virus to the pet, despite being completely vaccinated. Although the virus was not isolated from the cat sample, a high viral load was detected in the animal's oropharyngeal swab, that allude to an active infection at the time of sampling. In addition, the cat had compatible symptoms with the disease, without any known comorbidities. Taking into account that experimental studies have reflected that cats often do not present clinical signs when become infected (39) , the presence of sneezing in this cat, may suggest a higher virulence of the isolate. Under this scenario, the role of the cat as an active source of infection cannot be dismissed, as well as the potential capacity of the virus to mutate into the animal. All these facts together highlight the risk associated with pet delta variant infection and underline the importance of performing active surveillance in pets living with COVID-19 infected people, including genomic investigation in order to detect infections with VOCs or potential mutations associated with animal hosts.",
