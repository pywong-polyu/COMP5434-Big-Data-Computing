Vosoritide, an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide, stimulates endochondral bone growth and is in development for the treatment of achondroplasia. This phase 3 extension study was conducted to document the efficacy and safety of continuous, daily vosoritide treatment in children with achondroplasia, and the two-year results are reported. METHODS: After completing at least six months of a baseline observational growth study, and 52 weeks in a double-blind, placebocontrolled study, participants were eligible to continue treatment in an open-label extension study, where all participants received vosoritide at a dose of 15.0 \u03bcg/kg/day. RESULTS: In children randomized to vosoritide, annualized growth velocity increased from 4.26 cm/year at baseline to 5.39 cm/year at 52 weeks and 5.52 cm/year at week 104. In children who crossed over from placebo to vosoritide in the extension study, annualized growth velocity increased from 3.81 cm/year at week 52 to 5.43 cm/year at week 104. No new adverse effects of vosoritide were detected. CONCLUSION: Vosoritide treatment has safe and persistent growth-promoting effects in children with achondroplasia treated daily for two years.",

These data led to a growth study (to establish baseline growth over at least 6 months) and a phase 2, open-label study in children aged 5 to <14 years with achondroplasia [5] . The safety and efficacy data from this study supported further clinical development of vosoritide at a dose of 15.0-\u03bcg-per-kilogram-per-day in children with achondroplasia in pivotal, randomized controlled studies. This phase 3 study was a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, and conducted in 121 children with achondroplasia aged 5 to <18 years. Eligible children were randomized 1:1 to treatment with vosoritide or an identical matching placebo [6] . The mean difference in annualized growth velocity between participants in the vosoritide group and placebo group was 1.57 cm per year in favor of vosoritide (95% CI: [1.22, 1.93], two-sided p value <0.0001) [6] . In total, 119 participants experienced at least one adverse event; 59 in the vosoritide group (98.3%), and 60 in the placebo group (98.4%) [6] .",

These data are consistent with those observed in the phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of vosoritide, where the increase in annualized growth velocity approached that of average-statured children of a similar age [5, 6] . They provide further, robust clinical evidence that vosoritide is an effective precision therapy for children aged 5 to 18 years with achondroplasia [5, 6] . No adverse effects on bone maturation have been observed in these trials. This, combined with the improvements in body segment proportionality, suggests that longer periods of treatment with vosoritide commenced at an earlier age might result in sustained enhancement of skeletal growth, with clinically and functionally beneficial consequences. Due to the inherent variability of growth and the lesser magnitude of the pubertal growth spurt in children with achondroplaisa, these long-term effects will only be known once these children reach final adult height [2] .",
