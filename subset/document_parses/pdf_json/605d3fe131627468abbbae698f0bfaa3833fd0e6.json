The death rate is even higher in the obese COVID-19 patients, as a result of hypoxia, due to the interplay between adipose tissue hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea. The discrepancy of manifestations seen in COVID-19 seems to be mediated by a differential immune response rather than a differential viral load. One of the key players of the immune response is HIF. HIF-1\u03b2 is a stable constitutively expressed protein in the nucleus; and under hypoxic changes, its activity is unaffected, whereas the HIF-\u03b1 subunit has a short half-life and because of its degradation by an enzyme known as propyl hydroxylase; under hypoxic conditions, propyl hydroxylase gets deactivated thus leading to the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1. As mentioned before, HIF-1\u03b1 expression is triggered by hypoxic states, this crippling condition will aggravate the pro-inflammatory characteristics of HIF-1\u03b1. The vast majority of decompensated COVID19 cases manifest with drastic lung injury and severe viral pneumonia, the infection-induced hypoxia will the existing hypoxia in obesity. This will additionally augment HIF-1\u03b1 levels that will provoke the already existing cytokines' storm to fulminant. Consequently, this will directly correlate the effect of a hypoxic environment with the increase of HIF-1\u03b1 level. HIF\u0251 exists in two main isoforms HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1. HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 act in distinct ways in how they work on different target genes. For example, HIF-2\u03b1 may act on hemopoietin genes (heme-regulating genes); while HIF-1\u03b1 acts on EPO. HIF-1\u03b1 release seems to be markedly augmented in obesity due to adipose tissue hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea resulting in cyclic hypoxia. HIF-1\u03b1 can also be secreted by direct viral proteolytic effects. Whereas, HIF-2\u03b1 is stimulated by chronic hypoxia. HIF-1\u03b1 exerts detrimental effects on the immune system, characterized by unopposed pro-inflammation at the macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and complement levels resulting in cytokines' storm, which is linked to the poor outcomes of COVID-19. On the other hand, HIF-2\u03b1 role is regulatory and largely opposes the actions mediated by HIF-1\u03b1. In view of this, inhibiting HIF-1\u03b1 release or switching its production to HIF-2\u03b1 by natural products such as resveratrol or by synthetic drugs, offer a good therapeutic strategy that can prevent COVID-19 worst outcome in infected patients. The approach of breaking the vicious circle between lung damage-induced hypoxia and HIF-1\u03b1",

They may also potentially develop dire consequences such as the deterioration to multiorgan system complications such as liver injury, cardiomyopathy, acute kidney failure, gastrointestinal, and, central and peripheral nervous system affection. (L. Li et al., 2020) Increasing evidence suggests that this is caused by the detrimental inflammatory response of several aspects of the innate and specific immunity rather than the viral load itself. With that being said, the presence of such a spectrum of COVID manifestations can be explained by the existence of 2 main immune-types: Immunotype 1 related to severe disease, and Immunotype 2 related to the mild form. This was shown by Matthew et al., and confirmed by Liao et al., who successfully demonstrated pro-inflammatory macrophage subtypes, depleted dysfunctional resident T lymphocytes, and a cytokine storm in the lung milieu of severe COVID cases, in contrast with mild cases (Liao et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020) .",

The affinity purification detected HIF-1\u03b1 as the original HIF isoform from EPO locus using oligonucleotides, while HIF-2\u03b1 including HIF-3\u03b1 by homology searches or screens for interaction partners with HIF-1\u03b2. On the other hand, definitive studies in mice revealed that HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 work in two separate lines. Therefore, the inactivation of each subunit results in a distinctly different phenotype (Koh and Powis 2012) . This may result from two different poorly understood mechanisms: Firstly, the differences in tissue-specific induction of each isoform: As concluded by Sowter et al., in the breast carcinoma and endothelial cell lines, the major HIF required for induction of a set of well- (Sowter et al., 2001) . However, for hypoxia-induced cell migration, both subunits are necessary, which leads us to a similar conclusion as Blancher et al. who stated that while HIF 1 alpha is responsible for the regulation of a broad spectrum of hypoxia-inducible genes, HIF 2 alpha inhibits the growth of breast cells (Blancher et al., 2000) . This shows a strong relationship between the pattern of expression of both subunits wherein six human breast cancer cell lines, HIF 1 alpha was expressed at various levels, whereas, HIF 2 alpha was low or not even present in more aggressive cell lines. On the other hand, HIF 2 alpha overexpression is especially important in the development of renal carcinoma in patients with the von Hippel Lindau syndrome. In this setting, HIF 2 alpha may act as a renal cancer oncogene. Moreover, HIF 2 alpha is highly expressed in embryonic vascular endothelial cells and activates the expression of target genes whose products modulate vascular function and angiogenesis (Blancher et al., 2001) . Recently, Skuli et al. introduced a model of mice with HIF-2\u03b1-deficient endothelial cells and found that although they developed normally, such animals are characterized by increased vessel permeability, aberrant endothelial cell ultrastructure, and pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, these animals exhibited defective tumor angiogenesis associated with increased hypoxic stress and tumor cell apoptosis (Skuli and Simon 2009) .",

Thus, hypoxia exists in severe pneumonia and respiratory distress following SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is growing evidence that hypoxia acts as an inflammatory stimulant through HIF. Three HIF-\u03b1 proteins have been recognized; HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, and, more recently, HIF-3\u03b1. Despite sharing 48% of their amino acid sequence and having a similar protein structure, HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 have dissimilar target genes and are expressed differently. Cells acclimate to hypoxia by tailoring a cascade of responses mediated by HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1, depending upon the span and pattern of hypoxia. In their review, Saxena and Jolly distinguishably analyzed the pattern of hypoxia responsible for the switch between the two main isoforms of HIF: acute hypoxia mainly stimulates HIF-1A release, while chronic hypoxia stimulates HIF-2\u03b1 release. Moreover, the review added additional insights on the third type of hypoxia, an intermittent one. Brown et al. were the first to identify the presence of this type of hypoxia in mice tumors, which occurred because of the intermittent closure in the tumor blood vessels. This inefficient blood perfusion occurs due to increased oxygen demands in the growing tumor that leads to angiogenesis, forming structurally, and functionally abnormal blood vessels (Saxena and Jolly 2019).",

In addition, the higher prevalence of OSA in obese subjects is not confined to adults; recent statistics indicate that, relative to children seen in a general pediatric clinic, obese children have a 46% prevalence of OSA (33%) (Schwartz et al., 2008) .",

This finding may be attributed to OSA causing reduced activity levels and increased appetite, particularly for refined carbohydrates. Whether OSA predisposes to preferential accumulation of visceral fat is still unclear. However. as assessed by abdominal CT scanning, CPAP treatment of OSA has been shown to decrease the amount of visceral fat even in patients without significant loss of weight (Kritikou et al., 2013) .",

The hypertrophic adipocytes overgrow in diameter beyond the limit of oxygen perfusion. White adipose tissue depots in turn become hypoxic.

It accumulates during hypoxia and rewires cellular energy metabolism in adipose tissue macrophages. This reprogramming regulates the macrophages' number, phenotype, and function. As such, macrophages are more prevalent in the adipose tissue of obese people than in that of leaner ones. Macrophage infiltration and activation in adipose tissue is involved with inflammation, and subsequently with measures of insulin resistance. ATH increases the number of ATM and induces their inflammatory phenotypes via HIF-1\u0251 dependent mechanisms. Activation of NF-\u03baB enables the adipose tissue macrophages to survive in an obesogenic environment. ATH thus creates a state of lowgrade inflammation by stimulating ATM and changing their function to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines; such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, adiponectin, leptin, (MCP-1), and retinol-binding protein-4.",

The tree-like cytoplasmic processes of DC allows it to act as an antigen-presenting cell and consequently linking the innate and adaptive immune systems. In COVID-19 patients, the delayed T cell immune response has been attributed to the rapid loss of the DC function, which was claimed to be resulting from steroid administration. Zhou et al., however, proved that assumption wrong. It is becoming widely accepted that inflammatory hypoxia is crucial for normal DC function with HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 as the key transcription factors regulating DC adaptation. In vivo studies by Hamammi et al. and Fluck et al. concluded , that DC lacking HIF-1\u03b1 were the most potent inducers of inflammatory response. On the other hand, prolonged DC hypoxia has shown higher expression of CD40. Hypoxia has also caused higher T cell stimulation of DCs. Inhibition of the HIF pathway could block these changes (Hammami et al., 2018) .",

Hypoxia and HIF-1\u03b1 can affect the cytokine-mediated inflammatory response by either stimulating or inhibiting it. For instance, the stabilization of hypoxia and HIF-1\u03b1 may cause the enhancement or trigger the cytokine storm, as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is transcriptionally upregulated by HIF-1\u03b1 and accumulates under hypoxia. Endothelial cells are essential contributors to severe COVID-19 initiation and propagation. Circulating inflammatory cells migration into tissues is decided by a number of adhesive molecules and chemo-attractants produced by endothelial cells and increased vascular permeability. VEGF and VEGF receptors are participants in this process. When VEGF-A binds to VEGFR -2, an elevation in the expression of cytokine and pulmonary vascular permeability was noticed in cystic fibrosis patients undergoing lung transplantation and in experimental animals (Krenn et al., 2007) .",

The accumulation of activated neutrophils in the microcirculatory bed of the lungs, alveoli, and interstitium, is not just one of ARDS characteristics, it's also considered to be one of the causative factors of lung tissue damage due to a local factor. Neutrophil elimination through apoptosis and macrophage clearance is thought to be a principal feature in the inflammatory process. ARDS affects neutrophils by turnover impairment. On the other hand, hypoxia decreases neutrophil apoptosis through HIF-1\u03b1 and nuclear factor \u03baB and MIP1\u03b1. According to Cramer and colleagues, HIF-1\u03b1 is crucial for the glycolytic capacity regulation in myeloid cells: when HIF-1\u03b1 is absent, the cellular ATP pool is dramatically decreased. This role for HIF-1\u03b1 manifests its direct regulation of survival and function in the inflammatory microenvironment. That's why we can conclude that HIF-1\u03b1 activation is not only included in the genesis of cytokine storm but also in the neutrophil apoptosis disruption in ARDS (Thorsten Cramer, Yuji Yamanishi, Bj\u00f6rn E.

Furthermore, the obesity-coronaviridae complex seems to upregulate the release of HIF-1\u03b1, which acts to increase unopposed inflammation at various levels of the immune system, potentially resulting in the cytokine storm responsible for the devastating mortality seen by COVID-19. Despite being a transcription factor, its action is not limited to the nucleus alone, where it also acts in a paracrine manner through extracellular vesicles to stimulate proinflammatory mechanisms in nearby cells. In contrast, HIF-2\u03b1 opposes the pro-inflammatory detrimental effects of HIF-1\u03b1. The opposing actions of both isoforms are attributed mainly to their actions on different target genes. In view of the above, we urge working groups all over the world to initiate clinical trials involving HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitors or HIF-1\u03b1 switchers to HIF-2\u03b1 to guard against the generation of cytokine storms and by default against COVID-19's systemic and pulmonary complications.",
