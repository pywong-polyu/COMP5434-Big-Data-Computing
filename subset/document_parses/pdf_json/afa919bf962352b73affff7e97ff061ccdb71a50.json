            "text": "Tissue damage and repair are hallmarks of the inflammatory process. Despite a wealth of information focused on the mechanisms that govern tissue damage, mechanistic insight on how inflammatory immune mediators affect the restitution phase is lacking. Here, we investigated how interferons influence tissue restitution after damage of the intestinal mucosa driven by inflammatory or physical injury. We found that type III, but not type I, interferons serve a central role in the restitution process. Type III interferons induce the upregulation of ZBP1, caspase activation, and cleavage of gasdermin C, and drive epithelial cell death by pyroptosis, thus delaying tissue restitution. We also found that this pathway is transcriptionally regulated in IBD patients. Our findings highlight a new molecular signaling cascade initiated by the immune system that affects the outcome of the immune response by delaying tissue repair and that may have important implications for human inflammatory disorders.",

The strong interrelationship between these two functions of the immune system is best exemplified during the restitution phase that follows mucosal damage, occurring as a consequence of an immune response. The skin, the lungs, the gut, and other mucosae are constantly exposed to microbial and/or physical perturbations and harbor multiple immune and non-immune cells that sense the presence of hostile environmental or endogenous factors and mount a defensive response. The causative agent of this response, the response itself, or both, may lead to tissue damage. Tissue damage sensing by tissueresident as well as newly recruited cells initiates a complex cascade of cellular and molecular processes to restore tissue functionality and homeostasis, or to adapt to persistent perturbations (Meizlish, Franklin et al. 2021 ).",

In the intestine, immune cells, epithelial cells, and commensal microbes are in a dynamic equilibrium. A monolayer of highly specialized epithelial cells separates the gut lumen from the underlying lamina propria. The interplay between microbiota-derived inflammatory cues and the host cells in the intestine profoundly impacts the biology of the gut, both during homeostasis, inflammation, and damage responses. The lamina propria hosts a large variety of immune and non-immune cells that detect alterations in the functioning as well as in the integrity of the epithelial barrier and mount an immune response. The fine equilibrium between the microbiota, the epithelial barrier, and the immune system is lost during inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs).",

Along with a heightened inflammatory response, IBDs are characterized by the breach of the intestinal barrier and a defective repair response that compromises mucosal homeostasis. Therefore, the ability of immune mediators to influence epithelial repair has an important impact on the pathogenesis of IBDs. Indeed, the promotion of mucosal healing has been recognized as a major therapeutic challenge for the management of IBDs (Pineton de Chambrun, Peyrin-Biroulet et al. 2010) .",

IFN-\u03bb, as type I IFNs, plays potent anti-microbial roles, but, in contrast to type I IFNs, also preserves gut functionality by limiting excessive damage . The limited damage is largely explained by the fact that the expression of the IFN-\u03bb receptor (IFNLR) is mainly restricted to epithelial cells and neutrophils. In contrast, type I IFNs act systemically and play potent inflammatory activities on immune and nonimmune cells thanks to the broad expression of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). The local activity of IFN-\u03bb at mucosal tissues, thus, limits the extent of activation of immune cells, preventing excessive tissue damage, while preserving the anti-microbial functions of IFN-\u03bb ).",

Indeed, IFN-\u03bb and type I IFNs have been shown to function in a balanced and compartmentalized way to favor re-epithelization by acting, respectively, on epithelial cells or immune cells resident in the lamina propria (McElrath, Espinosa et al. 2021) . IFN-\u03bb has been also proposed to facilitate the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells via STAT1 signaling (Chiriac, Buchen et al. 2017) and to partially enhance gut mucosal integrity during graft versus host disease (Henden, Koyama et al. 2021 ). On the other hand, though, IFN-\u03bb and/or the IFNLR were found to be upregulated in IBD patients (Chiriac, Buchen et al. 2017 , Gunther, Ruder et al. 2019 . Also, systemic and prolonged overexpression of IFN-\u03bb in mice favored the death of Paneth cells, a group of cells that can facilitate epithelial cell regeneration by acquiring stem-like features (Schmitt, Schewe et al. 2018) , and by regulating the balance of epithelial growth factors in the stem cell niche (Sato, van Es et al. 2011 ).",

To assess the involvement of IFN-\u03bb during the restitution phase of the DSS colitis model, we injected, or not, recombinant (r)IFN-\u03bb in mice after DSS-induced inflammation has peaked.

After the peak of the inflammatory process induced by DSS administration, mice were treated with a blocking antibody directed against IFN-\u03bb and compared to mice treated with DSS, in the presence or absence of rIFN-\u03bb. Our data demonstrated that inhibition of endogenous IFN-\u03bb facilitates tissue restitution as measured by increased weight gain and colon lengthening (Figure 1D, E) . Notably, we found that ISG levels in epithelial cells were significantly decreased in mice treated with the anti-IFN-\u03bb antibody ( Figure S1A ), suggesting that IFN-\u03bb, rather than type I IFNs, plays a major role in driving gene transcription during the repair phase of colitis. To directly test the involvement of type I IFNs in the restitution phase of DSS-induced colitis, we either blocked type I IFN signaling using an anti-IFNAR antibody, or added rIFN\u03b2, 7 days after DSS administration. In keeping with a key role of IFN-\u03bb in regulating mucosal epithelial responses, none of the treatments aimed at targeting type I IFNs affected tissue repair (Figure 1F, G) . Accordingly, ISG levels in colonocytes were not altered under these experimental conditions compared to control mice ( Figure S1B ).",

We found a significant increase in the expression of ZBP1 as well as GSDMC in patients with active IBD, compared to non-IBD controls ( Figure 4B ). Similar expression trends were observed in RNAseq datasets derived from rectal mucosal biopsies from ulcerative colitis (UC) pediatric patients (PROTECT cohort) and from ileal biopsies from Crohn's disease (CD) pediatric patients (RISK cohort) in two independent cohorts previously published (Haberman, Tickle et al. 2014 , Haberman, Karns et al. 2019 (Figure S4B ). In keeping with a key role of IFNs also in IBD patients, we found that genes regulated in response of IFNs (evaluated as mean expression of genes that belong to the \"HALLMARK _IFN_ALPHA_RESPONSE\" geneset (Liberzon, Birger et al. 2015) and indicated as \"IFN response score\") were significantly enriched in IBD patients with active disease, compared to controls or patients with inactive disease ( Figure 4B) . In support of a role of IFN-\u03bb in modulating GSDMC expression, GSDMC levels positively correlated with the IFN response score in patients with active disease, but not in the other subjects analyzed ( Figure 4C) .

Dying cells assumed typical changes associated with pyroptosis including swelling and sudden disruption of the plasma membrane and liberation of nuclear DNA ( Figure 5A ). By using organoids derived from WT or Stat1 -/mice, we also confirmed that gene transcription induced by IFN-\u03bb was necessary to induce cell death ( Figure 5B ). No differences were observed between the two genotypes in the absence of rIFN-\u03bb ( Figure 5B) . Similar to what we observed in irradiated epithelial cells in vivo, we found that rIFN-\u03bb administration to small intestine organoids profoundly diminished the level of Lgr5 expression, suggesting a defect in the maintenance and/or proliferation of ISCs ( Figure S5B ). In agreement with a reduced number of ISCs that proliferate, we also found that cell proliferation (as measured by EdU incorporation) was significantly decreased in IFN-\u03bb-treated mouse, as well as human organoids ( Figure 5C , S5C).",

In agreement with the capacity of IFN-\u03bb to activate a ZBP1/Caspase-8/GSDMC axis, organoids grown for 6 days and then administered with rIFN-\u03bb showed ZBP1 upregulation and cleavage of GSDMC-2/-3 and Caspase-8 and Caspase-3 ( Figure 5E ). Furthermore, inhibition of caspase activity with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK protected the organoids from cell death induced by IFN-\u03bb ( Figure 5F ). To directly assess the involvement of GSDMC in this process, we knocked down Gsdmc-2 and Gsdmc-3 in small intestine organoids and found that, similar to Zbp1 -/organoids, upon exposure to rIFN-\u03bb, survival of organoids that do not express Gsdmc2, 3 was significantly increased compared to controls ( Figure 5G ).",

Although the protective functions of IFN-\u03bb in the gut, and in general at mucosal surfaces, are well known ), much less is known about the functions of this group of IFNs during the healing phase that follows intestinal tissue damage. Our data reveal the unique capacity of IFN-\u03bb, compared to type I IFNs, to negatively affect tissue restitution in the intestine, possibly opening new ways of therapeutic intervention for individuals that encounter tissue damage such as IBD patients or subjects exposed to radiation therapies. healing. Lrg5 + ISCs support normal cell turnover as well as injury-induced restitution (Metcalfe, Kljavin et al. 2014) . When ISC are depleted by radiation, or by immune-mediated tissue-damaging events, TA cells retro-differentiate and acquire new stem-like properties in the small, as well as in the large, intestine (Wang, Chiang et al. 2019 , Ohara, Colonna et al. 2022 . These cells then proliferate to allow the re-epithelization of the damaged tissue. We and others previously described the capacity of IFN-\u03bb to dampen lung epithelial cell proliferation (Broggi, Ghosh et al. 2020 , Major, Crotta et al. 2020 and to instruct anti-proliferative transcriptional programs in the lung of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Sposito, Broggi et al. 2021) . Nevertheless, our new findings in the gut suggest that decreased proliferation assessed at transcriptional and cellular levels is due to augmented cell death, possibly occurring in newly generated ISCs or in TA cells.",

            "text": "Another interesting observation we made is that exogenous administration of IFN-\u03bb does not induce caspase or GSDMC activation in vivo in the absence of tissue damage, although it induces ZBP1 upregulation at the transcriptional as well as protein level. ZBP1 is a Z-DNA binding protein, and is part of the PANoptosome, a multiprotein complex that governs the cell fate (Place, Lee et al. 2021) . PANoptosis is a form of cell death that encompasses pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. ZBP1 can interact directly or indirectly with proteins that regulate cell death and drive the activation of apoptotic caspases 8, 3 and 7, the necroptosis effector MLKL, or pyroptosis effectors Casp-1, 11 and GSDMD. So far, GSDMC was not associated with ZBP1 and/or PANoptosis. Our data highlight the existence of a ZBP1-GSDMC axis that appears to be the preferential pathway of cell death that is active during cycles of intestinal epithelial damage and restitution. Upregulation of ZBP1 alone is not sufficient to trigger the full activation of the PANoptosome, which is consistent with our inability to detect toxic effects of IFN-\u03bb in the absence of inflammation or tissue damage. Conversely, ZBP1 can be activated both by binding microbialderived nucleic acids (Kuriakose, Zheng et al. 2018 , Muendlein, Connolly et al. 2021 or by binding host-derived Z-DNA following oxidative damage of the mitochondria (Szczesny, Marcatti et al. 2018) . It is, thus, possible that in vivo, under tissue-damaging conditions, either microbiota-or host-derived DNA becomes available to induce the assembly and activation of the PANoptosome downstream of ZBP1. In contrast to our in vivo data, administration of IFN-\u03bb to murine or human intestinal organoids induces the ZBP1-GSDMC axis and drives cell death. We, thus, speculate that under our in vitro experimental conditions a \"tissue damage\" signal, e.g. Z-DNA from dying cells that are differentiating in vitro, is available, thus making additional signals unnecessary.",

Tissue restitution in the gut is regulated by a complex crosstalk between epithelial cells, immune cells, microbial stimuli, and mesenchymal cells and culminates in the proliferation of ISCs.

In contrast, when mice are injected with rIFN-\u03bb, or infected with murine rotavirus, a type of virus potently controlled by IFN-\u03bb (Walker, Sridhar et al. 2021), responses to IFN-\u03bb broadly distribute along the epithelial layer.",

Mice then received gamma irradiation in a Best Theratronics Gammacell 40 Cesium 137-based irradiator with lead shielding of the head, thorax, and upper extremities to prevent bone marrow failure. In one sitting mice received either 11 Grey of gamma irradiation to assess tissue restitution in small intestinal crypts or 14 Grey of gamma irradiation for survival experiments. To assess proliferation, mice were intraperitoneally administered a 100 mg/kg dose of EdU in saline, final volume 500\u03bcl.Histological Analysis and ImmunofluorescenceFor morphologic analysis of irradiation experiments, fragments of the small intestine were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. Intestinal sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images were acquired with an EVOS M7000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Intact crypts were counted in 3 sections per animal blindly with ImageJ software. Proliferation was assessed by measuring the number of EdU + cells per intestinal crypt. A minimum of 10 crypts per section and 3 sections per mouse were evaluated. For Immunofluorescence analysis, paraffin sections were deparaffinized with sequential washes in xylene and ethanol. Deparaffinized sections were then stained for EdU incorporation. All quantifications were executed in a blinded fashion. For histology of DSS-colitis experiments, colons were flushed with PBS, flattened and rolled into a 'Swiss roll'. Colon rolls were fixed in 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific), dehydrated in 70% Ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and histological features were evaluated. Histological scoring was performed in a blinded fashion by assignment of a score of 1-5 to segments of the colon roll (1, presence of leukocyte infiltrate, loss of goblet cells; 2, bottom third of the crypt compromised; 3, two thirds of the crypt compromised; 4, complete crypt architecture loss; 5, complete crypt loss and lesion of the epithelial layer). Each segment was then measured with ImageJ software, and the final histological score of each sample was obtained by 'weighting' the score of each segment against the length of the segment and divided by the total length of the colon roll.EdU incorporation staining. Deparaffinized slides or organoids fixed on transwell were stained for 30 minutes with 2mM Sulfo-Cyanine5-azide (Lumiprobe) in the presence of 1mM CuSO4 and 2mg/ml Sodium ascorbate, in PBS. After EdU staining, slides were stained with DAPI (Sigma) to detect nuclei, and mounted with ProLongGold antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific).",

Transfection efficiency was monitored by GFP fluorescence, media was changed 24 hours post transfection and lentivirus particles were harvested in cell culture media 72 hours after transfection. Lentivirus particles were concentrated with Lenti-X TM Concentrator (Takara 631232) with the manufacturers protocol.Concentrated particles were resuspended in 100% WRN conditioned media and titers were checked using Lenti-X TM GoStix TM Plus (Takara 631280). Only high titer lenti-particles were used to transduce duodenoids. For transduction, duodenoids were removed from Matrigel with Cell Recovery Solution and dissociated into single cells in Trypsin-EDTA for 10 minutes. Debris was removed by filtering over a 70uM Cell strainer (Stem Cell Technologies #27260) and single cells isolated at 300RCF for 10 minutes. Single cells were resuspended in 1ml of Organoid Growth Media + 500ul of concentrated lentivirus particles in a 15ml conical tube supplemented with 4ug/mL polybrene. Cells were spin-transduced in a pre-warmed 32C centrifuge in a swinging bucket rotor at 500 x g for 1 hour. Organoid pellet was resuspended in matrigel, plated onto a Corning 24 Well plate, and incubated in a 37C +5%CO2 incubator for 2 hours. After two hours 500ul of organoid growth media was added.
