            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Productive SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Indeed, viral entry into cells is mostly mediated by the early interaction between the viral spike protein S and its ACE2 receptor. The S/ACE2 complex is, thus, the first contact point between the incoming virus and its cellular target; consequently, it has been considered an attractive therapeutic target. To further characterize this interaction and the cellular processes engaged in the entry step of the virus, we set up various in silico, in vitro and in cellulo approaches that allowed us to specifically monitor the S/ACE2 association. We report here a novel computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex as well as its biochemical and biophysical monitoring using pulldown, AlphaLISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding assays. This led us to determine the kinetic parameters of the S/ACE2 association and dissociation steps. In parallel to these in vitro approaches, we developed in cellulo transduction assays using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and HEK293T-ACE2 cell lines generated in-house. This allowed us to recapitulate the early replication stage of the infection mediated by the S/ACE2 interaction and to detect cell fusion induced by the interaction. Finally, a cell imaging system was set up to directly monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a cellular context, and a flow cytometry assay was developed to quantify this association at the cell surface. Together, these different approaches are available for both basic and clinical research aiming to characterize the entry step of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and its variants as well as to investigate the possible chemical modulation of this interaction. All these models will help in identifying new antiviral agents and new chemical tools for dissecting the virus entry step.",

            "text": "ACE2 (1) has been reported as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the lung, as previously shown for SARS-CoV, which was responsible for the first SARS outbreak in 2003 (2) . ACE2 is expressed in human airway epithelia, lung parenchyma, vascular endothelia, kidney cells, and small intestine cells but is only weakly detected in the brain (3, 4) . However, in addition to respiratory syndrome, neurologic signs have been frequently observed, suggesting that the virus may also infect or invade the central nervous system (CNS) as supported by previous reports of CNS infection by SARS-CoV and the presence of viral particles in patient brains (5, 6) . Taken together, these data strongly suggest additional routes for viral entry to the CNS. The results from the literature confirmed the neuronal invasion property of the virus as well as the requirement for the ACE2 receptor in this process (7, 8) . Taken together, these data indicate that the S/ACE2 interaction remains the major entry pathway for SARS-CoV-2. To further investigate this interaction and thus identify new antiviral agents as well as new chemical tools for dissecting this entry step, we set up in silico, in vitro and in cellulo systems to monitor the S/ACE2 association. We report here computational visualization and analysis of the S/ACE2 complex as well as its monitoring using biochemical pulldown methods and biophysics approaches as well as AlphaLISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding assays. In addition to these in silico and in vitro approaches, we also developed a SARS-CoV-2 lentivirus infectivity assay and performed cell imaging and flow cytometry quantification of the S/ACE2 interaction. In addition to allowing the determination of the kinetic parameters of the interaction, our work provides a combination of methods for further analyses of the viral entry step and for the selection of drugs targeting this stage of the infection",

The X-ray structure with the PDB ID 6M0J, with a resolution of 2.45 \u00c5 was used (DOI: 10 .1038/s41586-020-2180-5). This structure contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1 and includes all the amino acid residues of the RDB, with well-defined density between the residues on S1 RDB and ACE2. Protonation states of all the amino acid residues were predicted using PropKA version 3.0 at pH 7.0 (DOI: 10.1021/ct100578z). The system was prepared for molecular dynamics using the AMBER18 software package and Leap, with the ff14SB force field (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255). Charges on the system were neutralized through the addition of counter-ions (Na + ) and the system was placed in a with TIP3P water box with a minimum distance of 12 \u00c5 between the proteinsurface and the side of the box, using the Leap module of AMBER. The model was submitted to four consecutive minimizations stages to remove clashes prior to the MD simulation. In these four stages, the minimization procedure was applied to the following atoms of the system: 1-water molecules (2500 steps); 2-hydrogens atoms (2500 steps); 3-side chains of the amino acid residues (2500 steps); 4-full system (10.000 steps). The model was then subject to a molecular dynamics equilibration procedure, which was divided into two stages: In the first stage (50 ps), the model was gradually heated to 310.15 K using a Langevin thermostat at constant volume (NVT ensemble); in the second stage (50 ps) the density of the systems was further equilibrated at 310.15 K. Finally, molecular dynamics production runs were performed for 400 ns with an NPT ensemble at constant temperature (310.15 K, Langevin thermostat) and pressure (1 bar, Berendsen barostat), using periodic boundary conditions, an integration time of 2.0 fs (with SHAKE algorithm to constrain all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms). A 10 \u00c5 cutoff for nonbonded interactions was used during the entire molecular simulation procedure. Coordinates were saved at each 10 ps. Final trajectories were analyzed in terms of backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSd), hydrogen bonds formed and clusters analysis. From the cluster analysis performed on the ensemble of poses generated from the MD simulations, one representative structure from each of the 8 dominant clusters was selected, for the subsequent step. The FPocket software (DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-10-168) was then used to identify possible druggable pockets in the interfacial S1-ACE2 region in each of the selected structures and in the initial model prepared from the X-ray structure. A minimum of 50 alpha-spheres per pocket was defined as criteria.",

For the association step, each loaded biosensor was dipped into serial dilutions of S-RBD(His)6 (from 3.12 nM to 100nM) for 300 s with a 2200 rpm shaking speed. Finally, the dissociation step of the bound S-RBD(His)6 was monitored by dipping the biosensor back into the reaction buffer for 300 s. Control experiments were performed to measure non-specific binding and included binding of reaction buffer with loaded biosensor (data subtracted) and binding of 100 nM of S-RBD(His)6 with no ACE2-Biot loaded onto the biosensor. The association and dissociation experimental curves were global fitted using a 1:1 binding model with the ForteBio Blitz pro 1.1 software. Kinetic binding parameters (ka, kd) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) were determined. Sensorgrams curves were plotted using Prism 5.0 software (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA)",

The simulation allowed us to precisely model the structural interfaces within the complex ( Figure 1A) and isolate the minimal receptor binding domain of S (RBD) (Figure 1B) . To precisely monitor the contacts between the spike protein and ACE2, we considered the previously published X-ray structure (9) and 8 representative structures obtained from a cluster analysis performed on a 400 ns molecular dynamics simulation with the AMBER force field (ff14SB) in a TIP3P water box with periodic boundary conditions. These 9 structures were used with FPocket (DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-10-168) to search for and identify important zones of contact between the two proteins within the S/ACE2 complex. The protocol allowed us to identify transient interfaces within the S/ACE2 complex and to incorporate the dynamic nature of the interface into the definition of the pocket to be explored in future virtual screening campaigns. The structural pockets identified are given in Figure  1C , which also illustrates the representative structure of each cluster and the percentage of structures in the MD simulations that correspond to each cluster. In addition, from the analysis of the hydrogen bond patterns during the MD simulations, the most stable hydrogen interactions for the S/ACE2 association were identified. These are reported in Figure 1D , which reports all the interfacial hydrogen bonds that are present in more than 20% of the structures generated by MD. This suggests that targeting the pockets identified in Figure 1C in a way that interferes with or blocks the formation of the hydrogen bonds described may constitute a strategy to be used in virtual screens for new compounds.",

Treatment with drugs targeting the early stages of lentiviral replication, i.e., reverse transcription and integration, which are shared in common by the two LV systems (efavirenz treatment reported in Figure 4C and dolutegravir treatment reported in Figure 4D ), also confirmed that both LVs were equally affected by the drugs.

Taken together, these data fully confirmed that LV infectivity monitoring of CoV-2 was directly related to the S/ACE2 entry pathway.

Analysis of the kinetics of cell fusion showed that the maximal percentage of fused cells was observed from 2 h posttransduction and lasted until 16 h post-transduction ( Figure 5D) .",

To answer this question, we incubated either HEK293T or HEK293T-ACE2 cells with the recombinant S-RBD protein and monitored cell fusion using epifluorescence microscopy to quantify polynuclear cells. As reported in Figure 6A , incubation of HEK293T-ACE2 cells with S-RBD protein induced a strong cell fusion phenotype. In contrast, no detectable effect was observed in HEK293T cells lacking the ACE2 receptor. The morphology of fused cells, magnified in Figure 6B , was similar to that observed in 293T-ACE2 cells transduced with the CoV-2 LV (cf Figure 5B) . Quantification of the percentage of polynuclear cells confirmed the specific effect of the S-RBD protein in HEK293T-ACE2 cells compared to HEK293T cells that did not express the ACE2 receptor ( Figure 6C) . Treatment with recombinant soluble ACE2 protein confirmed that the cell fusion induced by S-RBD protein could also be prevented by competition with the cellular soluble receptor in contrast to efavirenz or dolutegravir ( Figure 6D ).",

For this purpose, we developed an immunofluorescence binding assay using recombinant RBD(His)6 previously used for the in vitro interaction assays. For this purpose, recombinant S-RBD(His)6 protein was incubated with either HEK293T-ACE2-expressing cellular receptors or control HEK293T cells. Cells were then observed under an epifluorescence microscope after immunofluorescence labeling using anti-(His)6 antibodies. As reported in Figure 7A -B, after 16 h incubation with 293T-ACE2 cells, the S-RBD(His)6 protein was detected mostly at the plasma membrane. In contrast, no significant signal could be detected when the protein was incubated with 293T cells lacking the ACE2 receptor. More accurate kinetic analysis of incubation showed that the S-RBD protein was detected 2 h after incubation, and the plasma membrane signal increased with time, reaching a maximum intensity at 16 h ( Figure 7C) . To better quantify RBD binding to the cellular ACE2 receptor, we measured the percentage of cells that were positive for RBD binding by anti-(His)6 immunofluorescence followed by flow cytometry quantification. As reported in Figure 7D , RBD binding to HEK293T-ACE2 cells could be detected using anti-(His)6 primary antibody and Alexa488-coupled secondary antibody. The positive signal was found to be specific for the presence of the cellular ACE2 receptor, confirming that the RBD-ACE2 interaction could be monitored and quantified. ACE2 competition assays further verified these data, as shown by the RBD binding to the cellular ACE2 receptor when soluble protein was added to the assay (Figure 7E ). ",

Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) experiments were performed using Streptavidin biosensors and 1 \u00b5M of ACE2-Biot coated for 500 s in order to reach a binding value of ~ 2.7 nm. Baseline with the reaction buffer was measured for 60 s. For the association step, each loaded biosensor was dipped into serial dilutions of S-RBD(His)6 (from 3.12 nM to 100 nM) for 300 s. The dissociation step of the bound S-RBD(His)6 was monitored by dipping the biosensor back into the reaction buffer for 300 s. Control experiments were performed to measure non-specific binding and included binding of reaction buffer with loaded biosensor (data subtracted) and binding of 100 nM of S-RBD(His)6 with no ACE2-Biot loaded onto the biosensor. Sensorgrams curves shown in (A) were plotted using Prism 5.0 software (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA).

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on the early interaction between the viral spike protein S and its cellular receptor ACE2, which triggers the entry of the virus into host cells. The fundamental understanding of this entry step, and the subsequent development of specific and efficient inhibitors of this crucial replication stage, requires the ability to monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in silico, in vitro and in cellulo, and this specific interaction remains difficult to isolate in the context of a full wt virus infection. All three monitoring approaches were developed in combination in this work to help further analyze S-ACE2-mediated viral entry processes.Based on previously published structural data (9) , 400 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed, providing a dynamic view of the interaction between S and ACE2 that complements the information provided from the available X-ray structures. Together, these results provide detailed atom-level data on the minimal regions of interaction, in addition to possible druggable sites. In addition to providing data about the dynamics of the interaction, this work allowed us to set up modeling pipelines for further virtual screening of drug libraries targeting these unedited druggable sites. A set of biochemical and biophysical parameters was then used to both monitor and characterize this interaction between the minimal S-RBD/ACE2 complex. In particular, AlphaLISA technology could be applied to detect the interaction between both proteins. Optimization of this approach allowed us to monitor the association between the two partners with very low amounts of proteins (nM range) and strong AS signals (up to 1 000 000 AS units). Tolerance to DMSO solvent was also analyzed to facilitate further drug analysis. This powerful system will allow drug library screening as well as characterization of the interaction in different genetic contexts, such as S mutants from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. An additional optical analytical technique based on biolayer interferometry (BLI) was also used to detect the S-RBD/ACE2 interaction. In addition to providing monitoring of the interaction in a dynamic context, the BLI data analysis allowed us to measure a fast association constant (Ka=2.65x10 5 M -1 s -1 ) and slow dissociation constant (kd=2.47x10 -4 s -1 . The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was 0.93 nM. All these results indicate a very stable and strong interaction between the S-RBD and ACE2 proteins. This assay will be very useful for testing the influence of S or ACE2 mutants, drugs and additional cofactors on both the association and dissociation steps of the S/ACE2 interaction process.In addition to these biochemical approaches, we developed cellular systems as complementary models to monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a physiological context. An infectivity assay relying on the S/ACE2 interaction was set up using lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein and HEK293T cells expressing the human ACE2 protein. A comparison with the infectivity of lentiviruses pseudotyped with the VSVg envelope protein enabled us to study parameters specifically modulating the SARS-CoV-2 entry step. This system will allow us to determine, or screen, drug effects on this specific S/ACE2-dependent viral entry. Indeed, increasing the concentration of ACE2 led to a strong inhibition of CoV-2 LV infectivity, in contrast to VSVg LV, which was not susceptible to ACE2 treatment. This confirmed that CoV-2 LV infectivity monitoring was directly related to the S/ACE2 entry pathway and that this assay could serve as the basis for selecting drugs specifically targeting this viral entry. Interestingly, transduction with the SARS-CoV-2 LV vectors, in contrast to VSVg LV, induced a cell fusion phenotype dependent specifically on the S/ACE2 interaction and thus recapitulated the cell fusion observed with wt virus (12) . Additionally, adding the recombinant RBD protein to cells expressing ACE2 and not the parental cells directly triggered cell fusion, indicating that the minimal S-RBD domain was sufficient for inducing this process and demonstrating that this domain constitutes the main determinant for this process. The S-RBD/ACE2 interaction could be monitored both by immunofluorescence and by FACS analysis using HEK293T-ACE2 cells and S-RBD(His)6 protein. In addition to providing an additional assay for directly detecting the RBD/ACE2 interaction in a physiological context, this model would also allow us to precisely determine the mechanism of action of drugs targeting the S/ACE2 complex as well as investigate this specific event.In summary, we provide here a panel of in silico, biochemical, biophysics and cellular approaches for monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 S/human ACE2 interaction. This set of approaches is available for the community to further investigate the viral entry pathway and characterize new drugs or viral variants. The different models provided here will specifically allow the characterization of factors modulating the S/ACE2 complex and the study of their effect on the direct interaction between viral and cellular partners or on the cell fusion or infectivity induced by this association. Finally, in silico molecular dynamics simulation of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex revealed structural pockets within the S/ACE2 complex; targeting this structure in such a way that blocks the pocket or interferes with the formation of the described hydrogen bonds may be a strategy for future virtual screens for new compounds. Taken together, all the approaches reported in this work would allow the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 entry step from the very molecular point to the overall cellular mechanism.",
