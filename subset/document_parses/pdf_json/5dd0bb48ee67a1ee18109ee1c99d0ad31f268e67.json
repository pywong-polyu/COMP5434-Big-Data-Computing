General practice in the UK is under increasing pressure to improve patient access to health care to address rising patient demand with limited capacity and a workforce crisis. 1-2 Successive governments, therefore, have advocated for the adoption of online consultations to help alleviate these issues. The NHS Long Term Plan aims for patients to access 'digital first' primary care by 2023-2024, 3 meaning patients can 'easily access the advice, support and treatment they need using digital and online tools.' 4 The five-year framework for GP contract reform sets out intermediate goals: all patients should have had access to online consultations since April 2020 (and video consultations by April 2021). 5 Online consultation tools allow patients to remotely and asynchronously contact a GP using a computer, smartphone, or tablet to ask questions and describe symptoms in writing. Multiple tools are currently on the market in the UK that use automated triage algorithms, structured questionnaires, or free-text submissions. Patients using these tools may be signposted to self-care resources, immediately given the option to book an appointment online, or re-contacted through an online message or telephone call to resolve their problem or arrange a face-to-face consultation. Synchronous video consultation tools are not examined in this article.",

This stemmed from patient uncertainty about how their queries were dealt with, and whether practices used online consultations as their preferred method for patients to contact the practice. Consequences were identified that limited increases in practice efficiency by creating additional work, isolation, and dissatisfaction for some staff. over how they organise their workload and their working patterns. [4] [5] [6] [7] Evaluations of digital health technologies have generally found that their promise is not always delivered and they often produce unintended consequences; 8-11 that is, positive or negative effects that were not intended at the outset. Moreover, because the root causes were not well understood, strategies for dealing with unintended consequences have been criticised for being speculative, anecdotal, and vague. 9, 12 Previous studies of online consultations have specifically noted the importance of examining unintended consequences in order to fully understand their impact. [13] [14] [15] An understanding of these consequences is vital to minimise the negative effects and harness the positive. 16 Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify and understand the unintended consequences of online consultation tools.",

Allowing patients to 'access and interact with health and care services seamlessly', giving them convenient and instant access to care by following 'simple triage online to help them manage their own health needs or direct them to the appropriate service'; 3 and Intended consequence 2: increase the efficiency of care and reduce practice workload. Helping to 'alleviate workload challenges facing practices' 5 and creating 'greater efficiency across the whole system', 18 such as by reducing unnecessary face-toface appointments (although not necessarily by making face-to-face appointments shorter).

Relatedly, unintended consequences were found in which work was shifted from administrative to clinical staff when administrative staff were not confident with triage. These findings, and those of Casey and colleagues, 14 highlight how the redistribution of work within practices is complex and dependent on the existing skill-mix of staff and the new processes and workflows that are created.",

Since online consultations have been widely adopted sooner than anticipated, the unintended consequences need to be considered more openly and more widely, especially given that new workflows and processes may entail additional work that is difficult to recognise.

(GP1, Pr5, F) One of the few positive unintended consequences reported by a minority of staff was that regardless of whether any of the intended consequences were achieved, implementing online consultations fostered a greater sense of teamworking between staff groups: 'It made us as receptionists understand a little more about the duty doctor and kind of certainly broke down a few barriers because [the online consultation workflow meant] we were working hand in hand with the duty doctors a lot more [\u2026] Similarly with the urgent care nurses.'

When a free-text option was available, some patients struggled with how best to explain their issue owing to uncertainty about who they were writing to and who would read their enquiry:'I thoughtfor quite a bit about how to write it [the online consultation enquiry] so that it would be clear because [\u2026] I don't know actually who else reads it in between [\u2026] it's a bit odd because you don't know who you're actually talking to.' (P2, Pr2, F, aged 53 years) Practices that used the online consultation tools typically promised responses the next working day. Asynchronous communication with minimal opportunity for back-andforth added to the difficulty for patients, with some describing that communicating their issues and 'being heard' was more challenging: ' [Face to face] there are constant prompts and reminders as to what has been discussed and what is being agreed and what the concerns are [...] You've got these throwbacks all the way along so that you know somebody has understood you. Whereas you don't get that with this sort of simple transaction online.' (P3, Pr2, F, aged 56 years)Written asynchronous communication put more responsibility onto patients to articulate their issues independently. Furthermore, this minimised opportunities to raise other issues spontaneously. Patients highlighted holistic elements of care that were also lost without synchronous twoway interaction; for example, patients felt that it was 'a bit odd not having personal contact', that they missed out on 'a catch up as to how things are going' (P2, Pr2, F, aged 53 years), or suggested it was harder to be treated as individuals:'\u2026 they haven't got a clue about me [\u2026] I imagine they see some doddery old fossil, which I'm not [\u2026] that doctor has never ever seen me. I'd never met him either [\u2026] it's all very impersonal actually.' (P1, Pr1, F, aged 68 years)",

This provides an opportunity to innovate at a time when modifications to the physical environment of practice buildings and staff working patterns are still evolvingUnintended consequences and mitigation measures are derived from the interview findings as well as the views and experiences of participants at a stakeholder workshop held in When online consultations could potentially be reviewed and answered by any GP, both staff and patients noted further unintended consequences negatively impacting continuity of care: ' [Online consultations are] very much a move from [\u2026] a nice doctor-patient relationship [...] we try and maintain continuity, but that's difficult with this system [\u2026] often other people will pick up calls that are meant for you or the patients don't specifically ask for you.' (GP1, Pr1, F) Some practices used online consultations as their preferred way for patients to contact the practice for all enquiries. Patients and staff noted how this access model disadvantaged digitally-excluded patients, often the elderly:'\u2026 for my 92-year-old mother [\u2026] it was actually a huge problem. There's no way that she was going to be able to access her GP [online]. What she was saying to me was, \"Which doctor do you go to? How do you get in touch with them?\" [...] I think it's incredibly discriminatory. It assumes that everybody's into the digital era and they're not.' (P1, Pr1, F, aged 68 years)",
