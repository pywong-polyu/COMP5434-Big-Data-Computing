This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the quarantine on dietary, physical activity and alcohol consumption habits of Lithuanians and the association between health behaviours and weight changes. An online cross-sectional survey was carried out among individuals older than 18 years in April 2020. The self-administered questionnaire included health behaviour and weight change data. Altogether 2447 subjects participated in the survey. Almost half of the respondents (49.4%) ate more than usual, 45.1% increased snacking, and 62.1% cooked at home more often. Intake of carbonated or sugary drinks, fast food and commercial pastries decreased, while consumption of homemade pastries and fried food increased. A decrease in physical activity was reported by 60.6% of respondents. Every third (31.5%) respondent, more often those already with overweight, gained weight. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the higher odds of weight gain were associated with females, older age, increased consumption of sugary drinks, homemade pastries and fried food, eating more than usual, increased snacking, decreased physical activity and increased alcohol consumption. Our data highlighted the need for dietary and physical activity guidelines to prevent weight gain during the period of self-isolation, especially targeting those with overweight and obesity.",

On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern and a set of recommendations was issued [1] . In Lithuania, the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed on 28 February 2020. As the number of cases was increasing rapidly, the Lithuanian Government decided to declare quarantine from 16 to 30 March [2] . This was extended several times and ended on 16 June. All public indoor and outdoor gatherings were prohibited. Educational institutions began to work remotely. Shops excluding grocery shops and pharmacies were closed. Restaurants and bars were also closed, leaving the option for food takeaway. This situation forced people to cook",

The question about weight change was: 'Have you gained weight during the quarantine' with possible answers: 'Yes', 'No', 'I don't know'. By weight change, the respondents were grouped in those who gained weight ('Yes') and others ('No' or 'I don't know'). Self-reported current weight and height were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. According to WHO guidelines, overweight was defined as BMI 25-29 kg/m 2 and obesity as BMI \u2265 30 kg/m 2 [14] .",

The proportion of those who increased (14.2%) and decreased (15.9%) consumption of alcohol was similar. A large number of participants (60.6%) reported that they reduced physical activity (Table 2) . The changes in health behaviours differed according to changes in body weight ( Table 3) . Diet of those who gained weight changed in a more negative direction compared to those who reported no changes or did not notice the increase in body weight. More weigh-gaining respondents reduced fruit and vegetable consumption and increased red meat, carbonated or sugary drinks, pastries, fast food and fried food consumption. The majority of participants (84.3%) whose weight increased declared that they ate more compared to 33.4% of individuals without changes in body weight. More weigh-gaining people increased snacking and cooked more often than before quarantine. Increase in alcohol consumption was reported by every fifth participant (20.9%) who gained weight, and every tenth (11.2%), who did not. A large proportion of weight-gaining respondents (85.2%) decreased their physical activity during quarantine (Table 3) . Table 3 . The proportion of participants who reported changes in health behaviours by changes in weight (%). The weight gain was associated with BMI of participants. Those with higher BMI gained weight more often compared to those having normal BMI (Figure 1 ). The weight gain was associated with BMI of participants. Those with higher BMI gained weight more often compared to those having normal BMI (Figure 1 ). The binary univariate logistic regression showed that women were more likely to gain weight compared to men (Table 4 ). No associations were found with the age and education of respondents. The odds of weight gain were higher for those who decreased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and increased consumption of red meat, carbonated or sugary drinks, pastries, snacks, fast or fried food and ate more than usual. Increased alcohol consumption and decreased physical activity were also related to higher odds of weight gain. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the association of weight gain with increased intake of carbonated or sugary drinks, homemade pastries and fast food, increased snacking, eating more than usual, decreased physical activity and increased alcohol consumption remained statistically significant. The odds of weight gain also increased with age. The binary univariate logistic regression showed that women were more likely to gain weight compared to men (Table 4 ).

To remind people of the most important principles of healthy nutrition, WHO experts developed recommendations on food and nutrition during self-quarantine [1] . However, restrictions during COVID-19 pandemic decreased the availability of some foods. People were urged to stay at home, all restaurants and bars were closed, and only some of them offered food takeaway. Ordering food online was overloaded [12] . The variety of food products in grocery stores has declined [12, 19] . A Spanish study highlighted that people reported difficulties of finding meat in the supermarkets and grocery stores, which could be related to a decrease in consumption of meat during quarantine [12] . At the beginning of the quarantine, people experienced panic and uncertainty, which led to extra buying of all long-lasting food products and caused a shortage of grain and some other products in grocery stores [19] .",

On the other hand, some positive changes such as decreased consumption of processed meat, carbonated or sugary drinks and increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, legumes and white meat were identified [12, 16] .

Additionally, we used the COVIDiet questionnaire prepared by researchers from the University of Granada for the international study so we will be able to compare our data with other countries in the future. Several limitations of our study should be mentioned for the accurate interpretation of its results. First, we used non-random sampling to reach participants. The majority of respondents were women and people with higher education. The higher participation of women was also reported by other researchers [12, 18] . However, our study covered all municipalities of Lithuania and a large age interval. Furthermore, we used self-reported online survey data which may be less reliable and biased. BMI was calculated from self-reported data on weight and height, which could lead to underestimation of overweight and obesity. A question about weight loss was not included in the questionnaire. Finally, we did not collect data on employment status and stress during the quarantine. Stress could impact eating and alcohol consumption habits.",
