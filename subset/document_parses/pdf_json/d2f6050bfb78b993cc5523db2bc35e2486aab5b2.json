Factors to improve care around menstrual cycle problems in female athletes were: (1) informing athletes, coaches, trainers and mentors, (2) informing doctors, (3) conducting more research on long-term consequences, (4) breaking the taboo on menstrual problems, and (5) having a multidisciplinary collaboration between different specialisms.",

According to the athletes, more research is needed on the long-term consequences of amenorrhea in sports, to enable them to make a better assessment of their possible future health risks. Women experience a taboo on discussing menstrual problems; role models discussing the problem may help in decreasing the taboo.

The Olympic Games in Tokyo were the first Olympic Games in which almost 50% of the participating athletes were women [1] . For the last year, there has been an increasing focus on women in sports, including in scientific literature. One of the topics receiving more attention is RED-S (Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport). RED-S was introduced in 2014 and replaces the term 'Female Athlete Triad' . One of the reasons to replace the Female Athlete Triad with Page 2 of 11 Verhoef et al. BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation (2021) 13:146 RED-S, is that RED-S not only involves female athletes, but also male athletes. However, since menstrual problems, both amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea, are one of the most well-known consequences, the syndrome might be easier to diagnose with female athletes than with male athletes [2] [3] [4] .",

A LEA can be the result of disordered eating or eating disorders, but can also occur without disordered eating or eating disorder. The energy imbalance results in a disruption of various physiological functions and systems such as the basal metabolism, menstrual cycle, the (build-up of ) bone density, immune system, and cardiovascular health. The most evident symptoms that can occur are menstrual cycle abnormalities such as amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea. Other symptoms include stress fractures, but also constipation, cardiac arrhythmias, and reduced muscle strength. The exact prevalence of RED-S is unknown. One of the long-term risks is a decreased mineral bone density. Other potential long-term risks are also still largely unknown [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Psychological problems, such as anxiety, irritability and depression play an important part as they can both lead to RED-S and be the result of RED-S. Also, there can be an overlap between eating disorders and LEA; eating disorders can lead to LEA and LEA can also result in eating disorders [9] [10] [11] .",

Furthermore, the goal of the research was introduced. Two researchers (MW and SV) took notes during the focus groups (Tables 2,  3 ). The focus groups took place in May and June of 2020 and lasted approximately 90 min. The focus groups were audio recorded digitally and transcribed by one of the researchers (SV).

Also, in some cases there was an underlying eating disorder, which was a difficult topic for them to discuss (F2, P1: \"That was partly due to sports and partly an underlying eating disorder I developed at the time\" \u2026 \"For me, it was mainly shame at the time why I did not raise the alarm. Because a lot of other things were also involved. \"). Several participants experienced a taboo around discussing menstruation (F2, P4: \"And I certainly think that talking about it is a taboo. That a lot of women still feel like, I would rather not. \"). There were different opinions about the relevance of the gender of the care provider or coach regarding this topic (F1, P2: \"Now I have a female general practitioner and before I had a male general practitioner.

And that is only possible if cyclists know that this problem has also been mentioned during courses. \"). Participants indicated that athletes often feel safe with their coach or trainer, and therefore they should (be able to) start a conversation about menstrual problems. Informing the parents of athletes was also mentioned, because they can monitor the development of their child (F2, P1: \"If they [parents] also know more about it, suppose, perhaps, being informed by coaches who indeed know more about it, then they can also keep more of an eye on it.
