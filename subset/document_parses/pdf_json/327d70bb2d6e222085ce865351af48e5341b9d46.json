            "text": "Poor clinical outcomes in severe CAP necessitate treatment strategies other than antibiotics. Corticosteroids are a biologically plausible option that inhibit the expression and action of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response associated with pneumonia [8] . However, their use in CAP has yielded heterogeneous survival results in randomized clinical trials, in part because they included patients with and without severe CAP, precluding their routine inclusion in therapeutic strategies [9] . Appropriate selection of patients with severe CAP only, in whom the beneficial effects of corticosteroids outweigh the potential adverse effects, is therefore of major relevance [10, 11] . Indeed, subgroup analyses of patients treated for CAP with corticosteroids have shown survival benefits mainly in those with severe disease. This is plausible because the low mortality in patients without severe CAP makes it less likely that we will observe reduced mortality [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Given that the rationale for corticosteroid use is to attenuate the inflammatory response, those with the highest inflammatory status should obtain the most benefit. In a randomized clinical trial of patients with severe CAP and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, corticosteroid use led to less late radiographic progression of pulmonary opacities [19] . However, this study was underpowered for assessing differences in mortality and other clinical outcomes.",

Despite several studies showing improved outcomes, such as less treatment failure, shorter hospital stays, shorter time to clinical stability [19, 27] , or reduced risk of cardiovascular events [28] , only one has shown improved mortality [29] . This may be because many studies have lacked the statistical power to find significance differences. Improved mortality has been observed in several meta-analyses, mainly for severe CAP [15, 16, [30] [31] [32] , but concerns about non-reproducible results and differences in baseline characteristics have been raised for the two studies [29, 33] with the greatest positive results that drove the conclusions. A major limitation of these studies and meta-analyses is the fact that different criteria were used for severe pneumonia (i.e., admission to ICU, ATS/IDSA criteria, septic shock, invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, or high severity scores). These differences have led to contradictory suggestions in clinical practice guidelines. While guidelines for the diagnosis and management of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine favor corticosteroid use in CAP [34] , ATS/ IDSA guidance for CAP management continues to advise against corticosteroid use [4] .",

Corticosteroids have been evaluated in other related severe diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [40] or septic shock, with those results also open to debate. In the last Surviving Sepsis campaign, it was stated that corticosteroids were indicated in cases of septic shock when hemodynamic stability was not achieved despite adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support [41] . Recent positive results [40] . We did not find any difference in 28-day mortality in specific sub-populations (septic shock or IMV requirements alone) when analyzed separately, but we could only match small numbers of patients in each group, which makes it difficult to reach a firm conclusion. Further studies are needed to evaluate if corticosteroids reduce the risk of death in CAP by reducing pulmonary inflammation or improving hemodynamic parameters.",

However, our study still had several limitations. First, the observational design means that patients may have received corticosteroids for a reason other than severe CAP. Although we tried to recreate the conditions of a clinical trial as far as possible, corticosteroid treatments were not protocoled, and so patients who received corticosteroids were not homogeneous in terms of time until first corticosteroid dose, total dose, and type of corticosteroids. Second, despite exhaustive PS matching for underlying conditions, severity criteria, treatment adequacy, center, etc., some differences remained between the groups. Finally, we established time windows to include or exclude patients. These time windows can be found in previous clinical trials; however, in our case they may have led us to select certain patients and not others. Nevertheless, these limitations also reflect the reallife scenario. Our results must be considered with care, given the controversial results in clinical trials (including one unpublished trial, NCT01283009). However, they may help to develop new clinical trials including only the most severely ill populations with high inflammatory responses.",
