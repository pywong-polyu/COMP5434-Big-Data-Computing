Governments, in their quest to serve citizens, harness ICT to streamline their service delivery processes. e-Government transforms administrations into \"smart governments\" enhancing the social, political and economic inclusion and the quality of life of its citizens. However, the governments of developing countries are still facing challenges regarding transformation due to a myriad of obstacles, which include the lack of interoperability of e-government, lack of resources and lack of management commitment. Therefore, the aim of this study is to define an e-government implementation framework for developing countries. The 12 critical success factors identified for developing countries were mapped to the variables of Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) Theory in order to create the proposed implementation framework. The framework was then applied in a single case study at a government department in South Africa (SA) where the opinions of 110 managers were collected through an on-line questionnaire.

These CSFs were identified as they would increase or decrease the likelihood that the e-government implementation will materialise or not. The innovation-decision process starts with the knowledge stage where the citizen attempts to deduce what the innovation is and how it works. In order to create new knowledge during this stage, technology education and practice should provide both how-to and know-why experiences. Therefore, two CSFs, namely training and awareness, are relevant to both civil servants and citizens at this stage. The next step, a feeling-centred stage, is persuasion and during this stage an individual has a negative or positive attitude toward the innovation. Two CSFs are important at this pointone civil servant related and one citizen related. The stakeholder involvement CSF applies to civil servants acknowledging the IT skill that they require and bring to the innovation, and user computer efficacy points to citizens where efficient execution plays a major role. The third stage is the decision phase where an individual chooses to adopt or reject the innovation. The CSF focus for this stage is top management and government support that is mainly focused on civil servants and visible government support, calling on citizens to embrace the e-government service delivery innovation. The implementation stage is the fourth stage and the innovation is put into practice in this stage. An innovation may be modified by a user during the process of its adoption and implementation, and this usually takes place during the implementation stage. Based on the degree to which an innovation is changed, the implementation stakeholders may need technical assistance to reduce the degree of uncertainty about the consequences and subsequently placing emphasis on the ICT infrastructure CSF. The last step is the confirmation stage where the individual looks for support for his or her decision by seeking reassuring messages that confirm his or her decision.

Adequate legal and policies formulation for e-government service delivery in the public sector provides a healthy platform for successful implementation highlighted by 58% of respondents. 53% of respondents stressed that in order to achieve successful adoption of e-government, civil servants ought to be aware of ICT capabilities to improve service delivery to citizens, as well as optimisation of their processes. 62% of respondents emphasised that top management and government support are essential for successful adoption of e-government service delivery, while 30% emphasised the importance of user computer efficacy. In order to curb the skills flight of GDSA IT staff to better paying private sector jobs, which is an existing public service problem that hampers e-government service delivery implementation, IT personnel at GDSA should have an attractive stakeholder involvement plan to retain them. Hence, 40% of the respondents prioritised this CSF. Communication and change management focuses on addressing resistance to changefrom both civil servant and citizen perspectives -and 56% of the respondents agreed this CSF is essential for the successful adoption of e-government in the GDSA. A clear vision and strategy attracted a rating of 74% while training was prioritised by 40% of respondents. 68% of respondents highlighted the importance of department goals and 75% of respondents emphasised the significance of empowering citizens.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Case Study Data Analysis and Findings"}, {"text": "In order to visualise the priorities identified by the GDSA respondents for their particular implementation plan, a diagram was utilised shown in Fig. 2 . As all CSFs are important as a means to guiding implementation of the GDSA e-government service delivery programme, the rating shared by 110 GDSA managers may now guide implementation focus and priority. By tallying the somewhat important and very important categories, an importance rating per CSF pertinent to the GDSA is shown in Fig. 2 . Respondents identified the top 6 prioritise for the particular GDSA with a rating of more than 60% as top management and government support (62%), clear departmental goals (68%), clear vision and strategy (74%), empowerment of citizens (75%), ICT infrastructure (84%) and funding (93%). In order to achieve e-government service delivery improvement at the GDSA, an enabling environment is necessary. When considering the proposed framework in Fig. 1 and the prioritisation in Fig. 2 , a clear implementation plan may be designed for the GDSA. There is a priority requirement for government to provide adequate funding that will ensure that IT skills are retained, ICT infrastructure is put in place, and clear goals are set on how e-government will roll out across interactive stages. Furthermore, better government support will ensure that priority is given to ICT implementation initiatives. It is important that SA citizens are aware of, and understand, the e-government products that the GDSA offers so they can benefit from utilizing them. A large number of citizens in developing countries live in rural areas, often away from technology and infrastructure. The GDSA implementation project needs to be executed in such a way that it does not marginalise any group of SA citizens as these implementation plans should empower citizens and civil servants with the necessary knowledge and skills for the implementation and usage of e-government systems. Initiatives for road shows in rural areas on how citizens can register online should be done for the benefit of ordinary citizens. IT education to citizens is another way of dealing with the digital divide to ensure digital literate citizens. For the implementation of the GDSA project, high priority must be allocated to the approval of adequate budgets and funding from national government.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 152, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 488, "end": 494, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 940, "end": 946, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 973, "end": 979, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Case Study Data Analysis and Findings"}, {"text": "In order to address the requirement of e-government implementation in developing countries, this research proposed an implementation framework derived from CSFs for e-government implementation in developing countries mapped to DOI theory for the adoption of new ideas.
