The robot is fully equipped with communication technology and is controlled by the family who becomes present from a distant location and can virtually explore the room (Figure) . Conscious patients can communicate with the avatar of the family with a certain degree of independence and privacy ( Figure) . The family can be virtually present at the bedside and receive daily information during nursing care or participate in family conferences with ICU clinicians. Family members of unconscious patients can be introduced to the ICU environment and have a better understanding of the situation.",

A telepresence robot in isolation rooms may limit the psychological burden of limited visits. A) The robot is a wheeled device, controlled from a remote location that can move in the room or adjust its head rotation to optimize face-to-face meetings. It includes a tablet with 4G connectivity, video camera, screen, speakers, and microphones. A dedicated website is used to secure the connection and to avoid using personal login or phone numbers; no information is stored. It can be shared between patient rooms after an approved process of disinfection. B) The telepresence robot enhances communication between the relatives and the patient. The patient reported that the regular presence of unmasked familiar faces brought immediate relief.",
