As one of the class of therapeutic nucleoside and nucleobase analogues drugs, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been used in cancer therapy and in the treatment of various diseases for decades (Longley et al. 2003) . Therefore, in DDS, nanoparticles, nanogels, and nanopolymers are mainly focus on 5-FU cellular delivery for cancer therapy (Burke et al. 2014) . By applying a cell-specific cytotoxic aptamer, Sven's group found that it can be prepared in a one-step enzymatic reaction by incorporating multiple units of a nucleoside analogue directly into an aptamer that targets a cytokine receptor. In targeted cancer cells, the controlled cellular release of 5-FU is initiated by intracellular nucleolytic hydrolysis of the cell-specific cytotoxic aptamer (Kruspe and Hahn 2014) . Cytotoxic nucleoside and nucleobase analogues, such as 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (5-FUdR), are advantageous drugs for receptormediated active targeting as they benefit from this intracellular turnover. As showed in Fig. 14.7 , 5-FUdR becomes part of the aptamer molecule itself, replacing all the uridines in the original aptamer. The controlled release of the drug inside the target cells is mediated through naturally occurred degradation by lysosomal nucleases. The hydrolysis of the aptamer would yield 5-FUdR, which could escape the lysosome by active nucleoside transporters, which normally serve as recycling gateways for lysosomal degraded nucleic acids (Fig. 14.7) .
