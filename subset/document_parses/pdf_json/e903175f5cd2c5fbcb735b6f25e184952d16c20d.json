National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortages of healthcare resources that have to be re-allocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers, and save as many lives as possible. Also, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions. In this article, we propose a guidance to the management of pancreatic cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, and based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions. Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, the authors have separated the prioritisation analyses. The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale is outlined and discussed. The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored; it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients' need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of SARS-CoV-2. Pancreatic cancer demands a considerable amount of medical resources. Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AbstrAct"}, {"text": "As of 19 April 2020, 2 245 872 cases and 152 707 confirmed deaths have been reported across more than 213 countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 1 National governments are engaged in limiting the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, while healthcare systems' capacities are challenged or even overwhelmed worldwide: intensive care units (ICUs) are often unable to admit patients with severe respiratory conditions and many countries have suspended elective surgery. 2 It is a rapidly evolving challenge that requires a redefinition of every healthcare department structure and an allocation of the scarce medical resources (healthcare professionals, diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions) by following strict prioritisation criteria.

The less complicated distal pancreatectomy (including the resection of the spleen) is associated with severe complications in 25% of cases and a mortality rate of 3%. 18 During the COVID-19 public health emergency, all invasive interventions with high morbidity and mortality which could overload the already over-burdened healthcare resources should be deferred. However, the benefit/risk ratio should be carefully evaluated, and re-evaluated, along with the evolution of the pandemic. A critical factor is the delay from diagnosis to surgery that can be tolerated in pancreatic cancer surgery. Data are lacking, but a registry analysis on 16 673 patients affected by pancreatic cancer in stage I-II showed that a medium time to surgery of 15-42 days does not correlate with worse survival. A delay up to 3 months could select patients with a less aggressive cancer biology and allow a preoperative medical optimisation of patient comorbidities before elective surgery. 19 Nevertheless, the immunedepressive but potentially curative pancreatic cancer resection still retains a high priority to be evaluated in a multidisciplinary team consultation, discussing available resources in the pandemic, life expectations, and complications associated with an eventual SARS-CoV-2 infection. Every tailored medical and surgical decision during the COVID-19 pandemic, in respect to current national and international guidelines, should be derived from a multidisciplinary experts' consultation, balancing the pros and cons of every evidence-based therapeutic option. 2 9 After completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients should receive curative surgery without deferrals, especially if operating rooms and ICU capacity are not over-utilised at that moment.
