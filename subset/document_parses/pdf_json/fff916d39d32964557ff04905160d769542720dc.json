The real incidence of this infection in children is indefinite. The most common presentations of COVID-19 are fever and cough. However, the disease can have other manifestations such as myalgia, headache, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Despite the lack of the full presentation of the disease and outcomes in children, the most commonly reported symptoms and signs are milder than adults [3] . This may be due to differences in immune responses to the virus [4] .",

Therefore, the management of PIMS remains unclear and difficult. The purpose of this report was to provide a description and characterization of PIMS, increase the level of evidence about the possible association between COVID-19 and PIMS in our pediatric referral hospital in the north of Iran.

On admission, she was ill and irritable without respiratory distress and SPO2 was 99% in room air. She had bilateral otitis media and bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis. Her parents had a suspicious history of COVID infection, so the chest CT-scan was performed and was normal. Treatment with ceftriaxone and zinc gluconate was started. Gradually, presentation of the disease changed and periorbital edema (day 3), headache, limb pain, pharyngeal congestion with punctuated exudate and purulent conjunctivitis appeared. Due to abdominal pain and tenderness, abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography was performed which was normal, except for mild to moderate free fluid was seen and also, mild to moderate bilateral pleural effusion was detected. Liver transaminases, serum amylase and lipase were in a normal range. Because of a family history of COVID-19 infection and new changes in the second chest CT-scan compatible with COVID-19 infection, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were started on the 3rd day and the patient was isolated. On day 5, COVID-19 RT-PCR result was positive, she was still febrile and her condition deteriorated. She became drowsy, tachypneic (respiratory rate: 38 /min) without retraction and dry cough and generalized edema developed. She became hypoxemic in room air with SpO2 of 88% and was subsequently transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). On CBC, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia in addition to hypoalbuminemia were noted (Table 1) . So, packed red blood cells (packed cell), 1 g/kg IVIG and albumin were transfused and antibiotics changed to meropenem. Blood urea, Cr, LDH, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), bilirubin, triglyceride, and fibrinogen level were in the normal range and urine analysis was normal. Blood and urine cultures did not yield any organism. Echocardiography showed mild tricuspid regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation with normal coronary arteries.

While SPO2 was 84% in the ambient room, the second chest CT-scan changed to typical COVID-19 findings (bilateral pleural effusion, basilar patchy infiltration, and reverse halo sign). Anemia and hypoalbuminemia occurred while both of them were in the normal range on the admission day (Table 1) . So, the patient was transferred to the PICU, and oxygen was administered with a hood and packed cell, albumin and IVIG (1 gr/kg) were transfused. Antibiotic was changed to meropenem and vancomycin. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography was normal except mild fluid observed in sub-hepatic, perisplenic, and interloop space. Echocardiography showed mild tricuspid and mitral regurgitation and normal coronary arteries on two occasions.

Cracked lips, erythematous lips and tongue, and bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis also appeared. During the first admission day, the patient became toxic and was transferred to the PICU. The CBC showed leukocytosis with a significant neutrophil count. Elevated ESR, CRP, and liver transaminases and were also found in addition to hypoalbuminemia. Urine analysis and CXR were normal. COVID-19 RT-PCR test was negative and chest CT-scan showed non-significant changes. So, cefotaxime, hydroxychloroquine, 2 gr/kg IVIG and 60 mg/kg aspirin, zinc, vitamin D, and albumin started. Echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries, mild right pleural effusion (5 mm), mild mitral regurgitation with a normal coronary artery on the first admission day. Because of prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT) and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K were prescribed. Fever continued for 2 days after IVIG infusion and he was still toxic. So, the second dose of IVIG was infused on the fourth day of admission. Echocardiography showed diastolic dysfunction, mild right and left coronary artery dilatation in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the left circumflex artery without aneurysm. Liver transaminases, PT and PTT decreased to the normal value but leukocytosis continued and packed cell was transfused for severe anemia. Also, ceftriaxone changed to vancomycin and meropenem. The second chest CT-scan showed non-significant changes. While fever subsided on day 7, hydroxychloroquine discontinued but echocardiography showed progression in coronary arteries dilatation, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, decreased ejection fraction, and mild diastolic dysfunction. So, 2 mg/kg/day prednisolone, vasoactive drugs and furosemide started. On day 10, the patient became hemodynamically stable, so vasoactive drugs tapered but abdominal distension occurred with non-significant findings in the physical examination. Ultrasonography showed mild hepatosplenomegaly, intra-abdominal fluid, and bilateral pleural effusion. In CBC test result, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis (platelet count: 420.000/\u00b5L) were reported. Echocardiography showed progressive coronary artery aneurysm and beading and clopidogrel started. Abdominal distension improved during the last 5 days, and the skin rash disappeared with pilling on day 14. Still afebrile, he was toxic. COVID-19 RT-PCR result was negative but COVID-19 IgM was positive. After that, marked thrombocytosis appeared in the CBC (platelet count: 1.168.000/\u00b5L), ESR and CRP normalized but coronary artery dilatation progressed to a giant aneurysm in day 17 as follows: right coronary artery (RCA): 8.3 mm, left main coronary artery (LMCA) and LAD: 6.7-7.2 mm with good left ventricular ejection fraction. So, warfarin and infliximab were prescribed. The patient was discharged from the hospital with aspirin and warfarin. Results of other evaluations during admission like serum vitamin D, LDH, CPK, and antiphospholipid antibodies were unremarkable. Two weeks later, the coronary diameters decreased to 6 mm in RCA and near to 5 mm in LMCA and LAD in the follow-up echocardiography.",

The most common chest CT-scan findings included patchy infiltration, ground glass opacity with halo or reverse halo sign in the lower lobes of the lungs and pleural effusion. In echocardiography, ejection fraction was reduced in three cases, and in two cases, ectasia and in one patient aneurysm were reported. As reported by Verdoni et al. [5] , Whittaker et al.

Corticosteroids were prescribed for two patients with resistant Kawasaki disease with giant aneurism and multiorgan failure. Similar to other studies, the prognosis of most patients was good [4, 5, 7, 15] . Almost all our patients were discharged without complication, except one case with a giant aneurysm.
