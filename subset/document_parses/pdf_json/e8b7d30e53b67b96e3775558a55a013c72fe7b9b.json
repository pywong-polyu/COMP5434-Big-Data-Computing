As being pointed out in the MGI White Paper, the meaning of genome within non-biological contexts is \"a fundamental building block toward a larger purpose\". Thus, to make a material genetically-encodable, a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between the properties in all aspects and the arrangement of atoms within the material is necessary [2] . To address this fundamental problem, a combinatorial and systematic methodology integrating computational, experimental, and digital tools is proposed. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in the context of MGI, it remains challenging to realize genetic encodability in most of the existing synthetic materials [3] . On the other hand, however, nature has provided valuable and diverse prototypes of genetically-engineered materials in living systems and some of them can now be artificially engineered and repurposed at the genetic level towards smart and even living materials [4, 5] .",

Evolution occurs when information (genotype) and function (phenotype) close the loop where replication with errors generates diversity and selection enriches the desired progeny. While evolution is typically associated with living systems, this algorithm still holds at the molecular level, as demonstrated by the in vitro evolution techniques such as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment and directed evolution via ribosomal display [6, 7] . The Central Dogma of Biology holds that information flows from DNA to RNA and further to proteins. Proteins, the workhorse of life, also constitute the materials of choice in living systems, which have taught us a lot about material design and engineering, as shown in silks, hairs, keratin, as well as many other molecular materials like enzymes. The concept of genetically engineered materials (GEMs) has emerged in recent years to describe, in most cases, those man-made materials comprising artificial peptides or recombinant proteins with properties engineered for a specific purpose [8] .",

            "text": "Protein-based, genetically engineered materials can be recognized at three hierarchies: molecules, assemblies, and systems. Broadly speaking, discrete folded proteins can be considered as a simple form of GEMs. Not only are they responsible for functions such as enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, molecular transport, and so on, but also serve to construct materials at higher hierarchy. Folded proteins could further assemble into aggregates or ordered assemblies, be it discrete or infinite. Forming assemblies not only increases the protein stability, but may also add to the complexity of protein architectures, giving rise to new functions, such as structural support and functional regulation [9] . The assembly may also lead to bulk materials like silk. Artificial protein assemblies have been common in protein materials and may take a variety of forms ranging from zero-dimensional (0D) discrete nanocages, 1D fibers, 2D layers, to 3D micelles, phase-separated microstructures, ordered frameworks and crystals, and further to macroscopic gels [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The properties and functions of these entirely protein-based assemblies are encoded on the genes of the corresponding protein precursors and thus are fully programmable, or even evolvable. An even more complex system may result from an interacting network of biomolecules [16] , as seen in the complex and diverse gene circuits and biological pathways found in living organisms. With the development of synthetic biology, it is possible to mimic this systems' level of control to create engineered living materials, or materials with living features. Such materials are considered as genetically engineered materials at the systems level [17] . In this highlight review, we discuss the concept of genetically engineered materials at these three different levels from molecules, to assemblies, and further to systems with increasing size and complexity (Figure 1) . A brief summary of these materials are also provided in Table 1 .",

Among them, natural proteins constitute an abundant source of functional motifs and have currently inspired the design of many GEMs, but our pursuit of advanced protein-based biomaterials, enabled by powerful protein engineering tools, has already gone beyond the paradigm rigidly set by nature, thus leading to a much expanded structural and functional scope. To develop functional proteins, the essential units of higher-order GEMs, there are mainly two approaches: (1) engineering existing proteins toward a specific purpose; (2) finding new meaningful sequences either by gene mining from the plethora of functional sequences in nature or by de novo design of artificial functional sequences.",

            "text": "Although meaningful proteins are extremely rare within the vast, incomprehensively large sequence space, billions of years of evolution has inexorably swept away the debris and left behind a plethora of selected protein families in the living world. Fortunately, these folded structures are more conserved than their sequences and functions, making it possible to derive new functional sequences from the same scaffold by means of site-specific mutagenesis, domain insertion/fusion/deletion, domain swapping, circular permutation, split-and-reconstitution, and so on. Hence, new protein building blocks can be conveniently developed from existing ones to fit into our demands. Even new functional modes could arise. The recent introduction of \"covalent\" proteinprotein interactions is a prominent example. Conventionally, most of the natural protein-protein interactions are physical in nature with limited affinity. A protein-protein interaction involving covalent bonding possesses an infinite affinity by definition and is thus fundamentally different. In 2010, Howarth et al. [18] developed a peptide-protein reaction pair that can reconstitute and form an isopeptide bond, albeit with a moderate efficiency, by dissecting the major pilin protein Spy0128 from Streptococcus pyogenes. In 2012, the same group [19] reported the development of SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, a highly efficient isopeptide-forming peptideprotein pair. Regarded as a prototype of genetically encoded \"click\" chemistry, it has already gained traction with a broad biotechnology community [20] . The combined use of directed evolution and rational design led to further optimized pairs, approaching a quantitative yield and an instantaneous reaction rate [21, 22] . The strategy for developing these chemistries appears to be generalizable; new reactive pairs can be developed in a similar fashion by splitting and engineering other protein homologs harboring isopeptide or ester bonds [23] . Together, these studies have established covalent bonding as a new mode of protein-protein interaction; the molecular recognition between the peptide and the protein ensures the specificity, while the subsequent autocatalysis warrants the yield. The short SpyTag also serves as a bridge for linking proteins with other synthetic molecules [24] . Since these reactants are entirely made of natural amino acids, they are fully genetically encodable, which is invaluable for performing these chemistries in biological systems. As a side-chain ligation tool, they also render a unique opportunity to synthesize nonlinear proteins.",

            "text": "The advent of \"assembly-reaction\" synergy in supramolecular chemistry has enabled the synthesis of numerous exotic molecules with unusual chemical topologies. Translating this concept into the macromolecular context, Zhang and co-workers [25] used an entangling protein motif in conjunction with genetically encoded click chemistry [20] to achieve the selective synthesis of proteins with complex topology. A series of topological proteins have been synthesized in cellulo. Examples include the passive template synthesis of protein [n]catenanes [25] [26] [27] and lasso proteins [28] and the active template synthesis of protein heterocatenanes [29] (Figure 2a ). Functional improvements have been identified for these unconventional topologies, including enhanced stability against proteolytic degradation and thermal/chemical/mechanical denaturation ( Figure 2b ) [30, 31] . Coincidently, similar effects have been observed in a few rare examples in nature. For example, citric synthase from the thermophile Pyrobaculum aerophilum is a naturally occurring protein catenane and exhibits a melting temperature (T m ) 10.5\u00b0C, higher than that of the open-ended dimer [32] . More impressively, the bacteriophage HK97 capsid, which is a topologically linked chainmail with remarkable stability, partially resists denaturation at 5 M GuHCl [33, 34] . Topology has thus been added into protein engineering as a new dimension beyond the two conventionally used parameters, length and sequence [35, 36] . This new parameter converts a protein molecule from a linear, one-dimensional polypeptide chain into a multi-chain, multi-dimensional species. These artificial topological proteins, with their versatile designability and improved stability and dynamics, will greatly expand the repertoire of the building blocks needed for the construction of higher-order GEMs.",

One can use gene mining to discover the beautiful sequences already present in the biological system. But, even the evolution of life on earth has tested only a small fraction of the protein sequence space. Hence, de novo design of proteins open the avenue to a much expanded chemical space of genetically engineered materials. Recently, considerable progress has been made in the area of de novo protein design with the aid of computation, data science and machine learning [37] . It has become possible to design a protein, from small to medium in size, with a reasonable rate of success. For example, using the Rosetta method, Baker et al. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] have designed 0D protein nanocages, 1D fibers, 2D lattices, artificial enzymes, GFP analogs, interleukin analogs and so on. The recent triumph of AlphaFold in highly accurate protein structure prediction has been considered as revolutionary [44, 45] . Since structure prediction and protein design are the two sides of the same problem, we anticipate the advent of a similar game changer on the inverse folding problem in the near future [46] . While structured protein molecules have been the current focus of de novo design, there remains a lot to learn from basic polymer physics and naturally occurring protein sequences, especially those without orderly 3D structures but with well-defined functions. One should keep in mind that functional proteins have a broad continuum in the degree of order, from completely disordered to highly structured. Strengthened abilities to de novo design these molecules, be it ordered or disordered, will open the whole sequence space to genetically engineered materials.",

            "text": "Materials are usually homogenous or heterogeneous assemblies of molecules that could collectively accomplish certain functions. Proteins are extremely rich in their mutual interactions or interactions with other types of molecular components. Thus, protein molecules by themselves can fold into various shapes and structures, which can further assemble into complex structures across different length scales and generate collective and cooperative functions. Such protein assemblies are also considered as genetically engineered protein materials. One of the most prevalent protein assemblies are protein nanocages, which can be viewed as a type of 0D material. While proteins are often used as the bioactive component in self-assembled nanoparticles in biomedicine [47] , naturally existing protein nanocages, such as viral capsids, ferritins, encapsulin and chaperonins, can also serve as carriers of functional molecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, or metal ions) and/or nanoreactors for chemical reactions (e.g., riboflavin biosynthesis) [48] . Repurposing these natural protein cages for biomaterials has been nicely demonstrated for various biomedical applications, such as drug delivery vehicles, synthetic vaccines, and catalytic nanoreactors [49] . Moreover, recent success in the computational design of both one-and multi-component protein cages has opened the gate to diverse 0D protein materials [38] [39] [40] [41] . For example, antigens like SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains (RBD) have been fused onto a computationally designed protein cage component I53-50A and co-assembled with I53-50B into a nanoparticle vaccine displaying 60 RBD on surface and elicit potent and protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice (Figure 3a ) [50] . These designer protein cages, which are genetically encoded, highly stable and robustly assembled, have been used as a novel platform for developing \"plug-and-display\" vaccines, in which reactive tags tethered on their surfaces allow for the decoration with heterologous antigens [50, 51] . One should note that such protein cages can be evolved for even further improved stability, encapsulation capacity and substrate specificity, offering opportunities for future development [52, 53] . In addition, various protein assemblies like proteasomes and molecular chaperones are also considered 0D owing to their discrete nature and small size.",

Empowered by modern genome engineering tools such as TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9, mankind now is able to genetically engineer the silkworms to produce silk materials with unprecedented properties, including those amenable to further covalent decoration by functional proteins both in vivo and in vitro [54] [55] [56] . Spider silk, another category of naturally occurring 1D protein material, is gaining traction with materials scientists in recent years for its exceptional mechanical and biochemical properties; dragline silk rivals steel in strength and is said to be nonimmunogenic and biocompatible for biomedical applications [57] . Unlike silkworms, spiders are territorial and cannibalistic and thus cannot be farmed, which prevents the mass production of spider silk for common use. Although modern recombinant DNA technology has enabled the production of genetically engineered spider silk using bacterial cells, with one case even able to recapitulate those naturally occurring ones in mechanics [58] , the mass production of these recombinant protein materials has yet to be realized. In addi-tion to silk, other types of 1D protein materials are also bountiful in nature. As essential components of biofilms, the protein fibers impart considerable mechanical stability to the biofilms and also display multiple biological signals [59] . Representative curli fiber monomers include Escherichia coli CsgA and Bacillus subtilis TasA. Microorganisms often exploit amyloids, though considered detrimental in human bodies, to gain a competitive edge over their competitors or enemies [60] . These amyloid motifs are also building blocks of choice for constructing genetically engineered materials. For example, Collier and co-workers [61] fused \u03b2-sheet fibrillizing domains to different fluorescent proteins, of which the co-assembly was induced upon the addition of \u03b2-sheet fibrillizing peptides, thus leading to the formation of nanofiber materials displaying a controllable combination of proteins ( Figure 3b ).",

An excellent example is the naturally occurring bacterial S-layer assembled on the cell surface which comprises of an orderly monomolecular layer of identical proteins known as S-layer proteins. This natural protein material mainly serves as an armor to protect bacterial cells, while also being engaged in many other functions like enzyme display, cellular communication, and pathogenesis [62] . Recombinant S-layer proteins fused with various domains can be produced heterologously and the resulting products can robustly self-assemble into ordered 2D arrays in vitro in spite of the additional motifs attached. Thanks to their robustness, genetic encodability and high density of functional groups, S-layers have served as a versatile platform for designing diverse genetically engineered 2D materials, which enabled functional display of enzymes, ligands, antigens, antibodies, inorganic nanoparticles, and so forth [63, 64] . Lanthanide-binding peptide tags were fused to the S-layer protein of Caulobacter crescentus, leading to the creation of engineered 2D protein films with high absorption capacity toward rare earth elements [65] . Decoration of the S-layer protein with streptavidin, which enables further immobilization of biotinylated molecules, has given rise to a general platform for creating various functional materials [66] . Alternatively, incorporating peptide sequences like SpyTag or SnoopTag into the S-layer proteins has allowed covalent, yet robust and flexible functionalization of these 2D platforms [67] . Computational design of 2D protein lattices has also achieved considerable progress, making it possible to prepare 2D protein lattices with various symmetry from one or binary protein components. The design tolerates the reconfiguration of symmetry, composition, and surface features, which can be leveraged to modulate cell responses (Figure 3c ) [68] .",

To distinguish them from the aforementioned 0D assemblies, we can make the distinction mainly based on their size; the 0D assemblies are nanoscale, with precisely defined atomic arrangement, while the 3D assemblies are much larger, typically at meso-to macroscale (larger than micrometer). In the context of supramolecular chemistry, micelles and vesicles are less ordered 3D assemblies, and frameworks and crystals are much more ordered. Amphiphilicity of surfactants is often the driving force behind these 3D assemblies. Some natural proteins, albeit rare, can act like surfactants under physiological conditions [69] . For example, the t\u00fangara frog uses a surfactant protein called Ranaspumin-2 to create foam nests, thus providing protective and biocompatible shelters for eggs and embryos [70] . Artificial protein-based surfactants have also been designed by connecting a hydrophobic polypeptide with a hydrophilic one. Champion and co-workers [71] used oppositely charged leucine-zippers to induce the assembly of two recombinant proteins, hydrophilic GFP and hydrophobic elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), into supramolecular protein amphiphiles, which, upon heating, further assembled into vesicles with the potential for controlled drug delivery. Gao and co-workers [72, 73] designed an artificial amphiphilic protein by genetically fusing an ELP with a hydrophilic protein drug, interferon-\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1). The IFN-ELP diblock copolypeptide assembled into a spherical micelle, 48 nm in diameter, with an ELP core and an IFN shell (Figure 3d ). Not only does the large size of the assembly prohibit kidney filtration and extend the lifetime of the protein drug in vivo, the micelle also [50] ; (b) 1D protein nanofibers assembled from \u03b2-sheet fibrillizing peptides (adapted with permission from Ref.

In nature, the protein phase separation underlies the formation of larger 3D protein assemblies, such as the droplets or granules inside cells, by which membraneless organelles emerge and regulate cellular processes [74] . For example, P granules segregate with the P lineage during embryogenesis and help maintain germ cell integrity. Protein phase separation also plays key roles in regulating synapses and accounts for the formation of semimembrane-bound postsynaptic density [75] . The protein phase separation is also believed to be a mechanism by which cells exert spatiotemporal control over the expression of functional proteins in response to external signals. The protein phase separation process is often driven by multivalent interactions among either intrinsically disordered or folded globular proteins, which may be modulated by posttranslational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation and methylation) in response to local environmental variations in stress, temperature and so on.",

The correspondence between the thermo-responsive phase transition behavior and the chemical composition of ELPs has been well established [77] . Chilkoti and co-workers [78] have systematically studied in microdrops the phase separation of a group of ELPs with varied guest residue, chain length and block architecture, leading to a set of rules that govern the ELP-ELP interactions and the resulting phase-separation. Recently, the same group created complex self-assembled microarchitectures comprising the mixtures of artificial ELPs and partially ordered proteins across multiple length scales simply using droplet microfluidics and stepwise heating, which has opened the door to a variety of genetically programmable structures (Figure 4a) [79] . These researchers further engineered the intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) based on the sequence-property relationship, thus enabling the modulation of phase separation in living cells [80] . Conticello and co-workers [81] created pH-dependent interconversion of collagen tubes and sheets using heteromeric pairs of collagen-mimetic peptides with carefully selected number and position of charged residues for charge complementary. The controllable transformation between different assembly structures and morphologies would be promising in designing versatile and smart carriers of a diverse spectrum of molecular payloads.",

Crosslinking ELPs typically gives rise to elastic hydrogel materials, which in turn can serve as artificial extracellular matrices. Using the thiol-ene reaction, Murphy et al. [82] incorporated calmodulin in the polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel, which demonstrated reversible volume transition in response to the cognate ligands of calmodulin. Cao et al. [83] have recently created a series of PEG-protein hydrogels through deliberate use of proteinprotein interactions, revealing a good correlation between the stability of the hydrogels and the mechanics at the singlemolecule level. However, these materials can only be loosely regarded as genetically engineered, as they often contain abiotic components like PEG, even though their biological activities are largely determined by the protein building blocks.

            "text": "To circumvent this limitation, it is highly desirable to have genetically engineered materials, including their crosslinkers within, which are entirely composed of protein molecules. In 1998, Tirrell and co-workers [84] were among the first to demonstrate the creation of entirely engineered proteinbased hydrogels comprising physical networks of self-assembling triblock copolypeptides. Owing to the sequencedependent, reversible oligomerization of the terminal leucine-zipper coiled coils, these materials were genetically programmable in terms of their macroscopic properties, particularly their responsiveness toward environmental cues such as pH and temperature. Sun and co-workers [85] reported the synthesis of a covalently crosslinked, entirely protein-based hydrogel, the first of its kind, using the aforementioned SpyTag-SpyCatcher chemistry (Figure 4b) . \"The network of spies\" or \"Spy network\" was coined to describe this hydrogel. Since the gel is fully genetically encoded, interesting functions commonly associated with complex biomacromolecules but rare to conventional synthetic materials may be facilely introduced and faithfully preserved throughout the material synthesis. Thanks to the diversity of natural and designed proteins, various stimuliresponsive and functional smart hydrogels have been created using different protein building blocks, such as photoresponsive hydrogels comprising the B 12 -dependent photoreceptor CarH C protein and capable of controlled release of proteins and living cells (Figure 4c ), metalloprotein-containing hydrogels for selective sequestration of heavy metals (e.g., oceanic uranium, and chromate), as well as hydrogels containing antimicrobial proteins [86] [87] [88] [89] . One drawback of these genetically engineered hydrogels lies in their weak mechanics, which can be attributed to the large size of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher crosslinker and correspondingly the low crosslinking density. As to conventional synthetic hydrogels, a variety of strategies have been developed to enhance their mechanical stability, including the creation of those notable network structures, nanocomposite network, covalent double network, chemical-physical double network, slide-ring network, and ionically crosslinked network [90] . We envision that similar strategies can be adopted to improve the mechanics of these entirely protein-based materials.",

Rather, what we need is a shift from genetically encoded molecules to genetically encoded systems-reminiscent of a similar molecules-to-systems shift that occurred on this planet billions of years ago and provided the bedrock foundation for all later forms of life. From materials scientist's perspective, life on earth is a type of naturally occurring, genetically encoded living material that is consistently evolving, adapting to and/or reshaping surrounding environments; a living species is not merely a bag of organic molecules, but rather a system endowed with emergent properties by the assembly of genetically encoded molecules, alongside some abiotic ones. In this vein, synthetic biologists conceived the concept of engineered living materials. Through the integration of synthetic biology and materials science, several prototypes of engineered living materials have since been developed.",

This design principle was later adopted for converting penicillin-producing fungi into a living antibiotic-releasing surface [92] . Nevertheless, these materials have yet to exhibit any prominent emergent property-a property that does not arise from a single material component but from an interacting system. Recent progress has pointed to the feasibility of creating advanced engineered living materials with emergent properties. For example, Lu et al. [93] created switchable conductive living biofilms by integrating genetically engineered E. coli cells with gold nanoparticles (GNPs). The living cells, under the delicate control of inducible genetic circuits, were able to produce and display GNP-binding protein fibers for integration into a systems material. In another study, with the aim to design wearable living sensors, Zhao et al. [94] engineered a collection of E. coli strains that not only can be induced by various chemicals but also participate in intercellular communications; these cells, when co-encapsulated within robust hydrogel-elastomer hybrid matrices, act in synergy to result in a responsive GFP expression with fluorescent signal as the output.",

            "text": "Another remarkable feature of a living system is its agile adaptability. Engineered cells, with the aid of genetic cir-cuits, can sense and respond to complex environmental signals in a concerted manner, which in turn alters not only the behavior of individual cells, but also their intercellular connections and spatial arrangement. Hence, both biochemical and mechanical properties of a living material can be tuned with great agility. For example, Zhong et al. [95] developed spatially controllable biomimetic mineralization within engineered E. coli biofilms in a light-dependent manner, where gradient mineral densities and mechanical properties were achieved (Figure 5a) . This work represents a significant advance in designing highly adaptable living materials. Moreover, engineered living materials have been designed to grow into a made-to-order shape. The same group engineered TasA protein, a major component of the biofilm extracellular matrix, into Bacillus subtilis to make it more hydrophilic [96] . The resulting gel-like biofilms became highly processible. Not only could they be printed into desirable 3D shapes, but also they could be regenerated on agar plates via simple imprinting (Figure 5b ). These engineered living materials, with the combination of genetic programmability, unique material properties and living features, hold enormous prospects in that they can be delivered to remote areas where bulk transportation is difficult or even impossible, or applied under extreme conditions where they can self-grow into particular shapes and mature into functional forms. In this highlight review, we discussed genetically engineered materials from common protein molecules, to their functional assemblies, and further to the interacting systems as engineered living materials. The essential feature of these genetically engineered materials is their ability to carry biological information and translate the information into a specific function. This correlation between the information and the function makes it possible to fine-tune the properties and to evolve the material system, regardless of its length scale or detailed molecular mechanism. The recent development of engineered living materials has also ushered in a paradigm shift in basic materials science. With its integration with synthetic biology, genetically engineered materials will surely find real-world applications in the near future.",
