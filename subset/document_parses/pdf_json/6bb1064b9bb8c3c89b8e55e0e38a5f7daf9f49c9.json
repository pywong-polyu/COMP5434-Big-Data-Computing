However, other fields use well-established standards for similar devices. For instance, laboratory hoods, which protect their users from aerosolized pathogens, undergo standardized testing. In these testing protocols, they must demonstrate 3 performance characteristics to pass inspection: contaminated air must not escape from within the hood during normal operation, contaminated air must pass through a filter to remove the pathogens (<0.01% penetration through the filter or enclosure), and a vacuum system must pull enough air into the hood to prevent pathogens from escaping (>75 ft/min). 6, 7 Editor's Capsule Summary",

We collaborated with air filtration experts (Filtech Inc., Homestead, PA) to test the ability of the rigid plastic barrier enclosures to contain and filter aerosolized particles, using a combination of ISO 14644-3 and IEST test standards typically used for certifying class I biosafety cabinets. [6] [7] [8] We obtained a commercially available passive rigid plastic barrier enclosure (20\u00c216\u00c219 in) with two 5.75-in armholes for procedural access (VisionsAward, Celina, OH) ( Figure 1A ). Because commercially available passive rigid plastic barrier enclosures lacked the ability to incorporate active air filtration, we designed a 16\u00c213\u00c221in aluminum reinforced acrylic enclosure with a 3dimensionally printed adaptor (7\u00c27 in) to connect to the filters and vacuum sources ( Figure 1B ). The custom enclosure included a rectangular window (12\u00c25 in) for procedural access, which could be sealed when not in use. We sealed the caudal end of the enclosure with a clear plastic drape placed around the mannequin.",

            "text": "Quantitative aerosol leak testing consists of measuring particulate concentrations at enclosure openings and at filter exhaust ports to evaluate aerosol containment and filter performance, respectively. We generated a continuous flow of polydispersed polyalphaolefin (PAO) aerosol with an AG-E3 Laskin-nozzle Aerosol Generator (TEC Services Inc., New Oxford, PA) and released it directly above the mannequin's mouth at 56 mg/L. PAO aerosols generated in this manner contain particles from 0.1 to 10 mm, which corresponds to the size range of exhaled SARS-CoV-2 aerosolized droplets and is used as a laboratory surrogate of airborne pathogens. 6, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] We measured aerosolized PAO particulate concentrations inside and outside each enclosure with a calibrated PH-5 photometer (TEC Services Inc.). To quantify PAO concentrations outside of the rigid plastic barrier enclosures, we used the photometer to first measure the average concentration of PAO (upstream) within the enclosure, which served as the 100% reference to quantify aerosol penetration outside of the enclosure (downstream). We then acquired downstream sample measurements and reported them as a percentage of the upstream concentration. We took measurements every 10 seconds, for a total of 10 measurements per trial, and repeated this 3 times, for a total of 30 PAO aerosol concentration measurements at each location for each configuration. Failure of this test occurs when greater than 0.01% of PAO penetration is detected through the enclosure openings or the vacuum exhaust port.",

Although we tested a single commercially available passive rigid plastic barrier enclosure, we believe our results can be generalized to such enclosures, given the common design features that were well represented in the model we tested. Our active rigid plastic barrier enclosure was custom designed to include a single, larger procedure window versus the 2 independent armholes in the passive rigid plastic barrier enclosure. Because the surface area of the opening was larger in the custom active enclosure, it is reasonable to believe that 2 armholes would be the same or more favorable in containing aerosol if appropriately redesigned with sufficient active air filtration.",

Smoke pattern analysis revealed aerosol passing through the access points of the passive rigid plastic barrier enclosure and directly into the proceduralist's and assistant's face. Furthermore, the enclosure failed to contain aerosol during simulated intubations. A false sense of security provided by these enclosures may pose a risk to providers.",

Instead, by coupling a custom-made enclosure to vacuum sources with higher airflow rates and specialized filters, we demonstrated system performance similar to that of a class I biosafety cabinet. Furthermore, the active rigid plastic barrier enclosure demonstrated full containment of all aerosolized particulates (>99.99% efficient) and meets Food and Drug Administration guidance of a 4-log aerosol reduction for filtered air systems. 14 We continue to optimize the function and ergonomics of the design, yet in its current form, the active enclosure affords a significant Measurements were taken at the caudal end of the tent ( Figure 2C ) to simulate negative-pressure isolation. PAO aerosol concentrations are represented as median with 99% CI as a comparison against the industry standard safety limit of 0.01%. improvement in provider safety over current practice. Performance testing of aerosol containment devices before clinical implementation will improve the safety of health care workers using them. Adoption of rigid plastic barrier enclosures with active air filtration may allow peri-intubation preoxygenation and bag-valve-mask ventilation without increasing risk of contaminating providers. Given the protective efficacy during simulations of negative-pressure isolation, the active rigid plastic barrier enclosure device will likely facilitate the use of high-flow nasal cannula, CPAP, BiPAP, and nebulizers in coronavirus disease 2019 patients, reducing the current reliance on ventilators. 16 A battery-powered version of rigid plastic barrier enclosures with sufficient active air filtration could offer improved safety for emergency medical services and hospital-based patient transport. 17 In summary, simple physical barriers such as passive rigid plastic barrier enclosures inadequately protect providers from aerosols, yet they are being widely used by health care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures on infected patients. Rigid plastic barrier enclosures that incorporate sufficient active air filtration provide improved protection to health care workers during simulated intubations. Additionally, they provide a means to safely isolate individual patients and may also protect health care workers during patient transport. work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND (2) Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND (3) Final approval of the version to be published; AND (4) Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.",
