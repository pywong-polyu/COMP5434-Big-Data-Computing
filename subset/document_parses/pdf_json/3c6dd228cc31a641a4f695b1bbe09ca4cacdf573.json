It is widely accepted that the oxygen level in hypoxic tumor tissue is significantly lower than the oxygenation of the respective normal tissues and on average it is between 1%-2% O 2 and below (3) . Intratumoral hypoxia is a well established resistance factor for radiotherapy and is increasingly recognized as promoting resistance to systemic cancer therapies. Hypoxia promotes a more aggressive and resistant cancer phenotype, primarily mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor that is stable only in lowoxygen condition, which leads to cell cycle arrest, angiogenesis, and accelerated glycolysis (3). Nevertheless, tumor oxygen level largely depends on the initial oxygenation of the tissue, the size and stage of the tumor, and the method of oxygen measurement. In addition, different measurement methods often yield discrepant result and diagnose methods such as oxygen electrode and phosphorescence quenching and near-infrared spectroscopy are tedious and not suit to large numbers of samples.",

Then, we speculated that hypoxia activated the RAS signaling casade without KRAS mutation. To test our hypothesis, we performed clustering of CRC samples with wildtype (WT) KRAS status. Intriguingly, we found that CRCs with WT KRAS also fell into two groups, the proportion of hypoxia and normoxia was consistent with the abovementioned whole CRC cohort. GSEA consolidated the activation of RAS signaling in the hypoxic group without KRAS mutation both in GSE39582 (NES = 2.28, FDR q = 0, Figure 5A ) and TCGA (NES = 2.07, FDR q = 0.0038, Figure  5B ) cohorts. Additionally, ETS1, a genome-wide effector of RAS/ ERK signaling in epithelial cells and involvement in the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible genes (22, 23) , was found significantly unregulated in the hypoxic group compared to the normoxic group ( Figures 5C, D, Table S3 ). These results indicated that RAS signaling pathway may be triggered by ETS1 in a KRAS mutation-independent manner by hypoxia ( Figure 5E ), suggesting that CRC patients with WT KRAS status should consider hypoxia-target therapy or combination with EGFR inhibitor if failure of mono-EGFR inhibitor treatment.",

CIBERSORT was used to quantify the relative amount of 22 tumor lymphocytes in all four CRC datasets. Of note, CD8 T cell and CD4 memory resting T cell were less infiltrated under hypoxic conditions ( Figure S2) . On the contrary, we found that hypoxia was significantly associated with neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and polarization. Both M0 macrophages and M2 macrophages were much more infiltrated under hypoxic conditions (e.g., M2 macrophages median 15.5% versus 11.5%, GSE14333; 15.4% versus 9.6%, GSE17538; 13.2% versus 11%, GSE39582; 15.7% versus 13%, TCGA; Figure 6A ), however, this trend was not held for M1 macrophages. In addition, the aggregate amount of M2 macrophages was much larger than M1 macrophages ( Figure  S2 ). Two canonical markers of M2 macrophages, CD163 and CD206, had much higher expression levels in the hypoxic subgroup than in the normoxic subgroup in all four datasets ( Figures 6B, C) . Further correlation exploration between different lymphocytes observed that M2 macrophages had a negative correlation with plasma cells ( Figure S3 ). TAMs were reported to promote EMT of CRC cells via IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathway (24) . Given IL6/JAK/STAT3 was featured under hypoxic condition (Figure 4) , it is tempting to believe that it had a close association with more M2 macrophage infiltration. IL6ST (gp130), the receptor for IL6 initiating signal transmission, exhibited a significant positive correlation with M2 macrophage infiltration under hypoxic conditions ( Figure  S4) . Thus, the suppressive TIME orchestrated by hypoxia further exacerbated the tumor malignancy and, undoubtedly, a worse outcome. ",

            "text": "Hypoxia is characteristic for solid tumors and has been known to contribute to tumor aggressive phenotypes including enhanced motility, invasiveness, and immune escape (25) . In this study, we systematically analyzed four independent datasets covering different races and found that hypoxia was widely present in CRC. Hypoxic CRCs was characterized by enhanced angiogenesis, EMT, TGF-beta signaling, and undoubtedly, had worse OS, DFS, DSS, and RFS compared with the normoxic group. Notably, activation of the RAS signaling was one of typical characteristics under hypoxia and this association may through EST1 to activate the RAS pathway in a non-KRAS mutation-dependent manner to promote tumor proliferation and metastasis. In other words, not all CRCs with WT KRAS were suitable for solely cetuximab treatment. The mechanism of cetuximab resistance in KRAS-WT CRC patients remains poorly understood (26) . It's reported that increased DDX3 promoted by HIF-1a could induce cetuximab resistance via YAP1/SIX2 axis in KRAS-WT CRC cells (27) . These evidences coupled with our findings indicated that in combination of hypoxia-targeted inhibitors such as TH-302 (a hypoxia-activated prodrug) may enhance drug susceptibility in cetuximab resistant KRAS-WT CRC. In this case, patients with WT KRAS may still need to determine oxygenation status before applying EGFR inhibitors since activation of the RAS signaling pathway via hypoxia may lead to EGFR inhibitor treatment failure according to our finding. Furthermore, another interesting finding in this study was the hypoxic group of stage II CRCs had a worse outcome than the normoxic group of stage -II and even -III ( Figure 3B) . This finding provided a novel stratified basis for future CRC clinical treatment. In current clinical practice, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is required when stage II CRC patients have highrisk factors such as pT4 Tumors, obstruction or perforation, and lymphovascular and perineural invasion (28) . Hypoxia, in this context, may also be taken into consideration when applying preoperative or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for selected stage II CRC patients. It is also important to keep in mind that a better understanding of the interactions within the hypoxic tumor microenvironment is crucial for developing optimal new combination strategies. Through interrogating the constitution of TILs within CRCs, more M2 macrophage infiltration and a significant correlation with IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathway were revealed in the hypoxic group (Figures 4 and 6) . Macrophages are the main infiltrating immunosuppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment (29) . The M2 macrophage has been reported to promote tumor proliferation, angiogenesis (30), metastasis (31) , and resistance to anti-cancer therapies (32) . In breast cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hypoxia has been shown to positively regulate the expression of CD47, leading to cancer cell escape from phagocytosis mediated by macrophages (33) . Blockade of the well-known CD47-SIRPa \"don't eat me signal\" using monoclonal antibodies increases macrophagemediated phagocytosis and elimination of various solid tumors (34) (35) (36) , however, this therapeutic schedule may be not suit to hypoxic CRC because the expression of CD47 showed uncorrelated trend with hypoxia. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), direct depletion of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) by clodronate was sufficient to abrogate aerobic glycolysis and tumor hypoxia, thereby improving tumor response to anti-cancer therapies (37) , this therapeutic regimen may be also fit for CRC but warrants further investigation. Hypoxic CRC patients may also benefit from sarilumab (IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)-blocking antibody), which is approved for treatment of Castleman syndrome by the FDA (38) , since IL6/ JAK/STAT3 pathway was closely associated with M2 macrophages although their implication in oncogenesis was less well characterized (24) . Anyway, a safe, subtle, and flexible combination treatment should be designed in order to extend the clinical benefit of cancer therapy to high intratumoral hypoxic CRC patients.",
