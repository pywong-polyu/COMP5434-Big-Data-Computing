            "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic created a situation where online learning extended at speed. During the national lockdowns, when it was not possible for most children to physically attend school, the efficacy and efficiency of digital platforms made it possible for schools to fulfill their duties to provide an education. However, the urgency of the situation carried the risk that this was put in place without adequate consideration of the data protection risks from various online learning tools. Although the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides a framework of regulations and rights to protect users, the legal process is unwieldy to apply due to tensions in balancing the rights of the child learner with the public need to ensure that all children are provided with an education. This paper recommends that changes in digital schooling practices are needed so that children have realistically possible ways of enforcing their data protection rights as well as a clarified and uniformed approach to support schools.",

It expresses concern that the use of digital platforms in this context is not upholding children's rights and puts children at risk of unnecessary, unethical and potentially harmful data processing. This paper acknowledges that data protection regulation exists to protect individuals in the digital world but explains that, with the increased use of digital platforms for school learning, there exists a tension between the protections offered under law and the reality of a digitised and connected learning environment. This presents a confusing and potentially hazardous path for the child, their parents and the school to navigate. There may be no alternative option for a child who wants to, and must by law, receive an education, but to accept the invasive data practices now commonplace. The provision of alternatives is also logistically challenging for schools. Greater awareness and education are needed so that children can be empowered to exercise their rights and be active agents over their own data. Schools should be supported to ensure that they can provide online learning in a way that is safe and transparent and ensures that children are not put at unnecessary risks due to the invisibility of data processing and the subsequent harms that may occur in future as a result.",

            "text": "The first section of this paper contextualises the digital schooling environment. It explains that unethical and potentially unlawful data practices are happening via school learning due to the increased reliance on digital platforms. The second section addresses the legal position. It emphasises a fundamental tension between the child's right to object under Article 21 of the UK GDPR 1 and the justifications of 'public task' and 'legitimate interest' under Article 6(1)(e) and (f), which schools can rely on to defend their digital learning practices. It is suggested that this leaves ample space for third party companies to undertake unethical data processing of children without any negative legal consequences. This leaves children, parents and schools with limited opportunity for digital resistance, if any. The third section considers the development of children's rights in the digital world. It acknowledges that recent efforts to improve the recognition of children in this context are positive steps forward, including the launch of the UN Committee's General Comment No. 25 on children's rights in relation to the digital environment. 2 However, it emphasises that complexities of digital schooling need to be specifically addressed if the requirements of the General Comment are to be fully realised. This paper concludes by making key recommendations for the way forward.",

This paper therefore aims to put a spotlight on the unwarranted dataintrusive norms that have developed in the school education system prior to and during this time. It intends to draw the attention of law and policymakers to the legal discrepancies and the cultural challenges which allow pervasive data practices to exist in day-to-day learning.

            "text": "The collection of children's data by schools is not a new practice and there is value in recording information about children in the schooling context. For instance, schools record data on a child's learning progress, how they compare to their peers as well as grades and feedback. Schools also record more sensitive data, such as attendance records, notes on personal difficulties, family circumstances, health conditions and learning differences. As online technology has developed, there has been more opportunity to improve the effectiveness of data collection through the integration of digital systems in schooling environments. For example, some schools take children's fingerprints on their first day, which can then be used to make 'fingerprint payments' for school lunches. Digital tools can also be extremely useful in enhancing and supporting children's education. Holloway has suggested that data collection and analytics can help to personalise children's learning, increasing support where needed and maximising opportunities. 3 concerns over inter alia the surveillance of children, their right to privacy and potential risks associated with data processing. 4 Facial recognition software has also been developed for use in digital learning contexts. 5 At the time of writing, the use of facial recognition software in schools in the UK is not widespread, although it has been reported to have been utilised in a school in Scotland for lunch payments. 6 Andrejevic and Selwyn have warned that systems can take advantage of existing school practices of collecting photographs of children's faces for student records. 7 These can be used, for example, for accessing online content of courses, 8 authenticating the user, 9 or to confirm the identity of a student taking an online exam and confirming their presence for the exam duration. 10 Facial recognition software has also become a tool for monitoring student emotion and attention to detect learner engagement. 11 For example, it has been reported that some schools in China have systems which scan the room every 30 seconds to analyse student's emotions and behavior. 12 A start-up company in Hong Kong was reported to have developed a facial recognition software, known as '4 Little Trees', which recognises muscle movements in the face to determine emotions. 13 It also tracks how long a student takes to answer questions. It was considered to have been especially helpful for teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic for reading student's emotions. 14 However, this type of technology raises questions for fundamental human rights and freedoms of users, including both teachers and learners, as well as the more general concerns about data bias within AI systems, such as biased data regarding what it means to 'look engaged '. 15 The process of learning itself has also become increasingly 'datafied' i.e., subjected to data processing. Article 4(2) of the UK GDPR defines data processing as 'any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction'. 16 Like many online platforms, digital learning platforms may expose the child user to risks of data processing by tracking learning activities and achievements or learning behaviour. Any data collected can then be passed to 'on sellers' and data brokers who can make money from selling the data. Holloway has explained that data collected via classroom behaviour modelling apps, such as ClassDojo, may be taken into a different context and used to analyse a child's behaviour beyond the initially intended purpose. 17 This can take place without the consent of children or parents. Whilst many digital tools are presented to the user and the school as a benefit, to help them fulfill their educational aims and duties, it is the invisible data mining operations behind the scenes which dominate. 'Surveillance capitalism' is present in many contexts in which a child engages with the online world. 18 In recent years, scholars and children's rights advocates, including the Children's Commissioner for England and organisations such as the 5Rights Foundation, 19 have become increasingly concerned about the ungoverned space in which the online world operates, which has led to data processing being the underlying norm in software design. Design is based on economic imperative and engineers the platform for the purpose of increasing corporate profit and developing extractive economic practices, which encourage maximum user engagement for increased opportunities for data collection. 20 Software for schooling purposes is no exception. Much like other forms of data, 'learner data' is a lucrative commodity.",

In 2017, it was estimated that 30 million children in the US were using Google Classroom apps like Gmail and Docs, and that Chromebooks accounted for more than half of the mobile devices shipped to schools. 22 In February 2020, the Attorney General of New Mexico filed a lawsuit against Google for unlawfully tracking children's data through free Chromebooks provided to schools through the company's G Suite for Education platform (which has since been rebranded as Google Workspace). 23 that user did not have a Facebook account. 25 Further, it was reported that, in the first month of the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of active users of Google Classroom doubled to 100 million. 26 It became a 'go-to' platform for many schools and was recommended as a high-quality educational platform. 27 In February 2021, when the number of active users was reported to be 150 million, it was announced that Google would increase its educational offering with various new tools and add-ons. 28 Yet the company has been under scrutiny for data protection violations, having received four GDPR fines including three in 2020. 29 In May 2021, the Dutch Data Protection Authority advised schools and universities not to use Google Workspace for education. 30 This resulted in negotiations with Google who agreed to measures to mitigate some of the risks.",

The rush to move to remote learning meant that there was little transparency about the risks and implications of data processing or consideration of the impact that this may have on a child's future. Digital dependency also meant that there was no alternative to learning through digital platforms that are potentially collecting and harvesting the data of its users. Acceleration in the use of digital technologies has taken place without open public debate, with little reassurance as to the safety of the platforms being used and with no consultation with parents or children themselves.",

Those who are aware may, quite understandably, wish to reject the practices of data processing. There are some contexts in which it might be possible. For example, a parent could opt not have a smart speaker in the home or ensure that their children do not play with app-connected toys. However, the likelihood is that those who are concerned will be resigned to the fact that digital platforms are necessary for school learning, without considering the possibility of questioning whether there is an alternative. Livingstone, Lansdown and Third note that both children and adults are not hugely concerned about commercial use of their data, with the mindset that it 'is the only 'deal' on offer'. 39 Not only does this further contribute to the norm of pervasive data processing but also creates a norm in which children, parents and schools do not question unethical practices.

In February 2020, the Information Commissioner's Office, the UK's independent regulator for data protection and information rights law, published a report following a compulsory audit of the Department for Education (DfE). 40 <https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/publication/the-case-for-a-uncrc-general-comment-on-childrensrights-and-digital-media/> accessed 16 April 2021. 40 Information Commissioner's Office, 'Department for Education: Data Protection Report' (2020) <https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/audits-and-advisory-visits/2618384/department-for-education-organisations defenddigitalme and Liberty, with respect to the National Pupil Database. 41 The audit found that data protection was not being prioritised and that this had severely impacted the DfE's ability to comply with data protection laws. The ICO identified 'a high risk that data will not be processed in a compliant manner and could result in multiple data breaches or further breaches of legislation'. 42 In addition they made a total of 139 recommendations for improvement, with over 60% classified as urgent or high priority. 43 It was also identified that there were cultural barriers within the DfE regarding data protection such as a lack of importance placed on data protection in the development of policy and practice, reflected in the lack of resourcing afforded to the Data Protection Officer and the impact this has had on what is achievable. 44 It was also observed that the DfE had been lax in its approaches when providing advice and guidance on data protection matters. This included not providing sufficient privacy information for data subjects, not fulfilling data security obligations and limited data protection training for staff. 45 It was identified that there was a reliance on staff to become self-aware of regulations and polices with no follow up on whether these have been read or understood. 46 It was also recognised that Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) were not being carried out early enough or at all, meaning that data processing was taking place without this safeguard in place. 47 While schools act with the best intent, the alarming findings in the ICO audit indicate that a child or parent could, reasonably and understandably, prefer to opt out of digital education. However, as is explained in the next section, there are practical difficulties for a child or parent who wishes to do this, and it places schools in a logistically difficult position to provide alternatives while maintaining educational access.",

It demonstrates why the legal framework leaves children at risk of unethical data processing, and therefore exposed to possible harms in future.

As was identified in the ICO's audit of the DfE, internal cultural barriers and attitudes have been preventing 'an effective system of information governance, which considers the rights and freedoms of data subjects against their own requirements for processing personal data to ensure data is processed in line with the principles of the GDPR.' 51 The ICO audit also showed that there was limited training in a range of aspects including individual rights. 52 The cultural challenges are discussed in further detail in section 5.",

Although children (or their parents) have the right to object, it is legally, socially, and ethically unclear how it should be handled in practice, by school stakeholders, when it comes to digital learning and teaching technologies. Parallel to this, local authorities have a duty to provide an education to all children who cannot attend school as per Section 19(1) of the Education Act 1996. Although this provision was not designed to respond to the educational needs of children during the Covid-19 pandemic, it is still applicable to the context of remote learning. A child's education rights are also protected by international conventions. Article 2, Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that: 'No person shall be denied the right to education'. Similarly, Article 28 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) states that 'State Parties recognise the right of children to education' and Article 29 of the UNCRC adds a framework outlining the aims of education.",

In carrying out this balance, schools can quite legitimately override an individual child's interests due to their public duty to educate, despite pervasive data processing practices that may be taking place. However, there is no specific guidance as to how the balancing exercise should be handled in the schooling context.

Similarly, a child's health information will also fall under this category. We consider that 'learner data' can, in some instances, constitute special category data.

They can also entirely refuse to give their consent in the first place. The Data protection: a toolkit for schools states that if a pupil or their parent does not want to use the fingerprint scanner to pay in the cafeteria (or other biometrics processing), alternatives will be provided, such as paying with cash. 62 The school should not preclude the child from using the cafeteria services.

This is likely to be the lawful basis most often used by a school when processing special category data via digital learning platforms. This indicates that if a school can justify the overarching educational benefit, then the need to seek explicit consent is eliminated. This provision also states that processing of special category data is only possible if there is a 'Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject'. If interpreted in a strict manner and correctly enforced, then data protection concerns should be mitigated. However, as has been indicated throughout this paper, many digital platforms have a covert layer of data mining that schools are not always aware of or have a lax attitude towards. 59 Article 9(1) UK GDPR. 60 The age at which a child can give their own consent under the EU GDPR, is 16 years. However, in the UK, that age limit was lowered to 13 years by the Data Protection Act 2018. For children below the age of 13, the consent of a parent is needed. Scholars outside of the education context have expressed dissatisfaction with public interest justifications. Rinik has argued that, Grand and rather vague notions of data sharing being in the 'public interest' and helping to 'serve the public good,' offered as public justifications for the growth of data sharing, may be seen as mere window dressing for the voracious appetite for easier access to more personal data by business and government, which is needed for continued economic growth. 63 This concern is prevalent in the schooling context, where the public interest in providing an education to children has a clear and obvious benefit. Therefore, a school can reasonably provide well justified evidence as to why they are overriding an individual child's interests. However, this is not to say that schools are to blame. Schools may have little autonomy over the digital platforms they use. The rush to move to online education during the Covid-19 pandemic also made schools vulnerable to the advertising of large technology corporations who could step in to provide effective digital tools in the pedagogic sense, but who would have hidden agendas for profit-making via data processing. As a society, we need to consider whether the rights and obligations regarding education are enough to constitute reasons of 'substantial public interest' to the point of tipping the balance against individual rights of learners, leaving them exposed to unethical data processing practices by third parties.",

She acknowledges that data is more valuable if it preserves the individual user's characteristics. 67 Further, she indicates concern in light of the fact that it is possible to use technology and recombine data sets in order to re-identify an individual's data that was previously considered to be anonymised. 68 These observations are relevant to the schooling context, where it may be that allegedly anonymised data collection could still leave a child exposed to unethical and unnecessary risks.

Although they provide some important resources for improving children's online safety, very little is offered in the way of increased protection for children whose data is being monetised by third party corporations via digital learning platforms, which has become a more pressing concern during the Covid-19 pandemic. We argue that DfE guidance should do more to ensure that schools do not fall victim to the lure of free and easy-access digital learning platforms which, through the collection of data for educational reasons, are simultaneously harvesting the data of children for commercial gain. Further guidelines should ensure that individual data protection rights of child learners are given greater weight when balanced against reasons of 'substantial public interest', 'public task' and 'legitimate interest'.

Section 123(1) of the Act required the Information Commissioner to develop a Code of Practice to improve standards of protection for children in the digital world. This led to the Age Appropriate Design Code which was published in September 2020, with a one year transition period for organisations to ensure compliance. The code applies to 'relevant information society services which are likely to be accessed by children'. 74 This includes a range of websites, programs, apps, social media sites, as well as online games, toys and connected devices. The aim of the code is to support compliance with the DPA and the GDPR, through setting out 15 standards, to act as a 'benchmark for the appropriate protection of children's personal data', 75 which should be built into the design of services likely to be accessed by children. The code is said to incorporate the standards of the UNCRC including Article 3, the best interests of the child as the primary consideration. 76 It also endorses the use of default settings that are data minimising and that children who choose to change these settings are supported with information, advice and guidance before they do so. 77 The ICO maintains that it will monitor compliance with the code through audits and complaints processes and take action to enforce data protection rules. 78 The code also suggests that organisations have their own systems of accountability and governance to observe compliance with data protection legislation. 79 At the time of writing, the Age Appropriate Design Code is in its transition year for implementation. The impact that it will have in the schooling context is yet to be seen. The code does not specifically consider 'learner data' but the explanatory memorandum includes educational websites in their list of online platforms that will be covered by the code. 80 Therefore there may be some improvement to the digital schooling environment once the transition period has passed in September 2021. However, the code also emphasises that there can be a lawful basis for processing personal data and refers to Article 6 of the UK GDPR which includes 'public task' and 'legitimate interest'. 81 Similarly, it suggests that Article 9(2)(g),'substantial public interest', can be relied upon for the processing of special category data. As has already been discussed at 3. 1.1 and 3.1.2 , there are difficulties with schools relying on 'public task', 'legitimate interest' and 'substantial public interest' as a child's right to object or decline consent can be easily outweighed by a school's legal obligation to provide an education. This can leave a child subjected to unethical, unnecessary and potentially unlawful data processing, with no recourse but to resign themselves to the data-intrusive norm.",

In 2014, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child convened to discuss the implications of the convention in light of the digital age. 89 In 2017, the Children Commissioner's Growing up Digital report reviewed the UNCRC's provisions and suggested adjustments for the digital age. 90 The report called for a General Comment, which would include guidance on addressing the commercial design of digital technology, in order to better protect children's rights. This was subsequently developed into General Comment No. 25 on children's rights in relation to the digital environment and, in February 2021, was officially adopted by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. The General Comment was launched on 24 March 2021 at a webinar hosted by the 5Rights Foundation. 91 It confirms that the UNCRC now applies in the online world, including the schooling context. Therefore, the safeguards and support for children to be active participants and agents of their school learning should apply in the online world, just as they do for the offline world. The UN General Comment No. 25 makes important points with regard the protection of children's data. With reference to the best interests of the child, it outlines that 'States parties should prohibit by law the profiling or targeting of children of any age for commercial purposes on the basis of a digital record of their actual or inferred characteristics, including group or collective data, targeting by association or affinity profiling'. 92 In relation to the context of schooling, it states that '[s]tandards for digital educational technologies should ensure that the use of those technologies is ethical and appropriate for educational purposes and does not expose children to violence, discrimination, misuse of their personal data, commercial exploitation or other infringements of their rights' 93 This is a welcome development in the field of digital schooling. We suggest that these provisions should be interpreted such that, in the school learning context, data should only be collected for reasons that relate to the child's education and have clearly defined and ethically justified retention periods. For example, data collection might be needed for submitting work and receiving feedback or for receiving lessons online when necessary, but this should not be intertwined with unethical third-party data processing. Children should be able to engage in digital learning in a way that is safe and transparent without the hidden presence of surveillance capitalism.",

We consider that public duties to educate and the child's right to be educated should not be at odds with the need to keep children free from pervasive data processing practices. As has been stated by UNICEF, children's rights should work together and no one right is more important than the other. 95",

However, we emphasise, that there is a specific need for CRIA in the digital schooling context as well as DPIAs, both of which should be carried out as early as possible. We suggest that when schools are choosing which digital technologies to engage with, they mandate that only platforms which have been subjected to a CRIA and a DPIA can be used. This should include a prohibition on data processing by third parties for commercial purposes and ensure that any data that is processed is strictly related to the learning development of children. A CRIA for digital schooling would need to appropriately balance the best interests of the child and ensure that the interests of the children in receiving an education are not used a reason to allow third-party data processing to take place for unethical commercial purposes.",

If children are not given an alternative, then they may feel they have no choice but to agree with the way they are receiving digital education for fear that they cannot otherwise receive their learning. In line with the above recommendation of the Council of Europe, we suggest that if a child exercises their right to object, or wishes to withdraw consent, due to concerns about pervasive data collection, then they should be supported in this decision and their inclusivity should be ensured by being provided with an alternative way to learn and be included in school life.

Lundy has explained that 'the practice of actively involving pupils in decision making should not be portrayed as an option which is in the gift of adults but a legal imperative which is the right of the child.' 106 The UN General Comment No. 25 on Children's Rights in the Digital Environment also endorses the position that more is needed than simply listening to the voice of the child. It asserts that State parties 'should have regard for all children's rights, including their rights to seek, receive and impart information, to be protected from harm and to have their views given due weight'. 107 This is similar to the Council of Europe guidelines, which recommend the need for 'procedures for children to express themselves and to make their views heard in regard of exercising their right to privacy in educational settings and to ensure their view is taken into consideration'. 108 A mere symbolic or theoretical possibility of exercising GDPR rights does not ensure that the child's view is accorded due weight. We consider that children should be involved and heard much earlier in the process, when school decisions are being made about whether and if so which technologies to use in the educational context. Byrne has argued that the extent to which children's views are given due weight is dependent, in part, upon whether the school rules are a barrier or enabler of children's rights. 109 In the digital learning context, schools, often through no direct fault of their own and often without realising, act as a barrier to children's rights. This is partially due to the lack of awareness amongst children, their parents, school staff and society at large about data protection rights, how to exercise them and why they might need to be exercised. 110 Accordingly, we are concerned as to how a child who digitally resists might be socially perceived, especially where something as important as education is at stake. Rather than being perceived as active agents of their rights, there is a risk that they might be viewed as disruptive or troublesome. The reaction is likely to be dependent on the individual school. If the above claims regarding how a child might be perceived are unfounded, a child could still hold a genuine fear as to how they will be treated socially, not only in relation to how the school will perceive them but also the reactions of peers or their own feelings of discomfort from not following the crowd. An even greater concern is that a child, or their parents, might not be aware of their data protection rights to even consider whether they would like to exercise their right to object, or to even realise that there are risks attached to data processing in the first place.",

As schools will have a lawful basis for data processing, there is no guarantee that an alternative form of learning will be provided if a child or parent exercises the right to object. This makes it even less likely that this individual right will be utilised as it adds to the concern that, by exercising data protection rights, a child's education is being compromised. It is possible that, if the right to object is exercised, some schools might respond by willingly by providing hard copies of work for instance. During the national lockdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic, some children were provided with hard copies of work and given specific time slots to pick this up from school to ensure social distancing. However, it is most likely that this provision was for children who had no or limited digital access, rather than because the right to object had been exercised. Although, this shows that an alternative to using digital learning platforms is possible, it could be logistically challenging to expect schools to do this for a more sustained period. Additionally, the fact that the provision of alternatives based on the right to object is not guaranteed, could also mean that children in one school are provided with alternatives but children in another are not.",

An IT manager might then be responsible for checking the feasibility of this request and a GDPR officer might only become involved if a query is raised or if the platform is one that is not widely known.

Their success in keeping unethical pervasive practices concealed from society at large has led to members of society, including children, parents and school staff, automatically trusting well-known platforms. Article 29 of the UNCRC indicates that education should prepare children for a responsible life in a free society. In the digital learning context, this indicates that children should be able to exercise their right to education without the coercion and disempowerment experienced, albeit unknowingly, when using digital learning technologies who engage in commercially driven data processing. Article 29 implies that there is a pedagogic imperative to stimulate a child's critical awareness around digital data protection rights. But the culture of tacit acceptance makes this difficult to address in practice.",

The national lockdowns as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic tipped the balance even further towards commercial companies, as many schools turned to the platforms of well-known digital technology providers, who could take advantage of the opportunity for increased data collection by affording effective pedagogic tools. The 5Rights Foundation, in their report on the Online Safety Bill, emphasised the power imbalance users face including within the education sector. They stated that, In bringing forward an Online Safety Bill, the government has recognised that individual usersparticularly children and parentsare in an asymmetric power imbalance with the demands and commercial interests of tech companies. By exempting EdTech, the government has failed to extend this acknowledgement to teachers who cannot and should not be expected to mitigate the negative impacts of the digital services on which schools and children rely. 114 This important observation makes clear that more input is needed to address the power imbalance in the education sector. School staff should be supported in protecting and empowering children and adequate resourcing is needed to ensure this. However, school staff should not be entirely responsible as the Government and technology companies themselves also have a role to play.",

This increased during the Covid-19 pandemic when national lockdowns meant that most children had to undertake their schooling remotely. The collection of 'learner data' through digital learning platforms exposes children to unethical data processing by third-party companies, who use the data for commercial gain. Technology companies have strategically increased their product marketing during the Covid-19 pandemic, including through providing free or low-cost services. This has given companies increased influence over the education sector and helped to cement data-intrusive norms in the schooling environment.

The vast majority of data collected via a digital learning platform is personal data, for which children or their parents can exercise the right to object under Article 21. However, the practical reality of exercising this right in the schooling context is fraught with difficulty. Schools can legitimately rely on 'public task' and 'legitimate interest' justifications in Article 6(1)(e) and (f) of the UK GDPR as the school has a legal duty to educate and children have a right to be educated. Any special category data processed for digital learning can also be processed lawfully where there is 'substantial public interest' as per Article 9(2)(g).

Fundamental to the problem is the fact that schools are generally UK GDPR compliant. It is the legal framework itself that leaves a gap for third party companies to creep into. The right to be educated and the public obligation to provide an education are clearly entrenched in law but we suggest that these are not good enough reasons to warrant exposing children to exploitative data processing practices which are likely to have a negative impact on their future. Schools have little guidance as to how to balance the individual rights of the child with their wider public duty and it is not clear whether there is a uniformed approach.",

The socially disempowered position of children in the digital learning context is related to several issues including social fears regarding how a child who objects might be perceived and hierarchical structures in schools between children and school staff as well as systems of authority between staff themselves. The provision of alternatives for children is not guaranteed and creates logistical issues for schools. Most concerning is the power imbalance experienced by children, and those who are responsible for protecting them, as a result of the commercially driven data-intrusive norm which technology companies have taken even more advantage of since the Covid-19 pandemic. It is hoped that developments in national and international instruments might go some way addressing this imbalance but, as has been demonstrated, much of the existing and proposed regulations take a broad view, rather than specifically considering 'learner data'.",

This paper ends with a final message of global relevance. Societies need to reflect on whether they are satisfied with an education system that allows children to be exploited for commercial gain. Following the implementation of the UN General Comment No. 25, now is the time to consider whether we wish to remain in the disempowered position in which we live and allow the invisible data-intrusive culture that commercial companies have carefully crafted to prevail. Public exposure as to what exactly is happening to our children's 'learner data' is vital.",
