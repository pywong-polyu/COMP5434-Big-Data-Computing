We have introduced an alternative time-dependent form of growth rate. This form satisfies essential conditions to represent population growth and can be an alternative form for growth models to analyze population dynamics. We have employed the generalized Richards model as a guideline to compare our results. Further, we have applied our model in the case of epidemics. To check the efficacy of our model, we have verified the 2003 SARS data. This model has estimated the final epidemic size with good accuracy. Thereafter, we intend to describe the present COVID-2019 pandemic. We have performed our analysis with data for Italy, Spain, and Germany. Following, we have tried to predict the number of COVID-19 cases and the turning point for the USA, UK, and India.",

On the other hand, n determines the rate of decrease in the growth rate in the later phase. In all the cases, there is a similarity among the parameter sets (listed in table IV) and m is almost three times higher than n. One can also infer that from the trend of the daily reported case. There is a faster increase in the number of cases, whereas the tail is extended. But in the case of GRM, the fitted value of r and a (listed in table V) has variation among these three countries. So the relative growth rate and basic reproduction number are different. Whereas the m and n have similar values in our model. This similarity may have interesting consequences. This may indicate that the growth pattern has an intrinsic time dependence, depending on environmental conditions and demography. Further studies with data from different regions of the globe may enlighten in this direction.",

In all these cases, the pandemic seems to decelerate after 80 days (80 days should be counted from day 1 of our method i.e first day to report 100 new cases).

The growth rate tended to decline before this day and the maximum reported case was nearly 4000 on Feb 4 th . Our model could not fit this sudden rise with this limited number of parameters.

We have performed parametrization with the generalized Richards model as a benchmark study for our model. Our proposed model has a satisfying agreement with the GRM model in evaluating the turning point and final epidemic size for all the cases. We have also predicted the USA, the UK, and India using both GRM and our method. The pandemic seems to stay in India for a longer period than other countries due to a slower growth rate initially and late timing of the turning point.
