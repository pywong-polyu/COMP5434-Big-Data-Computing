Cetinkal et al, 13 however, argue that as previous studies reveal worse clinical outcomes in patients with cardiac injury, non-respiratory variables in the CHA 2 D 2 VASc system such as older age, DM, HTN and previous cardiovascular disease are valuable parameters for mortality risk stratification. However, AUROC values found for CHA 2 D 2 VASc remain at the low end compared with other existing scoring systems, despite modifications catered to COVID-19 added to form the m-CHA 2 D 2 VASc scale. Even this version, with an AUROC higher by 0.06, offers predictive ability similar to univariate NLR and inferior to troponin increase.",

Its superior discrimination may be due to its more accurate respiratory function evaluation (oxygen saturation [SpO 2 ] >90% / arterial oxygen tension [PaO2] <60 mm Hg in A-DROP vs respiratory rate \u226530/min in CURB-65). The modified age cut-off (male >70 / female >75 in A-DROP vs age >65 in CURB-65) may also contribute to A-DROP's advantage when applied to COVID-19, considering the median age of COVID-19 non-survivors is 69 years. 14 Ultimately, although APACHE II, SOFA, PSI and CURB-65 are well-founded in clinical practice, their requirement for sophisticated patient information makes rapid assessment impossible, an important benefit for triaging patients with COVID-19 in often overrun hospitals.

Due to the large cohort and continued follow-up of PCT levels throughout hospital stay, this study provides stronger evidence for the inclusion of PCT into scoring systems, which has begun to be implemented but is still in the minority of included parameters. Fois et al 26 used the same study design and identified the systemic inflammation index (SII) as an independent predictor of mortality. However, the study quality was poor-with only 119 patients and the large number of different inflammation indexes being studied in different combinations. It is unclear whether any clinical utility is offered by implementation of SSI, considering deranged lymphocyte count is already widely established as a useful predictor. 20 Renal and hepatic function biomarkers Esposito et al 27 identified estimated glomerular filtration rate (using a baseline of 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and Fu et al 24 identified cholestasis and hypoproteinaemia as independent predictors of mortality. Interestingly, as with cardiac biomarkers, these were predictors even after accounting for pre-existing comorbidities. The obvious benefit to clinical practice of renal and hepatic function markers is that they Open access are routinely done on hospital admission and straightforward to clinicians to score in a system. Replication of largescale multicentre studies is needed before determining the diagnostic validity of such parameters in the stratification of patients with COVID-19 in a statistical or AI model. It must be acknowledged that additional parameters must be externally validated to determine AUROC values and appropriate cut-offs for parameters. 6 Lung imaging Trabulus et al, 28 Francone et al 29 and Xu et al 30 examined the relationship between chest CT findings and mortality, with all three studies reporting independent associations with mortality (p<0.05). Two studies 31 32 used a methodology involving an overall severity score of each scan and proposed defined cut-offs above which there was yield of best predictive value. These cut-offs are of value for clinicians to allocate scans with a high/medium/low rating which can be used to triage patients with COVID-19. However, both these studies have limitations in their methodology and design, which need to be addressed before implementation of CT severity into scoring systems. In the study by Gao et al, 31 follow-up was limited to 24 days; a minimum of at least 28-day mortality is recommended to better reflect the clinical course of COVID-19 in most cases. 7 In addition, both severity score studies were retrospective in nature, which is susceptible to incomplete clinical records and bias in the interpretation of CT by different radiologists. Chest CT while highly sensitive is not a first-line test due to limited resources to CT scan in all COVID-19-positive hospital admissions. Routine implementation of admission CT scans would also carry a radiation burden to patients, which is arguably unnecessary if alternative parameters conferring equal predictive power without additional risk of iatrogenic effects could be used. Perhaps, chest CT is more appropriate in the discharge process of clinically stable, triaged patients with COVID-19 rather than as a first-line test as part of an admission scoring system.",
