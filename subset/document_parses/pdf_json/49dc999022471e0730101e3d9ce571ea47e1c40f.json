This study analyzed investment trends in 17 regions and eight technology clusters related to PM, consisting of 5727 public R&D projects worth USD 148.5 million, from 2015 to 2020. We also illustrated the level of investment for different PM-related technology clusters in each region; various research organizations explicitly verified comparable innovation capabilities for all eight technology fields in 17 regions, showing individual differences in technology areas per region. Our framework provided information to allow implementation of two goals: administering successful PM and improving regional equality in public health and healthcare according to technical and organizational levels. This study empirically demonstrates that it can provide a precise overarching innovation scheme with regional, technical, and organizational dimensions to establish collaboration among different stakeholders, thereby creating a foundation for an overarching national PM strategy.",

Thus, the United States Precision Medicine Initiative and the European Union's (EU's) \"Personalised Medicine\" (PerMed) were announced in 2015, and the International Consortium for Personalised Medicine (ICPerMed) was announced in 2016 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . The US Precision Medicine Initiative is a long-term research endeavor to develop a new model of individualized care with a USD 9269 million investment from 2016 to 2020 [7, 8] while PerMed and ICPerMed focused on coordinating and fostering research to develop and evaluate PM approaches at the European and international levels with EUR 3.2 billion spent during 2007-2020. After these announcements, other governments, including South Korea, Japan, and China, set out their national PM strategies. The China Precision Medicine Initiative was announced almost exactly one year after the US Precision Medicine Initiative, with an expected investment of more than USD 9 billion for a 15-year research period [2] . China has invested in three important scientific research fields, enabling a deep understanding of the genetics and biological systems of people, data collection and analysis tools, and improved computing power to make discoveries from largescale data [9] . The Japanese government supports the development of PM, as stated in the Japan Revitalization Strategy 2016 and Healthcare Policy Strategy. Japan plans to initially target rare, insurable, infectious, and undiagnosed diseases as well as cancer, dementia, and Korea have invested in which research fields and the kinds of R&D projects that have been accomplished to organize the collaboration groups in individual research fields.",

Namely, the elements of PM involve findings (knowledge) from basic molecular and clinical discoveries and population science; data (informatics) from biomedical and digital technologies, omics technologies, and imaging; and, ultimately, development of clinical applications [21, 32, 34] . In this study, we investigated PM from three perspectives (see Figure 1 ): (1) data: bigdata and AI-based analysis platforms (3 sub-clusters); (2) findings: clinical/empirical research for prediction, diagnosis, and therapy (4 sub-clusters); (3) medical and healthcare service: medical and healthcare service for application of PM. [30] . Thus, it is recommended to develop a national strategy for PM by considering a collaboration among government, scientists, and medical professionals [31] . In particular, we should assess the landscape in terms of which government agencies of South Korea have invested in which research fields and the kinds of R&D projects that have been accomplished to organize the collaboration groups in individual research fields.",

Consequently, considerable skepticism concerning the reliability and legitimacy of peer review [35] and committee and group meetings [39, 40] has risen among certain parts of the scientific world, because scientists and experts who participated in decision making have inherent cognitive bias stemming various sources including the specific case (e.g., data, reference materials, and contextual information), environment, culture and experience (e.g., organizational factor, education and training), and human nature (e.g., personal factors, human brain) [26] .",

Three ASJC codes (labels) were attached to each public R&D project, and the probability of relevance of each assigned ASJC code was indicated based on information (feature) from the title and abstract of the R&D project. In addition, a 10% threshold probability was applied to improve the correlation between the assigned ASJC codes and the nationally funded R&D projects.

Bigdata infrastructure for PM made up 62.4% (USD 879.4 million), followed by Empirical and clinical studies for PM (32.3%, USD 455.5 million) and Medical and healthcare services (5.2%, USD 73.6 million). In the bigdata infrastructure for PM, a significant amount of national R&D funding was invested in omics (CLS 1: Omics-bioinformatics based analysis, USD 342.7 million, 24.3%), followed by Smart-health (CLS 4: Smart-health device-based analysis, USD 285.7 million, 20.3%) and Cohort (CLS 7: Cohort-based clinical data platform, USD 251 million, 17.8%). In the empirical and clinical studies for PM, a significant amount of national R&D expenditure was allocated to Clinical information (CLS 2: Clinical information-based analysis, USD 192.2 million, 13.6%), followed by Drugs (CLS 5: Drug discovery, pre-clinical and clinical studies, USD 98.4 million, 7.0%), Prediction (CLS 8: Prediction and diagnosis, USD 87 million, 6.2%), and Therapies (CLS 6: Targeted therapies, USD 78 million, 5.5%).

As shown in Table 5 To present a list of potential collaborative networks in the PM industry, the current status of public R&D projects was reviewed by type of technology cluster, region, and organization (Table 6 ). Due to the different growth paths, it is difficult to change how a region has grown to acquire a technological capability [13, 33] . To effectively transform a region's growth path, it is necessary to know what types of regional research organizations existed in a new research field. Thus, this study enabled stakeholders to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of research capacities of region organizations. A regional R&D portfolio is presented in Table 6 . It could be presumed what types of organizations in what region have the competitive edge in the eight technology clusters. Looking at the specific amount of funds and investment rankings, industries and hospitals received the most investment in Seoul (USD 141,547 thousand and USD 79,691 thousand, respectively) followed by Gyeonggi-do (USD 68,242 thousand and USD 11,315 thousand, respectively). Research institutes represented the largest funders in Daejeon (USD 103,521 thousand) followed by Seoul (USD 90,408 million) and Gyeonggi-do (USD 66,571 thousand). Universities in Seoul (USD 79,691 thousand) received the most funding, followed by Ulsan (USD 68,242 thousand) and Gyeonggi-do (USD 54,571 thousand). Agencies represented a significant investment in Chungcheongbuk-do (USD 70,519), where the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention Agency is located. Notably, in the Services cluster, industry took the lead in Gangwon-do (USD 7360 thousand) over Seoul (USD 6851 thousand). In addition, industry in Gangwon-do played important roles in the Smarthealth (USD 6047 thousand) and Prediction (USD 2408 thousand) clusters after Seoul and Gyeonggi-do. In Daegu, research institutes and universities were the second biggest funders in the Clinical information (USD 11,485 thousand) and Therapies (USD 12,848 thousand) clusters. Industry was ranked as the second biggest funder in the Clinical information (USD 7275 thousand) cluster in Busan, whereas universities played an important role in the Cohort (USD 20,186 thousand) and Clinical information (USD 15,632 thousand) clusters in Ulsan.

First, we presented an investment and collaboration framework that provides information on the status and trends of government R&D investments in the technology sector in the target area. Based on previous studies [27, 28] , data on national research projects, project period, and funding were used. Thus, this information enables the PM's R&D managers to form strategic collaborations while considering the limited resources, lack of knowledge, and uncertainty about the market in the early PM industry.",

It provided a comparative analysis of investment levels in government-funded research projects related to PM for each region and other technology clusters in South Korea during 2015-2020 and described various R&D institutions in each cluster and region. By explicitly presenting innovation capabilities in eight distinct technology areas across 17 regions, it not only showed regional differences in individual areas but also proposed a list of organizations of PM services such as cancer, brain diseases, and chronic diseases by region. Seoul has the highest technological prowess compared to other regions, and some regions have superior competencies in specific technological areas, such as Daegu's clinical information, Gangwon-do's service, and Ulsan's cohort.

The proposed framework contributed to tackling the gap between theories and practices throughout, providing information that has salience, credibility, and legitimacy [23, 24] .

Only the data of public R&D projects from the central government were utilized; due to the absence of a database for the R&D expenditures of the 17 local governments, it is currently impossible to integrate the local government-funded project dataset. Thus, it will be necessary to use the proposed framework to accurately understand the status and trends of PM-related technologies when the local government-funded project dataset was developed and assessed by the public. Despite these restrictions, if a consensus on data openness is formed in 18 local governments in the future and a data-sharing plan is prepared, an analysis of detailed R&D perspectives between the central and local governments based on integrated data can be expected. Another limitation was the lack of funding data from other countries, such as the US, EU, and Japan, which could be employed to conduct a comparative analysis for an international research collaboration network among the technology segments, working toward a successful implementation of PM.

Seoul in particular received the highest investment in all technology clusters (Omics: USD 158.1 million, Smart-health: USD 122.4 million, Cohort: USD 104.3 million, Clinical information: USD 72.5 million, Drugs: USD 50.4 million, Prediction: USD 44.3 million, Therapies: USD 51.3 million, and Services: USD 30.9 million). Compared to Daejeon, Gyeonggi-do had a comparative advantage in the Omics (USD 60.3 million), Smart-health (USD 52.4 million), Drugs (USD 20.9 million), and Services (USD 17.3 million) clusters. Meanwhile, Daejeon received more government R&D funding than did Gyeonggi-do in the Clinical information (USD 45.8 million) cluster. Gyeonggi-do and Daejeon received similar investments in the Cohort (USD 27.7 million and USD 25.7 million, respectively) and Prediction (USD 15.1 million and USD 10.7 million, respectively) clusters. However, some regions showed relative advantages or potential for growth in specific technological domains. For example, Chungcheongbuk-do acquired relative competitive edges in the Omics and Cohort clusters with USD 46.4 million and USD 38.2 million of investment, respectively. For the Clinical information cluster, Daegu and Ulsan conducted USD 22.5 million and USD 15.6 million worth of R&D, respectively. In the Therapies cluster, Daegu received the second-highest government funding of USD 13.0 million, followed by Seoul (USD 51.3 million).
