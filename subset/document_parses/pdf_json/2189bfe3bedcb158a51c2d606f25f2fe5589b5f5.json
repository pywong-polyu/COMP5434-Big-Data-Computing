Coronaviruses use a complex strategy to express their genetic information [5, 6] , involving a process of discontinuous transcription during minus-strand RNA synthesis that is regulated by defined transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) [7] .

The S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein comprised of two domains, S1 and S2, responsible for receptor binding and the fusion of viral and cellular membranes respectively [18, 19] . The S glycoprotein of coronaviruses is primed for cell entry by host cell proteases that cleave the protein at one or more positions. Cleavage of a \"S1/ S2\" site at the boundary of the S1 and S2 domains occurs for some coronaviruses whilst cleavage at an \"S2\" site is common to all coronaviruses and results in activation of a highly conserved fusion peptide immediately downstream of the S2 site [20] [21] [22] . Although the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein shares 97% identity with that of bat coronavirus RaTG13 [4] , an important difference is the presence of a four amino acid insertion ( 681 PRRA 684 ) at the S1/S2 junction that introduces a potential furinlike cleavage site [23, 24] .

The genome is itself an mRNA which when translated gives rise to polyproteins pp1a and, upon a ribosomal frameshift, pp1ab. These polyproteins are proteolytically processed down to a range of non-structural proteins termed nsp1-16, some of which will form the viral replication-transcription complex (RTC). The RTC then generates subgenomic mRNA which canonically contains a sequence present at the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome known as the leader sequence. The 3\u2032-end of the leader sequence has a motif, the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), and there are similar sequences which precede each of the functional ORFs downstream of the replicase gene (pp1ab). This TRS in the leader associates with one of the TRS regions present adjacent to each of the other functional ORFS and this mediates discontinuous transcription between the two during minus-strand RNA synthesis. These minus-strand RNA molecules are used as templates to generate positive sense mRNA, and in this manner, the remaining ORFs on the viral genome are placed 5\u2032 most on the resulting subgenomic mRNAs and are subsequently translated.

In Fig. 1c , only the dominant transcript for each ORF is shown; thus, there may be transcripts with structural differences that code for the same ORF but this figure illustrates the structure of the dominant transcript only. This approach was used by us previously to successfully recapitulate the highly complex adenovirus transcriptome de novo [15] . Transcripts that could express all of the predicted ORFs were present, including for the newly predicted ORF10 [3] . However, only one ORF10 transcript was detected, and as previously suggested [9, 10] , the status of this as a functional mRNA needs further investigation. Moreover, non-canonical TRS joining events were detected leading to, for example, apparently bone fide subgenomic transcripts coding for ORF7b, as was also recently reported by Kim et al. [10] . Accurate mapping of the junction between the canonical leader and body TRS sequences is problematic as the two sequences are effectively repeated in the viral genome. Mapping algorithms cannot confidently determine a junction breakpoint within repetitive sequences like the TRS sequences, and this is further confounded by the error prone nature of dRNAseq. The full range of identified transcripts (and their structure) that could code for any given ORF is, however, compiled by the pipeline (Additional file 4: Table S3 ). Moreover, identification and assignment of individual transcripts by our ORF-centric pipeline is not affected by this as it classifies transcripts by 5\u2032 most ORF. Detailed information on the transcripts with a 5\u2032 UTR consistent with the model of coronavirus mRNA expression that would also code for a predicted protein are shown in Table 1 . Also reported are the average polyA tail lengths of each transcript group.

The coronavirus S glycoprotein is made as a larger precursor that must be primed by cleavage using host cell proteases to enable subsequent viral entry [40] . For different coronaviruses, cleavage can occur at one or more sites (termed the S1/S2 and S2\u2032 sites) depending on the host cell and the amino acid consensus sequences present at each site, with major repercussions on host cell tropism and pathogenesis [20] . The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein has a single arginine residue at the S1/S2 site (Fig. 2b ) that facilitates cleavage by a number of proteases including trypsin, cathepsin L and TMPRSS11D [41] [42] [43] and a consensus sequence for trypsin and/or elastin cleavage at the S2\u2032 site [21, 44] . By comparison, SARS-CoV-2 has a four amino acid insertion ( 680 SPRR 683 ) in the S glycoprotein that results in the generation of a furin-like cleavage site ( 682 RRAR 685 ) at the S1/S2 boundary that is not present in other lineage B betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and the highly related bat coronavirus RaTG13 [23] . Moreover, analysis of a cryo-EM structure of the S glycoprotein showed that the SPRR insertion creates a disordered solvent exposed loop [24] that protrudes from the trimer surface (Fig. 3a) . It has been proposed that this region is more available to host cell proteases for processing [24] . The presence of a furinlike cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary results in cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein before viral exit from the cell, whereas the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, lacking a S1/S2 furin cleavage site, exit the cells with the S glycoprotein largely uncleaved, necessitating cleavage prior to or during cell entry [21, 38, 45] . The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein deletion identified in this study removes the furin cleavage site, but also Arg 685 (corresponding to SARS-CoV Arg 667 ) required for cleavage of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. However, the sequence 694 AYT/M 697 (numbering of undeleted S glycoprotein, cleavage shown by \"/\"; Fig. 2b ) is still retained and has been identified as a second potential S1/S2 protease cleavage site for SARS-CoV downstream of the basic Arg 667 residue [23, 42] suggesting that either For each location, we indicate the amino acids (S, T or Y) and the amino acid numbering. The S glycoprotein is shown as S1 and S2 to illustrate where the sites would be relative to the major cleavage site on the wild type S glycoprotein the deleted SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein could be cleaved at this site or only use the S2\u2032 site for cleavage. Recently, pseudoviruses expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein and the corresponding S glycoprotein with the furin cleavage site removed at the S1/S2 boundary (residues 680 SPRR 683 removed) were made and their ability to mediate entry to Vero E6 and BHK-21 cells expressing hACE2 compared [38] . Deletion of the furin cleavage site enhanced the entry of the corresponding pseudovirus into Vero E6 cells but diminished entry into hACE2 BHK-21 cells. Although the engineered deletion differed from the naturally occurring deletion described here, this observation suggests that the naturally occurring deletion (in cell culture) enhances the ability of the virus to enter Vero cells and was selected for during passage in Vero E6 cells, a cell line that lacks a working type I interferon response. This has clear implications for the use of Vero cells to propagate and grow large batches of the virus for research and especially virus batches grown for use in vaccine challenge studies. Moreover, it also raises the possibility that even virus stocks which have been carefully assayed for homogeneity could still spontaneously generate this deletion during animal challenge studies-particularly in non-human primates and perhaps especially in animals from the Chlorocebus genus. Thus, vaccine studies will need to carefully monitor the homogeneity of the challenge virus throughout the study period. Indeed, the functional impact of this kind of deletion is already beginning to emerge from recent preprint data. For example, viruses carrying the deletion in the S glycoprotein reported in this study may well be attenuated in vivo in NHPs as this type of furin deletion virus has been shown to exhibit reduced pathogenicity in a hamster disease model [46] . The early emergence of a viral population carrying a deletion in the S glycoprotein that removes the furin cleavage site within an individual challenge animal could give the false impression that an individual animal had a mild infection. Given that animal studies are required to use the smallest number of animals needed for statistical significance, just one such event could confound the study. Since our initial findings were reported by pre-print archive, other teams have detected deletions in the S glycoprotein that remove the furin cleavage site at low levels alongside wild type S glycoprotein sequences in clinical samples [47] . Other teams have also reported the emergence of this type of deletion and other mutations at this location in independent cell culture based experiments [48] . This independent cell culture passage analysis concluded that viruses containing deletions in the S glycoprotein, that removed the furin cleavage site, result in a large plaque phenotype in Vero E6 cells and that this mutation is strongly and frequently selected for in Vero E6 cells. These observations raise the potential that in vivo, there are a subset of host cells where the deletion variant has a selectable advantage over the wild type. However, it is important to note that even where these types of deletions have been reported in clinical samples, they do not appear to dominate in vivo as there is still relatively little global variation reported in viral genomes including the S glycoprotein at this time [49] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 417, "end": 421, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 677, "end": 681, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 867, "end": 871, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 872, "end": 876, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 877, "end": 881, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 959, "end": 963, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 964, "end": 967, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1294, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1438, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1588, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1951, "end": 1955, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1956, "end": 1959, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1960, "end": 1963, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2426, "end": 2430, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2431, "end": 2434, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3094, "end": 3098, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 4555, "end": 4559, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 5197, "end": 5201, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 5357, "end": 5361, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 6083, "end": 6087, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 760, "end": 768, "text": "(Fig. 2b", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1478, "end": 1487, "text": "(Fig. 3a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2270, "end": 2277, "text": "Fig. 2b", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In addition to the S glycoprotein deletion, we were also able to find an additional significant deletion, in highquality data recently deposited by Kim et al.

This finding reinforces the potential of the virus to incur unexpected spontaneous deletions in viral genes during passaging that are hard to predict and detect. A recent analysis showed that deletion of ORF8 from human clinical isolates is possible [51] and our data shows that novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses containing deletions or even insertions can arise naturally and successfully propagate. As the virus continues to spread and potentially comes under selective pressure from the host response in humans, vaccines and antiviral drugs in the future, vigilance will be required to detect novel rearrangements/deletions. Coronaviruses use a distinctive complex mechanism for genome replication that needs to be considered during bioinformatic analysis of their genomes relative to viruses causing other epidemics and pandemics where the principle driver of viral change would be single nucleotide polymorphisms and/or small (< 3 nt) insertions/deletions.

The phosphorylation of the N protein of multiple coronaviruses is well known [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] , and the phosphorylation sites identified lie in either the N-terminal RNA-binding domain or interdomain linker [58] . Mapping of the phosphorylation sites on an x-ray structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal RNAbinding domain showed they were surface located (Fig. 5) . However, we believe this is the first report providing evidence of phosphorylation of the coronavirus proteins M, nsp3 and S. These are all membrane bound proteins. M protein is critical in forming the viral particle, nsp3 is a key multifunctional component of the replication/transcription machinery and S protein is the major attachment protein respectively [59] . The phosphorylation sites identified on the S glycoprotein may be important in assembly of the trimer. Residues T29, S31, S349, T791 and S816 are all surface located, whilst T240 sits underneath a disordered loop which when phosphorylated will add negative charge which may influence loop conformation. Residues Y789 and (perhaps to a lesser extent) T791 sit at the subunit interface and may be involved in controlling trimer assembly. S637 and S640 lie in a modelled loop but are nevertheless potentially interesting. They are close together in sequence and in the loops modelled for the compact folds these model well as hairpins. In the chain with the extended domain, the same loop models in an extended form. This would be consistent with phosphorylation at S637 and S640 forcing the hairpin apart. Thus, these amino acids are worth exploring as potential control points for spike conformational changes from compact to an extended form. Overall, the identification of protein phosphorylation sites is notable but some caveats are needed here and of course the status and functional significance of these sites will take considerable time to independently validate and investigate by point mutation and/or biochemical techniques.
