Digital surveillance using data available online has increasingly become a trend with the advancement of the Internet. In this study, we assessed the predictive value of multiple online medical behavioral data, including online medical consultation (OMC), online medical appointment (OMA), and online medical search (OMS) for the regional outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in Shenzhen, China during January 1, 2020 to March 5, 2020. Multivariate vector autoregression models were used for the prediction. The results identified a novel predictor, OMC, which can forecast the disease trend up to 2 days ahead of the official reports of confirmed cases from the local health department. OMS data had relatively weaker predictive power than OMC in our model, and OMA data failed to predict the confirmed cases. This study highlights the importance of OMC data and has implication in providing evidence-based guidelines for local authorities to evaluate risks and allocate resources during the pandemic.",

            "text": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has reemphasized the importance of the application of telemedicine worldwide because of the social distancing policies and shortage of medical resources. Hospital infections have been a wide concern for patients during the pandemic, as an investigation of 138 early confirmed cases found that nearly 41% of these cases might be related to hospital visits (Wang, Hu, Hu et al., 2020) . Online healthcare services have become alternative choices to offline medical visits because of safety concerns during the pandemic and the perceived convenience of their usage. Online medical services allow people to access healthcare services remotely using digital information and telecommunication technologies (e.g., computers, mobile devices, interactive television) (Koch, 2006) . The usage of online medical services during the pandemic has boosted because people are seeking for health information, syndrome diagnosis, and medical advices (Gong, Xu, Cai et al., 2020) In addition to the benefits of serving patients with online medical services, the wide availability of online medical services has provided potentials for the digital monitoring of the epidemic. Public health professionals and epidemiologists have made great efforts to predict the trend of an epidemic using traditional laboratory, clinical, and epidemiological data. Nowadays, the popularity of using online medical services also enables scholars to use online medical behavioral data for epidemic counseling and surveillance between diagnosed cases and search query or social media data is apparently indirect, and the mechanism remains unclear. Comparatively, the rapidly growing online medical services, such as online medical consultation (OMC) and appointments (OMA), tend to provide more directly correlated data for pandemic prediction. Moreover, existing studies have often relied on a single source of data for prediction (Husnayain, Fuad, & Su, 2020; Huang, Luo, Duan et al., 2020) and few studies have compared the predicative power of different sources (Santillana, Nguyen, Dredze et al., 2015) for disease surveillance to identify the most effective and efficient approach for disease prediction. This study thus aims to focusing on investigating the online medical behavioral data for prediction and comparing the predicative power of varied online medical behaviors for pandemic surveillance.",

The increasing usage of online medical services acts as one of the non-pharmaceutical interventions of COVID-19, which is conducive to the early identification and isolation of cases. Meanwhile, the digital footprints of online medical behavioral data generated by individuals raise the possibility of monitoring and tracing EIDs in the future. However, seldom research has examined the relationship between OMC and the transmission of EIDs largely because of the relatively low penetration rate of OMC and the lack of relevant and accessible data. The social distancing policies during the pandemic has made OMC more widely and actively adopted by users. During the epidemic, people who had used the OMC services of hospitals under the supervision of the National Health Commission increased 17 times compared with the same period last year. The volume of OMC on some third-party Internet service platforms has increased by more than 20 times during the same period (Wang, 2020) . Thus, this study aimed to explore the possibility of applying the data of OMS, OMA, and OMC for the surveillance and monitoring of EIDs using vector autoregression (VAR) analysis method to model the identification of the newly confirmed cases of COVID-19.",

The association between OMC and the spread of EIDs is likely to be stronger compared with OMS and OMA during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, OMS is a general behavior for information need. Seeking behaviors may be motivated by curiosity or fear and anxiety. The results and health information found through OMS are not personalized to solve patient-specific symptoms. Therefore, its association with pandemic prevalence can be largely contaminated by the \"noise\" of searching behaviors. Second, OMA is a pre-process for offline medical visit. However, OMA is restricted by the limited provision of medical services and the patients' worries of being cross-infected through offline medical visits during the pandemic. Third, OMC is a more personalized and relevant behavior for medical advice, because people with symptoms are likely turn to OMC to search for help and receive personalized medical advices. Thus, our study focused on the predicting capability of these online medical behavior signals in the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, we raised some research questions as follows:",

As a complement to the Granger causality test and IRF analysis, FEVD allowed us to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables with percentage terms in explaining the innovation to the dependent variables over time. The shock of a variable contributed the most fraction of the overall forecast on itself (see Table C in Appendix). Fig. 5 presents the result of variance decomposition with respect to NCC. Initially, almost all variations (100% and 99.55%) for the first two days in NCC were explained by its own shock and followed by OMC with 22.99% on the third day, along with other two variables' shocks were negligible. OMC explained 43.11% of the variation in NCC and became the most important variable in the system by the 10th day, if NCC own innovation is excluded (50.73%). By the end of 10 days, only 5.95% of the variations in NCC were explained by OMS. This finding further confirmed that OMS has less important shock on NCC.

Second, in terms of time-windows, we looked into labeled \"time effect\" with a longer or shorter period of observation than a 65-day timeframe based on the benchmark model. Furthermore, compared with aggregate data, OMA data retrieved from respiratory department, fever clinic and infection department were used to be the variable of OMA respectively. Finally, in the aspect of OMS, the Baidu Index data based on multiple keywords were recalculated at daily level with their quartile 1 (Q1), median (Q2), quartile 3 (Q3) and maximum values. As shown in Table 4 , additionally, OMC data were retrieved from the same platform within the corresponding period in year of 2018 and 2019, as well as the same length (i.e., 65 days) of period before pandemic at the end of 2019. For different lengths of lag from lag-1 to lag-6, the NCC did not Granger caused by those extra OMC datasets (i.e., OMC_18, OMC_19a and OMC_19b in Table 4 ), which did not contain the COVID-19 for Shenzhen city. By contrast with OMC_20b in benchmark model, OMC_20a data were retrieved excluding symptom keywords we used indicated that it did not Granger cause NCC for lag 1 to 6.

In line with the digital surveillance studies using other data sources, this study used the digital footprints of online medical behaviors to forecast the newly confirmed infectious cases. Different from other studies mainly using web queries and social media contents (Li, Xu, Cuomo et al., 2020; Li, Chen, Chen et al., 2020; Shen, Chen, Luo et al., 2020) , this research emphasizes the usage of online users' medical behaviors. As other studies addressed, the dynamics of \"information spread\" are inherently different from the dynamics of disease spread (Salath\u00e9, Freifeld, Mekaru et al., 2013) . Both web queries and user-generated social media contents are representations of information spread, but the online medical behaviors data indicates the behavioral trend, which can be closely connected with the spread of infectious diseases. With the rapid development of digital medicalization, people may turn to the Internet for help first before paying an offline visit to doctors, when the diseases start transmitting. Therefore, it is highly likely that using online medical data can capture the trend of pandemics earlier than other surveillance system. This study found that OMC and OMS were the Granger causes of confirmed cases during the outbreak of COVID-19, whereas OMA was not. The predictive power of OMS was not surprising, as it is in line with the Google Flu studies (Dugas, Jalalpour, Gel et al., 2013; Martin, Lee, Yasui, 2016) and other Baidu search index studies (He, Chen, Chen et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020) . However, the predictive value of OMS in this study was lower than that of OMCan underexplored online medical behavior. OMC is a rapidly expanding service that bridges the communication between patients and physicians during the social distancing period. OMC displays more accurate information of health situations among citizens compared with OMS, as OMC users often have specific medical appeals or syndromes. OMA failed to predict the trends of COVID-19 in this study. Apparently, one reason is that people are worried of being cross-infected and reluctant to visit hospitals in-person during the pandemic. Another reason for the decrease in the number of hospital visits is the SFV and travel restrictions. In addition, a non-Granger causality exists between OMC and OMA. This result indicates that the trends of online consultation and in-person doctor visits were exclusive in the short term and people who chose to consult online tend not to go to the hospital at least without using online appointment, vice versa. But, presumably, the shrink of OMA might due to patients sought medical care directly at hospitals rather than making online appointments at first. For example, as specialist clinics that affiliated with the emergency departments, online appointment to fever clinics may not be easily and immediately accessed to from a commercial medical platform, and this is evident from the amount (only 3059) of OMA at fever clinic. The results also showed that the future trend of OMA to the hospital was captured by OMS instead of OMC. This finding implies that perhaps those who sought medical help via search engine also turned to offline medical consultation.",

We investigated the dynamic consequences of shocks on the future behavior of NCC. The impulse responses to the \"own shock\" of NCC appeared instantaneous on the 1st and 2nd days. The relationship between NCC and OMC and between NCC and OMS was statistically substantial in the subsequent periods. And they both provided a short-term prediction about two days in advance. However, their impacts tended to disappear progressively. The size of the relationship between explanatory variables and independent variable was also studied. FEVD analysis revealed that OMC behaviors played the most important role in predicting the future trends of pandemic by explaining nearly half of the variation in NCC, except NCC itself, followed by OMS. The effect of OMA was minimal and explained less than 1% of the innovation in NCC. The conclusions drawn from the Granger causality test and IRF analysis were further verified.",

This study can call for the integration of disruptive online medical consultation data into the surveillance system. Different countries may consider the possibility and feasibility of such integration depending on their existing medical systems. Nevertheless, online medical behavioral data is also closely related to patient data privacy, and it is never too much to be cautious when using these data, even if it is used for public health surveillance and social good (Bari & O'Neill, 2019) . The present study accessed the aggregated and de-identified data to predict the NCC of COVID-19. More discussions are needed to examine how to strike a balance between protecting the patients' privacy and using online medical behavioral records for public good.",

Compared with the best-known approaches based on search engines, OMC is more directly related to disease management but has been neglected before. This study hopes to bring scholarly and health professional attention to such data and its potential of predicting EIDs. Online consultation data should be considered an important digital surveillance channel supplementary to the traditional surveillance system. Second, this study provides a solid methodology to examine the predictive power of online medical behavioral data. Many studies were concerned on digital surveillance based on single data type instead of validating two or more indicators against each other, and neglected the importance of integration of disparate sources of data (Bansal et al., 2016) . This study proposes the necessity to investigate the interdependent relationship between competitive variables in the dynamic system. A VAR model for multivariate analysis was performed in this study to explore the dynamic relationship between the different variables of interest and test the hypothesis of (non-)Granger causality, impulse response processes, and their FEVD. In addition, developing a flexible VAR model focusing on a certain target variable at different lag lengths is suitable for a data-driven exploratory research for epidemiology information in the absence of sufficient theoretical models. Taking the \"counterfactual\" data, time-windows and statistical methods into account, we still observed the similar predictive power of OMC on COVID-19 trend; hence, our findings were robust against alternative models.",

First, similar to other existing studies that relied on web-based data and query data based on keywords, choosing the appropriate combination of keywords is challenging. This study adopted the terms of symptoms of COVID-19, such as \"fever,\" \"cough\" and \"fatigue\" instead of direct \"novel coronavirus\" or \"novel coronavirus pneumonia\" , to avoid the errors of overfitting caused by self-correction in keyword selection (Cook et al., 2011; Lazer et al., 2014) , because the strong link between search queries and NCC might result from the fear and panic during pandemic. However, keywords selection and filtering methods based on different inclusion criteria and correlation analysis (Yuan et al., 2013; Santillana, Zhang, Althouse, et al., 2014) can be considered in the future. Second, although COVID-19 cases were categorized as confirmed, suspected, clinically diagnosed, and asymptomatic in China, NCC only included confirmed cases. Symptoms and exposures are related to suspected cases and clinically diagnosed patients, whereas asymptomatic cases are those whose viral nucleic acid test results turned positive but without any symptoms (NCPERE Team, 2020). We may omit asymptomatic cases in the prediction by using symptoms terms to retrieve data. Thus, the bias in the predictor model might be caused by the self-reported symptoms of suspected and clinically diagnosed cases (Shen et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020) and the absence of a small number of asymptomatic cases. However, the estimated parameters of our model reflected the trends and changes in confirmed cases rather than the actual numbers; thus, OMC might be a good predictor of a potential outbreak of COVID-19 but not a definitive factor for case counts.",

In addition, collecting adequate data on nationwide platforms is challenging, as few platforms provide OMC and OMA services at the same time. Meanwhile, other local platforms lack sufficient conditions, such as infrastructures of medical networks and broad usage of mobile devices, to take full advantage of online medical platforms.
