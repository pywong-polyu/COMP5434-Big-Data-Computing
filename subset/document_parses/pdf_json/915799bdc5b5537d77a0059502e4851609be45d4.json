Presented in Table 5 is the multivariable logistic regression model of moderate to severe anxiety (a GAD-7 score of 10 or greater). Initially entered into the regression model were variables by which the GAD-7 score differed in univariate analysis, and included age, sex, the language in which the questionnaire was completed (English vs. any other language), change in diet pattern (diet healthier prior to COVID-19 yes/no), smoking status (current smoker yes/no), employment status (unemployed yes/no), minutes per week of physical activity during the pandemic, and MedDiet score. The final model was arrived at using a backward, stepwise approach. Physical activity and current smoking status were not included in the final model. The model was significant, and correctly classified 74.4% of study participants for moderate or more severe anxiety. As can be seen, women were more than twice as likely as men to experience moderate to severe anxiety. Individuals who completed the survey in English were more than four times as likely to have moderate to severe anxiety. Unemployment increased the odds of moderate to severe anxiety by 36%. People who reported that their current diets were less healthy than their diets prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had a 70% increase in odds of moderate to severe anxiety. On the other hand, each 1-point increase in the MedDiet score reduced the risk of moderate to severe anxiety by a relative 7.2% (4-11%). Age also significantly reduced the risk of moderate to severe anxiety. quality did not differ by sex and was inversely associated with anxiety in both women and men. Despite a lack of by-sex differences in overall diet quality as measured by the MedDiet score, some individual score components did differ by sex, and their associations with anxiety also often differed by sex. The examination of score components in addition to total score deserves further research. If a similar median score misses underlying differences in dietary intake patterns, then components of diet quality scores should be examined when comparing between groups. These dissimilarities may explain some of the variability in between-group morbidity and mortality observed between women and men. In the future, by-sex differences should be considered when assessing diet-disease association, and overall scores should be decomposed to components. Further, the findings of the present study suggest that preventive and wellness public health campaigns during health-related events such as pandemics should be sex-specific. The increase in anxiety and deterioration of diet during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic in women implies a need to address these issues for women in particular. ",

For example, women reported consuming significantly more daily servings of vegetables than men, a finding consistent with reports in the US [25] . Daily servings of vegetables were weakly but significantly inversely associated with anxiety in women, but not in men. In the present survey, women reported using olive oil as their primary culinary oil significantly more frequently than men. This finding diverges from a report of the Spanish participants in the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer (EPIC) cohort, in which women consumed less olive oil than men [26] . Nevertheless, consuming olive oil was inversely associated with anxiety in women, but not in men. On the other hand, women also reported consuming significantly more weekly servings of sweet baked goods than men. While this finding fits well with the concept of emotional eating, whereby individuals overconsume unhealthy foods such as sweets in response to negative emotions such as anxiety [27] , an association between the number of weekly servings of sweet baked goods and the GAD-7 score was not observed in the present survey in women or men. Men reported consuming significantly more sweetened/carbonated drinks than women. In both women and men, consumption of sweetened/carbonated drinks was positively associated with anxiety, and the strength of the association did not differ by sex. This association was also observed regarding red/processed meat intake. Men reported consuming more weekly servings of these foods, but red/processed meat intake was positively associated with anxiety in both women and men; a significant by-sex difference in the strength of this association was not detected. Though men reported consuming more alcohol, a positive association between alcohol consumption and anxiety was observed only in women, and a significant difference in the strength of this association by sex was observed. Compared to women, men reported consuming more weekly servings of legumes; however, no association between legume intake and anxiety was observed in men, and a positive association was detected in women. Weekly servings of hummus/tahini were inversely associated with anxiety in both women and men, with no between-sex difference in the strength of the association, though men reported higher intake. Women and men did not differ in their reported intake of weekly savory baked goods or salty snacks. Consumption of these foods was more strongly associated with anxiety than other items in the MedDiet score. Interestingly, a food intake report during COVID-19 lockdowns indicates that almost a quarter of Italian respondents increased their intake of salty snacks during the pandemic [28] .",

This rate is considerably higher than the prevalence of any anxiety in the general population, which is estimated to be 1.9-5.1% [21] . In a study of sleep quality and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, 80% of women vs. 50% of men reported increased general anxiety, and women had significantly greater anxiety scores; however, these differences did not translate into differences in sleep quality [30] . Consistent with this, women reported more clinical symptoms than men in an Australian study of anxiety and depression during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic [31] . In our model of moderate to severe anxiety, female sex more than doubled the odds of this endpoint. Additionally, every one-point increase in the MedDiet score was associated with a 7% decrease in the odds of moderate to severe anxiety, and participants who reported that their pre-pandemic diets were healthier than their current diets had a 74% increase in odds of moderate to severe anxiety. These finding are consistent with those of a study of associations between anxiety and dietary habits conducted in Latin America during COVID. In that study, \"dysfunctional\" food intake was associated with increased anxiety, and women reported greater disruption to their dietary patterns including more emotional eating [32] .",

Anxiety has been shown to differ across cultures [37] , and the by-language differences in anxiety could reflect true crosscultural differences. Alternatively, the by-language differences in anxiety could represent differences in the severity of the pandemic and/or public health messaging in locations where surveys were answered in English. Individuals who responded in English had a median (IQR) age of 29 (11) years compared to 32 (21) years in those who completed the survey in other languages, and age was inversely associated with anxiety.",

The data are cross-sectional, so the causality of associations between sex, diet quality, and anxiety cannot be ascertained.

Further, the sampling method was a convenience sample, bringing into question the external validity of the findings. Participation was predicated on using social media. Participant characteristics, including relatively young age, largely female, and highly educated, suggest that the study sample is different from the general world population in many respects. Nevertheless, the present survey presents findings of a very large, multi-national group of respondents during the rapid contagion period and lockdowns of the early COVID-19 pandemic.",

Diet quality did not differ by sex and was inversely associated with anxiety in both women and men. Despite a lack of by-sex differences in overall diet quality as measured by the MedDiet score, some individual score components did differ by sex, and their associations with anxiety also often differed by sex. The examination of score components in addition to total score deserves further research. If a similar median score misses underlying differences in dietary intake patterns, then components of diet quality scores should be examined when comparing between groups. These dissimilarities may explain some of the variability in between-group morbidity and mortality observed between women and men. In the future, by-sex differences should be considered when assessing diet-disease association, and overall scores should be decomposed to components. Further, the findings of the present study suggest that preventive and wellness public health campaigns during health-related events such as pandemics should be sex-specific. The increase in anxiety and deterioration of diet during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic in women implies a need to address these issues for women in particular.",
