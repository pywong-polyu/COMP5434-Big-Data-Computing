Cox proportional hazard models and logistic regression models were used to assess the risk of death.

The subsequent muscle damage induced by the exaggerated inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients is associated with significant strength deficit both of the upper and the lower limbs, a phenomenon even more relevant in people with obesity, leading to worse clinical outcomes, as higher mortality and longer hospitalization. Some limitations should be acknowledged. First, muscle density is related to, but not a precise measure of intramuscular fat content (Hausman et al., 2014) . Secondly, inflammatory cytokines levels, such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha were not available for the whole study population, and further insight into the relationship between systemic inflammation and muscle local consequences was not possible. Lastly, this is a cross-sectional study and further longitudinal imaging and/or histological studies are needed to better clarify the impact of COVID-19 induced inflammation on muscle damage in hospitalized subjects and the possible role of different muscle fat depots.",
