Uncertainty, insecurity, instability for the present and future, and reduced autonomy and self-directedness, are common feelings at the time of COVID-19. These aspects are very important during emerging adulthood. In spite of the fact that medical reports suggest that youth are less prone to experience COVID-19 infections, emerging adults might be at higher risk for their psychological adjustment. Emerging adults showed higher concerns about their role as a possible asymptomatic carrier than being positive with COVID-19 themselves. Both worries and concerns about COVID-19 and psychological maladjustment may be related to cultural factors. Individualism, collectivism, equality, and hierarchy seem to be meaningful perspectives to take into account. A total of 1183 Italian emerging adults were asked to fill out an online survey during the second week of the national lockdown in Italy. Results showed they reported an accurate perceived knowledge about COVID-19. At the same time, they showed higher worries and concerns about COVID-19 for their relatives, followed by more general/social worries. The lowest score included worries about COVID-19 related to themselves. State anxiety and stress levels were above the normal cutoff, confirming the challenges that emerging adults are facing during the pandemic. On one hand, emerging adults' collectivistic orientation was related to higher perceived risks of infection; on the other hand, it predicted lower psychological maladjustment, controlling for socio-demographic variables. The study suggests that to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and decrease levels of psychological maladjustment in emerging adulthood, individuals' cultural orientation such as the wish of sharing common goals with others, interdependence, and sociability, have to be emphasized and promoted as protective factors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] was declared a global pandemic on 11 March by the World Health Organization.

Research suggests that the regional prevalence of pathogens worldwide has a strong positive correlation with cultural indicators of C and a strong negative correlation with I [23] . According to the authors, countries that have a higher infectious disease prevalence (i.e., pathogen risk) tend to endorse more collectivistic attitudes because, for instance, collectivistic cultures are warier of contact with foreigners and other out-group members and this attitude can serve as an effective antipathogen function by inhibiting exposure to novel pathogens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 154, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 155, "end": 158, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 248, "end": 252, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 342, "end": 346, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 347, "end": 351, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 352, "end": 356, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 357, "end": 361, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 520, "end": 524, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 702, "end": 706, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Individuals' Cultural Factors and Response to COVID-19 and National Lockdown"}, {"text": "Even though Italy is considered an individualistic country, the sense of relatedness and family connectedness is strong, and many emerging adults live with their parents or are used to meeting with them often [31] .

Individualistic people think of the self as stable and the environment as changeable, whereas collectivistic people think of the social environment as stable (duties, obligations) and the self as changeable (ready to fit into the environment).

On one hand, individuals with strong collectivistic orientation reported greater perceived vulnerability than individualistic ones, because they may feel both higher distinction between in-groups and out-groups, and higher interconnection (physical and mental) with others. This may increase fear and worries of being infected from others, such as foreigners (out-group) or something unknown like a novel virus, as well as from family members, friends, and co-workers (in-group) due to close relationships. The latter aspect also applies to the fear and worries of infecting others [17, 24] . Moreover, people with high collectivistic orientation are characterized by conscientious personality traits and feel a strong sense of responsibility towards others and their community [26] [27] [28] 33, 37] . A recent study found that higher scores in conscientiousness were associated with higher social distancing and handwashing [38] . Therefore, collectivistic orientation may increase their need to be aware and informed about the pandemic and the engagement in recommended COVID-19 containment measures. On the other hand, the sense of belongingness and social connection may serve as a buffer against risks and psychological maladjustment in terms of anxiety, stress, and emotional and behavioral difficulties. It may even be protective when facing an emergency because people feel like a community and that their country can protect them [24] . Therefore, although collectivistic people can perceive more risks than individualistic ones in the face of an observed risk, they tend to have a higher sense of efficacy than individualistic ones, meaning that their group will work together and act to protect themselves and those protective processes are coordinated [24] . In addition, regardless of worries about infection risks, the threat of isolation may be best countered by people who feel a sense of belonging and connection with others [33, 39, 40] . It is important to note that what has been said about the role of I and C is also true for the sense of family connectedness and related habits. Where family connectedness is strong, speed of infection may be faster and worries about infection risks may be higher than other countries. At the same time, it may have a positive role on respecting lockdown rules and a protective effect toward social isolation, considering its relationship with psychological maladjustment [41, 42] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 762, "end": 766, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 767, "end": 770, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 958, "end": 962, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 963, "end": 967, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 968, "end": 972, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 973, "end": 976, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 977, "end": 980, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1110, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1620, "end": 1624, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1945, "end": 1949, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2123, "end": 2127, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2131, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2135, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2610, "end": 2614, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2615, "end": 2618, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Individuals' Cultural Factors and Response to COVID-19 and National Lockdown"}, {"text": "Considering the peculiar impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emerging adults, particularly in the Italian context because of the national lockdown, this study was aimed to evaluate: (a) emerging adults' perceived knowledge and worries and concerns about COVID-19; (b) their psychological maladjustment in terms of emotional and behavioral difficulties, state anxiety, and stress during the lockdown with the assumption that due to COVID-19 they reported higher difficulties than normative samples; (c) the association between perceived knowledge and worries and concerns about COVID-19, and psychological maladjustment, assuming that they were positively associated; (d) the relationships between cultural orientations at the individual level and the aforementioned aspects.

Correlations between measures of perceived knowledge, worries and concerns about COVID-19, emotional and behavioral difficulties, state anxiety, perceived stress, and cultural orientations at the individual level were carried out using Spearman rank correlations. Due to multiple correlations, a p-value was considered significant for p < 0.001. Effect size was interpreted according to Cohen [53] and Gignac and Szodorai [54] . Significant correlations with coefficients lower than |0.10| were not interpreted because they were considered negligible. A composite score (CS) of psychological maladjustment was calculated as the mean of the standardized scores of the SDQ Total Score, STAI State, and PSS Total Score, which were significantly and positively correlated to each other with a large effect size (r > 0.50). In order to assess the reliability of the items comprising the CS in assessing psychological maladjustment in our sample, Cronbach's alpha was calculated; it was 0.94. By convention, an alpha of 0.65-0.80 is often considered \"adequate\" for a scale used in human dimensions research [55] . The CS was the outcome variable of a hierarchical multiple regression model. It was run by inserting socio-demographic variables first. These variables were: gender (male vs. females), employment situation (students vs. workers), living situation (in the family, in a shared apartment, in a student house, alone in apartment), romantic relationship (single, unstable, short-term, medium-term, long-term), history of psychiatric/psychological disorders (yes vs. no) (Model 1). Perceived knowledge and worries and concerns about COVID-19 were inserted in the second block (Model 2). INDCOL dimensions were inserted in the third block (Model 3), in order to verify if this block improved the model's fit to psychological maladjustment over the previous blocks. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) of the three models, as well as ANOVA among them, were calculated to find the best model, as indicated by significant variation in \u2206R 2 and the lowest AIC. Finally, the effect size of the best multiple regression model was calculated using Cohen's f 2 = R 2 /(1 \u2212 R 2 ).

In addition to the assessment of levels of perceived knowledge and worries and concerns about COVID-19 and psychological maladjustment, it aimed to deepen the role of cultural orientation at the individual level seen as a possible protective factor for well-being. Italian emerging adults indicated that during the second week of mandatory lockdown (17 March to 24 March 2020), they received information about COVID-19 to which they paid attention. At the same time, they were aware of the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and worried and concerned about it.

[20] , Lin [61] and Maekelae et al. [62] confirmed the trend for COVID-19: higher perceived knowledge level was related to higher worries, anxiety, and distress. Since perceived knowledge is related to how much attention they paid to information about COVID-19, it is possible that it was associated to anxiety and stress because it reflects worries about the pandemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 382, "end": 386, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 387, "end": 391, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 392, "end": 396, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 409, "end": 413, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 420, "end": 424, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 445, "end": 449, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Perceived knowledge and worries and concerns about COVID-19 were positively correlated to collectivistic dimensions, and especially to the vertical one. Interdependence and sense of connectedness with others seem to explain the perception of the seriousness of the situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, in line with other studies [17, 24] , the higher the individuals' collectivistic orientation, the higher the perceived vulnerability to infectious diseases. This suggests that individuals who feel higher interdependence and sociability with others, especially who emphasize the integrity of the in-group such as one's own family, ethnic group, country, and support competitions of their in-groups with out-groups, may be more afraid and worried of being infected from others such as foreigners (out-group) or something unknown like a novel virus. At the same time, they are more worried of infecting others such as family members, friends, and co-workers (in-group), due to close relationships. In addition, it might be due to their strong sense of responsibility towards others and their community and conscientiousness [33, 60] which lead them to follow containment measures [38] . Therefore, emerging adults who felt a higher sense of belonging to their in-groups and interconnection with others were more worried for the pandemic, as well as of being infected and infecting others. In the present study, any individualistic dimension was associated to any specific aspect connected to COVID-19.

Accordingly, VC (strictly related to family connectedness) is more important for Italian adolescents than emerging adults [36] . Their developmental needs of both autonomy and relatedness [63] might explain why VC was not related to psychological maladjustment during the lockdown. If in general the sense of belonging to a group may be related to psychological well-being [24, 41, 42, 54, 64, 65] , it is not obvious for Italian emerging adults who seem to be protected from maladjustment when they feel a sense of relatedness while maintaining a sense of autonomy at the same time and without submitting their wills and needs to authorities (e.g., family).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 670, "end": 674, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 736, "end": 740, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 921, "end": 925, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 926, "end": 929, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 930, "end": 933, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 934, "end": 937, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 938, "end": 941, "text": "64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 942, "end": 945, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is noteworthy that controlling for the effect of socio-demographic variables, as well as knowledge, worries and concerns about COVID-19, the sense of being connected with others and the sense of having common goals with others during the COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown acted as protective factor against psychological maladjustment.

Moreover, as a recent study during the COVID-19 pandemic found, female gender and student status were significantly associated with higher levels of stress and anxiety [46] .

In addition, it is remarkable that stronger will of becoming distinguished and acquiring status through individual competitions with others predicted higher maladjustment, suggesting that in this period characterized by instability and struggle to make future plans, emerging adults who have this orientation cannot take advantage; on the contrary, they find more difficulties. Consequently, they reported more emotional and behavioral difficulties. Overall, we can also say that individualistic people, thinking of the self as stable and the environment as changeable find more difficulties in this period because they feel they cannot do much. On the other hand, for collectivistic emerging adults, at the moment the social environment is stable and they have to respect duties and obligations, therefore they have to change their own self.

Moreover, although cultural factors at the individual level such as I and C are considered stable components of personality, they may have a situation-specific component [33] . Since this study is cross-sectional, it was not possible to distinguish between these two different components, as well as to establish a clear direction of causality between the selected variables.

Although emerging adults reported important anxiety and stress levels, their psychological maladjustment was not very high nor clinical. However, prolonged stress related to the pandemic could alarmingly increase psychological maladjustment.
