            "text": "Homologous recombination (HR) has an intimate relationship with genome replication, both during repair of DNA lesions that might prevent DNA synthesis and in tackling stalls to the replication fork. Recent studies led us to ask if HR might have a more central role in replicating the genome of Leishmania, a eukaryotic parasite. Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding whether or not HR genes are essential, and genomewide mapping has provided evidence for an unorthodox organisation of DNA replication initiation sites, termed origins. To answer this question, we have employed a combined CRISPR/Cas9 and DiCre approach to rapidly generate and assess the effect of conditional ablation of RAD51 and three RAD51-related proteins in Leishmania major. Using this approach, we demonstrate that loss of any of these HR factors is not immediately lethal, but in each case growth slows with time and leads to DNA damage, accumulation of cells with aberrant DNA content, and genome-wide mutation. Despite these similarities, we show that only loss of RAD51 and RAD51-3 impairs DNA synthesis, and that the factors act in distinct ways. Finally, we reveal that loss of RAD51 has a profound effect on DNA replication, causing loss of initiation at the major origins and increased DNA synthesis at subtelomeres. Our work clarifies questions regarding the importance of HR to survival of Leishmania and reveals an unanticipated, central role for RAD51 in the programme of genome replication in a microbial eukaryote.",

HR is a multistep repair process initiated by resection of the ends of double-stranded DNA breaks to generate single stranded DNA overhangs. This processing provides access to a key player in HR: the Rad51 recombinase (RecA in bacteria, RadA in archaea) (2) , which catalyses invasion of the single-stranded DNA into intact homologous duplex DNA, allowing templatedirected repair of the broken DNA site. During evolution, duplications of the Rad51 gene have resulted in so-called Rad51 paralogues (3), a set of factors that are found in variable numbers in different organisms and whose spectrum of roles remain somewhat undefined, at least in part because they can belong to a number of protein complexes. Nonetheless, Rad51 paralogues have been implicated in directly modulating HR, acting on Rad51 HR intermediates (4) (5) (6) , and in wider repair activities for cell cycle progression (7, 8) .",

In Trypanosoma brucei, HR factors have been clearly implicated in the directed recombination of Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) genes during host immune evasion by antigenic variation (21), as well as in maintenance of the massive subtelomeric VSG gene archive (22, 23) . In T. cruzi, HR has been suggested to be a driver of variability in multigene families (24, 25) and in cell hybridisation (26) . Finally, in Leishmania, HR related factors have been implicated in mediating the formation or maintenance of episomes, which appear to form stochastically, arise genome-wide and have been implicated in acquisition of drug resistance (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) .",

            "text": "Despite emerging evidence for HR roles in Leishmania genome change, is it possible that the reaction has wider and deeper functions in genome maintenance and transmission in the parasite? One reason for asking this question is recent observations suggesting that origin number and distribution in Leishmania is unusual, since one study detected only a single site of DNA replication initiation per chromosome (39), while a later study suggested >5000 sites (40). These data indicate either a pronounced paucity or huge overabundance of origins relative to all other eukaryotes. Alternatively, the disparity in the datasets may be due to a widespread, unconventional route for initiation of DNA synthesis, acting alongside a small number of conventional origins, perhaps indicating novel strategies for DNA replication that may link with genome plasticity (41). A second reason for asking about the importance of HR for genome transmission in Leishmania is other work that has led to uncertainty about the importance of HR factors for survival of the parasite. Leishmania encodes a highly conserved, canonical Rad51 recombinase (30, 42, 43) , as well three Rad51 paralogues, referred to as RAD51-3, RAD51-4 and RAD5-6 (29), a slightly smaller repertoire of nonmeiotic Rad51-related proteins than is found in T. brucei (44) (45) (46) (47) . In L. donovani (48), unlike in L. infantum (30) , it has proved impossible to make RAD51 null mutants. Furthermore, while null mutants of are viable in L. infantum, RAD51-3 has been described as being essential, and RAD51-6 nulls were not recovered in the same experiments (29). Mutation in Rad51 or its relatives has never been shown to be lethal in any single celled eukaryote, notably including T. brucei (49), or in prokaryotes, making these observations in Leishmania particularly striking.",

Our data show that loss of each gene is, over time, increasingly detrimental to Leishmania fecundity, demonstrating that black and white definitions of essential or non-essential are too limiting for HR genes in the parasite.

            "text": "In order to compare the effects of ablating RAD51 and each of the three known L. major RAD51 paralogues, we adopted a rapid approach to generate cell lines for conditional induction of a gene KO. For this, we used a cell line constitutively expressing Cas9 and DiCre (Fig.1A) . In this strategy, we first used CRISPR/Cas9mediated HR to exchange the endogenous copy of the genes by a copy flanked by loxP sites. In addition, each construct translationally fused copies of the HA epitope to the C-terminus of the gene's ORF. PCR showed this approach to be very efficient for RAD51 and the three RAD51 paralogues, since selection using only puromycin resulted in all wild type (WT) copies of each gene being replaced by floxed and tagged versions after a single transformation (Fig.S1 ). Because RAD51 and the RAD51 paralogue mutants may generate similar phenotypes (44, 46) , since each contributes to HR (29), we used the same approach to modify the L. major gene encoding the orthologue of T. brucei PIF6. This factor has not been functionally examined in Leishmania, but in T. brucei PIF6 is the sole known nuclear Pif1 helicase homologue (50). Since Pif1 helicases have been implicated in modulating DNA replication passage through barriers and during termination(51, 52), and thus operate in distinct aspects of nuclear genome maintenance compared with Rad51 paralogues, we considered this gene could provide a valuable control for the effects of conditional gene KO of the Rad51-related proteins. A number of attempts failed to replace all WT endogenous L. major PIF6 gene copies with HA-tagged versions, whereas each copy could be floxed with untagged gene variants ( Fig.S1 ). Growth curves showed that addition of loxP sites or the HA tag did not lead to any significant growth impairment for any of the five genes (Fig.S2 ).",

PCR analysis using DNA from cells after a number of induction rounds ('passages'), where cells were grown from low to high density and repeated by dilution, showed that complete gene excision was achieved after passage 2 for all genes (Fig.S3) . Controls without addition of rapamycin showed no gene excision, and unexcised gene copies were undetectable even after >15 passages in the presence of rapamycin (Fig.S3 ). The rapidity of DiCre mediated loss of the gene products was confirmed by western blotting (RAD51 and paralogues) and : signal for all four HA-tagged proteins was no longer detectable after 48 h of the second round of KO induction (Fig.1B) , and PIF6 cDNA could not be PCR-amplified (Fig.1C) . KO induction of RAD51 and of each of the RAD51 paralogues, but not of PIF6, resulted in increased levels of \uf067H2A (53) in western blotting analysis (Fig.1D ), suggesting accumulation of nuclear DNA damage after loss of any L .major RAD51-like protein, but not after ablation of PIF6 (at least during unperturbed growth; see below). To attempt to answer the question of whether or not RAD51 and the RAD51 paralogues are essential in Leishmania (29, 48), we measured growth of the parasites for a prolonged period after DiCre-induced gene excision (Fig.1E ). At least until passage 4, no growth defect was seen due to loss of RAD51, any of the RAD51 paralogues or PIF6. However, when kept in culture for longer periods (Fig.1E) , the RAD51 KO cells and each of the RAD51 paralogues KO cells, but not the PIF6 KO cells, showed marked growth defects, suggesting HR factors that contribute to the catalysis of homology-directed strand exchange might be critical for long-term Leishmania viability in culture. Accordingly, flow cytometry analysis showed that prolonged cultivation after KO induction of RAD51 and the RAD51 paralogues, but not PIF6, resulted in an increased proportion of cells with less than 1C DNA (Fig.S4 ), suggesting increased genomic instability, perhaps reflecting the increased levels of \uf067H2A.",

To do this, rapamycin induced and uninduced cells were subjected to a short pulse of IdU labelling followed by immunostaining under denaturing conditions and flow cytometry detection, allowing us to track the level and pattern of DNA synthesis in each cell cycle stage ( Fig.2A ). Loss of RAD51 or RAD51-3, but not loss of RAD51-4, RAD51-6 or PIF6, resulted in a reduced percentage of IdU-positive cells in the population. Quantification of IdU signal in individual S-phase cells at 48 and 72 h of the second round of KO induction confirmed these effects (Fig.2B ): a significant reduction in IdU fluorescence was found at both time points in the rapamycin-induced RAD51 and RAD51-3 KO cells compared with their cognate uninduced controls, whereas no such reduction was seen after KO of RAD51-4, RAD51-6 or PIF6. These data suggest that only loss of RAD51 or RAD51-3 affects DNA synthesis, meaning the growth impairment seen after loss of RAD51 and its relatives, though similar in extent, might not have a common basis, or loss of DNA synthesis is not the main reason for growth reduction after the induced KO of RAD51 or RAD51-3.",

For this, rapamycin induced and uninduced cells were arrested in G1 using 5 mM hydroxyurea (HU) and then released from arrest by removing HU, sampling at the point of arrest and at various times after release for western blotting (Fig.2C ). The patterns of \uf067H2A accumulation revealed notable differences in the cell cycle functions of the five genes (Fig.2C ). KO induction of RAD51 or RAD51-3 resulted in a pronounced increase of \uf067H2A levels in cells navigating through S-phase up to G2/M, suggesting roles related to the resolution, before cell division, of genome injuries that arise during DNA replication. In contrast, loss of RAD51-4 or RAD51-6 did not show any clear evidence for increased \uf067 H2A signal compared with uninduced controls after HU release, suggesting a more limited contribution to tackling replication-associated damage, which seems consistent with the absence of changes in IdU uptake after KO. PIF6 KO displayed a yet further difference, with increased levels of \uf067H2A only ~6 h after HU release (Fig.2C) , when much of the population had passed through S-phase (Fig.S5) .",

This SSR proximity mapping also revealed a difference between the three gene KOs: following loss of RAD51 a decrease in SNP accumulation was seen at both origin-active and -inactive SSRs relative to uninduced controls, whereas the opposite effect was observed after RAD51-3 KO, and no change in SSRproximal SNP density was found after RAD51-4 KO.

Around the SSRs, a clear peak of new InDels in the uninduced cells was less apparent than was seen for new SNPs (compare Fig.S6C with Fig.3D ), though InDels appeared to accumulate around both origin-active and -inactive SSRs upon RAD51 KO (Fig.S6C ).

As expected for predicted DNA double-strand break repair factors, KO induction of either RAD51 or RAD51-3 lead to increased sensitivity to phleomycin and camptothecin. However, only RAD51-3 KO led to increased sensitivity to HU, further suggesting distinct roles for RAD51 and RAD51-3 roles during DNA synthesis. Consistent with this interpretation, differences were also observed in the patterns of SNP and InDel accumulation after exposure to and release from HU treatment (Fig.S8 ). Both genome-wide (Figs.S8A,B) and in each chromosome (Figs.S8C,D), fewer HUinduced new SNPs or InDels were detected in RAD51 KO cells compared with uninduced, whereas KO of RAD51-3 resulted in higher levels of HU-induced SNPs or InDels relative to uninduced cells. Despite the global decrease in HU-induced SNPs after loss of RAD51, SNPs were found to increase around SSRs in RAD51 KO cells after HU treatment compared with uninduced cells (Fig.S8E) , whereas no such effect was seen for InDels (Fig.S8F ). Again, this phenotype differed from that seen after RAD51-3 loss: no accumulation of SSR-proximal HU-induced SNPs was seen in the RAD51-3 KO cells compared with uninduced ( Fig.S8E) , whereas a very modest enrichment of InDels was observed (Fig.S8F ). Taken together, these HU data reinforce the view that RAD51 and RAD51-3 play distinct roles in maintenance of the L. major genome, despite loss of either causing impaired DNA synthesis.",

One explanation may be that RAD51-4 and RAD51-6 act redundantly in Leishmania. To test this, we used the combined CRISPR/Cas9, DiCre approach to attempt to make conditional double gene KOs of the Rad51-paralogues in all possible combinations (Fig.4A) . First, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to generate floxed copies of either RAD51-3 or RAD51-4 using gene-specific puromycin-resistance constructs (described above). Next, the resulting cell lines were subjected to a second round of CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to delete the endogenous copies of RAD51-4 or RAD51-6 in the Western blotting (Fig.4B) showed that HA-tagged RAD51-3 or RAD51-4 protein in the null mutants was undetectable after rapamycin induction of gene KO. The RAD51-4 and RAD51-6 null mutants, prior to induction of conditional excision of the second gene, showed increased levels of \uf067H2A compared with the background cell line (Fig.4C ). DiCre-mediated gene excision, leading to the three different double gene KOs, did not result in further increases in the levels of the phosphorylated histone. The lack of further impairment when two genes are lost relative to one was broadly consistent with growth curves (Fig.S11A) and with flow cytometry analysis of DNA content (Fig.S11B ): conditional excision of the second gene did not lead to worsening of growth or to increased numbers of aberrant cells with less than 1C content compared with uninduced single gene null cells. Intriguingly, the RAD51-4 and RAD51-6 null mutants, even without induction of the second gene KO and having been selected as clones, appeared to recapitulate the longterm growth impairment seen upon prolonged cultivation after DiCre excision of a single HR gene (compare IdU labelling followed by FACS analysis of each of the three cell lines (Fig.4D ), before and after rapamycin induction, did not show a change in the proportion of cells that incoporated the nucleotide analogue.",

However, if and how the two factors might contribute to the programme of DNA replication in L. major was not known. To address this question, we performed MFA-seq analysis, comparing read depth across the chromosomes in DNA extracted from replicating and non-replicating cells, thereby identifying sites of replication initiation and patterns of fork progression (39, 54, 55) . To do this, we used a modified version of MFA-seq compared to what we have described previously: rather than using FACS to isolate S-and G2-phase cells, we isolated DNA from L. major cells in logarithmic (log) or in stationary phase growth, sequenced each using Illumina technology, and mapped the ratio of reads in the two populations. Fig.6A shows these data as Z-scores across two chromosomes, where positive signal represents regions where the mean read depth in the log phase cells is greater than the mean of the stationary cells ( Fig.S13 shows further chromosomes). This modified MFA-seq approach will be described in detail elsewhere (BioRXiv 10.1101/799429), but two primary features of Leishmania replication are revealed relative to MFA-seq based on S/G2 phase read depth ratios using cell cycle-sorted cells (39). First, we confirm the predominant use of single origins in each chromosome, most of which are centrally disposed in the molecules and each coinciding with SSRs. Second, we now detect weaker sites of replication initiation that were not seen previously and are proximal to one or both telomeres in the chromosomes (see -RAP data in Fig.6A , which are highly comparable with WT cells; BioRXiv 10.1101/799429) .",

Comparing induced RAD51 KO cells with uninduced cells revealed a striking variation in MFA-seq pattern: loss of MFA signal was seen at the main origin that had previously been mapped within each chromosome (39), while an increase in MFA-seq signal was seen at the extremities of the chromosomes (Fig.6A, Fig.S12 ). In the induced RAD51-3 KO cells, the same differential effect was not obvious: though there was potentially some loss of MFA-seq signal at the main origin, increase in subtelomeric signal was not apparent. To examine this genome-wide, we generated metaplots of the MFA-seq signal in the different cells (Fig.6B,C) . Profiling of MFA signal around the main origin ( Fig.6B) revealed considerable consistency in amplitude and width of the peaks, both for the 36 origins within one cell and between the two uninduced cells, confirming there is little variation in timing or efficiency of DNA synthesis initiation at all main origins in the WT L. major population (39). The same profiling confirmed that loss of MFA-seq signal around the main origins was a genome-wide effect upon RAD51 KO, with lowered amplitude and width, and was less pronounced upon KO of RAD51-3. These data indicate that loss of RAD51 leads to a more pronounced decrease in replication initiation activity at the main origins compared with RAD51-3 loss, which appears consistent with decreased SNP accumulation at SSRs after RAD51 KO but not after RAD51-3 KO (Fig 3D) . Profiling of the MFA-seq mapping at the chromosome ends ( Fig.6C ) showed that loss of RAD51, but not RAD51-3, resulted in a gain of signal in the subtelomeres, which again was strikingly consistent in amplitude and width across all chromosomes. These data indicate that loss of DNA synthesis at the main origins due to ablation of RAD51 is accompanied by increased DNA synthesis in the subtelomeres, a shift in the replication programme that is not clearly seen after loss of RAD51-3. In addition, these observations further confirm that RAD51 and RAD51-3 play distinct roles in Leishmania DNA replication.",

Here, we sought to answer two main questions. First, are RAD51 and RAD51 paralogues essential in Leishmania, given the conflicting data on the ability to generate and propagate null mutants in different species? Second, given the potentially novel distribution of mapped origins in the Leishmania genome, does HR play a central role in Leishmania genome duplication? Using a rapid, conditional knockout approach that combines CRISPR/Cas9 gene modification and DiCre gene excision, we show that loss of any RAD51-like gene is not immediately lethal to promastigote L. major but is increasingly detrimental over time. Thus, we suggest that binary definitions of essential or non-essential for HR-related genes inadequately describe their contribution to parasite biology. In addition, our data reveal that loss of RAD51 and RAD51-3, uniquely among the four HR proteins examined, impairs DNA replication, though their roles are distinct, with RAD51 playing an unexpected and central role in DNA replication initiation.",

In addition, RAD51-3 and RAD51-6 null mutants were not recovered by two-step homology-directed gene deletion in L. infantum (29) . The conditional KO approach used here aids understanding of this complex biology, since we show that excision of any of these HR factors has no immediate impact of parasite fitness, but rather causes a progressive slowing of growth, presumably due to accrual of problems. Nonetheless, it is clear that Leishmania null mutants of RAD51 (in L. infantum)(30), and the RAD51 paralogues RAD51-4 and RAD51-6 (this work, in L. major), can be generated. Similarly, null mutants of each RAD51-related gene have been described in T. brucei (44, 46) . It is possible such variation in importance reflects species-specific aspects of HR function. However, it is also conceivable that conventional, two step transformation approaches to generate null mutant clones allows for selection of cells possessing compensatory changes that lead to survival -an adaptation that may not always be recovered when using CRISPR-Cas9 to simultaneously ablate both alleles (48), or that emerged in the timeframe we have used during conditional gene excision (this work). What such adaptations might be is unclear, but the abundant mutations we describe after loss of HR genes may provide a genetic basis for their generation. In addition, RAD51-directed HR is not the sole route for repair of DSBs in any trypanosomatid (56-62), though whether such pathways can increase in activity in the absence of RAD51-directed HR has not been tested. What aspects of Leishmania genome function degrade with time after loss of RAD51 and its relatives remain to be fully characterised, though our data suggest these effects may differ for the different RAD51 paralogues, and for RAD51.",

Impaired nucleotide uptake after RAD51 loss appears to be explained by a shift in the programme of L. major DNA replication, with loss of efficient DNA replication initiation at the single primary origin in each chromosome and increased subtelomeric DNA replication initiation. The finding that RAD51 KO cells are impaired in growth and nucleotide uptake argues that increased replication from the subtelomeres is insufficient to compensate for loss of the primary initiation events. In the case of RAD51-3, the more modest loss of replication at the main origin, and no clear increase in subtelomeric replication, seems most readily explained by a widespread impairment in genome replication, perhaps because the RAD51 paralogue is needed to guide processes involved in promoting replication in the face of genome-wide impediments. In this regard, the replication phenotypes after loss of RAD51-3 may be comparable with effects seen after mutation of T. brucei MCM-BP (66), a poorly understood factor that modulates activity of the replicative MCM helicase (67, 68). In addition, such a role for L. major RAD51-3 may be akin to roles for mammalian Rad51 paralogues on stalled DNA replication forks, with the differing effects of loss of L. major RAD51-4 or RAD51-6 suggesting similar functional compartmentalisation amongst the paralogues (13) .",

Such an origin-specific function for RAD51 or RAD51-directed HR has no precedent and, indeed, would be distinct from origin activity in T. brucei, where these sites are conventionally defined by binding ORC (54, 69). Nonetheless, ORC binding has not been mapped in any Leishmania genome and precedents for recombination-directed replication initiation exist in viruses (70-72), bacteria (17), polypoid archaea (18) in Tetrahymena (73), albeit normally without a focus on defined genome sites. In addition, human Rad51 acts with MCM8-9, an alternate MCM helicase complex, to initiate DNA replication (74); though this DNA synthesis pathway is origin-independent in humans, no work has tested MCM8 or MCM9 function in any trypanosomatid.

These loci might then be vulnerable to breakage, such as during chromosome segregation, and RAD51-directed HR may be required to repair any breaks, such as after mitosis in order to allow proper licensing and firing of origins at these loci. Such a scenario could be compatible with data from other eukaryotes of important roles for RAD51-directed HR is maintaining centromere function (77-79). In T. brucei, the presence of further ORC-defined origins in each chromosome may compensate for loss of RAD51 causing impaired centromere-focused origin function, but such a mutation in Leishmania might be more detrimental, given the presence of only a single major centromere-focused origin in each chromosome (39). A distinct suggestion for an indirect role of RAD51 is that the recombinase does not play an origin-or centromerefocused role, but instead is needed to support DNA replication genome-wide, given previous suggestions that replication from a single major origin in each Leishmania chromosome would be insufficient to replicate all chromosomes in S-phase (39, 41). Such a function could be compatible with originindependent roles of HR-directed replication (discussed above) and, in the absence of RAD51, complete chromosome replication is lost during S-phase, leading to impaired mitosis and reduced numbers of cells that license the main origins. This scenario may also explain the increased levels of MFA-seq reads in the subtelomeres. As we did not detect this replication signature when previously sorting S-phase cells (39), it is likely that the subtelomeric DNA replication reaction occurs either late in S-phase, or even post-S-phase.",

As it stands, we do not know the nature of the subtelomeric DNA synthesis, but these data indicate it is distinct from DNA replication emanating from the main SSR-focused origins and is RAD51-independent.

PCR product of RAD51- 3 (LmjF.33.2490) was cloned into the SpeI restriction site of vector pGL2314. The resulting constructs contained the GOI flanked by LoxP sites (pGL2314GOI Flox ) and were used as templates in PCR reactions to generate the donor fragments flanked by sequences homologues (30 nucleotides) to the targeting integration sites. PCR products were ethanol precipitated and transfected into the DiCre/Cas9/T7-expressing cell line. Correct integration into the expected locus was confirmed by PCR analysis. The strategy used to generate sgRNAs was essentially as previously described (81). Briefly, sgRNAs were generated in vivo upon transfection with appropriate DNA fragment generated by PCR. These fragments contained the sequence for the T7 polymerase promoter, followed by the 20 nucleotides of sgRNA targeting site and 60 nucleotides of sgRNA scaffold sequence. The Eukaryotic Pathogen CRISPR guide RNA/DNA Design Tool (http://grna.ctegd.uga.edu) was used to generate the 20 nucleotide sequences for sgRNA targeting sites.",
