Although both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes have been reported with COVID-19, there has been anecdotal suggestion of an overall decrease in stroke admissions. To date, the effects of any pandemic on telestroke service lines have not been described. The purpose of this cross-sectional analysis of telestroke activations in the 30 days before and after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic is to describe the difference in case volumes of telestroke activations, the characteristics of patients, and treatment recommendations between the two time frames. We found a 50% reduction in total telestroke activations between the pre-and post-groups, 142 and 71, respectively.",

The percentage of patients in whom we recommended acute stroke treatment with intravenous alteplase, mechanical thrombectomy, or both, decreased from 44% to 33%. The reasons for the significant decrease in telestroke activations and acute stroke treatment recommendations are likely multifactorial, regardless, underscoring the importance of continued public health measures to encourage patients and families to seek emergent medical care at the time of symptom onset.",

The ultimate magnitude of impact from COVID-19 has yet to be seen in the United States. Neurologic manifestations of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in 36.4% of the Wuhan cohort of COVID-19 patients, with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke occurring in 5.7% of patients. 1 Anecdotally, the volumes of stroke admissions in some communities in the United States have recently decreased. 2 Prior studies during epidemics such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic have demonstrated decreased Emergency Room (ER) utilization collectively. 3, 4 This brings into question whether patients may feel dissuaded from presenting to the hospital with mild or rapidly resolving symptoms-a situation that could be reflective of patients' anxieties during this daunting time. With this, we would anticipate that the volume of stroke patients with more severe deficits would still remain stable. However, Zhao et al report a reduction in thrombectomies in Shanghai by 50% in the first month after the Spring Festival when compared to the same time period in 2019. 5 Whether this reflects a reduction in patient volume, decreased eligibility due to delayed presentation, reluctance to perform a procedure that could potentially result in contamination or exposure, unavailability of specialized staff that may be ill or redeployed to another specialty, or simply the lack of resources or hospital capacity to carry out the procedures is unknown.",

There were no differences in age, sex, diagnosis, or regional variation in volume (Table 1) . Table 2 summarizes the clinical variables in patients with diagnosis of ischemic stroke only. While the proportion of ischemic stroke diagnosis volumes were similar pre-and postpandemic declaration, the last known normal/symptom onset time to telestroke activation in the ER was significantly shorter for the post-pandemic declaration group ( Figure 1 ). Recommendation for acute stroke intervention (IV-tPA and/or thrombectomy) occurred at a lower rate for our post-pandemic group. This is despite the findings of similar stroke severity in the two groups. Notably, however, all patients that did not receive acute stroke treatment in the post-pandemic declaration group had an NIHSS <6, with the majority of patients with an NIHSS < 3 (21/24, 87.5%).",

            "text": "This retrospective review describes the telestroke activation patterns of the Mayo Clinic telestroke network in the 30 days preceding the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 30 days following. There was a notable reduction in average telestroke utilization from 4.7 to 2.4 activations per day, which was observed across all geographical regions of the telestroke network. The observed decrease in volumes at our spoke sites argues against a phenomenon that could be attributed to reluctance of community hospitals to refer to tertiary referral centers, or decreased acceptance of patients from the receiving tertiary centers. However, it remains unclear if the overall reduction in volume of telestroke activations was due to a reduced incidence of stroke, patient-related factors, or a reduction in utilization by ER providers. It is notable that similar reductions in volume have been seen for percutaneous coronary interventions in the setting of ST elevation myocardial infarction in the United States as well as reports from Spain.\u2077 , 8 We found that the median time from reported symptom onset or last known normal time to telestroke activation was decreased in the post-pandemic declaration group compared to the pre-pandemic declaration group. This could potentially be explained by local stay-at-home orders that resulted in more witnessed strokes at home by family members, resulting in earlier presentation to the ER. Potentially, an overall decreased ER utilization for all medical conditions could also contribute to earlier telestroke activation. Additionally, there could be late-presenting patients who were not captured in our cohort due to presentation after 24 hours, thus not meeting criteria for telestroke activation. Despite this decreased time to telestroke activation, there was a reduction in the percentage of patients that received acute stroke interventions (IV-tPA and/or thrombectomy). We noted that most of the patients who did not receive treatment had low NIHSS scores, suggesting mild stroke symptoms. The data in this regard was difficult to interpret as details on potential exclusion factors were not included as part of this review, and the number of patients in this group was small. However, this remains an area that may require further exploration to determine if acute stroke treatment patterns are affected by the pandemic.",

Interestingly, age did not appear to differ between the two groups despite the increased morbidity associated with COVID-19 in the elderly population. Based on reports of reduced ER presentations for less severe conditions during the MERS epidemic, one may expect a reduction in the proportion of stroke mimics and TIAs compared to ischemic stroke diagnoses 3 . However, this was not observed in our cohort. While we did see a reduction in the proportion of stroke mimics in the post-group; this did not achieve statistical significance. Likewise, among those with a stroke diagnosis, NIHSS did not appear to be significantly different between the two groups.",
