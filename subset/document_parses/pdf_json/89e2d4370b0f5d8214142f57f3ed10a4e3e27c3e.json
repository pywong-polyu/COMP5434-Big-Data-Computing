The authors concluded that a normal compliance variant of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) does not exist, based on two small cohort studies reporting low respiratory system compliance in COVID-19 patients [2, 3] . However, this assumption may be erroneous, as, first, the admission and intubation thresholds are highly variable across units, resulting in marked heterogeneity. Secondly, several studies demonstrate that a high proportion of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients exhibit near-normal lung compliance [4] [5] [6] .",

The early radiological changes of ground-glassing and consolidation in COVID-19 were considered to be infective or inflammatory in aetiology [11] . However, recent paired parenchymal-perfusion imaging studies demonstrate well-demarcated perfusion defects underlying these changes, implicating a thrombotic aetiology [4, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Unmatched defects are also seen [4, 15] . Moreover, the parenchymal changes follow a peripheral \"vascular distribution\", which are often wedge-shaped [11, 16] . These findings suggest that the primary insult is vaso-occlusive, as infections or inflammation are rarely confined to vascular boundaries. Additionally, proximal vascular dilatation suggests distal vessel occlusion [13, 16] . Interestingly, rapid radiological resolution and clinical improvement with inhaled thrombolytics have been described in a small case series [17] .",

The early COVID-19 respiratory failure phenotype, with hypoxaemia in the presence of preserved lung mechanics [4] [5] [6] , suggests perfusion impairments as the main pathophysiology. Although the ground-glass changes signify ventilatory impairments, owing to perfusion loss, the affected alveoli act as dead spaces rather than shunts. In this situation, hypoxaemia occurs primarily due to flow redistribution and overperfusion involving a significantly reduced vascular bed, resulting in ventilation/perfusion mismatch [24, 25] . This typically requires loss of 40-50% of the pulmonary vascular bed before clinically significant hypoxaemia could occur, indicating a large reserve. Reduced mixed venous saturation could further exacerbate hypoxaemia. Also, during extensive obstruction, available time for red cell oxygenation within the alveolar capillaries may be reduced, due to insufficient microcirculatory recruitment and increased flow velocities. Diffusion limitation may result, further aggravating hypoxaemia [24, 25] .",

While hypoxaemia can result either from ventilatory impairments or from disorders of alveolar perfusion, there are stark differences in their clinical features. In alveolar diseases such as pneumonia, shunt perfusion results in early hypoxaemia, with clinically proportionate dyspnoea due to abnormal lung compliance. However, in progressive perfusion loss, hypoxaemia manifests late due to the large lung perfusion reserve, initial ventilatory compensation that mitigates ventilation/perfusion mismatch from overperfusion, and adequate initial right ventricular compensation to acute pressure overload. Furthermore, unlike ventilatory disorders, the initial hypoxaemia in this situation may be \"silent\", owing to minimal parenchymal injury and normal lung compliance at this stage. However, once dyspnoea sets in, there would be rapid clinical progression whereby minor changes in mixed venous saturations or transit time could result in major changes in systemic oxygen saturation. Correspondingly, as the perfusion reserve continues to decline, physiological stress and exertion would be poorly tolerated. Eventually, right heart compromise would result in cardiorespiratory collapse and rapidly progressing multi-organ failure. These insights are key to understanding the clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 lung injury.",

Cherian and co-workers take issue with our interpretation of the respiratory physiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , arguing that it is based merely on \"small cohort studies\", and instead declaring that \"a high proportion of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients exhibit near-normal lung compliance\". Yet the low respiratory compliance of COVID-19 patients has now been extensively demonstrated by studies totalling more than 800 COVID-19 patients [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , including a direct comparison with non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients that revealed no difference in respiratory compliance [7] . In contrast, the three case series cited by R. Cherian and co-workers in support of their claim comprise cohorts of, respectively, 16, 10 and 26 patients [8] [9] [10] . Furthermore, even these case series report average respiratory compliance in COVID-19 of 40-45 mL\u00b7cmH 2 O \u22121 , which is in fact abnormal and far from \"near-normal compliance\" [11, 12] . As an informative comparison, the ANZICS (Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society) cohort of ARDS patients used to derive the Berlin definition of ARDS had an average respiratory compliance of 40\u00b115 mL\u00b7cmH 2 O \u22121 [13] . We thus find no evidence in the authors' citations (or elsewhere) to support their empirical claim that many or most COVID-19 patients present with \"normal\" or \"near-normal\" respiratory compliance.",

Cherian and co-workers also assume a temporal progression from \"early\" COVID-19 physiology (characterised by normal respiratory compliance) to \"late\" physiology (characterised by impaired respiratory compliance). Yet three published studies comprising nearly 350 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients have reported serial measurements of respiratory compliance [1, 3, 6] , and none has shown any temporal trend towards decreased compliance in the days following initiation of mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, a recent report from HAUDEBOURG et al. [7] demonstrated no correlation between duration of symptoms and respiratory compliance in COVID-19 patients (figure 1a). We have since validated this observation using our own clinical data (figure 1b). As shown in figure 1c , GATTINONI et al. [14] recently published their own data countering these findings. Importantly, when data from all three cohorts are combined and analysed together, no temporal trend is present ( p=0.50, r 2 =0.005; figure  1e ). Closer inspection reveals that the purported correlation in the cohort of GATTINONIet al. [14] is entirely attributable to two patients with low respiratory compliance and >3 weeks of symptoms, a duration of @ERSpublications disease irrelevant to considerations of acute pathogenesis and rarely encountered in the literature and not at all by HAUDEBOURG et al. [7] or ourselves ( figure 1a and b) . As shown in figure 1d , if analysis is restricted to the 35 patients with symptoms shorter than 3 weeks, there is no evidence of a temporal correlation ( p=0.72, r 2 =0.004), and the results align with the meta-analysis (figure 1e).",

A final under-appreciated and unmeasurable pitfall of premature phenotyping raised in our editorial, and one that the multitude of publications addressing these purported phenotypes are substantiating, is the cost to research resources caused by high-profile yet unsupported speculation. This factor is all the more pertinent in the face of an unforgiving pandemic in which clinical intensive care unit workload is highly demanding and clinical research is a zero-sum game. Furthermore, clinicians have even less time than usual to critically evaluate scientific literature. Therefore, it is incumbent as clinician-scientists that, whilst our data gathering may be agile and creative, its interpretation should be cautious and deliberate.",

Our editorial did not take a position on the pathophysiology of COVID-19, nor do we dispute the need to identify more homogenous biological pathways. Frankly, we do not believe in \"typical ARDS\", as the syndrome encompasses diverse aetiological pathways with only partially intersecting clinical and histopathological \"bottlenecks\". We are merely arguing that the currently postulated phenotypes are unconvincing, and insufficient to justify a widespread change in clinical management (as proposed by the correspondence).",

Rajendram (along with R. Cherian and co-workers) seems to think that we dispute the heterogeneity of ARDS, and advocate for a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to its clinical management. Quite the opposite: we strongly believe that ARDS represents a pathophysiologically heterogenous syndrome and have argued the same for COVID-19-related ARDS [19] . Until well-defined biological subgroups are identified, the ceiling of effective interventions is likely to remain supportive. We also strongly suspect there are likely to be considerable biological differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS [20] .",

This was the central point of our editorial and is illustrated with two examples in this response (the \"normal compliance\" of COVID-19 and its purported temporal worsening). As a contrast, the correspondents may consider recent pre-COVID-19 research identifying hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory subphenotypes in ARDS (to which we have contributed) [8, 21] . These ARDS subphenotypes were derived using unsupervised clustering of more than 3000 rigorously adjudicated and extensively characterised patients [22] . The ARDS subphenotypes have been consistently validated across multiple cohorts and research groups [23] [24] [25] . In contrast, the high-compliance \"L\" phenotype, for the reasons already detailed, seems inherently unstable. Whereas it was initially described as constituting 70-80% of COVID-19 ARDS cases [21] , it now is defined as a rarely encountered extreme of a one-dimensional physiological continuum. In comparison, the previously identified ARDS subphenotypes represent distinct clinical \"clusters\" of patients, informed by measurements across organ systems and physiological domains in secondary analyses of well-curated cohorts of patients [22] . Yet despite this robustness, we would recommend that any therapeutic interventions for which benefits have been observed in these hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory phenotypes require testing in prospective trials before they are implemented into clinical practice, as they were derived using secondary analyses.",

As described in our editorial [15] , for phenotypes to be purposeful, they should be discrete, robust, generalisable, easily identifiable and, ideally, have an actionable intervention. Seemingly, almost none of these conditions are met in the current case. As an illustration, the problem with loosely defined phenotypes, as described by the correspondents, emerges when we try to precisely identify, at the bedside, who the patients are in whom they \"hoped to help prevent use of high positive end-expiratory pressure when there is no benefit and, equally important, to avoid maintaining low pressures when higher pressures can be beneficial.\" It is difficult to conceive how these phenotypes would be identifiable using quantifiable variables and when precisely to intervene, given that L.

Viraemia with viral endotheliitis fuels an inflammatory response appropriate for vascular injury, resulting in a prothrombotic state. Interleukin (IL)-6 upregulates fibrinogen gene expression. Pulmonary in situ thrombosis is facilitated by Virchow's triad. Early disease is subclinical due to lung perfusion reserve. Progression may be aborted in young individuals with rapid endothelial turnover and robust intrinsic thrombolysis. Progressive in situ microvascular thrombosis eventually leads to hypoxaemia when reserves are exhausted. Initial hypoxaemia may be silent (no dyspnoea) as lung compliance is normal. Oxidative damage from iron and haem in the presence of unextracted alveolar oxygen, after perfusion loss, may be a major determinant of parenchymal injury. Additionally, self-induced lung injury, ventilator lung injury and secondary infections result in diffuse alveolar damage. D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin are elevated sequentially. Pulmonary in situ thrombosis as the initial insult and major determinant of COVID-19-related lung injury explains the observed clinical phenotypes and disease spectrum. Early risk stratification and anticoagulation may avert thrombotic storm.

We merely insist that phenotyping be done using careful, data-driven approaches. To paraphrase R. Rajendram, rather than strengthening a house of cards, we should instead aspire to build a foundation out of sturdier, more lasting materials: in this case agile, yet robust, scientific studies using a responsible, data-informed approach. At this stage of the pandemic, sufficient data points exist to equip us to advance from anecdote-based intuitions to evidence-informed science.",
