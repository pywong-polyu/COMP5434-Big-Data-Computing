Stochastic processes whereby incremental changes are interspersed with sudden and large changes occurring at unpredictable times are common in nature [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .

Recent development of the theoretical \"stochastic resetting\" framework aims to describe features of such stochastic processes. A paradigmatic model for these phenomena is provided by a Brownian particle diffusing and also resetting instantaneously its position to a fixed value at exponentially-distributed random time intervals [5] .

A paradigmatic example is the Brownian motion, where the addition of spatially homogeneous resetting, in any spatial dimensionality d [5, 29] , ensures a stationary state even in the absence of confining boundary conditions and/or potentials. In the recent past, a variety of situations have been studied within this framework, e.g., Brownian particles resetting to a generic spatial distribution, under the action of an external potential [30] , and for various choices of the resetting time probability distribution [31] . Most of these studies consider resetting phenomena with open boundary conditions. However, excepting for rare instances such as Refs. [32, 33] , not much is known about systems that experience stochastic resetting in a closed geometry, such as periodic boundary conditions in one dimension.

Our key findings, however, concern the transport properties of diffusion processes with resetting and periodic boundary conditions. For these systems, a stationary state exists and we can define a probability current with nonvanishing stationary value.

Accordingly, we show that currents provide useful and insightful information about the underlying non-equilibrium resetting process, in addition to that conveyed by the probability distribution.

The latter displays robust qualitative features in its dependence on the resetting destination x r , see Fig. 3c : with x r outside (inside) the resetting region compared to the typical values outside it, i.e., |x r | > a (|x r | < a), J increases (decreases) upon increasing (decreasing) the resetting rate r, because resetting induces particles to be concentrated in a region with low (high) local resetting rate. As a result, the current is exponentially suppressed upon increasing r inside the resetting region, inducing a discontinuity at x = \u00b1a for r \u2192 \u221e. Notably, our finding rationalizes the emergence of a cusp in the stationary distribution at x r , as the resetting current is discontinuous also in x r due to the imbalance of resetting fluxes (Fig. 3d) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 133, "end": 140, "text": "Fig. 3a", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 247, "end": 254, "text": "Fig. 3a", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 494, "end": 501, "text": "Fig. 3b", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 588, "end": 595, "text": "Fig. 3c", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 775, "end": 782, "text": "Fig. 3b", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 863, "end": 870, "text": "Fig. 3c", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 979, "end": 986, "text": "Fig. 3c", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1638, "text": "(Fig. 3d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Application to RNA polymerase.

This dynamics can be modeled as shown in Fig. 4b , as confirmed by in vitro single-molecule experimental data obtained for yeast S. Cerevisiae [11] . The model describes the evolution of the backtrack depth x \u2265 0, i.e., the spatial distance between the active site of the polymerase and the 3' end of the backtracked RNA. Recovery from backtracking is due to Brownian diffusion of the polymerase with diffusion coefficient D (grey arrows) or to the action of active processes that allow cleavage (orange scissors) of backtracked RNA of length up to a finite length a \u2265 0 and at random times with constant rate r [11] .

We study two statistical properties of the RNA polymerase backtracking for which no analytical results have been reported so far. Firstly, we focus on the distribution of the length of cleaved RNAs.

Discussion. Our work provides analytical and numerical insights into the particle currents emerging in the presence of control mechanisms (evaporation and resetting) on an otherwise unbiased Brownian diffusion, for various boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we have shown that resetting the particle position at stochastic times to a prescribed location leads to Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion. On the other hand, periodic boundary conditions induce stationary particle current that can be decomposed as the sum of diffusive and resetting fluxes. Such a current could be used, e.g., to exert a force on an external load, as in the case of Brownian motors. For ring-like geometries, we have proved a resetting gauge invariance of the distribution with respect to the resetting protocol (direction), resulting into different particle currents. Finally, we have applied our findings to a biophysical model, deriving analytical predictions that involve the efficiency of RNA polymerase backtracking. Our work indicates new avenues for understanding the nonequilibrium features of resetting, e.g., in the study of optimization of resetting pathways for efficient particle transport. Furthermore, we expect that our formalism could be extended to shed light on various biophysical problems described by one-dimensional diffusions with suitable boundary and/or resetting conditions, such as microtubule dynamics [40, 41] , molecular motors [2, 42, 43] , single-file diffusion of water in carbon nanorings [44] , or polymer translocation through nanopores [45, 46] . In this Appendix we report the solution for the Laplace transform of Eq. (1) for P (x, t|x 0 , x r ), the probability distribution of the Brownian particle position in one dimension, initially at x 0 , resetting to x r according the spacedependent resetting rate r c (x). Although the framework that we will present applies to any space-dependent resetting rate, we will focus on the case r c (x) = r \u03b8(a \u2212 |x|), i.e., non vanishing within a segment of width 2a and constant rate r. More generally, we exert an external control on the system, parametrized by \u03c3 c , corresponding to the identification of r c (x) as a resetting rate (\u03c3 c = 1) or as an evaporation rate (\u03c3 c = 0). In this picture, we denote by P nc (x, t|x 0 ) the probability density of no-control, i.e., the probability that no reset/evaporation has occurred up to time t in the space interval [x, x + dx] is given by P nc (x, t|x 0 )dx. In general, P (x, t|x 0 , x r ) depends both on the initial position x 0 and the resetting point x r ; in what follows, we denote this quantity by P (x, t|x 0 ) whenever x 0 \u2261 x r . Note that in the case of evaporation, \u03c3 c = 0, and the probability distribution P (x, t|x 0 , x r ) coincides with P nc (x, t|x 0 ), because the only existing particles are those that have not experienced evaporation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 370, "end": 374, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2616, "end": 2620, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2621, "end": 2624, "text": "41]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2644, "end": 2647, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2648, "end": 2651, "text": "42,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2652, "end": 2655, "text": "43]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2709, "end": 2713, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2759, "end": 2763, "text": "[45,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2764, "end": 2767, "text": "46]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 201, "end": 207, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 446, "end": 453, "text": "Fig. 4c", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 751, "end": 758, "text": "Fig. 4d", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Analogously, following Ref.

For the specific choice, being \u03bb > 1/2 particles reset mostly to the right, making the current positive for almost all values of x r .

This feature follows from the competition of two mechanisms. The first consists in the fact that, as x r becomes larger, more particles reset and contribute negatively to J res (\u2212L) in Eq.

On the other hand, this mechanism becomes less effective as r grows, because the particles reset more and tend to concentrate around x r . Therefore, even for \u03bb \u2212 1/2 slightly positive (negative), the positive (negative) contribution to the current J res (\u2212L) prevails on the negative (positive) one.
