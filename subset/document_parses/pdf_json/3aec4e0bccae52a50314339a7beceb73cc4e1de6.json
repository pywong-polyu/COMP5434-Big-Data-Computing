Although Bangladesh is in the world's thalassaemia belt, the information on this disease is scarce. Additionally, the awareness of this life threatening, but potentially preventable disease is surprisingly poor. However, mass awareness is pivotal for the development of an effective preventive strategy. In this context, the understanding of parental perspectives is essential to grasp the magnitude of the problem. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the parental knowledge gaps and perceptions regarding thalassemia, the barriers confronted by the parents for caring for their thalassaemic children and their attitude to prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis.",

A person who inherits one mutated gene is called a carrier and usually leads a completely normal life. However, those who inherit two mutated genes (one from each parent) will have the disease [3] . Patients with severe forms of this disease require regular blood transfusion and adequate iron chelation therapy to survive as there is no curative treatment for thalassaemias except bone marrow transplantation, which is only available for a limited number of patients due to the high cost and morbidity associated with the procedure [4] . The survival and quality of life of the patients with transfusion dependent thalassaemia (TDT) have been improved dramatically in high resource countries over the past few decades owing to safe transfusion practice, successful prevention programs and access to modern therapies [5] . However, the scenario is still very disappointing in the lower resource setting, where most of the children with TDT die before reaching 5 years and the average life expectancy of thalassaemia patients is around 30 years [6, 7] .",

Unfortunately, up to 90% of patients with serious haemoglobin disorders live in developing countries with limited resources, which mainly includes sub-Saharan Africa and Asia [8] ; and the prospect for these patients is grim. The burden is expected to rise substantially in the coming years in these areas due to the reduction in infant mortality and large population size. However, it is clear from many reports that most of these developing countries have extremely limited facilities for the diagnosis and management of thalassaemias, mainly due to the high cost associated with standard treatment [9] . Thus, it is not possible for resource-constrained countries to meet the ever-growing treatment demand of thalassaemic patients. Moreover, the psychological impact and social stigmatisation among patients and their caregivers is notably higher in these countries [10] . Therefore, reducing the burden of thalassaemias through effective preventive approaches in parallel with widespread awareness programmes is the most critical and cost-effective strategy for resource-poor countries.",

Common strategies include mandatory premarital screening with the option of prenatal diagnosis and therapeutic termination of pregnancy. Some countries, notably Cyprus, Greece, Iran, and Italy, have achieved high success in reducing the birth prevalence of thalassaemia by implementing these strategies [2] . Screening services and prenatal diagnosis with therapeutic termination of the affected pregnancies are also available in Bangladesh, but it is unclear how effective and accepted these preventive strategies will be in Bangladesh. In this context, effective community participation is vital, especially in developing countries like Bangladesh where overall health awareness is very poor among the general population. Thus, engaging the parents or caregivers of thalassaemic children at a community-level would be instrumental in creating mass awareness. Parents or caregivers play a vital role in chronic diseases like thalassaemias. Their knowledge and perspective regarding the disease can help the society to realise the depth and seriousness of the intertwined problems regarding the health, economic and psychological burden prevailing in families of thalassaemic children in resource-poor settings. The current study aims to investigate the parental knowledge and attitudes regarding thalassemia, prenatal diagnosis and practical barriers faced by the parents of thalassaemic children in Bangladesh.",

A multidisciplinary team of experts including a haematologist, public health researcher, parents of thalassaemia children and statistician was formed to develop another section of the study questionnaire to investigate the attitudes and practice towards prenatal diagnosis and barriers. Regarding attitude towards prenatal diagnosis, the following questions were included: have you heard of prenatal screening (yes/no)? would you accept prenatal diagnosis in a future pregnancy (yes/no/not sure)?, have you undergone prenatal diagnosis in a previous pregnancy (yes/no)? would you consider abortion after a positive prenatal test (yes/no/not sure)?. To investigate the barriers faced by parents of thalassaemic children following questions were asked: do you get support from social blood donor clubs? (yes/no), do you have difficulty in getting regular donors and social stigmatization (yes/ no)? do you feel stigmatized in the society? (yes/no).

Only half of the parents of thalassaemic children correctly answered that thalassaemia is a preventable disease. Approximately half (45.5%) respondents were not aware that a thalassaemia carrier is healthy like normal people (16.4% answered: No, while 29% answered: Don't Know). Table 4 reports the association between socio-demographic variables and level of knowledge about thalassaemia among caregivers. Mean knowledge scores were significantly higher in respondents with higher income and education. There were no differences in knowledge score in terms of gender, having thalassaemic children or a history of deaths related to thalassaemia in the extended family.",

This finding is consistent with our prior study involving college students (premarital age group) where over 65% respondents were unfamiliar with thalassaemia despite being the most common inherited condition in Bangladesh [13] . All these results indicate a significant lack of thalassaemia awareness in Bangladesh. Most parents would, in retrospect, have agreed to premarital screening if it were available. We also found that almost all parents would have avoided marriage if they had been aware of their own and their partner's carrier status. In addition, almost all parents felt guilty for not undergoing pre-marital screening. All these findings suggest that thalassaemia is highly unfamiliar in the society and therefore the issue of awareness on thalassaemia should the cornerstone of future prevention strategy in Bangladesh. Besides, almost all thalassaemic children in our study were below 30 years of age. This essentially reflects the poor survival of thalassaemic children in Bangladesh, mainly due to inadequate treatment facilities and high out of pocket cost involved. This again underscore Most parents had knowledge about inheritance, diagnosis, carrier status, and the consequence of marriage between two carriers. These findings suggested better levels of knowledge compared to studies conducted in other South Asian countries [14] [15] [16] . However, nearly half of parents were not aware that carriers are usually healthy normal people without symptoms. This is particularly important since people may conceal their carrier status because of wrong perception. Higher family income and level of education were associated with higher knowledge scores.",

However, a few Muslim countries permit TOP based on the interpretations (named as Fatwa) of Quran and Hadiths issued by respected religious scholars [18, 19] . A Fatwa is a non-binding Islamic legal opinion providing practical guidance for decision-making. In addition, a Fatwa is not country-specific and therefore, it could be utilized by Muslim anywhere in the world. Most importantly, Fatwas related to TOP are not available in public and these have been developed for health care practitioners (HCPs). Pakistan, a South Asian conservative Muslim country, introduced prenatal diagnosis (PND) for beta-thalassaemia in 1994 based on a Fatwa given by two respected Islamic Scholars. However, there is yet no national policy or law governing PND services [19] in Pakistan, although the province of Punjab has mandated premarital screening [20, 21] . Because of the unsettling situation, HCPs encounter dilemmas on religious and legal grounds [19] . Apart from unsolved legal and ethical issues, high cost and lack of awareness, the utilization of PND service is limited in Pakistan even though it has been available for over two decades [19] . In most Muslim countries, religious scholars may not be aware of medical conditions where religious opinion might be necessary to address certain emerging health problems. Therefore, engaging religious scholars in culturally sensitive health issues is expected to bring better policy outcomes.",

We found that most parents were not familiar with thalassaemia before diagnosis in their children and said they would have avoided marriage if they were well-informed. This study has also revealed the parental perspectives of regret, social stigmatisation, and inadequate support for managing regular blood transfusion. These findings would contribute to thalassaemia prevention and intervention strategies in Bangladesh as well as other similar settings elsewhere in the world. ",
