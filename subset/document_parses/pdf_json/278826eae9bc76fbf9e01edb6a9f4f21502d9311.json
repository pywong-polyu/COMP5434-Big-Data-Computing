Toye (2013: 5) stressed the importance of the social, political and cultural context. More importantly still he stressed that rhetoric is not merely the means by which ideas are expressed but also a means by which they are generated. Similarly Wodak (2001: 65-66) argues that in terms of the media discourse it can constitute social practices and not just reflect them.",

            "text": "The deliberately provocative Eurosceptic emotive Post-Truth rhetoric of Grillo in the earlier sections of analysis are not surprising, even when they border on or in fact enter into the realms of hate speech, in his alarmist demonising say of Africans arriving in Italy, posing a threat of tuberculosis. However when the mainstream Italian media gives Grillo yet another platform for such provocation, without challenging the lack of factual substantiation is far more worrying. This was prevalent in a plethora of articles. Sarra (2018) built a news piece around Grillo's quotes in Il Giornale, ahead of the 2018 general election. Grillo claimed only his Five Star Movement and Berlusconi's Forza Italia could win. In quoting Grillo so extensively and putting him centre stage in the story, in Il Giornale's case, to highlight what was deemed the greatest threat to Berlusconi's Forza Italia, they are nevertheless giving Grillo the oxygen of publicity. In building a story around and reproducing his Post-Truth, it could be argued they are giving him and indeed his blog publicity. While Il Giornale in this instance does not produce any Post-Truth of its own. In giving such a platform to Grillo's rhetoric they are helping him to generate his ideas to a public outside his more central political constituency. What Il Giornale is not doing and needs to do, is to actually challenge the unsubstantiated, emotive rhetoric of Grillo (Lewis 2016) . They are legitimising the Post-Truth articulated by Grillo in this instance. In a way, it could be argued this is as worrying as crafting their own and this could be said of other journalists throughout this investigation.",

Johnson then looms large, quoted saying then Chancellor, George Osborne gave \"air kisses\" to International Monetary Fund chief, Christine Lagarde, then describing the referendum fight as a struggle against \"people who know Christine Lagarde and can go mwah, mwah with her\". Johnson is allowed to appeal to the prejudiced emotions of a populous increasingly angry with the elite. There is a suspension of reality, as the Johnson quotes are used to convince the reader of how Osborne is in it (the elite) with Lagarde. There are no supporting facts offered by Johnson or The Sun. Newton-Dunn should be challenging the unsubstantiated position of Johnson, in framing and presenting Lagarde and Osborne as the elite. Instead a story is built around the quote. The Sun is contributing to Post-Truth in its failure to hold Johnson to account, but merely gives him a platform. This further undermines the position of journalism in relaying the facts and questioning potential untruths.",

The Sun does not present the picture of Johnson and his provocative language. Indeed it is only the Telegraph that provides a platform for some of it.

More worringly, much like Newton-Dunn (2019) unless Telegraph readers read the coverage on page two and three, they would not even be aware of how a series of MPs (including on the Tory benches) complained about the prime ministers inflammatory language, replicated by trolls who had made death threats against a series of MPs. Very little of this was covered all the same. \"Epistemic competition is as much about choosing which truths can be considered salient and important as about which claims can be considered true and false, and these choices have important consequences\". (Social Studies of Science 2017). The Daily Telegraph, like The Sun, chose not to highlight the language used by the prime minister, accusing fellow MPs of 'surrender' and 'betrayal'.",

Cameron is not utilised to convince the audience of the veracity of something that is open to conjecture (as was the case with the Telegraph and Daily Mail ). As is customary in news, the piece is built around the authority's quotes. Cameron responded to the Brexit campaigners, saying the suggestion Turkey would join the EU was a \"lie\" (line 30). What is however noticeable from the piece, is that Cameron accused the Brexiters of \"stoking intolerance and division with extreme warnings on immigration\" (lines 1-2). Rather than the emotive compelling seen earlier in the chapter he does provide a rational, substantiated argument for his position in the piece. A spokesperson for Leave did respond to Cameron's arguments, in the piece.",

In terms of the linguistic means by which this was achieved compulsion was effectively employed. Another way of understanding this is such texts reaffirmed for readers what they wished to believe. This flew in the face of the evidence regarding EU immigration, conspicuous by its absence (Wadsworth et al. 2016; Springford 2013; Devlin et al. 2014; Allen 2016) . Beyond the term EU migrant it was even more prevalent. What was apparent was a theme in the discourse equating EU migration with a strain on public services and the benefits system-despite a complete lack of evidence to support this from either politicians and most pertinently, the newspapers themselves. Newspapers were generating and actively constructing their own Post-Truth around these issues.",

Mele argues Trump's presidential campaign forced newsrooms to confront false equivalency head-on. What do you do when the overwhelming accumulation of facts lies on one side of the argument? Do you have to be seen to offer exactly the same amount of copy for the counter-argument? Think back to the BBC's coverage of 'Europe' over the last decade. The number of times the BBC's flagship morning news programme, Today, would start with an interview with Nigel Farage, leader of the then peripheral anti-EU UKIP. Was this not creating a false equivalence-which has now, post the vote for Brexit, become mainstream? Unlike Il Giornale, rather than a cursory comment from other parties and not actually relating to countering Salvini's claim, Ziniti (2019) and La Repubblica spend a lot of the subsequent article demonstrating how the accumulated evidence lies on the other side of the argument, effectively countering Salvini's position-having correctly quoted his position, it has to be said. Like previous articles analysed, La Repubblica refers to a Facebook video by Salvini. Unlike others in this case, Salvini's Post-Truth emotive rhetoric is not just cited and given a platform. Instead at the end of the article, Salvini's emotive and often factually incorrect rhetoric is allowed speak for itself, with the full 30-minute Facebook video offered to readers. It currently has 604,000 views. This way the readers can decide for themselves and realise that what Salvini says flies in the face of the truth. This is a clever way of countering the circumnavigating of the mainstream media by Salvini (and Grillo before him) in the use of social media. It is also more effective than the Reality Check approach, D'Ancona (2017) takes issue with.",

In this sense it could be argued such Italian journalism is more honest and candid, starting from the counter-position, opposing Salvini. The first issue in January 1976 of La Repubblica carried an article by founder Eugenio Scalfari declaring the paper to be a \"journal of information that doesn't pretend to follow an illusory political neutrality, but declares explicitly that it has taken a side in the political battle\u2026\" (Poggioli 1991: 6) .

Mele argues Trump's presidential campaign forced newsrooms to confront false equivalency head-on. What do you do when the overwhelming accumulation of facts lies on one side of the argument? Do you have to be seen to offer exactly the same amount of copy for the counter-argument? Think back to the BBC's coverage of 'Europe' over the last decade. The number of times the BBC's flagship morning news programme, Today, would start with an interview with Nigel Farage, leader of the then peripheral anti-EU UKIP. Was this not creating a false equivalence-which has now, post the vote for Brexit, become mainstream? Is this not, as outlined at the start of the conclusions, Toye's (2013: 5) point about rhetoric is not merely the means by which ideas are expressed but also a means by which they are generated. By this logic, if you do not call out the Post-Truth rhetoric (or indeed hate speech) of the populists, you are complicit with them.",

Yet Johnson's Post-Truth rhetoric and hate speech has surfaced in Parliament and occasionally in his columns in the Daily Telegraph. This suggests at least that it is not always the new digital landscape that is the game changer. Albeit limited, it suggests that there can be different responses in divergent countries, even in Europe. Italian politicians seem to have weaponised the digital landscape in a way that Johnson, as least has not.

Italy's Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, argued vociferously that Europe also needed to pool its debt, sharing the burden across the community. The proposal of Corona bonds was supported by France and Spain-but initially rejected by Germany, Holland and Brussels. This was an historical moment. A furious Conte said: \"If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d'\u00eatre to the people. We are at a critical point in European history\". (Lelliot 2020) Lelliot (2020) argued: \"That just about sums things up. The message being sent out is that Europe is a project for the good times and that when the going gets tough people can only really rely on their own government and the nation state\".",

D'Ancona (2017 refers to the disappointment so many of the disaffected have come to feel with the mainstream political class-and by association the mainstream media. Kaltwasser (2014: 470) argues populism raises issues that are entirely legitimate and \"we should avoid treating populism as an irrational impulse\". D'Ancona (2017: 140) is of the view: \"political disappointment is the handmaiden of Post-Truth, a solvent of trust and a cue to further tribal huddling\". All these lessons need to be learned.",
