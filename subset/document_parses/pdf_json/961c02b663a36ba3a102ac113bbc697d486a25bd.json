Health information systems (HIS) support the collection and use of health related data. However, HIS focus on reporting and are unfit to support decisions. Since data tools are paper-based in most primary healthcare settings, we have produced an innovative Paper-based Health Information System in Comprehensive Care (PHISICC) using a humancentred design approach. We are carrying out a cluster randomised controlled trial in three African countries to assess the effects of PHISICC compared with the current systems. Methods and analysis Study areas are in rural zones of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Mozambique and Nigeria. Seventy health facilities in each country have been randomly allocated to using PHISICC tools or to continuing to use the regular HIS tools. We have randomly selected households in the catchment areas of each health facility to collect outcomes' data (household surveys have been carried out in two of the three countries and the end-line data collection is planned for mid-2021). Primary outcomes include data quality and use, coverage of health services and health workers satisfaction; secondary outcomes are additional data quality and use parameters, childhood mortality and additional health workers and clients experience with the system. Just prior to the implementation of the trial, we had to relocate the study site in Mozambique due to unforeseen logistical issues. The effects of the intervention will be estimated using regression models and accounting for clustering using random effects. Ethics and dissemination Ethics committees in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Mozambique and Nigeria approved the trials.",

Robust evidence on health systems is more likely to gain the credibility of policy-makers and to make it into systematic reviews, guidance development and policy and practice. \u25ba Research targeting front-line health workers in remote, rural areas has to take place where they live and work, which poses serious obstacles in the organisation, management and monitoring of the trials. \u25ba These obstacles, aggravated by the COVID- 19 pandemic, have challenged the mobility of the research team, the availability of the intervention in one of the countries and the duration of the trials.",

Decisions are made by exerting a balanced judgement on the information related to healthcare events, such as making the correct diagnoses or deciding on which vaccinations a child should receive on a given day. In order to properly handle this information, appropriate data support tools and processes are required, referred to as the health information system (HIS), or routine HIS, or health management information system. 1 In reality, though, HISs are primarily designed to report aggregated health events to the higher tiers of the health systems rather than to inform decision making at the point of care. 2 Increasing pressure by donors and governments to collect more and more data has aggravated the situation, through the proliferation of data support tools that have overloaded front-line HWs compromising their capacity to deliver good quality of care and to produce good quality data 3 for higher level decision making.",

The project started in 2015, producing a systematic review on the effects of HIS interventions 6 7 and a framework synthesis on how HIS are understood in the literature in order to learn from past experiences in HIS developments. This global evidence was coupled with studies to characterise the existing HIS in the three countries, to understand how HWs interact with the HIS and to identify entry points for HIS design improvements. With these bodies of evidence the research team was well equipped to engage into a human-centred design (HCD) cocreative process with front-line HW to design an innovative HIS (PHISICC).

For each village, we used Google satellite maps to identify and geo-locate every visible roof.

From the mapped points, 10 per village (with 20 more acting as reserve) were randomly selected and marked on another map used in the field for data collectors to approach households. Where technical problems impeded this approach in a given village, a field supervisor would rotate a bottle on the floor towards the centre of the village and would select at random 10 households in the direction pointed by the bottle, from the outer limit of the village till the centre. 11 Blinding is only feasible for the research team members carrying out the CRCT data collection and the analyses of the CRCT findings.

Cocreation groups were formed in each country with researchers, staff from partner institutions and healthcare workers, led by a team of professional designers. Research team members supervised and coordinated exclusively the feedback on the contents of the tools, to ensure compliance with each country clinical guidelines. At the outset of the process, the design focused on three healthcare areas (ie, antenatal care, vaccination and sick child) and slowly extended the new visual language to other healthcare areas. Initial workshops served to brainstorm on problems and potential design solutions, without any other rule than being comprehensive and not rejecting a single idea. Designers, then, formalised some of the most promising solutions and a first round of exchanges within the cocreation team was used to address misinterpretations or inconsistencies. There were two in-the-field testing rounds in Mozambique, two in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and three in Nigeria and uncountable exchanges through teleconferences and email, in-between. The prototypes were considered final when no errors were detected, were compliant with data needs in each country and comments from the field could not be accommodated in the design concept or there was no consensus on minor or formal issues being raised.",

Ideally, mothers of alive children or women in childbearing age is interviewed in order to obtain information on living children (ie, vaccination history) and death events, respectively, using home-based records if available and accessible. Patients' satisfaction is assessed using the Patient Satisfaction Quaestionnaire (PSQ-18). 22 23 24 Essentially, the tool enables practitioners to investigate the extent to which their healthcare service meets the perceived needs of their client group and pinpoint areas for improvement. 24 The interview will be conducted with consenting individuals as close to their care encounter as possible. 25 Data tools are translated into the official languages of the study countries and pilot tested for consistent meaning and relevance to the setting. Data collectors are also able to communicate in local languages. The Satisfaction of Employees in Health Care survey is a validated tool to assess staff satisfaction. It was first developed and validated in a low-income country (Ethiopia) 26 and later successfully validated in a highincome country (USA). 27 We use a mix of paper and electronic data (Open Data Kit (ODK) 28 ) collection tools. Data collectors are trained to minimise error. Tools are piloted before implementing. ODK data are regularly stored and sent to secure servers, as soon as data collectors reach their office base. Data from paper tools are double entered and compared and sent to secure servers. Each data collection tool has its corresponding electronic database that is cleaned and submitted to the analyses. All data are anonymised at the point of data collection or as soon as possible in the data management process. Data are labelled with an arm code (eg, 'A' or 'B') without any further information allowing to disclose which data items belong to the intervention or to the control arms, ensuring blinding during data analyses.",

One mechanism to address this issue is using a district-based cluster randomisation scheme.

SG ensured the regulatory, ethical and trial monitoring components. AR developed the analytical approaches and made the sample size calculations. RBY, MS and SB adapted the protocol to the context of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and managed the administrative and ethical approvals in the country; AO-I, NE, ON, ANN and ABG likewise in Nigeria; AMM, SML and GM, in Nampula province (Mozambique); JS and TM adapted the protocol and acquired ethical and administrative clearances for Inhambane province (Mozambique). DWB is chair of the PHISICC Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and has coordinated multiple formal and informal inputs. LKK and DWB have advised on the adequacy of the study protocol within the overall PHISICC proposal and TAG advices. All country teams participated in PHISICC workshops and ensured that the protocol was suitable to countries realities; developed data collection tools and training materials. They are responsible for the implementation of the trial in each country. XB-C drafted the first version of the manuscript. All authors commented on several versions of the manuscript.
