            "text": "Understanding influencing factors is essential for the surveillance and prevention of infectious diseases, and the factors are likely to vary spatially and temporally as the disease progresses. Taking daily cases and deaths data during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the U.S. as a case study, we develop a mobility-augmented geographically and temporally weighted regression (M-GTWR) model to quantify the spatiotemporal impacts of social-demographic factors and human activities on the COVID-19 dynamics. Different from the base GTWR model, we incorporate a mobility-adjusted distance weight matrix where travel mobility is used in addition to the spatial adjacency to capture the correlations among local observations. The model residuals suggest that the proposed model achieves a substantial improvement over other benchmark methods in addressing the spatiotemporal nonstationarity. Our results reveal that the impacts of social-demographic and human activity variables present significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In particular, a 1% increase in population density may lead to 0.63% and 0.71% more daily cases and deaths, and a 1% increase in the mean commuting time may result in 0.22% and 0.95% increases in daily cases and deaths. Although increased human activities will, in general, intensify the disease outbreak, we report that the effects of grocery and pharmacy-related activities are insignificant in areas with high population density. And activities at the workplace and public transit are found to either increase or decrease the number of cases and deaths, depending on particular locations. The results of our study establish a quantitative framework for identifying influencing factors during a disease outbreak, and the obtained insights may have significant implications in guiding the policy-making against infectious diseases.",

The estimated mortality rate is 8.1 times higher than seasonal influenza, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Livingston et al., 2020) . The pandemic increased the unemployment rate (Swasey et al., 2020) and is continuing to have a significant impact on the economy (Coibion et al., 2020) . In light of the severe consequences from the COVID-19 outbreak, different public authorities quickly responded to the outbreak through various strategies, including the declaration of emergency, travel restrictions, city lock-down, and enforcing social distancing (Brzezinski et al., 2020) . If properly followed and executed, these measures serve as the crucial first steps to limit physical contact and mitigate the extent of the outbreak before a vaccine is available. Nevertheless, under similar mitigation measures, significant differences are observed in the number of reported infections and the mortality rate across the U.S. (Dong et al., 2020) . This motivates us to explore the underlying factors that result in the heterogeneous disease dynamics for assisting the disease mitigation policies in the remaining phase of the COVID-19, and for better preparing against future risks of unknown infectious diseases.",

With recent advances in ubiquitous computing and epidemiology and the wide adoption of smartphones in the past decade, we are now able to monitor human activities at a fine spatiotemporal level and overlay such dynamics with high-resolution trajectories of disease outbreaks. This, together with the available data on socioeconomic, demographics and historical daily commuting patterns, provides an unprecedented opportunity to scrutinize the impacts of non-epidemiological factors and comprehensively evaluate how these factors drive the fate of the disease outbreak across the U.S.",

            "text": "Existing studies have related social-demographic characteristics and human mobility with the spread of the COVID-19. The social-demographic structure of the population is demonstrated to have a significant effect on the fatality rate. An early study in China (Surveillances, 2020) suggested that people with age greater than 80 years older has the highest fatality rate of 14.8%, and similar findings were obtained from studies in other countries (Dowd et al., 2020; Sannigrahi et al., 2020) . In addition, a study (Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson, 2020) in New York City revealed the existence of racial disparities among the Whites, the blacks, the Asians and the Hispanics in the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, nearly 20% of the U.S. counties had a disproportionate Black population (Millett et al., 2020) , and they accounted for 52% of the confirmed cases and 58% of the deaths nationally. Except for demographic factors, the social and economic factors are also found to affect the fate of the COVID-19 outbreak. The study (Atchison et al., 2020) suggested that households with the lowest income level are six times less likely to be able to work from home (WFH) and three times less likely to be able to self-isolate in the U.K. during the COVID-19. Besides, Stojkoski et al. (2020) mentioned that the high income population is more resilient to being infected by the COVID-19. Finally, extensive efforts have shown that human activities and mobility dynamics are dominating factors that facilitate the spread of infectious diseases (Wesolowski et al., 2012; Vazquez-Prokopec et al., 2013; Qian et al., 2020a; Qian and Ukkusuri, 2020) . Studies suggested both information propagation and human mobility patterns co-affect the epidemic propagation (Wang et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2020b; Yabe et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, Lima et al. (2015) provided evidence that restricting mobility may not eliminate the diseases. And Bajardi et al. (2011) recommended that stricter regimes of travel reduction would have led to a delayed outbreak of two weeks based on the study of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

            "text": "The aforementioned studies highlighted the significant roles played by mobility-related and socialdemographic factors in the disease spreading process. Nevertheless, few studies examined the collective impacts of non-epidemiological factors on the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease. In addition, the impacts of these influencing factors were primarily assumed to be stationary over time and space in the existing literature. The lack of consideration of these aspects will fail to fully reveal the interdependencies among modeling determinants and may result in biased model estimations. To address the issues, in this study, we introduce a quantitative approach, named mobility-augmented geographically and temporally weighted regression model (M-GTWR), to investigate the heterogeneous effects of non-epidemiological factors on the spreading dynamics of the COVID-19. The M-GTWR model can examine the heteroscedasticity of weekly average daily confirmed cases (WADC) and weekly average daily deaths (WADD) during the COVID-19 outbreak and quantify the spatiotemporal effects of the social-demographic characteristics in U.S. counties. By relating daily activity data and inter-county transportation data with the propagation dynamics of the COVID-19, the model confirms that the relationship between the spread of diseases and human activities is spatiotemporally heterogeneous. We also measure how mobility and activity dynamics affect the disease propagation. Our results suggest that counties with a high percentage of black population, a high household income level, a low education level, and a high unemployment rate are associated with more WADC and WADD. Moreover, the impact of human activity dynamics is found to differ spatially. Grocery and pharmacy activities only show positive and statistically significant effects on the COVID-19 cases in rural counties with a low income level, and effects of the public transit activities are tightly related to the WFH and reopening strategies.",

To ensure that the disease dynamics are statistically meaningful, we target the counties with at least 100 confirmed cases from March 23, 2020 to December 13, 2020. In addition, counties with incomplete data are also removed. Finally, we keep the counties within 48 contiguous states. The preprocessing results in 699 selected counties that cover both metropolitan areas (592) and non-metropolitan areas (107) according to the definition in the rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) code (Morrill et al., 1999) . And the spatial distribution of the study areas (redcolored counties) is shown in Figure 1 . The selected counties cover 79% of the total U.S. population. We report that the processed data provides a reasonable scale to understand the non-epidemiological determinants of the COVID-19 propagation and linked with the underlying effects of the social-demographics characteristics and human activities on disease propagation in the metropolitan counties in the U.S. ",

We use the WADC rather than daily cases to smooth the daily fluctuations in the data. As suggested in other studies (Surveillances, 2020) , there is a time delay between the date when an individual was actually infected and the reported date, which is usually two weeks for the COVID-19. On the other hand, human activity dynamics were reflective of the reporting date. To ensure the consistency between the disease and mobility dynamics, we apply a two-week delay to the human activity data to match the disease data. We report that the number of confirmed cases and deaths in the selected counties accounted for 75.5% of the total cases and 76.1% of total deaths during the study period in the U.S, as shown in Figure 2 . These indicate that the dependent variables in the selected counties are representative of the general disease dynamics in the metropolitan areas in the U.S. ",

The dataset demonstrates the changes in visiting frequency of a particular activity category at individual counties and is also indicative of the activity intensity on the corresponding day of the week. To be consistent with the dependent variables, we calculated the average daily mobility in a week based on the daily mobility data. Then, we visualize the mean and standard deviation of the dynamic variables in the selected counties and its comparison with the ground truth data in Figure 3 .

They are collected from the U.S. Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER Geodatabases (Bureau, 2016b) and 2016 American Community Survey (ACS) (Bureau, 2016a) . In light of the varying size of the selected counties, we calculated the population density(POPD) by dividing the total population by the land area. Besides, we measured the percentage of the population by race via dividing the population in each race category by the total population. The socioeconomic factors in our study include the percentage of the population having at least a bachelor degree(BDHP), mean household income(MHIC), and the citizen labor force unemployment rate(CLUE). They are collected from the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS) (Bureau, 2016a) . The socioeconomic factors serve as indirect measures to probe how people may respond to the preventative measures and the economic resilience of the community against the disease outbreaks. Aside from the demographic and socioeconomic variables, we also include several travel-related factors as human activity intensity measures before the COVID-19. The travel-related factors include travel mode factors and public road mileage(MILE). The travel mode factors in our study contain the percentage of the population working at home(WFHP), the percentage of the population taking public transit(PTAP), and the mean commuting time(MTAT). These variables are obtained from the 5-Year ACS statistic (ACS 2011 to 2015) (Bureau, 2015) . Except for the above variables, the MILE is another crucial travel-related factor to reflect the intensity of economic activities in the county. The public road is described as any road under the jurisdiction and is maintained by a public authority. We collected the MILE from the 2018 Public Road Geodatabase (Bureau, 2018) .",

And the geographical airline passenger flow among airports is provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation and Bureau of Transportation Statistics (1999). The Bureau of Transportation Statistics offers quarterly airline and airport origination and destination survey (DB1B) within the U.S, which is a 10% sample of airline tickets (passengers) from reporting carriers. The DB1B has the records of airline passenger volumes in U.S. airports, but it does not contain the information of airline flow among counties.

In this study, we apply the Breusch-Pagan(BP) test to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the dependent variable. The BP test is a classic approach used to detect spatial heterogeneity (Nurhayati et al., 2019) . The null hypothesis in the BP test is that the error variables are equal in all areas: \u03c3 2 1 = \u03c3 2 2 = \u03c3 2 i = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = \u03c3 2 . The alternative hypothesis is that there should be at least one location i, such that \u03c3 2 i = \u03c3 2 . Besides, we use the adjusted Moran's I test to examine the spatial autocorrelation of the dependent variable that varies from time, which is proposed by Gao et al. (2019) . The results for the significance of the spatial heterogeneity and autocorrelation are shown in table 2 and table 3. From the test results, the BP test rejects the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity for WADC and WADD in the 38 weeks period (significant at 0.001 level). In addition, the results of the adjusted Moran's I test demonstrates the spatial misspecification of dependent variables. Moreover, since the Z-score values are positive in the number of WADC and WADC, it implies that the spatial distribution of counties with WADC and WADD is more likely to be spatially clustered.",

The M-GTWR model addresses the nonstationarity issue for the fundamentally heterogeneous and dynamic disease propagation and provides more efficient estimates by assuming the effects of the influencing factors are spatiotemporal heterogeneous. Compared with the global OLS model, the M-GTWR model improves AICc and adjusted R 2 from 59779.59 and 0.54 to 26309.13 and 0.94 for the WADC. As for the WADD, the corresponding AICc and adjusted R 2 are 34801.25 and 0.90 respectively. Instead of the static effects of the influencing factors estimated in the global OLS model, our findings show the effects of the factors vary among regions and time in both models. For estimates of the demographic variables, the coefficient of POPD is positive and the estimates are statistically significant in the WADC and the WADD in the studied counties from the 12th week and 48th week. In particular, the median elasticity of the POPD shows that a 1% increase in the POPD leads to 0.63% increase in the the WADC and 0.71% increase in the WADD on average. In Figure 8 , we visualize the coefficient and t-stats distributions for OLDP from three selected weeks (12th, 30th, 48th) based on the WADC model. The coefficients are observed to be positive and the estimates are statistically significant in around 50% of the studied counties at the 12th week. However, the corresponding coefficients among 34% of these counties gradually shift to negative while the estimates remaining statistically significant at the 48th week. One reason is that the older population are more vulnerable to the disease. This, along with the worse pandemic situation, indicates that the older population are increasingly cautious and adopting better preventative measures, which reduce their chances of being infected as the outbreak proceeded. In addition, among the studied counties that have insignificant effects at the 12th week, 59% of these counties has shifted to have negative coefficients and remaining statistically significant at the 48th week, and the coefficients of the high population density counties (mean population density is 357 population/km 2 ) are more likely to shift to negative in the later stage than the relative low population density counties (mean population density is 288 population/km 2 ). That might because the high population density counties provide better guide for the older population in preventing the COVID-19. Finally, the coefficients are observed to be negative and statistically significant in around 64% of the studied counties at the 48th week.",

Then, the coefficient of the LATP are positive and the estimates are statistically significant at over 90% of counties in the 30th week and 48th week at both models. On the other hand, as shown in Figures 9c, and 9d , while the BLAP is found to be a statistically significant factor in 70% of the counties in the 12th week for the WADC model, the corresponding value drastically reduces to 20% of the counties in the 48th week. Besides, the coefficients are found to be positive in over 50% of the counties for the WADD as shown in Figure 9g , and 9h. This finding is consistent with the previous survey (Millett et al., 2020) , where they asserted that the black communities are more vulnerable due to the spread of the COVID-19 with the lower coverage rate of health insurance. However, As shown of the t-stat in Figure 9a and 9b, more than 40% of counties are observed to have negative coefficient of ASIP in the WADC and the WADD models during the study period, which is more than the number of counties having positive coefficient, including the high population density cities and states (e.g., Californian, Seattle, and Florida). As reported by the studies (Abuelgasim et al., 2020; Raisi-Estabragh et al., 2020) that the Asians have a higher infected rate by the COVID-19 due to the deficiency of Vitamin D and a higher incidence of coronary heart disease. However, the Asians might get warnings from their families and peers who experienced the earliest suffering of the COVID-19, which may help the Asian population to be more aware of the risk of the COVID-19 and may take better preventative actions against the disease in advance. It yields similar results when we apply the normalization of the race population cross the studied counties.",

In the 12th week, the number of counties with a positive coefficient of the CLUE is more than the number of areas with negative effects on both models (24% vs. 17% for the WADC model, and 15% vs. 8% for the WADD model). The unemployed population with unstable(unsafe) workplaces and irregular social activity might intensify the disease propagation as suggested by the previous finding (Poletto et al., 2013) . More importantly, the high population density areas are more likely to have positive and statistically significant effects of the CLUE in the 12th week (e.g., counties in California, Washington, Arizona, Minnesota, and Florida). However, this situation has been changed for the WADC model in the 48th week as shown in Figure 10f . That may be related to the effectiveness of the shelter policy and the the COVID subsidies, which mitigated the sufferings of the unemployment population in purchasing daily needs and helped reduce their daily activity levels. Similarly, the study (Borkowski et al., 2020) also indicates the occupation is the key factor affecting travel time change and infected rate. For the education effects, the number of areas with negative coefficient (tstat < -1.64 ) of BDHP is more than the number of areas with positive coefficient (t-stat > 1.64) in the WADC model (about 30% vs. 10%) and the WADD model (about 40% vs. 20%) during the study period. The reason might be the highly educated population have a higher awareness of the risks of the COVID-19 and are more acceptable to the public suggestions for preventing the COVID-19. On the other hand, the median elasticity indicates 1% increase in the MHIC results in 0.83% increase in WADC and 1.17% increase in WADD. The reason might be that commercial activity and business communication are more active in counties with high MHIC. As for the travel-related effects, the effects of MILE are statistically significant and positive on the WADC and WADD models at all studied counties during the study period. It indicates that the availability of public transportation facility is more likely to increase the number of WADC and WADD. In particular, the median elasticity of the MILE suggests that a 1% increase in the MILE results in 1.03% increase in the WADC and 1.04% increase in the WADD on average. For the travel mode effects, the median elasticity shows that 1% increase in the MTAT results in 0.22%(0.95%) increase in the WADC and the WADD on average. The effects of MTAT on the WADC and the WADD are heterogeneous among counties during the study period. For example, the MTAT for counties in California is positively (t-stat > 1.64) related to WADC and WADD. However, the counties in Arizona have negative effects (t-stat < -1.64) of the MTAT on the WADC and the WADD. The underlying reason might be that the long MTAT in high population density areas intensifies the disease propagation. Whereas, the large scale of urban structure with low population density effectively reduces the contact space among people. The t statistic estimations for the PTAP is summarized in Figure 11 . In particular, about 80% of counties have positive coefficients in the 12th week in both models (see Figure 11a and Figure 11c ).The long contact duration and close proximity among passengers in transit system are likely the causes for this observation (Qian and Ukkusuri, 2020) . It also indicates that the public transit closure strategy may effectively curb the propagation of the COVID-19 in the early stage. However, the effects of the PTAP in most counties became less significant or insignificant in the 48th week. This highlights the temporally varying effects of the modeling determinants and suggests that the PTAP is no longer a determining factor in the later stage of the pandemic. Besides, as shown in Figure 12 , there is a higher number of counties showing that the WFHP is negatively related to WADC and WADD in the 12th week than in the 48th week. This finding is consistent with the estimated results of the PTAP and suggests that WFH plays a more significant role in the early stage of the disease. Besides, the evidence of WFH policy applied at Australia (Beck et al., 2020) also verifies our insights. The local daily activities directly respond to the WFH policy and travel restriction. Thus, the estimated coefficients of the human activity variables may serve as a measure of the effectiveness of disease prevention and mitigation strategies. In the M-GTWR model, the GPPC is positively (t-stat>1.64) related to the WADC and WADD in about 30% of the counties in the 12th week of 2020 as shown in Figure 13a , and Figure 13c . More importantly, the positive effects are found to be significant in rural counties or low-income areas in California (e.g., Tulare), Arizona (e.g., Yavapai), and New York (e.g., Long Island area). This is on the opposite to the estimated effects of the recreation and parks activities (not present in the model due to the high correlation with the GPPC) in the high population density areas. Although daily activities increase the disease propagation, people might have better personal prevention (e.g., social distance and mask-wearing) or reduce their daily activities in the high population density areas. Besides, the effects of the GPPC on the WADC and the WADD become less significant in most of the counties in the 48th week (see Figure 13b and 13d). The WOPC is either negatively (t-stat<-1.64) or insignificantly related to WADC and WADD in most counties. In addition, the effects of TSPC are significant in areas with high population density (e.g., Fresno county in California) and low population density areas (e.g., Apache county in Arizona). These might be related to the transit usage policies that apply in different areas. And this discrepancy in terms of TSPC highlight the importance of modeling spatial heterogeneity to more accurately understand the impacts of non-epidemiological factors. The distribution of the t stats of public transit is shown in Figure 14 ). In the 12th week, the number of counties having negative coefficient of TSPC on the WADC and the WADD is more than number of counties having positive coefficient, however, this situation has been changed in the 48th week. This might be related to the public transit usage restrictions on the early period of pandemic and reopen strategy at the later stage. Therefore, the analysis of all the influencing factors shows that the effect of the influencing factors is spatiotemporal heterogeneous. In conclusion, based on our analysis, the coefficients of the POPD and MILE yield persistently positive and statistically significant in studied counties during the studied period. This clarifies the population density and public infrastructure facilities are the primary factors that intensify the number of cases and deaths during the pandemic. On the other hand, the impacts of the several social-demographic variables (e.g., BLAP, MHIC, and PTAP) are observed to become less significant or even insignificant in the later weeks (e.g., the 48th week). This suggests that static variables may have greater impacts on the disease dynamics in the early stage of the pandemic than in the later stage. Nevertheless, the human daily activity variables (e.g., WOPC, and TSPC) are sensitive to the disease prevention policies and their impacts remain statistically significant during the entire course of the COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of modeling spatial and temporal heterogeneity to gain more precise understandings of the impacts from non-epidemiological factors. Finally, the insights for disease prevention based on the results of our study are summarized below.",

Our results indicate that the concentrated population and the availability of public infrastructures (such as public transit and public road mileage) tend to promote the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, limiting human contacts through reduced human activity levels is found to be largely effective, nevertheless, the effects of which vary significantly over space and time. This indicates that the WFH policy and travel restrictions may not serve as universal mitigation measures, and future strategies should be more tailored to the demographics and socioeconomic of the particular location. Besides, we find that the older, the black, and the Latino are more vulnerable to the COVID-19 than other population groups. The reason may be attributed to either physical weakness or low-risk awareness. The highly educated population is observed more likely to comply with the restrictions during the COVID-19 outbreak. For the commuting time, its median elasticity shows that a 1% increase in the MTAT to work results in 0.22% increase in the WADC and 0.95% increase in the WADD on average. Finally, the change in human activity patterns also presents a mixed impact on disease dynamics. In particular, the scale of the impacts is found to be closely related to the activity intensity and activity types. The grocery and pharmacy activity is found to be significant in low population density areas. And activities associated with public transit usage lead to a positive impact on the WADC and the WADD. This indicates the major role played by the public transit during the COVID-19 and implies the need to restrict public transit usage, especially in high-transit demand areas.",

However, the efficiency of the intervention strategies(e.g., wearing face masks, maintaining social distance, and handwashing) for mitigating the spreading of the COVID-19 is a lack of exploration due to the limited data source. More importantly, since these strategies are at a great cost to the economy, the optimal control strategies to balance the public health and freedom of movement, the economy, and society deserve further investigation. Besides, although we estimated the effects of the several types of activities, we do not differentiate the risk level of detailed activities due to the data limitation (e.g., we estimated the effects of the recreation activities, but the exposure risk of the bar and book store might be different.). And the understanding of the exposure risk of the detailed activities provides directional suggestions for the policy-makers in conducting control strategies for the COVID-19 prevention. Finally, the study indicates the severe disparities respond to the crisis of the disease, which might even intensify the community inequity and racial bias on the more vulnerable groups. Thus, the resource allocation strategies (e.g., health care accessibility, wage guarantee system during the pandemic, and social welfare distribution) should be explored for maintaining a sustainable environment in future crises.",
