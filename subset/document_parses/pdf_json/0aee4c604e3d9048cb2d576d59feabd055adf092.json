In one prototypic project that is being implemented in Ramanagara District of Karnataka, a south Indian state, we encountered many such issues. They ranged from issues related to availability of dedicated space to set up the hub-studio, inconsistent internet connectivity (particularly in remote areas) and inadequate digital literacy among the grassroot community health workers who hail from villages.

The objectives are to examine the impact of two different types of training methods for non-specialist medical officers and community health workers of Ramanagara District of Karnataka, a state in south India. The control group received the traditional training model, which consists of one-time onsite classroom training and no further mentoring/handholding. The study group receives extended mentoring for six months in addition to the onsite classroom training. A training hub was established inside the premises of the Ramanagara District training Centre (that comes under the administrative control of the District Health authorities), and the mentoring was done remotely using digital technology [2] consisting of live video-based interactions with healthcare workers, with the aim of skill-building. Sessions included case-based discussions and presentations on dedicated topics related to case-finding, simple interventions that community health workers can do, and referral mechanisms. Participants are the Community Health Workers [CHWs: Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Auxiliary Nurses Midwives (ANMs)] of the three primary health centres (PHCs) of the study group (total of 37 CHWs). The CHW were specifically chosen for this study, since they would be the one doing door to door surveys and they would be knowing the villagers even at personal level. The sessions occur fortnightly for each of the three study PHCs, one at a time. Total six sessions are planned for each of the study PHCs covering the following aspects: (1) sad, worried and nervous persons (b) violent, fearful and disorganized persons (3) suicide and how to manage suicidality (4) behavioural problems related to substance use (5) do's and don'ts (and myths) about mental health in the community and (6) rehabilitation and disability benefits that are available to those with mental illnesses. Curriculum for the sessions was prepared by the investigators keeping in mind specific expected roles of the CHWs (identification, referral and basic counselling). As per the Project ECHO protocol, each session includes anonymised case presentations by the CHWs (generally related to the topic of the day) followed by discussion. Case discussion is followed by a didactic on the day's topic by the hub experts (in local language, Kannada). Additionally, each session also includes a recap of the fortnight's work and a problem solving discussion related to any work related difficulties that the CHWs may face. CHWs are supposed to log in independently or all gather in their respective PHCs for each of the sessions. To date, we have completed 20 online sessions. Since the ultimate purpose of this implementation research is to develop insights that could be generalized across India, we set up the training hub (Studio) in the district headquarters (Ramanagara) instead of NIMHANS that is located in a metropolitan city. The goal was to further decentralize and empower the health system at the district level, which is essential to integrate mental health into the general health care. The district headquarters hub is involved in training the health care workers of 3 study group PHCs. An important outcome measure of the project is the number of patients (with mental health problems) identified, referred and given interventions. Below we describe the various technology (and related) administrative challenges we encountered in launching and sustaining these online mentoring sessions.",

However, due to space constraints, the physical space was provided by the District Training Centre (DTC), Ramanagara, situated about 500 m away from the District Hospital. Although state-level authorities permitted us to use the physical space for conducting the training, another goahead was required from the principal of DTC as multiple other training activities also occur at the same site. At times, training sessions had to be rescheduled due to calendar conflict. Rescheduling was a complicated task since it required coordinating with a whole group of CHWs to set up a new time for the session. This duplicate work took a lot of time and was sometimes frustrating.",

Also, occasional power cuts resulted in delays (and sometimes cancellation of sessions). Lastly, CHWs' areas of operation are in more peripheral locations where internet connectivity is even worse. Therefore all 9 Sessions to date have happened after the CHWs gathered in their respective nodal PHCs. Attending classes online, utilizing smartphones to engage in digital learning requires some technical expertise and experience. CHWs, who are generally 10th class graduates, faced difficulties engaging with the video conferencing software (zoom application in this case) to join the classes, selecting appropriate audio options, and minimizing noise interference during a session. CHW's needed repeated instructions and training regarding using the technology. Some had issues in the comprehension of the English language that came in their way of signing and logging in. The Junior Research Fellow had to make dedicated visits to PHCs for familiarizing CHWs with the application. Apart from technical difficulties, administrative issues such as frequent transfer of authorities and controlling officers and a lack of dedicated space for the studio compounded the problem. Lastly, though internet penetration has significantly increased in the country, its actual presence in rural hinterlands is still not optimal [12] .",

            "text": "Most of the CHWs are lay persons with education less than 10 standard, because of which there were difficulties in explaining the concepts to them. The CHWs also faced resistance while they were doing house to house surveys. The residents of the villages were not very forth coming when the help was offered and showed lot of resistance when they were told their family member had signs suggestive of mental illness. The response from such people has been that they would take the patient to a religious place or to a spiritual healer for the treatment. This reflects that the stigma is still widely prevalent in our country, more so in rural areas as pointed out previous studies [13, 14] . Another important obstacle was that the CHWs were not paid regular salaries by the state government. For majority of the part they were on strike to increase their salary and this further delayed the process of training them. COVID-19 was another hurdle, because of which the CHWs were not welcomed by the villagers, fearing that they would be carriers of infection as travel and meet multiple people on day to day basis. The research being conducted by NIMHANS itself created a hurdle. People in the interior villages felt that NIMHANS is meant for treatment for severely mentally ill and they are not severely mentally ill, so they refused accepting any form of suggestion by our team. This highlights the importance of incorporating psychiatric services in general hospital and if the same research was conducted by general hospital this obstacle might not have come-up.",

Slowly, but surely there was a positive change in the confidence and attitude of CHWs towards mental health. They started identifying cases during their routine visits to households. Some of the CHWs were proactive in their initiatives and would accompany patients to their respective PHCs to ensure that they received treatment. When patients could not be treated at PHCs, and required referral to higher centers, the CHWs coordinated the care by interacting with the research team by telephone or video. Psychiatric case-finding by the CHWs is a relatively new concept in the public mental health of India [15, 16] , and this augurs well for the future. In fact, in 6 months, 37 CHWs (of the study PHC) have identified more than 220 patients with deemed psychiatric problems residing within their communities. It is reasonable to assume that many of them may not have reached treatment centers at all, but for the active outreach and coordination by the CHWs. Technology has played a significant role in this endeavour. It has shown that if there is persistent and committed effort, the challenges (in its use) can be overcome towards bridging the treatment gap.",
