Data on comorbidities 10 years prior to the date of COVID-19 were identified to calculate the exposure of interest: CCIS of 0, 1-2, 3-4, and > 4. 2 Outcomes of interest were (1) a composite of death, diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (ICD-10: DB972A), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and (2) death. Logistic regression models adjusted for sex and age as a continuous variable were employed to associate CCIS 1-2, CCIS 3-4, and CCIS > 4 with odds of outcomes. The models were used to estimate the absolute risk of both outcomes according to CCIS groups across ages 40-85 for both sexes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 578, "end": 579, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS"}, {"text": "A total of 4480 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, of which 2911 (65.0%), 1112 (24.8%), 288 (6.4%), and 169 (3.8%) had a CCIS of 0, 1-2, 3-4, and > 4, respectively ( Table 1 ).
