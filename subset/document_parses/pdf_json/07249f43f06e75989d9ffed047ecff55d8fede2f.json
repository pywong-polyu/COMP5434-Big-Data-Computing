            "text": "Objectives The social unrest that began in Hong Kong in 2019 became a threat to public mental health, such as for depression and post-traumatic stress disorders. A supportive family environment is the most effective protective factor for mental health problems for young people who are exposed to conflict and violence. This study investigated the outcomes of a brief mindful parenting workshop on parent mental health and family functioning. Methods Using a randomized controlled trial design, 54 parents of adolescents and young adults were randomized into intervention group and waitlist control group. Depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, negative emotions, family functioning, and family conflicts were measured at baseline (pretest), following training, and at 3-month follow-up. Results We found a significant improvement in family functioning among parents in the intervention group when compared to those parents in the control group (F [1, 51] = 4.41, p = .04). When we further controlled the child-initiated physical conflict as covariate, a significant reduction of self-rated levels of depressive symptoms was found in the parents from the intervention group when compared to the parents in the control group (F [1, 49] = 5.14, p = .03). Conclusions We found preliminary evidence that a brief mindful parenting workshop can strengthen parent and family mental health at times of social unrest.

A few studies have investigated how social unrest has affected family relationships since the 2014 umbrella movement. In a qualitative study, Ho et al. (2018) found intra-familial conflict and different levels of renegotiation in family relationships of active participants and bystanders in the political movement. In a study of young adults and their family members, Chan et al. (2018) found that lower relationship quality and lower congruence in their political attitudes predicted more serious subsequent family conflicts, suggesting a close relationship between political and family life. Both studies suggested that some families may have stronger resilience while others experience serious and persistent conflicts, which may require professional attention.",

Mental health issues, particularly post-traumatic stress, are common during social unrest but they can be moderated by positive parental mental health and positive parenting (Dubow et al., 2012) . Post-traumatic stress is caused by actual or threatened death or serious injury, direct exposure to violence, witnessing a significant person's exposure to violence or an accident, or indirect exposure through hearing aversive details of the event (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) . Core symptoms of post-traumatic stress include re-experiencing the trauma, avoidance, and a persistent sense of threat. Prolonged symptoms may lead to issues with affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and relationship disturbances (Cloitre et al., 2018) . About 6-20% of individuals develop post-traumatic stress disorder after a potentially traumatic event (Kahana et al., 2006) . Other mental health issues including depression, anxiety, paranoid ideation, and aggression have been found in adolescents with extensive exposure to community violence (Al-Krenawi & Graham, 2012) .",

The parent-adolescent relationship is often fueled by age group distinctions, as many parents experience challenges and difficulties where peer relationships of their children overpower family influences (Soliz & Rittenour, 2012) . Such age differences can extend to the influence of birth cohort, and communication among members of different generations or birth cohorts can be problematic when the social status and economic resources of one cohort have conflicts with those of another (Hummert, 2012) . In the context of social unrest, intensive conflicts among generations within families that are characterized as major differences in essential goals, needs, and values, and are perceived as irresolvable may lead to an enduring and destructive mutual violence over time (Halperin, 2015) .",

For example, Lippold et al. (2015) found that mindful parenting can improve mother-adolescent communication by reducing parental negative reactions to information, adolescent perceptions of over-control, and by improving the affective quality of the parent-adolescent relationship. In a study with parents of children 10-14 years of age, Coatsworth et al. (2015) integrated mindfulness with the Strengthening Families Program and compared the effects with the Strengthening Families Program alone in a randomized controlled trial. Results showed that both programs improved multiple dimensions of parenting, including interpersonal mindfulness in parenting, parent-youth relationship quality, youth behavior management, and parent well-being, with fathers showing more sustained effects with the mindfulnessenhanced program than with the Strengthening Families Program alone. In a study targeting highly stressed mothers of adolescents aged 12 to 17, Chaplin et al. (2021) reported significantly larger improvements in parenting stress relating to parent life restrictions, relationship with spouse, and emotional awareness in parenting when compared with those completing a parent education program without a mindfulness component. In addition, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 mindfulness-based parenting programs for parents of adolescents reported a small, post-intervention reduction in parenting stress and youth outcomes (Burgdorf et al., 2019) .",

Two additional mindfulness exercises were included in view of the special family and social context of the participants. First, \"Finding the ground\" was introduced and participants were offered additional choices for objects of attention as there was a concern that some participants might have some difficulty in focusing on their breath due to COVID-19, anxiety, panic, or post-traumatic stress (Williams, 2020) . Second, we included the Soles of the Feet (SoF; Singh et al., 2011) practice which enables parents to manage their anger or other upsetting events by shifting the focus of attention to a neutral part of their body and dissipating the negative emotional arousal. This practice can be very useful for managing conflictual situations in family interactions.",

All analyses were carried out according to the intention-to-treat approach. The participants' missing values were imputed using the lastobservation-carried-forward method. A two-sided p value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. In the case of significant results, effect sizes were calculated. Cohen (1988) suggested that d = 0.2 be considered a small effect size, 0.5 a medium effect size, and 0.8 a large effect size. All quantitative analyses were performed using SPSS version 27.0. For qualitative analyses, a process of inductive analysis was employed to derive concepts, themes, and models, through a detailed reading of interview data (Strauss & Corbin, 1998; Thomas, 2006) . Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory analysis (Strauss & Corbin, 1998) . The researcher constantly moved between change mechanism of mindfulness-based intervention and understanding client's experiences of changes. A \"bracketing\" of assumptions and purposes of the study was required, especially during the early stages of analysis. \"Reflexive validity\" was met by constantly revisiting the original ideas and the formation of the categories (Stiles, 1993) . The process of analysis was carried through repeated readings and interpretations of the interviews. Although it is often assumed that themes emerge from qualitative data, we agree with Braun and Clarke (2006) that themes are in fact interpretatively identified and are influenced by the researchers in terms of how the data are interpreted.",

However, Alkoby et al.'s study was not designed for parents. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a brief 4-session mindful parenting program in Hong Kong, a city that had experienced social unrest for a year at the time of study, and investigated if it can strengthen their emotion regulation, promote better mental health, and reduce family conflicts.",

First, the social unrest aroused families' suspicion and sensitivity about data collection, and they were very reluctant to reveal their personal data to the researchers. To manage this, we adopted an indicated preventive approach and used a self-reported depression screening before the start of the intervention. Second, some parents hesitated to participate in a face-toface program due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A ban on gathering and social distancing created hurdles for the project team to recruit more parents to attend the workshops. Collaborators at secondary schools had been preoccupied with adjustment in academic study and placed less priority in arranging parent programs. The number of participants recruited for the study was much smaller than our planned sample size. Further studies in this context should be prepared for these challenges in recruitment and develop strategies to reduce the parent's resistance in data collection.",

When we considered the changes in the intervention group only, we found marginal improvement in depression from pre-intervention baseline to 3-month follow-up.

Such differences may be due to the context of the present study, when social unrest was experienced by the participants during the course of the study. Indeed, many parents and families anecdotally reported still being overwhelmed by the political protests and media coverage. In addition, the city was facing another wave of COVID-19 pandemic while the last set of data was being collected. These external contingencies resulted in limitations to the study design not only with regard to participant recruitment but also the extent of data that could be collected, both in terms of breadth of the information and the duration of the data collection period. On a positive note, the present study provides salutary information that can inform future research under social unrest and pandemic conditions.",
