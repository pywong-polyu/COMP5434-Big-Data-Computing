Here, we perform a large-scale, spatiotemporal analysis of human mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic. We derive human mobility from anonymized, aggregated telecommunication data in a nationwide setting (Switzerland; 10 February to 26 April 2020), consisting of \u223c1.5 billion trips. In comparison to the same time period from 2019, human movement in Switzerland dropped by 49.1%. The strongest reduction is linked to bans on gatherings of more than five people, which are estimated to have decreased mobility by 24.9%, followed by venue closures (stores, restaurants, and bars) and school closures. As such, human mobility at a given day predicts reported cases 7 to 13 d ahead. A 1% reduction in human mobility predicts a 0.88 to 1.11% reduction in daily reported COVID-19 cases. When managing epidemics, monitoring human mobility via telecommunication data can support public decision makers in two ways. First, it helps in assessing policy impact; second, it provides a scalable tool for near real-time epidemic surveillance, thereby enabling evidence-based policies.",

            "text": "Prior literature has suggested the use of human mobility data to model the COVID-19 epidemic (8) . Mobility patterns have been inferred from point-of-interest (POI) check-ins (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) and from location logs of smartphone apps (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . Other works have used telecommunication data to model spreading patterns (27, 28) , for exploratory analysis of mobility patterns (29) (30) (31) , for network analysis of structural changes in mobility (32) , and for modeling the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 (28) , but none have yet empirically explored the link between telecommunication data and policy measures. Establishing such a link would provide a scalable tool for near real-time disease surveillance under policy measures and, in particular, enable evidence-based policies. Previously, the value of telecommunication data for disease surveillance has been studied in the context of malaria (33, 34) , influenza (35) , and other infectious diseases (36) (37) (38) , where the objective was to make spatiotemporal forecasts. In contrast, this paper demonstrates the utility of telecommunication data for near real-time assessments of COVID-19 policies. In fact, nationwide data from mobile telecommunication networks have been used by governments during the first wave of COVID-19 (39) . However, to the best of our knowledge, empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of telecommunication data for epidemic surveillance in the context of COVID-19 is absent.",

Our analysis is based on large-scale, granular data of human movements (anonymized and aggregated) consisting of \u223c1.5 billion trips in Switzerland during the first COVID-19 wave (10 February to 26 April 2020) derived from telecommunication data. Using regression models, we estimate 1) the impact of policy measures on human mobility and 2) how mobility predicts the growth in reported COVID-19 cases. By establishing that policy measures reduce mobility and that mobility predicts reported cases, mobility insights can be used to inform when to implement policy measures. The findings are therefore of direct value to public decision makers: Monitoring human mobility through telecommunication data provides an effective and scalable tool for near real-time epidemiology and, thus, management of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

We first study the reduction in mobility due to five different policy measures (bans on gatherings of more than 100 people, bans on gatherings of more than 5 people, school closures, venue closures, and border closures). We then estimate the extent to which reduction in mobility predicts decreases in reported case growth. Here, we compare the predictive ability over a forecast window from 7 to 13 d. Taken together, the results confirm the effectiveness of policy measures for reducing human mobility and, in turn, human mobility as a predictor of reported cases by a lead time of approximately (approx.) 7 to 13 d. The two-stage approach is repeated for total trips, three different modes of mobility (train, road, highway), and two different purposes for mobility (commuters vs. noncommuters). In an extended analysis, we further perform a mediation analysis. Here, we decompose the reduction in new reported cases due to the policy measures into 1) the Significance To manage the current epidemic, policymakers need tools that help them in evidence-based decision making. In particular, decision support is needed to assess policy measures by their ability to enforce social distancing. A solution is offered by our work: We use mobility data derived from telecommunication metadata as a proxy for social distancing, and, based on this, we demonstrate how the effect of policy measures can be monitored in a nationwide setting. Compared to the status quo, this provides a clear benefit: Monitoring policy measures through case counts has a substantial time lag, whereas our approach allows for monitoring in near real time.",

Other cantons had lower case numbers and put policy measures into effect during a later phase of the epidemic. We followed a systematic procedure (SI Appendix, section 1) based on which we encoded policy measures according to five categories: bans on gatherings (>100 people), bans on gatherings (>5 people), school closures, venue closures (stores, restaurants, bars), and border closures.

For a precise ranking, the width of the credible intervals must be considered. Here, the aforementioned policy measures appear more effective at reducing total trips than the other two policy measures (i.e., bans on gatherings of more than 100 people and border closures). In particular, bans on gatherings of more than 100 people are linked to a comparatively smaller change in total trips than bans on gatherings of more than 5 people (i.e., the 95% CrIs of the estimates are disjoint).

Highways are often used for long-distance travel, which is more likely to be suspended during an epidemic, while roads also include movements within close proximity and are more likely to correspond to routine or essential activities (e. g., grocery shopping). For the ban on gatherings and school closures, the largest reduction is seen in trips by train, which can be explained by the widespread use of public transportation in Switzerland. Finally, we observe a wide credible interval for the estimated effect of venue closures on trips by train. A potential reason for this is that the use of trains (e.g., for visiting stores) varies across cantons, as some cantons (e.g., Zurich) have a high population density with extensive shopping infrastructure, while others (e.g., Appenzell Innerrhoden) have only a few stores due to their low population density, resulting in the need for travel to visit stores.",

For a 13-d ahead forecast, a 1% decrease in the total number of trips predicts a 1.11% (95% CrI: 0.9 to 1.6%) reduction in the reported number of new cases. Overall, mobility predicts decreases in the reported number of new cases over the whole forecast horizon. The predicted decrease is larger for longer forecasts.

Our analy-sis is based on nationwide telecommunication data during 10 February to 26 April 2020 from Switzerland, which were used to infer nationwide mobility patterns. This supports monitoring of the COVID-19 epidemic as follows: 1) We first studied the link between policy measures and human mobility. In particular, we performed a difference-in-difference analysis quantifying how mobility was reduced due to five different policy measures (bans on gatherings, school closures, venue closures, and border closures). The largest reduction in total trips was linked to bans on gatherings of more than five people, followed by venue closures and school closures. Overall, the policy measures resulted in substantial reductions of human mobility. 2) We then studied the link between human mobility and reported COVID-19 cases. Reductions in mobility predicted decreases in the number of reported new cases. Specifically, a reduction in human movement by 1% predicted a 0.88 to 1.11% reduction in the daily number of new cases of COVID-19 over a forecast horizon of 7 to 13 d. Our modeling approach with telecommunication data therefore provides near real-time insights for disease surveillance. Taken together, the findings enable quantitative comparisons of the extent to which policy measures reduce mobility and, subsequently, reduce reported cases of COVID-19.",

Specifically, such data capture all movements of individuals carrying mobile devices without explicit user interaction, including those from nonresidential and even foreign individuals. Mobile devices routinely exchange information when searching for signals from adjacent antennas; hence, metadata are retrieved regardless of the underlying mobile service provider. Second, such metadata can be collected in an anonymized manner that is compatible with data privacy laws. Third, movements at a microlevel (e.g., trips to other households, school, and work) can be inferred. Thus, compared to alternative sources of mobility information such as check-ins or smartphone apps, telecommunication data are considered to be more complete (8, 40, 41) . Fourth, unlike smartphone apps, telecommunication data are also available in low-income countries (43) . Finally, telecommunication data are measured with high frequency (e.g., daily), thereby enabling regularly updated monitoring as needed by decision makers. Based on these benefits, telecommunication data appear to be highly effective for policy monitoring during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

            "text": "This work is subject to the typical limitations of observational studies. First, the findings depend on the accuracy of the data on COVID-19 cases. Second, our models are informed by recommendations for COVID-19 modeling (44) and, therefore, follow parsimonious specifications to isolate features of the epidemic for policy-relevant insights. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that there exist external factors beyond those that are captured by the spatially and temporally varying variables in the models. To address this, we use flexible models and conduct extensive robustness checks (SI Appendix, section 6). Third, the model linking policy measures to mobility estimates effects, while the model linking mobility to cases is predictive. The different objectives of the models address the needs of public decision makers: The former serves policy assessments and the latter epidemiological forecasting, respectively. Therefore, the estimates from the former are identified with a differencein-difference analysis and may thus warrant causal interpretations under certain assumptions (SI Appendix, section 4A). On the other hand, the estimates from the latter are conditional associations since the model does not control for that policy measures reduce both mobility and cases. Therefore, the latter model predicts reductions in reported cases from reductions in mobility when both reductions are driven by policy measures (see SI Appendix, section 4B for a discussion of this approach). Fourth, our findings are limited to our study setting, that is, the first wave in Switzerland. Future research may confirm the external validity of our findings by analyzing other countries or time periods. Inferring mobility patterns from telecommunication data is inherently coupled to the coverage of such data and our definition of trips. Only movements for individuals who carry a mobile device with a SIM card are included. In particular, trips are not included for individuals who do not carry SIM cards. Similarly, trips may be counted several times if an individual carries several SIM cards (e.g., when carrying both a phone and a SIM-based tablet). It is also possible that trips by children, elderly, or other groups of the population with less phone usage are underrepresented in the data. Furthermore, microlevel movements are not observed but inferred via triangulation between antennas through the use of a positioning algorithm achieving state-ofthe-art accuracy. Despite these limitations, telecommunication data are considered to be scalable and, in particular, more complete for inferring mobility patterns compared to alternative data sources (8, 40, 41) . Moreover, our objective is not to obtain accu-rate estimates of mobility in itself, but to evaluate the predictive ability of telecommunication data for reported case growth. Our analysis confirms telecommunication data as such a monitoring tool.",

Based on the telecommunication data, mobility estimates are inferred as follows (Fig. 5 ): 1) Telecommunication data are collected at the level of antenna. 2) Telecommunication data at antenna level are used to infer microlevel movements of individuals via triangulation. 3) Data on microlevel movements are used to count movements between postal codes (named trips) over time. This procedure is performed to capture mobility levels in the population. 4) The data are further aggregated at the cantonal level per day to link them to policy measures and COVID-19 case numbers.

The locations of SIM cards within antenna areas are determined via triangulation between antennas through the use of a positioning algorithm (51) . A high-level description of the algorithm is as follows: Every signal from a SIM card in the telecommunication data is associated with a probability distribution over locations that represents the uncertainty of its actual location in a given antenna area at the time. The location is estimated from two random variables: the radius R, given by the distance of the signal from the origin of the antenna area, and its angle \u0398 to the antenna azimuth. Here, R is Gaussian distributed with empirical mean and variance estimated via maximum likelihood, and \u0398 follows a multinomial distribution depending only on the antenna azimuth and its bandwidth. The inferred locations are subject to a delay between signals between antennas and SIM cards. To address this, the location at a given point in time is estimated by marginalizing the probability distribution of the radius over the empirical distribution of signal delays estimated from all observations. Details are available in ref. 51 . In sum, by tracking the location of SIM cards over time, we are able to capture microlevel movements of individuals.",

For comparison, public transport through train is an important mode of transportation in Switzerland (https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/mobilitytransport/passenger-transport/travel-behavior.html) that is relevant for explaining the results. The purpose of mobility was classified based on trips to/from work (called commuting) and all other trips (called noncommuting). This differentiation was based on the home and work locations of individuals (in terms of postal code area). These locations were derived from the most frequent geographic location of individuals between 8 PM and 8 AM for home locations and 8 AM to 5 PM for work locations. Afterward, both home and work locations were matched against the departure and arrival (postal code area) of a trip to determine whether the trip was to/from work and hence labeled commuting.

Rather than modeling the disease dynamics themselves (as with a compartment model), our focus is on estimating the relative effect of other determinants, namely policy measures and mobility. The use of negative binomial distributions is common in epidemiological modeling, as it allows for overdispersion in the dependent variable (i.e., the number of trips and the reported number of new cases). Furthermore, each model uses a loglink between the dependent and explanatory variables. For the model of the reported number of new cases, it enables us to capture the exponential growth in cases during the initial stages of an epidemic, also observed in our data. For the model of mobility, it makes the estimates relative to the observed levels of mobility. Both dependent variables were found to fol-low negative binomial distributions (with overdispersion).

We thereby account for unobserved factors that affect both policy measures and mobility (for the former model) and mobility and cases (for the latter model). 3) Time effects are modeled in two ways. On the one hand, we include weekday fixed effects to control for variations in the implementation of policy measures, levels of mobility, and reporting/testing across weekdays (e.g., mobility is higher on weekdays, whereas testing is lower on weekends; thus, reported cases are lower on weekends and tests conducted on weekends may be reported on Mondays or Tuesdays). On the other hand, we incorporate a trend variable that controls for changes in case dynamics or behavioral adaptations toward social distancing that occur over time since a canton first reported a case. This could for instance occur due to unobserved changes in adherence to other policy measures (e.g., wearing masks and keeping physical distance of at least 1.5 m) over time.

Since the logarithm of zero is undefined, we then set z it = q it + 1 and include the logarithm of z it in the model. The associated parameter \u03b3 (k) is therefore interpreted as the percentage increase in relative mobility given a 1% increase in the number of days since a canton first reported a case. The rationale for including z it is that individuals may adapt their mobility behavior over time irrespective of social distancing policies. Therefore, the variable captures how mobility would trend over time even if the policy measures were not implemented. The variablelog z i = T \u22121 T t=1 log z it is the time average of log z it in canton i (the bar over the expression denotes an average value). The variable is included in the model to allow the canton-specific effect \u03b8 (k) i to be correlated with log z it over the cantons. Such correlation would, for instance, arise if the date that the first COVID-19 case is reported in each canton depends on the unobserved canton-specific factors. As an example, the date the first case is reported in a canton could depend on the (unobserved) adherence of inhabitants to social distancing recommendations. If such correlation exists but is ignored, it would instead enter the error term of the model, leading to a violation of the exogeneity assumption and incorrect parameter estimates. By including log z i , we essentially make \u03b8 (k) i a Mundlak-type correlated random effect (56) . The benefit of correlated random effects over fixed effects or standard random effects is that they use only the within-unit variation to estimate parameters (and, hence, give identical estimates to those of fixed-effects models) while also having the random effects property of estimating the variation in the unobserved heterogeneity via partial pooling. Note that time averages of the policy measure variables or weekday effects are not included in the model since those are conditionally exogenously determined and, therefore, uncorrelated with the model errors. We refer to ref. 57 for a detailed discussion of the underlying benefits of this approach relative to fixed effects.",

The prior on \u03b3 implies that we expect the relative outcome to increase by 1% for each 1% increase in the number of days since the first reported case. The intercept, overdispersion parameter, and standard deviation of the canton random effects are given weakly informative priors. The prior on \u03b4 w(t) states that the effect of a given weekday that is not Monday should fall within 50 to 150% of the Monday effect.

(A) Total number of trips per canton for the first week after all policy measures were put in effect in all cantons (25 March to 1 April 2020). (B) Total number of trips for the same week in 2019 (i.e., as reference year). For this week, the total number of trips dropped from \u223c186 million (in 2019) to \u223c95 million (in 2020), i.e., a reduction of 49.1%. (C) Percentage change in total trips across 26 subnational levels (cantons) for 2020 vs. 2019 (when aligned for day-of-week patterns). The reason for the comparison to 2019 is to show the reduction in mobility relative to a reference year, while accounting for seasonal changes in mobility. A higher reduction in mobility is observed for cantons that also reported a high number of COVID-19 cases (i.e., Ticino and Geneva). (D) Reduction in trip count by mode of mobility. (E) Reduction in trip count by purpose of mobility.
