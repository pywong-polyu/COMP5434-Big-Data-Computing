The sample comprised of 100 participants (Male \u00bc 50; Female \u00bc 50) who were under the age range of 18-25 years. Purposive sampling was taken to gather the data. Attitudes Towards Disabled Persons (ATDP) Scale and the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire were administered on the participants. All the responses were entered on the SPSS software which was analysed through descriptive statistics, t-test, and Pearson's correlation. Findings of this study showed that both males and females had negative attitude towards physically disabled person. Furthermore, males and females were equally empathetic towards physically disabled person. Consequently, there were no gender differences in the attitude and empathy of youth towards physically disabled persons. Also, significant and positive correlation was seen between the two constructs, i.e., attitude and empathy. These results indicated a need of destigmatization about disability especially physical disability in the society.",

As per WHO, it is estimated that the aggregate amount of persons with disabilities has already exceeded one billion (WHO, 2011) . In India, as per the 2011 Census, there are about 2.68 Crore people who are 'disabled' which is approximately 2.21% of the whole population (Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, 2016; Verma et al., 2016) . The condition of differently abled people, especially in developing countries like India, is distressing. Regardless the laws and protection provided by government and its agencies, there is an immense stigma associated with disability, and differently abled persons are still seen as dependent persons and are even denied of their basic human rights, including education, employment and movability (Janardhana and Naidu, 2011) . Sometimes, the families of disabled person deny that their family member is differently abled because of the fear of losing social status and reputation in society (Janardhana et al., 2015) . Basically, disability itself has become a 'sin' or 'taboo' in the Indian society. Further, there aren't even proper laws which allow disabled people to property rights. The social attitudes of citizens of the country have led to policies by policy makers which aren't favorable to the disabled section of the population.",

            "text": "It is a well-known that attitude has intertwined into the fabric of our daily lives and has become a vital element in the field of social psychology. Renowned social psychologist, Gordon Allport, had dubbed attitude as 'the primary building stone in the edifice of social psychology' (Allport, 1954) . Whereas, empathy is referred to as an emotional response to the perceived predicament of other person. It is viewed as the ability to experience similar emotions as that of the other person. Howbeit, it is crucial to note that empathy is the genesis that leads to attitude change. This change has become a necessity in our society especially towards certain individuals, groups or communities and thus, the present paper focuses one such group, that is, physically disabled persons. The aforementioned persons are viewed with negative attitude and apathy. In one research, the attitudes of pre-service teachers of Jordan and UAE towards persons with disabilities were explored. The findings exhibited negative attitudes of teachers towards disabled persons (Alghazo et al., 2003) . Therefore, the current paper provides the perception of youth in terms of attitude and empathy towards physically disabled people. Thus, the present research is imperative for the destigmatization of the affected group which is still experiencing exclusion (Morris, 1991) and is vulnerable in the society. Also, the need for modifications in the national policies for persons with disabilities (PWD) laid by the government of India is emphasized.",

Attitude has multiple meanings, but in general, it has an orientation towards actions, or responses. Allport (1935) has defined attitude as, \"a mental or neural state of readiness, organized through experience, exerting a directive or dynamic influence on the individual's response to all objects and situations to which it is related\". In the world of social psychology, attitude is used to predict the action of persons. Attitude is divergent from human behavior; this means, as stated by Leon Festinger (1954) that the individual behavior is hardly affected by their changing attitude. Further, attitude can be positive, negative or neutral. For instance, a person may believe that disabled individuals have low intelligence (negative attitude), or a person who practices the art of meditation is healthy (positive attitude).",

Each of these dimensions is interlinked to one another. These components are also known as the tri-component view (Eagly and Chaiken, 1993) . The affective element involves emotional reactions; the behavioral element involves one's predisposition or intention to act in such way that it depicts his/her attitude; and the cognitive element showcases the beliefs and thoughts towards the object of attitude. This model has an underlying assumption: there should be consistency between feelings, beliefs and actions of a person. If a disturbance occurs, then it will lead to anxiety and tension and the individual will try to bring his/her system back to equilibrium. On the contrast, LaPiere inflicted in his study that cognitive and affective component do not always match with behavior (LaPiere, 1934) .",

Williams (1984) , Radley (1993) and Bozo (2009) have explained that people can make sense of their disabilities through the context of their personal biographies which in turn must be influenced by and tangled in with, the cultural values of the society in which they reside in. This statement clears that any disability is part of the function of the society which is failed to given recognition. Thus, terms like 'disabled', 'special', or 'handicapped' prevail to exist because they are not physically constructed, but also socially constructed. Nonetheless, physical disability has significant consequences on social relationships, mental health and well-being of a person. For instance, blindness limits a person's mobility and thus, the person is heavily inclined upon other people to finish his/her daily tasks. This causes the blind person to demand diverse things from others which makes him/her an object of ridicule. This affects the disabled person's social relationships and this person even questions his/her identity as a human being and also questions their sense of self.",

Empathy is referred to as an emotional response to the perceived predicament of other person. It is viewed as the ability to experience similar emotions as that of the other person. In positive psychology, empathy is studied along with egotism, and a balance in egotism and empathy is perceived to be a portal towards altruism, forgiveness and gratitude. Egotism infers to the motive that a person pursues either for personal gain or benefit through certain behavior (Baumister and Vohs, 2007) . Altruism is the behavior that is aimed at benefitting another person which can be invoked through personal egotism or empathic desire to help another person. Gratitude is the appreciation of the actions of another person and forgiveness is \"a freeing from negative attachment to the source that has transgressed against a person\" (Thompson et al., 2005) . However, renowned philosophers such as Aristotle (384-322 BC), Thomas Hobbes (1588 -1679 or psychologists as Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) had debated whether empathy, or egotism, or both fuel prosocial human behavior.",

Piliavin and Chang have opined (1990) , \"There appears to be a paradigm shift away from the earlier position that behavior that appears to be altruistic must, under closer scrutiny, be revealed as reflecting egoistic motives.

            "text": "Empathy is significant in order to form and maintain different forms of social relationships, and also helps in the development of prosocial behaviors (Roberts et al., 2014) . However, empathy varies person to person, that is, empathy is categorized into two categories: cognitive and affective empathy. Cognitive empathy is the extent to which one successfully guesses someone's thoughts and feelings (Wlodarski, 2015) . This is more associated with visual perspective taking or complex mental challenges such imagining what the other person might be thinking. Also, greater cognitive empathy is known as empathic accuracy, where an individual has the precise knowledge of the contents of the other person's mind (also involves the feelings of that other person). On the other hand, affective empathy is inclined towards the emotional aspect of an individual. Hence, it is also called emotional empathy, which is sub-categorised into three components: i. emotional contagion (having the similar feeling as that of another person); ii. Personal distress (one's own feelings of distress in reaction to perceiving another's plight); and iii. Empathic concern/sympathy (the feeling of compassion towards another person). All of these accumulate to form emotional empathy. However, in social psychology, affective component of empathy is studied and shown more reliance than cognitive empathy as cognitive empathy might be linked to false consensus effects and other egocentric view of social psychology. For instance, in a study by Hynes et al. (2005) , found a differential role of the orbitofrontal cortex in affective and cognitive empathy. They saw that the medial orbitofrontal cortex was more engaged in affective empathy rather than cognitive empathy.",

These skills are used on day-to-day basis such in planning, remembering, learning, or managing certain tasks. Miyake and colleagues (2000) have posited three subdomains of executive functions, that is, mental set shifting, inhibitory control, and information updating and monitoring. Each of these functions is stimulated by different brain regions to perform diverse functions, like attention.

This scale has three different forms: ATDP-O, ATDP-A and ATDP-B. However, for the current study, ATDP-O was utilized. The ATDP-O Scale consists 20 statements to which the participants choose from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree, using a six point Likert Scale. The administration of this questionnaire takes up to 15 min. The reliability was this scale was established through four means: test-re-test, parallel, split-half test, and covariance of test items. ATDP has an average reliability coefficient of .80 (Yuker and Block, 1986) . Further, the content validity of this scale was established through literature view, and item analysis. The criterion and construct validity was made by comparisons with other attitude scales. Scores for the ATDP-O Scale ranged from 0 to 120.

The attitudes of youth today are mix, with some conservative and some liberal attitudes towards different concepts in life like disability.

Nevertheless, such attitudes can also be seen in different parts of the world as well, although the youth in developed countries are assumed to be open minded, but the case is opposite of the assumption with people having mixed attitudessome conservative, some liberal, and some neutral attitudes.",

As per Article 1, Convention on the Rights of persons with Disability, disability is recognized as a \"long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may impede their complete and effective contribution in society on an equal basis with others\". Finkelstein (1980) has told that countries where division of classes exist, in such societies, disabled persons are looked upon as a misfortune to both the family and the person suffering from disability itself. Moreover, physically disabled person suffer the most especially in Indian society (Bhat, 1963) . She says that in some tribes, children with physical disability were killed at birth, and in urban cities, the concept of infanticide, that is, killing a child at birth, was practiced, especially in Asia, Africa, Oceania, and America because of their detected physical disability. Also, UNICEF has told that a disability becomes problematic when people in the society hold problematic attitudes and create environmental barriers for them.",

            "text": "Another crucial concept that was studied in this research was empathy towards physically disabled persons. Empathy means to understand and share the emotions of another person as if it is your own feelings. Empathy is of two types mainly: affective and cognitive empathy. The former taps the emotional empathy within the person, whereas the latter taps a person's thoughts and feelings of another person. In general, people look at any individual with disability with pity, which is basically sympathy. People think that a person with disability cannot carry out most of the life tasks, and they also are sensitive in nature. Such assumptions are false because people who are disabled, let it be physical disability can carry most of the task on their own and they are normal individuals like non-disabled persons. But, due to the lack of empathy in our society, a stigma and discrimination towards disabled pupil still prevails. Further, this study leaned more towards affective empathy, although cognitive empathy was mutually exclusive in some items of the questionnaire used (Toronto Empathy Questionnaire). The current research also used a well-known questionnaire, namely, 'Attitudes Toward Disabled Persons' (ATDP) Scale (Yuker et al., 1960) . This study used purposive sampling to attain the desired population, that is, youth, and applied descriptive statistics, Independent samples t-test and Pearson's correlation on the respective responses. Moreover, gender differences in attitudes and empathy of youth were explored. However, no significant difference was found in the attitudes of male and females towards physically disabled persons (H 1; t \u00bc -1.06). Similarly, no significant difference was present in the empathy between males and females towards physically disabled persons (H 2; t \u00bc -.46). This is because of certain cultural factors present in our society and also because certain males and females look at disabled people with equality rather than inferior to them (Tamm and Prellwitz, 2001) . In a country like India, disabled individuals are seen as vulnerable and burdensome. Such an ideology arises from the Indian scriptures and folklores which has been passing on from one generation to another, and still prevails in the modernized society where laws and benefits exist for any disabled person. In India, a term called 'Charak Sinhala' exists which means that diseases or any sort of misfortune exists due to the result of misdeed in the previous life (Mukherjee and Wahile, 2006) . Even though we live in a rapid world of development and advancement, yet such ideology exists in the minds of youth today. Thus, due to such mind-sets in both the genders, getting a difference in their attitudes became difficult.",

Contradictory, the result came out to be negative in both females as well as males, that is, no significant difference between the two genders. Similarly, Wilson and Scior (2013) did a review of past literatures on the attitudes of physical and intellectual disabilities. They found that most of the studies depicted males and females having negative attitude towards physically disabled persons. They also mentioned that it was due to the implicit attitudes of non-disabled people. Implicit attitude refers to the unintentional introspection of one's personal past experiences which mediate in favourable or unfavourable response (feelings, thoughts, behavior) towards a social object -person, thing, situation, or any phenomenon (Greenwald and Banaji, 1995) . Furthermore, in developing countries like India, there are several factors due to which a negative attitude has been created in the minds of youth. For instance, the superstitious traditions which still view physically disabled persons as a sin, and therefore, at times, subject disabled individuals to various detrimental treatments (Sengupta, 1996) . Also, prevention of physically disabled person to participate in social gathering by families, or the lack of education or employment opportunities towards the disabled sector (Kalyanpur, 2008) have created a narrow mind-set in the young minds that the disabled people are more of a burden to the society than an asset itself.",

Fortunately, the findings although non-significant depicted that females and males were equally empathetic towards physically disabled people, though females slightly more empathetic than the latter. This is because girls seemed to be more sensitive and social when it comes to approaching people with disability (Georgiadi et al., 2012) . Also, in the present research, it was checked whether there was any significant relation between the attitudes and empathy among youth towards physically disabled persons (H 3 ). The result for this hypothesis came out to be true that there was a significant relation between the attitudes and empathy of youth towards physically disabled persons (r \u00bc .305). This means that the more empathy in a person, the more positive attitude of a person towards physically disabled persons and vice versa. Such a finding was found in another study where empathetic activities applied on nursing students in order to make their attitudes positive towards disabled persons (Ge\u00e7kil et al., 2017) . Lastly, a statistically significant relation was tested between attitudes and subtypes of affective empathy among youth towards physically disabled persons (H 4 ) . Surprisingly, the result came out be positively correlated to two subtypes of affective empathy, that is, emotional contagion and sensitive behavior. This result was interesting because some items in both the types had aspects of cognitive empathy. Emotional contagion refers to the tendency of a person to mimic and coordinate the facial expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another individual (Hatfield et al., 1994) . Basically, someone's triggering of certain emotions and behaviors in other person. Whereas, sensitive behavior refers to 'assessment of emotional states in others by indexing the frequency of behaviors demonstrating appropriate sensitivity' (Spreng et al., 2009 ). Both of these subtypes tap not only affective empathy, but also the thoughts and feelings of other person, that is, cognitive aspect of empathy. This showcases empathy plays a crucial role in the attitude of youth towards physically disabled persons.",

The insights of the study showed how physically disabled people are still seen as crippled, or disadvantaged by the current youth which was surprising because we live in a world where we have accepted other communities like LGBTQ, yet the youth feels uncomfortable when it comes to disabled people. However, they are becoming more accepting with time as it was visible through the results of empathy. Still, awareness and interventions at different sectors of the society is required to normalize disability in our society.",
