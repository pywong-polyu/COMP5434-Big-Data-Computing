This study aimed to map and assess the spatial risk for hospitalization due to Community-Acquired Pneumonia in children under 5 years of age and its association with vulnerable areas. Methods: Ecological study in the city of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The study population consisted of hospitalized under-5 children, diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto-S\u00e3o Paulo-Brazil, from 2012 to 2013. Data were collected in different databases, by a trained team, between March 2012 and August 2013 and from the 2010 Demographic Census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The 956 urban census tracts were considered as the units of analysis. The incidence of cases per 10,000 inhabitants was calculated by census tracts during the study period. For the identification of the spatial risk clusters, the Kernel density estimator and the Getis-Ord Gi* technique were performed. Generalized additive models were used to verify the association between areas with social vulnerability and the occurrence of childhood pneumonia. Results: The study included 265 children under the age of five, hospitalized due to community-acquired pneumonia. A concentration of cases was identified in the regions with greater social vulnerability (low income, poor housing conditions and homelessness), as well as a lower occurrence of cases in the most developed and economically privileged area of the city. The majority of the children lived in territories served by traditional primary healthcare units, in which the health surveillance and family and community focus are limited. It is important to highlight that the tracts with the highest degrees of vulnerability, such as those identified as high vulnerability (urban) and very high vulnerability (subnormal urban clusters).",

According to this agenda, one of the main challenges is morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia and, if uncontrolled, in 2030 it is estimated that the disease will be responsible for 735,000 deaths of children under 5 years of age [2] . The actions developed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, in the period 2000 to 2015, led to a considerable drop in the incidence (30%) and mortality (51%) of pneumonia in young children, globally [3] . However, the most recent world estimate indicates that the disease is still responsible for 8800 deaths of children under 5 years of age per year, with a greater concentration in developing countries [2, 3] . These estimates are alarming, since there are effective interventions for the prevention and management of this disease, available at low cost, such as antibiotics and vaccines [4, 5] . Furthermore, the concentration of child morbidity and mortality from pneumonia in developing countries reflects social inequities, which lead to greater exposure to risk factors and hinder access to preventive, diagnostic and treatment actions for the disease [6] .",

As Brazil is a country with continental dimensions, it presents marked socioeconomic and cultural differences among its regions, which have an impact on the health of the population, especially among children [7] . Studies in the Brazilian context have suggested a change in risk factors for the worsening of pneumonia among children under 5 years of age, and research is recommended to investigate other risk factors not yet explored, especially in the community [7, 8] . At the community level, there is evidence that pneumonia mainly affects areas where there is a concentration of poverty -such as irregular settlements (known as favelas), areas with high environmental pollution and areas of difficult access [2] . Accordingly, pneumonia mainly affects an excluded population, in social and geographic terms [9] .",

Next, the search for the geographic coordinates of each address was carried out, using the Google Earth technology, which is accessible without charge, then the technique of georeferencing the cases was performed using the ArcGIS software (v10.5). For the identification of spatial clusters at risk for the occurrence of CAP hospitalizations in children under 5 years of age, the Radius of the distance was measured using the Incremental Spatial Autocorrelation (ISA) tool provided by the ArcGIS software (10.5), which tested 30 distances, with 7589 km being the result of the most pronounced distance, with p < .01 [20] . Subsequently, to verify the spatial association of child hospitalizations for pneumonia, an analysis of the Kernel density estimator and the Getis-Ord Gi* technique was performed. The reason for the application of Kernel is justified by the exploratory approach and, therefore, for the elaboration of maps of point density and the production of a choropleth map. Following this, an analysis of Getis-Ord General G, G(d), was carried out, which consists of a global index to evaluate the spatial association of an attribute based on statistical distances and calculated from the sum of values for a given distance.

When the p-value is significant (p < .05), the null hypothesis can be rejected and the z-score value becomes important, as it reflects statistical significance; in this case, if the z-score is positive, the observed G-Index is higher than expected; this indicates that the high values for the attribute are grouped in the study area, configuring a risk value. When the value of the z-score is negative, the observed G-index is lower than the index expected, indicating that low values are grouped in the study area [21] . In addition, the z-score reflects statistical significance, in which +/\u2212 3 have a 99% confidence level [22] .

If the value corresponds to the extreme of the simulated distribution, it is an event with significance [24] . For all tests, type I error was set at 5% as statistically significant (p < .05). Subsequently, the Getis-Ord Gi* technique was applied, a local association indicator that considers the values for each location -in this case, each census tract -based on a neighborhood matrix. In the analysis, a z-score is generated; for statistically significant census tracts, there is a positive z-score, that is, higher zscores equate to more intense clusters of high values (hotspots).

For example, a family with a well-nourished child, whose parents have a good level of education, but live in an area of social vulnerability (such as subnormal urban clusters or favelas) due to low income, may have difficulty taking the child to the health service at the first signs of the disease, causing the evolution of a severe condition, which requires hospitalization.",

In this context, childhood pneumonia continues to be a socially contained and politically neglected disease [2] .

The hypothesis suggested is that, in areas with adequate access to health services, children are diagnosed at the first signs of respiratory impairment and receive early treatment, decreasing the magnitude of the vaccine's protective effect; whereas, in areas with problems of access to early diagnosis and treatment, the protective effect of the vaccine on the child population would have a greater impact. Furthermore, in addition to protection at the individual level, vaccination coverage of the exposed population contributes to collective protection, controlling the circulation of the etiological agent [40] . The non-governmental organization Save the Children advocates the development of action plans for pneumonia, integrated with development strategies for the health systems [2] . The plans must involve the investigation of children in areas of higher risk, ensuring access to trained teams, equipped for the proper diagnosis and treatment of the disease and supported by an effective referral system [2] . The Brazilian health system is guided by the organization in Health Care Networks, with PHC being the main gateway, care coordinator and organizer of the actions and services available in the network, aiming to optimize access and the use of the existing resources [41] . The relevance of integrating child monitoring services and effective referral and counter referral mechanisms should be noted [42] , particularly in the first years of life, when vulnerabilities to morbidities are greater.",
