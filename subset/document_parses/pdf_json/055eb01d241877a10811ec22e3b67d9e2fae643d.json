            "text": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a fatal systemic inflammatory syndrome. HLH has been reported as a rare immunerelated adverse event (irAE) in patients receiving immunotherapy with nivolumab, ipilimumab, and/or pembrolizumab. The data are limited to case reports and case series. The objective of this research is to compile data on this rare but potentially life-threatening adverse event of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and identify the common agents that cause this irAE, clinical spectrum, and successful management strategies to assist the treating oncologists. A review was done using PubMed database. Eligible articles included case reports and case series published from January 1, 2015, through February 1, 2021. Reports published in languages other than English were excluded. Data were compiled into a detailed supplementary table and simple descriptive analysis was used to interpret data. A total of 22 cases were included, which constituted 14 individual case reports and two case series. The immunotherapy prescribed consisted of antibodies against and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in all 22 patients. Out of them, immunotherapy consisting of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) antibodies was prescribed in nine patients. Fever was the most common symptom at the presentation (90.9%). The most common laboratory findings were anemia (90.9%), thrombocytopenia (90.9%), and elevated ferritin (90.9%). All the patients received steroids (100%). HLH responded to treatment in 19 patients. Three patients died. Three patients were rechallenged with immunotherapy, with no recurrence of HLH. HLH in the setting of ICI therapy is lifethreatening, but potentially treatable with early detection. However, diagnosis is often delayed due to difficulty in differentiating the presenting symptoms and laboratory findings from complications of cancer and other therapies. Majority have shown an adequate response to standard HLH treatment; however, some required a longer course of corticosteroids. HLH is not always associated with other irAE. Rechallenging with immunotherapy was successful in some patients after completing treatment for HLH.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) break the co-inhibitory signaling pathways and recondition the anti-tumor activity of immune cells. Immune checkpoint blockade promotes antitumor immunity by blocking intrinsic down-regulators of immunity, such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) [4] . Since the mechanism of action of ICI depends on the inhibition of the physiological barrier of immune activation, they could potentially cause immune-mediated inflammation of various organ systems [5] . These are recognized as immune-mediated or immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These irAEs usually have a delayed onset, prolonged duration and are unique compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy [6] .",

HLH has clinical and laboratory features that are similar to cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

The main characteristics of these cases are summarized here (Supplementary Material 1, www.wjon.org). Majority of the 22 cases were men (n = 14), and the mean age of the patients was 55 years (range 26 to 78 years). Immunotherapy was prescribed for metastatic melanoma (n =12), lung cancer (n = 3) or other cancers (n =7). Other cancers were metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, metastatic thymic carcinoma, metastatic prostate carcinoma, metastatic breast carcinoma, metastatic bladder cancer and pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma. The immunotherapy prescribed consisted of antibodies against PD-1/PD-L1 in all 22 patients. Out of them, immunotherapy consisting of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies were prescribed in nine. The time between the first infusion and the onset of HLH ranged from a few days to 1 year. A few patients developed other immune-related toxicities, such as immunemediated hepatitis (n = 5), hypophysitis (n = 2), lymphocytic meningitis (n = 2), hepatic cytolysis (n = 2), colitis (n = 1), pneumonitis (n = 1), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (n = 1), thyroiditis (n = 1), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (n = 1) and autoimmune thyroiditis (n = 1). The characteristics of the 22 patients are shown here (Supplementary Material 1, www.wjon.org). All patients fulfilled the HLH-2004 criteria for HLH and required in-patient level of care. Fever was the most common symptom at the presentation (90.9%). The most common laboratory findings were anemia (90.9%), thrombocytopenia (90.9%), elevated ferritin (90.9%). Only nine patients had an elevated soluble CD25 (40.9%). A bone marrow/liver biopsy was performed in 19 (86.36%) cases, revealing features of hemophagocytosis. One patient had a negative bone marrow biopsy initially and on repeat found to have hemophagocytosis. Although other potential causes of HLH such as infection and progression of the cancer were considered in all cases, there was no sufficient evidence to confirm the association. Thus, it was concluded that HLH was secondary to ICI except for one patient who developed HLH during treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib following pembrolizumab, and therefore was unable to confirm which agent caused HLH. All the patients received steroids (100%). Five patients were treated with etoposide (22.7%), one with intravenous immunoglobulin (4.6%), five with cytokine blockade (tocilizumab in four cases and anakinra in the other), and three patients received immunosuppressive therapy (mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and cyclosporine). HLH was resolved by the treatment in 19 and three patients died. Three patients were rechallenged with immunotherapy, with no recurrence of HLH.",

It has been reported in patients receiving immunotherapy with nivolumab, ipilimumab, and/or pembrolizumab [12] [13] [14] 17] . However, this is one of the rare irAEs; only one case was identified among the 745 patients included in one of the three pharmacovigilance databases [18] . HLH should be suspected when a patient on ICIs develops unexplained fever, cytopenia, and elevated transaminases. The diagnosis is challenging because it may mimic other common conditions in oncology patients such as sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute liver failure [19] . Other irAE such as autoimmune hepatitis may also present with similar clinical features and laboratory findings [20] . Extremely high ferritin, usually more than 3,000 \u00b5g/L is a helpful but a nonspecific marker for HLH. The diagnosis of HLH is based on fulfilling the published diagnostic criteria used in the HLH-2004 trial [9] . However, it is important to note that oncology patients have many other causes for elevated ferritin such as transfusion, sepsis, and liver inflammation [21, 22] , etc. Soluble CD25/soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) alpha is a more specific biomarker, although it needs to be specifically studied in the ICI-HLH setting [23] . Further, hemophagocytosis in bone marrow can be seen in sepsis, after blood transfusions [24] , etc. Overall, it is important to recognize the clinical and laboratory features of HLH and perform a comprehensive evaluation to find the underlying etiology [25] .",

It combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy (etoposide, corticosteroids, cyclosporin A, and, in selected patients, intrathecal methotrexate), followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in persistent, recurring, and/or familial disease. Initial treatment is given based on the HLH-94 protocol in addition to treatment of the causative disease. HLH-94-based therapy includes etoposide and dexamethasone given at tapering doses over 8 weeks. Upon review of three melanoma patients who developed ICI-related HLH, it was clear that anti-IL-6 therapy seems a very promising strategy for this entity allowing rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of the abnormal laboratory results. Interesting trials testing alternative therapeutic approaches have been initiated, including those incorporating ruxolitinib, anakinra, alemtuzumab and emapalumab and currently are being explored [25] . It is important to note that therapy should not be delayed while awaiting specialized immunologic testing or genetic analysis [26] .",

Retrospective analysis of seven relapsed or refractory EBV-HLH patients who were treated with nivolumab on a compassionate-use basis at West China Hospital has led to complete response in five patients [27] .
