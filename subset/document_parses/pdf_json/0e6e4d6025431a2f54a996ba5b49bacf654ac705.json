In this process, antibody-producing B lymphocytes are isolated from mice after immunizing the mice with specific antigen and are fused with immortal myeloma cell lines to form hybrid cells, called hybridoma cell lines. These hybridoma cells are cultured in a lab to produce monoclonal antibodies, against a specific antigen. This can be achieved by an in vivo or an in vitro method. It is preferred above all the available methods to produce monoclonal antibodies because antibodies thus produced are of high purity and are highly sensitive and specific.",

Polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous mixtures of various antibodies with the potential to identify multiple epitopes. Polyclonal production of antibodies will increase the potency of the immune system and offer it the potential to convey a fast and effective response against any bacterial or viral insult. Polyclonal sera have multiple epitope binding properties, which makes them a useful chemical agent for a wide range of applications. Polyclonal sera have been used for many years as a treatment against toxin-producing microorganisms as well as disease-specific microorganisms [6] . The method of manufacturing leads to batch-to-batch variability that poses a risk of transmitting blood-borne diseases. Another disadvantage is that these antibodies have low specificity, and hence, comparatively high doses are needed to achieve the desired result during experimentation. Also, polyclonal antibodies cannot be used to treat chronic diseases. Due to a number of these disadvantages associated with polycomb antibodies, there is a necessity for isolating antibodies that are specific. Therefore, mAbs are created by somatic cell technology, which is sensitive, highly specific [6] .",

Furthermore, about 1 in 100 cells will be viable hybrid cells. Therefore, there are a number of unfused cells within the media [1] . This step allows the selection of the fused cells from all the unfused cells. This is achieved by incubating the cell mixture followed by culturing for 10-14 days in HAT media (a selection media). HAT medium contains hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine. Aminopterin present in HAT media blocks the power of cells to synthesize nucleotides by the de novo synthesis pathway. Hypoxanthine and deoxythymidine allow cells with functional hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) genes to survive through salvage pathways. Due to a limited life span, unfused B cells perish within a few days. Unfused malignant neoplastic cells die as a result of the lack of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) gene. The presence of aminopterin blocks their ability to synthesize nucleotides through the de novo pathway [10] . Therefore, the remaining viable cells left in the media are the hybrid cells; these hybrid cells have the ability to grow and divide on HAT media because they have functional HGPRT gene from the B lymphocytes, which make them HGPRT positive, and thus, they can grow in unlimited concentration on HAT media [8] .",

Generally, animals like mice that are used in the production of monoclonal antibodies could carry many viruses such as viscus virus, retrovirus, reovirus, herpes virus, and thymic virus, leading to cross-contamination or infection in humans [18] . This poses a major threat for cross disease transfer from mice or rats to the human. \u25a0 Despite purification, there is no guarantee that monoclonal antibodies made using the hybridoma technique are virus-free. \u25a0 The fusion of human lymphocyte and mouse myeloma cells may result in the production of unstable fused cells. \u25a0 In humans, there are no stable myeloma cells, suitable for the process of antibody production that can be used to substitute mouse myeloma cells.",

Prior to the introduction of hybridoma technology, antibodies were created by immunizing laboratory animals followed by isolation of the sera, which may then be put to therapeutic use. But this method has many disadvantages such as the occurrence of allergic and hypersensitive reactions in the patients. Furthermore, there were no clinical trials for the administration of the crude sera. Hybridoma technology brought a paradigm shift as it led to the production of highly specific and sensitive monoclonal antibodies in huge amounts presently [17] . The mAbs have been used extensively in diagnostics also including the use in the detection of cancer. These are used extensively in cancer therapy as well. However, this method also has some limitations such as immunogenic responses but these limitations are rare and could be overcome with advanced study and research in this field [20, 21] . Technologically advanced techniques such as genetic engineering helped in reducing immunogenicity. Advancement in the field of hybridoma technology (Fig. 6) : [27] . These totally humanized antibodies are made with the help of transgenic mice that have human immunoglobulin; therefore, they include 100% human sequences and are needed in fewer quantities than the antibodies of mice origin [9, 23, 28].",

The antigen-binding sites on the antibodies have a vital function within the binding of antibodies with the antigen; the Fv and Fab fragment play a major role. On the opposite hand, the Fc portion can be variable [42] . In this, the messenger RNA isolated from B-lymphocytes of humans or mice are converted into complementary DNA [cDNA] . The H and L chain sequences of this cDNA are amplified by using PCR. Then, these cDNAs are treated with restriction endonucleases to separate H and L chain sequences, and then these sequences are individually cloned into virus vectors. Later these are placed along and are cloned in another virus vector. The H and L chains get combined to create Fv fragments; then, these are screened for antigen-binding activity. The particular H and L chains forming of the inclusion are reworked into E. coli cells; then, this E. coli are cloned and propagated to provide Fv fragments that will bind to a particular antigen [42] .",

These B cells in the secondary lymphoid organ go through a maturation process in which the variable area of antibodies expands by collecting corporeal hypermutations, resulting in the selection of high-affinity binder antibodies. These antibodies have the ability to link substantial and lightweight chain genes in a natural way. In vivo and in vitro strategies are used for biological research and propagation functions [2, 11] . This method is suitable for the production of a huge number of monoclonal antibodies with specificity and selective binding for specific antigenic molecules like the external and internal structure of bacteria or virus, surface receptors of bacteria or virus, enzymes, chemicals, hormones, etc. Presently the majority of these antibodies are produced in mice or rabbits in the laboratory. These animals are available easily for immunization and are easy to control and handle in labs. Monoclonal antibodies are an excellent tool for scientific research and analysis and are widely used in various disciplines like biochemistry, immunology, molecular studies, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology [10] with a high degree of specificity, sensitivity, and reliability. These antibodies are used clinically; however, these antibodies carry some animal proteins that have a risk of inducement of immune responses in humans like hypersensitivity and allergies. However with expanded analysis scope in this field, numerous strategies are being developed to avoid these undesirable effects of the monoclonal antibodies [20] . There have been some attempts made to produce human monoclonal antibodies to reduce any undesirable side effects or attempts are made to make these antibodies as human as possible. The most economical and effective methodology of manufacturing antibodies would be to fuse antigen-specific human B-cells with human or mouse metastatic tumor cells. However, this methodology holds a drawback of manufacturing genetically unstable vegetative cells. Some other functions of monoclonal antibodies are these can be used to identify surface proteins or define surface antigen of a cell, and they can be also used to localize molecules within cells or tissues. The practical advantage of hybridoma technology is that after the stable somatic cell lines are established; then, these may be used to produce sensitive and specific monoclonal antibodies in limitless quantities. The antibodies created by the hybrid cells during this technology preserve the native paring of constant and variable regions of the antibodies. This helps within the analysis of the functioning of monoclonal antibodies. Hybridoma cell technology is one of the foremost vital technologies for the assembly of monoclonal antibodies [4] . Currently, the classic methodology of hybridoma cell technology is responsible for more than ninetieth of the antibodies licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) [10] .
