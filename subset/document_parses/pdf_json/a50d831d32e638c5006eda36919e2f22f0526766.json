Adequate specimen collection is the first crucial step for the correct diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. Objectives: The present retrospective study aimed: i) to verify the cell yield obtained from sampling the nasal respiratory tract using mid-turbinate flocked swabs; ii) to evaluate the normalization of viral load, based on cell number; and iii) to compare the kinetics of viral infection obtained with normalized vs non-normalized viral load. Study design: The number of cells were quantified by real-time PCR in residual extract of nasal swabs tested for respiratory viruses detection and stored at \u221280\u00b0C in a universal transport medium (UTM\u2122). Results: A total of 513 virus-positive and 226 virus-negative samples were analyzed. Overall, a median of 4.42 log 10 \u03b22-microgolubin DNA copy number/ml of UTM \u2122 (range 1.17-7.26) was detected. A significantly higher number of cells was observed in virus-positive as compared to virus-negative samples (4.75 vs 3.76; p < 0.001). Viral loads expressed as log 10 RNA copies/ml of UTM \u2122 and log 10 RNA copies/median number of cells were compared in virus-positive samples and a strict correlation (r = 0.89, p < 0.001) and agreement (R2 = 0.82) were observed. In addition, infection kinetics were compared using the two methods with a follow-up series of eight episodes of viral infection and the mean difference was -0.57 log 10 (range \u22121.99 to 0.40). Conclusions: The normalization of viral load using cellular load compliments the validation of real-time PCR results in the diagnosis of respiratory viruses but is not strictly needed.",

            "text": "Respiratory tract infections (RTI) have an enormous social and economic impact, with a high incidence of hospitalization and high public health care costs [1] . Because of similar clinical symptoms and simultaneous circulation of several different viruses, their etiology is often difficult to determine. Adequate specimen collection is the first crucial step for the correct diagnosis of influenza and other respiratory infections. Dilution correction in nasopharyngeal aspirates might improve the detection of respiratory infections [2] . Many studies have confirmed that mid-turbinate flocked swabs are less invasive than other specimen collection types (nasopharyngeal swabs, aspirates and washes), have good sensitivity in the detection of respiratory viruses and are therefore a good alternative for specimen collection [3] [4] [5] [6] . Moreover, these mid-turbinate flocked nasal swabs are suitable for self-collection at home (either in adult patients or in children by their parents). Fast-and high-throughput molecular workflows require sample matrices that are suitable for automation. Respiratory swab specimens are better suited for this purpose compared to the more viscous nasopharyngeal aspirates. Universal Transport Medium (UTM\u2122) is a room temperature stable viral transport medium for the collection, transport, maintenance and long term frozen storage of viruses and other pathogens such as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma.

In these studies, molecular cell quantification using real-time PCR was performed and therefore the data obtained could be compared with those presented here. In addition, our results were consistent with the findings observed in these two studies, in which samples positive for single or multiple viruses had a greater number of cells as compared to virus-negative nasal swabs [14, 15] . In these studies, several reasons such as increased epithelial desquamation or a cytopathic effect induced in vivo have previously been hypothesized to explain this observation [14, 15] . Additionally, these phenomena could be explained by local nasal immune system activation and recruitment of cellmediated immunity during the early phase of infections when respiratory samples are usually collected. This hypothesis is also supported by the McNamara et al. study reporting a significant difference in the cellular response (mainly leukocytes) in bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with severe hRSV bronchiolitis as compared to controls without respiratory infection [16] . Similar results were also reported in another study where the cellularity of samples in RSV-positive samples was higher than that of controls [17] .",
