            "text": "Since its outbreak in 2019 SARS-CoV-2 has spread with high transmission efficiency across the world, putting health care as well as economic systems under pressure [1, 2] . During the course of the pandemic, the originally identified SARS-CoV-2 variant has been widely replaced by various mutant versions, which showed enhanced fitness due to increased infection and transmission rates [3, 4] . In order to find an explanation, why SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging mutated versions showed enhanced transfection efficiency as compared to SARS-CoV 2002, an improved binding affinity of the spike protein to human ACE has been proposed by crystal structure analysis and was identified in cell culture models [5] [6] [7] . Kinetic analysis of the interaction of various spike protein constructs with the human ACE2 was considered to be best described by a Langmuir based 1:1 stoichiometric interaction. However, we demonstrate in this report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2 is best described by a two-step interaction, which is defined by an initial binding event followed by a slower secondary rate transition that enhances the stability of the complex by a factor of ~190 with an overall KD of 0.20 nM. In addition, we show that the secondary rate transition is not only present in SARS-CoV-2 wt but is also found in B.1.1.7 where its transition rate is five-fold increased.",

First, for biolayer interferometry hACE2 was immobilized via a Cterminal biotin on a Streptavidin coated sensor-surface. Incubation with a serial dilution of the S1-S2 spike protein yielded the sensograms shown in Fig. 1 A. To obtain apparently good looking fits based on a Langmuir 1:1 model, the dissociation time needed to be significantly shortened ( Fig. 1B) . Such incomplete fitting allowed the determination of a KD and kinetic rates similar to those that have been published previously [5, 10, 19, 20] . The model fails, however, to describe the dissociation phase of the interaction, which cannot be fitted satisfactorily by a monoexponential decay (Fig. 1 C) . This conclusion is confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. hACE2 was coupled via IgG1 fc-tag on a Protein A/G derivatized surface and various concentrations of S1-S2 spike protein was applied as analyte (Fig 2 A) . Apparently satisfying fits based on a Langmuir 1:1 model are only obtained, when the dissociation time is only a few hundred seconds (Fig. 2 B) . The inclusion of longer dissociation times into the analysis, however, clearly shows that the interaction of the viral S1-S2 spike protein and the hACE2 is not of a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (Fig. 2 C) .

We have demonstrated that a secondary state of the SARS-CoV-2 spike -hACE2 complex exists and that the transition increases the stability of the complex by a factor of ~190 with an overall KD of 0.20 nM for the monomeric spike S1S2 protein. Furthermore, when the isolated RBD is tested for its affinity to hACE2, no secondary state formation was observed. This suggests that the context of the whole ectodomain is needed to promote the secondary state within the complex after the first contact is mediated by the RBD. When the kinetics of the monomeric SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 are compared with the trimeric variant, an increased secondary state transition was identified for the trimeric protein, suggesting cooperative effects between the subunits. Finally, the secondary state formation was Taken together, these findings highlight the role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the context of the ongoing pandemic and stress its importance as potential drug-target. The presented SPR method for the verification of secondary state transitions within the spike protein -hACE2 complex allows a straightforward way of predicting the infectiousness of novel SARS-CoV-2 mutants. To date, several studies aim for the inhibition of the spike -hACE2 interaction by targeting one of the interaction partners [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, the present study shows that an efficient inhibitor should impact both, the primary as well as secondary binding state in order to obtain significant reduction of complex formation. Since the secondary transition rate is potentially the defining parameter for an enhanced infection rate, it is important to understand its molecular mechanism. Targeting the secondary state transition could represent a very efficient therapeutic mechanism for the therapy of COVID-19. Most importantly, we suggest to use the full quantitative kinetic and thermodynamic binding behavior of newly appearing spike protein variants to hACE2",

Similarly, the kinetic values of the B.1.1.7 secondary state deviate from those identified for the 2002 and wt trimers. Here, the secondary state transition rate is of highest interest, because it will directly impact the contact time that will be needed to form a complex with enhanced stability. The ka identified for B.1.1.7 is 5.1 and 6.1 faster than the transition rate for the wt and 2002 trimer, respectively.The significance of this finding becomes obvious when it is transferred to physiological conditions,",
