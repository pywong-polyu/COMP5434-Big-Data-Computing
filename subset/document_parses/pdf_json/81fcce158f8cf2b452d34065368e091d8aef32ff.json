Material and method Electronic patient records consisting of intraoral scans of the dentition, digital radiographs, photographs and written dental records were collected. Exercises in age estimations contained digital radiographs and photographs of ground tooth sections, with digital measuring tools and tables according to age groups. The teaching material was organised as a module in an electronic Learning Management System with external links to all relevant teaching material. Results For the identification exercises, intraoral scans and the latest digital radiographs simulated the postmortem examination of the deceased. For comparison, all other radiographs, photographs and dental records were available as antemortem material. The exercise was to match postmortem findings with the antemortem records using the Interpol standard and reconciliation. Age assessment of children used designated tables to grade tooth development on digital radiographs. For adults, non-destructive methods, digital radiographs, photographs and measuring tools were used. Discussion The teaching concept was hybrid, but it can easily be adapted as a fully digital exercise. The instructions and written material can be translated into different languages. The level of difficulty in the exercises can be adjusted according to the participant's level of knowledge. Conclusion The educational material embraces the new possibilities for digitalisation and intraoral scanning. This might be a valuable tool for motivating and engaging the students in their participation and understanding of the subject.",

Most scanners used in dentistry are non-contact type. Intraoral scanners use various methods to capture raw data, including confocal microscopy, triangulation, interferometry, wavefront sampling, structured light, laser and video [13] . The scanning software processes the images of the dento-gingival tissues using nonionizing electromagnetic radiation [14] . Digital information on oral structures collected by intraoral scanners can be managed through software tools to generate point clouds that are triangulated to give surface reconstructions, often referred to as meshes [15] . The software creates an STL file (standard tessellation language) and can be communicated to dental laboratories and patients. The scans can also be exported to a Polygon File Format file (PLY) which can be viewed in programmes on most platforms [16] . The 3D surface model is the 'virtual' alternative to the traditional plaster model, but it allows enhancement in magnification, rotation and colour adjustments [17] .",
