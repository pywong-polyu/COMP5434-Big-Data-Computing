However, 95% of these deaths are preventable. The availability of an adequate blood bank infrastructure is paramount for increasing the chance of survival after PPH. 3 Although it is essential to ensure the adequate provision of blood products that are obtained from voluntary blood donors, social isolation policy and stay-at-home orders could affect the frequency of donations and therefore the availability of blood products.",

RBCUs available in July 2020 (Fig. 2, bottom) . The current \"blood bank crisis\" has been reported on almost all continents 4,6-8 and has prompted the proposal of extraordinary measures, such as facilitating the mobility of blood donors during mandatory confinement, 9 performing triage in cases requiring massive transfusion, 10 making calls from scientific associations at the regional level, 11 and even considering the obligatory nature of blood donation amid the health crisis. 12 This complex issue and the difficult decisions necessary to overcome it have led to a debate about necessary public healthcare from economic, sociological, and even legal points of view. 9 A factor that has mitigated the blood bank crisis is the decrease in the frequency of transfusions by 30.7% in April 2020 compared to that in previous months. This decrease was probably due to the cancellation of elective surgical procedures and the reduced occurrence of trauma-emergent consultations due to mandatory confinement. Regarding obstetric activities at the study institution, a 22.7% decrease was observed in urgent consultations in obstetric services in April (with a progressive increase in the number of consultations between May and July), but the volume of births and number of cases of PPH remained unchanged during the pandemic (Fig. 3) . The above aspects make it clear that although urgent visits decreased temporarily, severe obstetric pathologies that result in PPH with high requirements for transfusion remained unchanged, and if blood donation decreases, the problem of scarce blood supplies will be increased.",

The situation in low-and middle-income countries is especially worrisome because in addition to expecting more serious consequences of the pandemic, 22 the current situation of blood banks is unknown. For example, in the study environment, only 32.3% of the hospitals that care for patients with PAS report the availability of their own blood banks, 23 which may hinder intentions to apply policies reported as useful in countries with different economic situations. 24, 25 Although some countries have made public calls for donations to prevent or resolve critically low blood inventories in blood banks, 26, 27 the response to these calls is unknown and the relevant information in regions such as Latin America is scarce. Among the extraordinary strategies described are the active mobilization of the donor base, considering non-altruistic donation strategies, large-scale public health campaigns promoting donation as a symbol of national solidarity, 11, 28, 29 or even the modification of some established criteria for the acceptance of blood donors. [30] [31] [32] The disclosure of the positive psychological effects of donation may also be helpful in the context of the negative effects of the stay-at-home policy. 33, 34 The truth is that blood banks must find their \"new normal,\" and the health of the population that requires transfusions depends on the joint efforts of society as a whole. 35 Maternal health, especially the care of patients with PPH and PAS, is at risk due to the side effects of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the speed of the virus, the ability of blood banks to respond to the usual requests of hospitals depends on the attitudes that society and everyone in it have toward blood donation.",

The bottom of Figure 2 describes the number of RBCU transfusions in the FVL obstetric unit and operating rooms, which was similar to that of the entire institution. The number of transfusions was markedly reduced in April and recovered to values similar to those of the first months of the year in the operating rooms while remaining at low levels in obstetrics services. The relationship between blood donations and RBCU transfusions has been negative since March (\u221269 RBCUs), with increasingly alarming results in May (\u2212333 RBCUs) and July (\u2212296 RBCUs). Thus, the accumulated potential deficit of RBCUs grew gradually from March (\u221269 RBCUs) to July (\u2212951 RBCUs).

The blood donation and RBCU transfusion balance must be monitored daily by the blood bank. The average number of available RBCUs considered as a critical threshold in the study institution is 100 RBCUs. Although other institutions accept a different number, the requirements for the care of a single patient with PPH due to PAS can deplete blood reserves rapidly since as many as 40% of cases require massive transfusions, with patients demanding up to 46 units of RBCU. 13 Similarly, the prevalence of 7.5% of irregular antibodies in patients with PAS requires the availability of a large number of RBCUs to maintain safety during a transfusion. 14 Although the exclusion of donors as a precaution and the national mandatory confinement partly explain the reduction in the blood bank inventory, 9 the most frequently mentioned reason for not donating blood is the fear of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 during the donation. 15 The cancellation of extramural campaigns using the MBDU was the most striking factor in the low frequency of donations. Under normal conditions, 80% of blood donations are collected by the MBDU, whose operation is subject to cancellation or reduced operation if the interest or support of the general population decreases. 16 The American Red Cross estimated that 4600 appointments for donations were canceled immediately upon ordering mandatory confinement in the United States, with an estimated loss of 143 600 RBCUs. 17 Similarly, in 2018 and 2019 in the study institution, 71.3% and 73.3% of donations, respectively, were obtained by the MBDU, whose maximum productivity occurred in 2 months each year (April and October), when massive donation days were scheduled at universities with F I G U R E 3 Frequency of use of obstetric services during 2020.
