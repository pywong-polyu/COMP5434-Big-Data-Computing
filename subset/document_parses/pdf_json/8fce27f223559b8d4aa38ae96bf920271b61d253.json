Mathematical models can help define the scale of an epidemic and the rate at which an infection can spread in a community. I used ARIMA Model, Diffusion Model, SIRD Model and Prophet Model to forecast the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan and compared the numbers with the reported cases on the national database.

The patient zero had a travel history to Iran and immediately quarantined upon testing positive for the virus. However, the patient was followed by hundreds of pilgrims returning from Iran which were likely carrying the virus that ultimately led to the spread of COVID-19 into the community. Since then the infections have been increasing exponentially and without proper intervention the situation may escalate enough to overwhelm the already struggling healthcare system in the country. In this study we aim to model the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, which will indicate the peak infection day, rate of increase of infections per day and a 90-day forecast to assess the final size of the epidemic.",
