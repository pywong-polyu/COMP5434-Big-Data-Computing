            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented disruption to the fabric of society, our health service and economy. However, the multitude of challenges presented by the pandemic may also pose a significant threat to our psychological health. 1 Individuals are facing a panoply of stressors including serious illness, bereavement, social distancing and unemployment. The consequences of these stressors for mental health will not be uniform, rather they will be influenced by a range of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. Identification of the latter will be critical in determining who may be at greatest risk of mental health difficulties and should be the focus of future interventions; while the former can inform approaches to intervention. We report here cross-sectional findings from a community cohort study designed to capture both the mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic and the modifiable and non-modifiable explanatory factors associated with adverse mental health Strength and limitations of this study \u25ba To our knowledge, this paper provides the first empirical evidence from a large cohort on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people in the UK. \u25ba The findings are based on a large community cohort of N=3097 adults aged 18 years or older, capturing the views of people across the UK, including key workers and individuals from ethnic minority groups. \u25ba The use of validated measures of mental health allows us to conclude that levels of depression, anxiety and stress significantly exceed previously reported population norms. \u25ba The assessment of demographic and modifiable psychological variables allows us to report on which groups appear to be at greatest risk of increased psychological morbidity, and identifies a role for psychological and public health interventions. \u25ba The cross-sectional design prohibits an analysis of causal relationships and the recruitment of a selfselected community sample has implications for generalisability.",

            "text": "In keeping with its recent emergence, much remains unknown about COVID-19 and its consequences. However, the expectation is that the consequences for both mental and physical health will be profound and far reaching. 2 With regard to the former, evidence from China attests to this possibility. 3 4 as does the experience of previous pandemics. 5 6 Indeed, preliminary evidence from the UK suggests that these experiences may be replicated here. 7 But who might be at greatest risk of mental health difficulties? Individuals at increased risk of the disease and/or adverse outcomes might be expected to experience greater psychological morbidity. For example, the death rate is known to be higher in men and older individuals. 8 9 The latter being also more likely to have coexisting conditions and be socially isolated through shielding. The ethnic diversity of countries such as the USA and the UK has also highlighted that individuals from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds appear to be affected disproportionately by the disease. 10 Recent UK data also suggest that key workers, in particular those in social care, are at greater risk of COVID-19-related mortality. 8 The afore-mentioned factors are, however, largely nonmodifiable, and thus are valuable in understanding who may be at greatest risk of mental health difficulties and in need of intervention. Do modifiable risk factors exist which could be targets for intervention? Stress and coping theory 11 attests that emotional responses to challenging situations vary according to both our appraisal of stressors and the availability of psychological and social resources. Cognitions are central to the former and evidence from previous pandemics and the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that perceptions of the risk of contracting the disease and increased worry about risks to health are positively associated with adverse mental health outcomes. [12] [13] [14] In terms of resources, social support and its corollary loneliness are among the best established determinants of our emotional responses to stressors. Successive systematic reviews demonstrate poorer mental health outcomes and increased morbidity and mortality in individuals who perceive themselves to be more lonely and lacking in support. 15 16 Positive mood, now no longer viewed as just the opposite of negative mood, may also confer direct effects on well-being as well as protective effects in challenging situations. 11 17-19 In terms of mental health, evidence suggests that the existence of positive mood reduces the risk of mood disorders by 28% and anxiety disorders by 53%, and also influences recovery from some mental health conditions. 20 21 Taken together there is an urgent need to report evidence on the prevalence of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, to understand who may be at greatest risk, and to explore the psychological and social resources that may mitigate this risk. To that end, we report cross-sectional findings from a community cohort established in April 2020 to prospectively examine the mental health consequences of the pandemic. We focus here on findings from the first survey conducted between 3 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, which coincided with the first 4-6 weeks of social distancing measures being introduced in the UK.",

Comparisons with prepandemic normative values were made using independent samples t-tests. Examination of histograms indicated both depression and anxiety scores deviated from a normal distribution; however, transformations or non-parametric tests were not suitable for these comparisons as only summary statistics not individual level data were available for normative data. While t-tests are robust to deviations from normality especially when sample sizes are large, 26 results of these specific tests should be interpreted with appropriate caution. To explore the associations between the outcome variables and non-modifiable and modifiable explanatory factors, we first conducted univariable linear regression analyses (see online supplemental appendix 2). Multivariable linear regression analyses were then used to explore the independent relationships of nonmodifiable factors (age, gender, ethnicity, key worker status, living alone and being in a recognised COVID-19 risk group) on outcome variables. Then, in subsequent models, modifiable explanatory factors (perceived loneliness, perceived risk of COVID-19, positive mood, worry about contracting COVID-19) were added to examine the additional and independent contribution of these factors to explaining variation in the outcome variables. The variable assessing COVID-19 worry was treated as a categorical variable in all models, with 'occasional worry' treated as the reference value as this was the most common response. Assumptions of linear regression (normality and homoscedasticity of residuals, linearity with continuous variables) and presence of outliers were assessed graphically. Multicollinearity was checked for all models using variance inflation factors and found to have acceptable levels. Square root transformations were used for depression and anxiety scores to satisfy assumptions. Robustness of the models was examined by removing data points with large residuals (<\u22123 or >3) and comparing results to the original models. In the vast majority of models, this had no substantive effect on interpretation. Thus, these results are only mentioned where interpretation may be affected. Additionally, as perceived risk of getting COVID-19 was not assessed in those who thought they had had it (n=519) these participants are not represented in final multivariable models. As a sensitivity analysis, models were additionally respecified excluding this explanatory variable (see online supplemental appendix 3).",

Table 1 summarises the main characteristics of the participants, alongside comparative data on UK population values where available. This shows that women were proportionally over-represented and participants older than 75 years, and from Northern Ireland, were underrepresented in the current cohort. Otherwise the sample was reasonably representative of the wider UK population. The cohort had a mean age of 44 years (SD=15); and 10% (n=296) from minority ethnic backgrounds. Fifty per cent (n=1559) described themselves as key workers (39%/ n=1198 identifying as working in health and social care). Twenty per cent (n=649) identified themselves as having clinical risk factors, which would put them at increased or greatest risk of COVID-19. Table 2 summarises findings in relation to levels of stress, anxiety and depression in the cohort. The mean values for all measures indicate levels that are higher in women than men and decrease with age. Overall mean values are significantly higher than previously reported population norms. [27] [28] [29] For both anxiety and depression, the means for the cohort were higher for both genders compared with their respective population norms, and also for all age ranges between 25 and 64 years. In contrast, both men and women aged over 65 years had anxiety and depression scores consistent with previous population norms. The data suggested no significant differences in stress scores by gender, despite the combined mean score exceeding the population norm. Means scores for depression, anxiety and stress weighted to reflect the most recent UK age and gender distributions (Office for National Statistics, midyear estimates 2019) are presented in online supplemental appendix 4 and show similarly elevated levels in both men and women compared with prepandemic population norms. Table 3 shows the categorisation of participants in line with established cut-offs for anxiety and depression. This shows 64% of participants reported symptoms of depression and 57% reported symptoms of anxiety. When considering the thresholds at which someone would qualify for high intensity psychological support (score of 10 or greater) in the NHS, 26 we observe that 31.6% reported moderate to severe depression and 26% moderate to severe anxiety.",

Our results pertain to the experiences of people within the first 4-6 weeks of social distancing measures being introduced, and focus on self-reported depression, anxiety and stress scores. The findings indicated that mean levels of depression, anxiety and stress significantly exceeded previously published population norms. [27] [28] [29] Models examining the relationship between these mental health outcomes 23 and GAD-7. 25 \u2020PHQ-9, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire 19 ; GAD-7, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale. 20 Open access and non-modifiable explanatory factors accounted for only a modest proportion of the variance (7%-14%). Increased depression was associated with being younger, female, living alone and being in a recognised COVID-19 risk group; increased anxiety was associated with being younger, female and being in a recognised risk group; and increased stress was associated with being younger, female, living alone, being from a BAME background and a recognised risk group. In contrast, when we added the hypothesised modifiable variables into our multivariable models we observed that the final models accounted for a much larger proportion of the variance (54%-57%) with significant independent effects emerging for lower positive mood and greater perceived loneliness and worry about getting COVID-19 associated with higher scores for all three outcomes, as well as greater perceived risk of COVID-19 emerging as significant for anxiety and stress. These findings highlight a number of issues worthy of discussion. First, we acknowledge several limitations. These include the cross-sectional design that impedes an analysis of cause and effect. Thus, while we report on several significant associations it remains the case that we cannot be certain whether the relationships are causal, or simply due to the presence of other unmeasured characteristics; or indeed be certain of the direction of these relationships (ie, reverse causality). For example, it is possible that lower positive mood leads to greater depression and that greater depression leads to lower positive mood.",

We also note that, typical of online surveys, we are unable to determine the extent to which our findings were *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001. \u2020A square-root transformation was applied to the dependent variable. \u2021Comparison reference group 'I am in neither risk category'. \u00a7A 'case' is defined as a GAD-7 Score greater than or equal to 10, at which level someone would qualify for high intensity psychological support in the National Health Service. BAME, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic; GAD-7, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale. Open access affected by non-response bias. We took a number of steps to minimise this including ensuring brevity of the survey, designing it in conjunction with our virtual PPI Group and conducting supplementary analyses weighted to reflect the most recent UK age and gender distributions. But this remains a potential source of bias in our findings. Finally, we also note that our comparisons with normative data were limited to the most recent data we were able to access. For stress and depression, comparisons were made with data reported in 2013, but for anxiety it was 2008. We acknowledge there may have been population shifts in mental health in the intervening years which may account, in part, for some of the increase in mental health difficulties reported here. A second observation is that both mean scores and measures of caseness suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to an increased prevalence of mental health difficulties in the UK. This is true for depression, generalised anxiety disorder and stress and is in keeping with observations from other countries. 3 4 Indeed, the proportion of participants who would require intensive support for depression and anxiety in the NHS does not compare favourably with recent historical estimates of the prevalence of mental health problems in the UK. For example, the 2014 Office of National Statistics report on adult psychiatric morbidity reported a prevalence of 17% for six different common mental disorders. 31 The prevalence of depression alone in the context of this pandemic is almost double this. However, what we cannot determine from this work is whether the apparent increase in psychological morbidity is an expected, but short-term response to the pandemic. Or if this distress is sustained over time and likely to warrant intervention. Longitudinal follow-ups of this and other cohorts will provide valuable data in this regard. Furthermore, as noted above, we also cannot be certain how much of the increase in psychological morbidity is attributable to the pandemic or a more general trend towards increased mental health concerns that has been suggested by some in recent years. 32 Third, the non-modifiable explanatory variables significantly associated with increased levels for all three of our mental health outcomes were being younger, female and in a recognised COVID-19 risk group. The findings regarding gender and age are of course recognised risk factors for mental health 33 and are also consistent with unpublished data from another UK community cohort recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic with a similar gender profile to our own, 34 suggesting that these groups may be the most in need of intervention. They are also, in part, consistent with our hypothesis that the greatest psychological morbidity would be observed in individuals at greatest risk of COVID-19. But they also clearly illustrate that for some (eg, younger participants), the experience of psychological morbidity may be unrelated to their actual risk of COVID-19. These results may reflect the fact that the pandemic has resulted in a panoply of challenges likely to affect mental health that go beyond the disease ",

These findings are encouraging as they suggest that there is considerable potential to develop interventions to mitigate the mental health effects of the pandemic. 35 But they also signal a role for public health interventions.

Clear and consistent public health messaging regarding the use of face masks to reduce infection risk could be another effective strategy. Viewed this way, these public health interventions could simultaneously reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection as well as help to manage some of the concomitant psychological distress. There is, of course, still likely to be increased demand for mental health services in response to the pandemic. However, our data suggest that public health control measures commonly used in response to epidemics and pandemics may also have a role to play. A final issue concerns the effects of the pandemic beyond mental health. It is well known that when negative mood states persist over time they result in the dysregulation of physiological systems involved in the regulation of the immune system. 36 Thus, there exists significant potential for the psychological harm inflicted by the pandemic to translate into physical harm. This could include an increased susceptibility to the virus, worse outcomes if infected, or indeed poorer responses to vaccinations in the future. 36 Studies providing longitudinal data on the prevalence of psychological morbidity and appropriate biomarkers (eg, cortisol) will be required to determine whether the risks to physical health go beyond the hypothetical.",
