            "text": "The sex discordance in COVID-19 outcomes has been widely recognized, with males generally faring worse than females and a potential link to sex steroids. A plausible mechanism is androgen-induced expression of TMPRSS2 and/or ACE2 in pulmonary tissues that may increase susceptibility or severity in males. This hypothesis is the subject of several clinical trials of anti-androgen therapies around the world. Here, we investigated the sex-associated TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in human and mouse lungs and interrogated the possibility of pharmacologic modification of their expression with anti-androgens. We found no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 expression in the lungs of males compared to females in humans or mice. Furthermore, in male mice, treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide did not decrease pulmonary TMPRSS2. On the other hand, ACE2 and AR expression was sexually dimorphic and higher in males than females. ACE2 was moderately suppressible with enzalutamide administration. Our work suggests that sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes attributable to viral entry are independent of TMPRSS2. Modest changes in ACE2 could account for some of the sex discordance.",

Androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 raises the possibility that the physiological roles of androgens may, at least partially, account for the sex-specific clinical outcomes 9, 10 . Utilizing a high-throughput drug screening strategy, a recent study found that ACE2 levels in human alveolar epithelial cells can be downregulated by 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors, suggesting an androgen-driven mode of expression 11 . Furthermore, due to its androgenregulated nature in the prostate and its essential role in SARS-CoV-2 etiology, TMPRSS2 expression has been postulated to follow a similar pattern of regulation in pulmonary cells by the potent androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone 12 . If this link proves correct, it could pave the path to novel strategies, including repurposing of FDA-approved potent androgen synthesis inhibitors or AR antagonists, such as enzalutamide (Enz) and apalutamide, for the treatment of COVID-19. These strategies are the subject of several clinical trials (e.g., NCT04374279, NCT04475601, NCT04509999, NCT04397718) 5, 13 .",

We provide in vivo evidence in mice that neither mRNA nor protein levels of TMPRSS2 vary by sex or treatment with the potent AR-antagonist Enz.

Considering the poorer clinical outcome of COVID-19 in men, underlying androgen-related causes are suspected but not presently known. The SARS-CoV-2 co-receptor TMPRSS2 harbors an AR-responsive enhancer that is induced by androgens in prostate tissue 15 , raising the possibility of a similar mode of regulation in the respiratory system. We first asked whether, similar to TMPRSS2, ACE2 was also regulated by AR signaling in the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line originally derived from a lymph node metastasis (LNCaP), which is AR expressing and androgen responsive. Indeed, both mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 were strongly induced by the synthetic androgen R1881 and suppressed by Enz-mediated AR blockade (Fig. 1A ,B, S1 and S2). The specificity of the changes in ACE2 protein levels was confirmed with knockdown experiments, using two different antibodies (Fig. S1 ). Moreover, ChIP-seq analysis of AR cistrome revealed multiple AR-binding sites upstream of the ACE2 region that were lost upon Enz treatment (Fig. 1C) . These findings collectively indicate that ACE2 is indeed an androgen-driven gene in prostate cells.",

Across all tissue-type comparisons, we found no evidence for elevated ACE2, TMPRSS2 or AR mRNA expression in males compared with females ( Fig. 2 ). Next, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses to explore the possibility of a sex-specific pattern of protein expression within distinct pulmonary cell types. The IHC-stained mouse and human lung specimens were assessed by an expert pulmonary pathologist (SM) and semi-quantified for protein expression using the H-score, a common and well-known semiquantitative scoring system that takes into consideration staining intensity as well as the percentage of cells staining positively [16] [17] [18] . H-scores can range from 0 (no expression) to 300 (3 + staining intensity in 100% of cells).",

Consistent with the overall pattern observed in humans, lungs of male mice expressed markedly higher levels of AR protein than females (Figs. 3E and 4D). Alveolar pneumocytes (epithelial cells) were the dominant ARexpressing population in mouse lungs (Fig. 3G ).

            "text": "In the case of ACE2, we detected no significant difference between non-smoker men and women. Nevertheless, its expression was elevated in the lungs of male smokers compared with female smokers (Fig. 3C,I) . Thus, we observed sexually dimorphic ACE2 expression in smokers only. In mice, the sex disparity was readily detectable, with males expressing significantly higher ACE2 protein in airways than females (Fig. 3F ). These data, together, suggest that pulmonary ACE2 and AR expression is sexually dimorphic. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ TMPRSS2 expression is unaffected but ACE2 is modestly suppressed by potent AR blockade. To further explore the possibility of inhibiting TMPRSS2 expression by means of AR blockade, we harvested lungs from female and male mice treated with control diet or Enz for > 10 days and analyzed them for protein and mRNA expression. The animal studies performed on bulk lungs yielded results consistent with the human expression analysis: i.e., there were no sex-specific TMPRSS2 changes. Additionally, Enz treatment failed to detectably downregulate TMPRSS2 (Fig. 4A,D) . It has been previously noted that, due to glycosylation, fulllength TMPRSS2 may be detected by SDS-PAGE at a higher molecular weight of approximately 70 kDa 20 . In immunoblots performed with maximum-sensitivity substrate and extended exposures, we did not detect distinguishable bands for TMPRSS2 above 50 kDa (Fig. 4D ). Given the unchanged AR protein levels (despite a modest but statistically significant mRNA increase) in Enz-treated males, we infer that TMPRSS2 is not regulated by AR in the lung. Nevertheless, high resolution techniques such as single cell-sequencing or -proteomics may be employed to explore otherwise undetectable alterations of expression in minority cell populations. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Similar to the human data, we found no evidence of sex-specific changes in AR transcript levels in mice (Fig. 4C ). The lungs of male mice, however, expressed significantly higher amounts of AR protein compared with females ( Fig. 4D) . As mentioned previously, this may be due to AR stabilizing effects of abundant circulating androgens in males. Similar to AR, ACE2 expression also showed clear sexual dimorphism, with males expressing substantially higher levels of protein (Fig. 4D ) and modestly but significantly higher amounts of mRNA (Fig. 4B ) in bulk lungs compared with females. Treatment with Enz lowered the transcript levels in males down to female levels ( Fig. 4B ) and also partially reduced protein quantities (Fig. 4D) as evidenced by immunoblotting. Some subtle ACE2 protein levels were apparent in the control groups that might be due to biologic variations. Nevertheless, the modest Enz-mediated suppression of ACE2 was not clearly captured in our IHC analyses. This could be explained by possible marginal changes of ACE2 within pulmonary cells that may fall below the IHC detection limit, however, accumulatively can be observed through total protein detection methods performed on bulk tissue. Overall, these data indicate sex-discordant AR and ACE2 regulation, and a potential androgen-regulated mode of expression for pulmonary ACE2. Therefore, androgen-AR-mediated mechanisms could explain sexspecific differences in COVID-19 outcomes by TMPRSS2-independent mechanisms. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increases in current smokers whereas in former smokers, expression returns to levels found in never-smokers. In addition to male sex, smoking is a risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor clinical outcomes 21 . One recent study of 1,099 COVID-19-positive patients reported a more than two-fold increased risk for intensive care unit admission and death in smokers as compared with non-smokers 22 . We identified human expression GEO datasets of bronchial/airway epithelial cells containing subject smoking status and asked whether smoking is associated with TMPRSS2 expression. Our analysis indicated a consistent pattern whereby expression of both TMPRSS2 (Fig. 5A ) and the primary SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (Fig. 5B ) was modestly but significantly increased in smokers compared with nonsmokers. Interestingly, the levels were downregulated to never-smoker levels in former smokers. The results of our analysis are in keeping with several recent reports on ACE2 and smoking [23] [24] [25] . Although the p-values range widely across different data sets, almost all show changes in a consistently increased direction for current smokers including multiple data sets with small p-values (Fig. 5A,B) . Finally, for both TMPRSS2 (Fig. 5C) and ACE2 (Fig. 5D) , there was no correlation between smoking pack-years and mRNA expression in either current or former smokers, suggesting that the change does not build up over time but is instead a rapid process akin to a switch.",

Sex steroids (i.e., androgens and estrogens) are possible mediators of these biologic differences. For COVID-19, potential androgen-mediated biologic differences include (1) SARS-CoV2 cellular receptor regulation and (2) immune modulation 5, 13 . Our study addresses the first of these possibilities. In both humans and mice, AR protein is clearly more highly expressed in the lungs of males compared with females. Detection of AR protein in male compared with female lung might be surprising in the absence of a detectable difference in AR transcript. This might be explained by stabilization of AR protein in the presence of androgens, which is recognized to occur in prostatic tissues 19 . To our knowledge, there are no prior reports of this sexually dimorphic pulmonary AR expression. The specific presence of AR protein in male lungs raises the question of its transcriptional program-namely expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2.",

Therefore, TMPRSS2 regulation in the lung appears to fundamentally differ from clear androgen-dependent regulation in prostatic tissues. In contrast, there is a sex discordance in AR and ACE2 expression in lungs of mice and humans. In humans, elevated ACE2 expression is apparent in the lungs of male smokers compared with female smokers. Pulmonary TMPRSS2 regulation appears not to account for the sex-discordance in COVID-19 clinical outcomes. In contrast, ACE2 expression is elevated in smokers and particularly in males. The magnitude of ACE2 suppression with enzalutamide in mouse is modest. The ultimate effects of anti-androgens on human pulmonary ACE2 expression and COVID-19 outcomes are not yet known. Smokers could partly mitigate their increased risk by quitting smoking. ",

For AR staining only, 64 min of antigen retrieval time was applied. The slides were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature with the following dilutions: TMPRSS2 (ab92323), 1:3000; TMPRSS2 (ab214462), 1:200; Androgen Receptor (ab133273), 1:100; ACE2 (R&D Systems, #AF933), 1:400. The antibodies were visualized using the OmniMap anti-Rabbit HRP (05269679001; Roche), and OmniMap anti-Goat HRP (06607233001; Roche) in conjunction with the ChromoMap DAB detection kit (05266645001; Roche). Lastly, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and bluing. The specificity of each antibody was first tested on appropriate Figure 5 . Expression of both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 transcript in human bronchial epithelia increases in current smokers compared to both former and never smokers and the increases do not depend on smoking pack years. (A) Box plot of TMPRSS2 expression (normalized; mean within each data set equals 1) from GEO data sets. N for each data set: GSE16008 = 13 current/13 never smoker; GSE18385 large airway = 32 current/20 never smoker; GSE18385 small airway = 58 current/51 never smoker; GSE37147 = 99 current/139 former smoker; GSE61327 = 112 current/71 never smoker; GSE7895 = 52 current/31 former/21 never smoker; GSE994 = 34 current/18 former/23 never smoker. Data sets 18,385, 63,127, 7895, and 994 contained multiple TMPRSS2 reference sequences whose expression values were summed. In all data sets containing four reference sequences (18,385 large and small airway and 63,127), the difference between groups was largest for sequence AI660243, so expression using that sequence alone is also shown. For data sets with two groups, p-values were obtained from t-tests. For data sets with three groups, Tukey HSD p-values were obtained after one-way ANOVA (ANOVA p-values: GSE7895 0.009, GSE994 0.033). (B) Box plot of ACE2 expression from the same data sets as in (A). Data sets 18,385 and 63,127 contained multiple ACE2 reference sequences whose expression values were summed. For data sets with two vs. three groups, p-values were obtained as in (A) (ANOVA p-values for three group sets: GSE7895 0.82, GSE994 0.010). (C) Scatter plots of normalized TMPRSS2 expression vs. smoking pack years for current and former smokers in data sets containing pack year data.

            "text": "ACE2 is an androgen-regulated gene in prostate cancer cells. (A) Immunoblots and (B) RT-qPCR analysis of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in LNCaP cells treated with Enz (10 \u00b5M) for 14 days or stimulated with R1881 (10 nM) for 48 h. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels served as a marker of AR activity. Vehicle (Veh) denotes DMSO. Results (mean \u00b1 SD) are representative of three biological repeats, performed in triplicate. p-values were determined using one-way ANOVA. Arrows indicate the location of the specific bands. ACE2 detection was performed with ab15348. (C) ChIP-seq track examples of AR occupancy within TMPRSS2 and ACE2 gene regions, in LNCaP cells treated with Veh (DMSO) or Enz (5 \u03bcM) for 14 days. TMPRSS2, AR, and ACE2 transcript expression in human lung are similar in males and females. (A) Box plot of TMPRSS2 expression (normalized so that the mean within each data set equals 1) from the publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets. Center lines indicate median values, edges of boxes indicate first and third quartile values, whiskers indicate largest and smallest values extending no more than 1.5 * inter-quartile range from edges of boxes, and dots indicate outlier values. P-values from t-tests are shown for female vs. male comparison within each data set. N for each data set: GSE103174 = 22 female/31 male; GSE123352 = 81 female/95 male; GSE16008 = 15 female/11 male; GSE18385 large airway = 16 female/36 male; GSE18385 small airway = 35 female/74 male; GSE37147 = 103 female/135 male; GSE4115 = 41 female/122 male; GSE43696 = 74 female/34 male. Data sets 18,385 and 4115 contained multiple TMPRSS2 reference sequences; none of the individual sequences had female vs. male expression differences with p < 0.05, and the expression values of the different sequences were added together for this plot. (B) Box plot of AR expression from the same data sets as in (A). (C) Box plot of ACE2 expression from the same data sets as in (A). AR and ACE2, but not TMPRSS2, display sex-discordant patterns of immunohistochemical staining in human and mouse lung. (A-F) Plots of H-scores from staining for TMPRSS2 (A,D), AR (B,E), and ACE2 (C,F) in human (A-C) and mouse (D-F) lung samples. Note that for AR in mouse, alveolar epithelial scores are shown, as airway scores were zero for all samples; for all other panels, airway scores are shown. Humans were smokers or never-smokers as indicated. Male mice were given control chow or enzalutamide as indicated whereas female mice were given control chow. Plots show each individual data point and horizontal lines for mean values. P-values from Kruskal-Wallis tests are shown, and for plots in which Kruskal-Wallis tests suggested differences between groups, p-values from post hoc Wilcoxon tests are shown. (G-I) Representative images (400 \u00d7 magnification) illustrating sex differences in staining. (G) AR staining in control male (top) and female (bottom) mice. Black arrows indicate alveolar epithelial cells with positive nuclear staining in male and negative in female. Red arrow indicates lack of staining in bronchiolar epithelial (airway) cells. (H) AR staining in human male smoker (top) and female smoker (bottom). Black arrows indicate airway epithelial cells with positive nuclear staining in male and absence of staining in female. Red arrows indicate alveolar epithelial cells negative in both. (I) ACE2 staining in human male smoker (top) and female smoker (bottom). Black arrows indicate positive apical membrane staining in male airway epithelial cells and absence of staining in female airway epithelial cells.
