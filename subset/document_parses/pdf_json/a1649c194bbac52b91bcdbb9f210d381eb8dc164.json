We note that the opening jump may occur due to inclusion of the dividend value when it comes to a traded stock, as in (1) when computing the log returns. Consequently, the notations that we adopt in this paper follow those that were initially used by Garman and Klass [5] : In addition to the above notations, we introduce the following extensions concerning a succession of equally sized n-periods T:",

While the first drawback seems to have no effect since the estimator \"works just as well for non-zero (drift rate)\", the second has some consequences.

            "text": "The information that is brought in by the daily traded volume and the entropic mechanism through which the intrinsic entropy-based estimations are computed provide for more dynamic changes, although we note that these estimates can offer a more valuable perspective of the overall market evolution for short time horizons. Moreover, the traded volume can be taken into account by investors when focusing on a technical analysis approach [22] [23] [24] . Figure 1 shows the volatility estimates generated by the intrinsic entropybased estimator for a 20 day time window of historical data for the S&P 500 market index, along with the index price evolution and the daily traded volume. In comparison, the Yang-Zhang volatility estimator ( Figure 2 ), for the same 20 day time window, provides higher estimates and shows little changes of volatility on a daily basis. If we move to a 60 day time interval, the same pattern is preserved-the intrinsic entropy-based estimator generates volatility in a lower range of values than those produced by the Yang-Zhang estimator, while showing consistent changes in volatility estimates on a daily basis (Figures 3 and 4) .",

In addition to the MSE and PB indicators, we note the volatility estimators' efficiency. The efficiency of an estimator is defined as the variance of a benchmark estimator divided by the variance of that particular estimator: Table 2 presents the mean squared error (MSE), proportional bias (PB), and efficiency values for the Parkinson, Garman-Klass, Rogers-Satchell, Yang-Zhang, and intrinsic entropy volatility estimators relative to the classical close-to-close estimator as a benchmark. The computation process uses the S&P 500 stock market index daily trading data for various moving time windows. We note that the intrinsic entropy-based estimator's efficiency is consistently higher than the other volatility estimators, particularly for short time intervals of between 5 and 11 days, representing roughly one to two weeks of trading. In order to explore this observation in more detail, we computed the volatility estimators' efficiency for a series of successive time intervals from 5 to 20 days, along with a 30 day window. Figure 11 shows the evolution of the volatility estimators' efficiency for the S&P 500 (GSPC) index over these time intervals. We note that the volatility estimators' efficiency was not consistent with regard to the stock market indices. The empirical data show no volatility estimator as having the best efficiency for all market indices considered in our analysis.

It does offer a higher coefficient of variance for a lower mean of the estimates, which may suggest a better purpose for its usage as an investment decision support tool, rather than a descriptive reporting tool for historical volatility. Figure 13 shows the comparative evolution of the Yang-Zhang and intrinsic entropybased volatility estimators for the S&P 500 stock market index over a time window of 260 days. We want to encompass an entire trading year, with data going backwards from 31 January 2021, in order to reflect the market crash caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020. We note that the other variance-based volatility estimators, namely the Parkinson, Garman-Klass, Rogers-Satchell, and classical close-to-close estimators, exhibit a similar evolution curve as the Yang-Zhang estimator.

From this different perspective of market volatility, we note that the intrinsic entropy-based volatility estimates may have a more useful role in emphasizing the fractured nature of the market [28, 29] . Robert A. Levy argued in [30] that even if we assume the efficient market hypothesis advocated by Eugene Fama [31, 32] to be at play, intercorrelations or co-movements in securities prices could conceal existing dependencies in successive price changes. Levy conducted a serial correlation study of securities performance ranks and reached the conclusion that this technique offers a better indication regarding close relationships between certain securities over time than a similar study of successive first differences would provide. Levy concluded in [30] that even if one adheres to the efficient market hypothesis, his findings regarding the superior profits that can be achieved by investing in securities, which historically have had strong price movements, do not necessarily contradict the random walks hypothesis.

It is the market perception that their underlying companies are the leaders of the field they are activating in. Essentially, Levy's suggestion is an early hint to the fractal theory investigated more recently through econophysics methods [33] .",

            "text": "This paper presents the results from employing the intrinsic entropy model for volatility estimation of stock market indices. Diverging from the widely used volatility models that take into account only the elements related to the traded prices, -namely the open, high, low, and close prices of a trading day (OHLC)-the intrinsic entropy model includes the traded volumes during the considered time frame as well. We adjusted the intraday intrinsic entropy model that we introduced earlier for exchange-traded securities in order to connect daily OHLC prices with the ratio of the corresponding daily volume to the overall volume traded in the considered period. The intrinsic entropy model conceptualizes this ratio as an entropic probability or market credence assigned to the corresponding price level. The intrinsic entropy is computed using historical daily data for traded market indices (S&P 500, Dow 30, NYSE Composite, NASDAQ Composite, Russell 2000, Nikkei 225, and Hang Seng Index). We compared the results produced by the intrinsic entropy model with the volatility obtained for the same data sets using widely employed in the markets volatility estimators. The intrinsic entropy model proved to consistently deliver lower volatility estimations for various time frames we experimented with, compared with those provided by the other advanced volatility estimators. We note that while producing estimates in a significantly lower range compared with the other considered volatility estimators, the intrinsic entropy-based volatility offers consistently higher values for the coefficient of variation of its estimates. The tests that we conducted using historical trading data concerning the major international stock market indices provide empirical evidence that the intrinsic entropy-based volatility estimator offers more information regarding the market volatility, particularly for short time intervals of 5 to 11 days of trading data.",
