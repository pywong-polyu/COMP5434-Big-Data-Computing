These students, now constituting around one-fifth of the student body in the UK universities, are viewed primarily in terms of the economic benefits they bring to the host country, and there has been little explicit discussion around equity principles that might inform international student recruitment. Responding to calls for further consideration of the ethics of this situation, this article offers a novel perspective by drawing on a 'pluralist internationalist' theory of global justice. This theory grants unique normative relevance to the state whilst at the same time embedding the state within multiple other grounds of justice that are global in scope, thereby contributing to the disentanglement of some of the normative disagreements that characterise debates about global justice. The suggestions that result from applying this theory offer a substantive alternative both to the nationally oriented assumptions of current policy and to other contributions to the debate within academia which have drawn on the cosmopolitan tradition of global justice.",

The process of higher education marketisation over several decades has caused a disconnect between nationally based expectations of educational equality in terms of class, race and gender amongst other factors on one hand, and the commodification of international higher education, on the other. This is an increasingly pressing issue, as both the absolute number of international students in the UK universities and the proportion of international students within the student body as a whole have increased in recent years. In the 2019 to 2020 academic year, the UK hosted approximately 560,000 international students (DFE, 2021) . This represents an increase of around 12% over the previous academic year and means that international students make up approximately 23 per cent of the total student population. The UK government recently launched the 'International Education Strategy' (DFE, 2019) , the central aims of which are to 'grow education exports' and 'preserve market share ' (p. 4) in the context of a global economic competition for international students who are primarily framed as sources of income for the higher education sector. International higher education as an export industry is important to the UK's economy: It was worth over \u00a314 billion in 2016 (DFE, 2019) .",

Firstly, some argue that there is no good reason to exclude international students from the much higher expectations of educational equality that apply to domestic students (Tannock, 2018) . Secondly, 'selling' international higher education at a high cost entrenches social inequalities in other countries by essentially selecting for the most socially privileged members of society (e.g. Netz et al., 2020) . Despite this, there has been surprisingly little debate around how and to what extent principles of social justice and educational equality should be applied to international students, with a small number of exceptions that act as points of departure for this discussion (Enslin & Hedge, 2008; Tannock, 2013 Tannock, , 2018 . The need to consider this issue in-depth is increasingly pressing given that international students now represent a full one-fifth of higher education students in the UK and that the UK government plans for a significant expansion of international student numbers over the next decade (DFE, 2019) .",

The question of what 'we' (as citizens of the same country) owe to individuals from other countries has, broadly speaking, been considered through one of two lenses, referred to in this article as 'statism' and 'cosmopolitanism': This is also true of the limited debate around the ethical dimensions of international student recruitment in the UK. The former view holds that duties of justice towards fellow citizens take priority; this reflects the current situation in which international students are seen mostly in terms of their potential to benefit the UK . The latter view holds that the interests of all must be counted equally, regardless of nationality; this perspective informs the handful of academic contributions challenging the status quo (Enslin & Hedge, 2008; Tannock, 2013 Tannock, , 2018 . The 'third wave' is distinguished from earlier work partly because it seeks to 'disentangle conceptual and normative disagreements that underpinned debates' (Wollner, 2013, p. 21 ) between statists and cosmopolitans. Pluralist internationalism sets out a substantive alternative that lies between these two, making a case for multiple 'grounds of justice' with different scopes. What this means in practice is that citizens have particular rights and moral duties resulting from their shared membership of state, but other obligations of justice apply to all human beings, regardless of nationality, due to, for example, our common humanity and our shared membership of global order.",

In the 1960s and 1970s, international student recruitment in the UK was characterised by a dual public diplomacy and development aid rationale. As notes, international students were generally welcomed, largely as part of Britain's 'moral obligation' to former colonies and members of the Commonwealth. At the same time, a public diplomacy rationale developed in response to the Cold War: Scholarship schemes were set up to counter Soviet influence in ex-colonies (Perraton, 2014) .

New restrictions were introduced by the Coalition government on the right of international students to work in the UK, and more stringent requirements were introduced for Tier 4 student visas . Whilst the further restrictions on post-study work introduced by the Coalition were recently reversed (Adams, 2019) , restrictions on the right to work during study remain and students from low-income backgrounds are disproportionately affected by these measures because they are more likely to require access to part-time work to cover living costs and tuition fees in the UK. In addition, changes to visa requirements effectively made it easier for students from wealthy countries to enter the UK and much more difficult for students from 'high risk' (and less wealthy) countries. This is because the requirement to prove access to sufficient funds to cover the costs for the duration of the study period is eased for students from low-risk countries (Tannock, 2018) .",

This is evidenced in the ever-increasing tuition fees for international students, which effectively means that the UK higher education selects for the most privileged citizens of other countries.

This warning has scarcely been heeded in the Global North, where current processes of internationalisation continue to contribute to the (re)production of global inequalities. Concerning international student recruitment specifically, there has been sporadic protest in the UK and elsewhere about the injustices associated with commercialisation. A recent example is that of France, where the Council of State announced the introduction of differential fees for international students in July of 2020. The national student federation objected to this change, arguing that doing so amounts to 'making a social selection' of international students along the lines of social class and wealth and that raising fees for international students 'opens a dangerous door' to increased fees for local students (Marshall, 2020) . Similar concerns have been expressed in the UK (Tannock, 2018) . Tannock (2013 Tannock ( , 2018 and Enslin and Hedge (2008) have previously considered the issue of equality of access for international students in the UK and therefore act as points of departure for this discussion. The overall arguments of both of these contributions are aligned with the cosmopolitan tradition of global justice. An underlying principle of this tradition is that the same moral principles of cosmopolitanism apply to all, and an individual's entitlements should not be determined by factors such as one's citizenship: to use Pogge's (2002, p. 169) phrasing, each human being is 'the ultimate unit of moral concern'. 'Statists', in contrast, argue that the only relevant relation between individuals is the shared membership of a state. Therefore, when demands for social justice are made, they are generally only perceived to be relevant to those within the borders of the nation state. The key assumptions around social justice within higher education in the UK are essentially statist. This is evidenced by the exclusion of international students from demands for social justice, outlined in the previous section.",

As political and economic associations between individuals are now clearly global in scale, moral duties of individuals also span the Earth and are not confined by morally arbitrary national borders and communities. Young (2006) , for example, argues that principles of justice extend globally, in particular, in instances where people are connected by social processes that transcend international borders. This position underpins the arguments of Tannock (2013 Tannock ( , 2018 , resulting in his suggestion that international students and domestic students should pay the same fees and be subject to the same demands for social justice. That is to say, overseas students should be treated as equals to domestic students, in terms of fees associated with study and in terms of ensuring the equality of access of students along the lines of gender, race, ethnicity and class backgrounds, for example. In a similar vein, Enslin and Hedge (2008) contend that the nation-state has reduced salience in the modern era and that this, combined with the increased level of global association between peoples, means that the university's role in the UK as part of a higher education export industry should be reconsidered. They conclude that if 'widening access to higher education is a necessary response within the nation state, it is an equally compelling goal internationally ' (2008, p. 116) .",

Simply put, pluralist internationalism concurs with statist theory in that it holds that the nation state should be differentiated when constructing a theory of global justice. This is due to the unmediated nature of interactions between individuals and the government of the state in which they live, which, it is argued, makes the state 'normatively peculiar' (2012, p. 24) and results in relatively robust demands of justice. Overall, the pluralist internationalist stance refutes the contention of cosmopolitan theorists (e.g. Pogge, 2002; Caney, 2005; Young, 2006) that the moral arbitrariness of national membership leads to moral irrelevance or meaninglessness.",

Instead, in a similar vein to cosmopolitanism, there are grounds of justice that generate duties between all people globally, some of which are relational (i.e. grounded in associations) and some of which are nonrelational (i.e. grounded in universal features of human beings). What distinguishes pluralist internationalism from both statism and cosmopolitanism is that it identifies multiple grounds of justice, rather than just one, thus representing a view between the two common positions that principles of justice should either be applied only within states or to all human beings (Risse, 2012, p. 17) . The theory has utility, then, in that it helps to nuance the debate around international student recruitment in which there are, broadly speaking, two positions, the dominant 'statist' mode of thought, which excludes international students from debates around distributive justice due to their non-citizenship, and the cosmopolitan position, which leads to an argument for standards of social justice that exist within the bounds of the state to be straighforwardly expanded globally.",

It is important to note that the latter four principles are not necessarily less stringent than the first, which applies to the state, but the content of the principles of justice and the moral duties which arise from them differ. Risse (2012) argues that the continuing significance of the state lies in the particular nature of relations between members, of cooperation and coercion. At the same time, it is recognised that the state is not the only community that coerces its members, and that it accepts the claim made by other theorists (e.g. Young, 2006; Valentini, 2011 ) that coercion is not unique to the state, given the level of connectedness beyond national borders in the globalised world. However, it is the extent and nature of this coercion that distinguishes the state. The state constitutes the environment in which 'basic rights are, or fail to be, realised'; whether an individual can freely exercise rights is a function of their proximate environment (Risse, 2012, p. 27) .",

Shared membership generates rights held vis-\u00e0-vis the global order, and rights, in turn, generate duties of assistance. This is primarily a duty to create the conditions within each state to enable the realisation of a list of human rights. Risse takes an 'institutional stance', arguing that institutions within states 1 are responsible for creating the conditions required for the realisation of human rights. Thus, the primary means of achieving a minimally just state is through the development of effective institutions. The duty of assistance is, therefore, specifically a duty to assist in the development of effective institutions, which will, in turn, create the conditions for all states to realise human rights. However, it should also be noted that Risse (2012, pp. 48-49) offers three prima facie reasons that constrain this duty. First, assistance may be ineffective because what is needed cannot necessarily be provided by the donor. Second, a paternalism (or neo-colonialism) concern: institutions may be shaped by outsiders in their own image. Third, a reliance on outside support may lead to dependency.",

The implications of the realisation of Risse's conception of global justice appear far-reaching: States would act responsibly towards future generations with regards to resource stewardship and climate change and ensure that the benefits of the global trade would be distributed more equitably, as examples. At the same time, several potential challenges to the theory have been put forward. For example, Vernon (2015) highlights a possible objection from cosmopolitan theorists, who may argue that global relations meet some of the criteria that Risse argues makes a state particularly normatively relevant, and global institutions may thus be viewed as having a position on a spectrum of normative relevance, as an alternative to privileging the state's 'special' relevance over that of global organisations.",

There are two main strands to the argument. The first is that charging differential fees is unjust because international students can be described as members of the state where they reside. The second is that attracting large numbers of students from low-and middleincome countries is not necessarily a desirable outcome because doing so is widely understood to perpetuate existing global inequalities. The conclusion of the first strand is seemingly similar to that of cosmopolitan theorists, but the reasoning differs. Whereas from a cosmopolitan perspective, the principle of equality of educational opportunity should be extended internationally because the same grounds for making social justice claims nationally exist internationally, from this perspective, a citizen of another state would not necessarily be entitled to the 'societal resources' of the UK or any other state (Risse, 2016) . This is because entitlements to these resources emanate from shared membership of the state. Thus, the optimal response to inequalities between two individuals resulting from their national origin is not to make a case for all individuals to have the same entitlement to the societal resources of every state (such as higher education institutions) but to make the world more just (Risse, 2016, p. 59) .",

Internationalist conceptions of global justice generally justify the normative peculiarity of the state on the grounds of either shared national identity (e.g. Miller, 2012) , shared subjection to and nonvoluntary compliance with social rules (e.g. Nagel, 2005) or collective participation in a system of social cooperation (e.g. Sangiovanni, 2007 ). Risse's justification draws on the latter two. The question with regard to international students is, therefore, whether they are 'members' of the state in which they reside for study purposes, in terms of subjection to forms of coercion and participation in the same forms of cooperation. An argument can be made that they are. International students become subject to the host state's authority once they become residents, which means that they are largely subject to the same forms of coercion and cooperation (reciprocity) as citizens and therefore should be subject to the same far-reaching principles of justice that dictate the allocation of the goods generated under the same conditions. In terms of coercion, it is clear that international students are subject to the same legal system and public bureaucracies as citizens. They may pay income tax and make national insurance contributions if they are employed whilst studying (UKCISA, 2019).",

For example, the impact of non-tuition fee income from international students in 2016 was estimated to be \u00a311.3 billion, or \u00a349,000 per student on average (London Economics, 2018) . This includes housing and subsistence costs, other course costs and spending on dependents. They are often social and political actors, as evidenced for example by the activity of international students in protests (Pham, 2015) , and the fact that some international students,who hold citizenship of a Commonwealth country and leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, can vote in elections (UKCISA, 2020). However, despite being subject to the same forms of coercion, and participating in a broadly similar way in the forms of cooperation that characterise membership of a state, they are granted fewer rights and protections than local citizens. A potential counterargument is that citizens have a greater entitlement to the benefits of the UK higher education system, given that the institutions were built up partly through the lifelong taxation of students' parents and grandparents. However, differential pricing of public services for temporary and permanent residents (such as public transport or museums) is not a norm. A notable exception is that of healthcare, in that individuals resident in the UK for more than 6 months must pay a healthcare surcharge. However, this is a relatively recent policy, having been introduced in 2015; Previously, those entering the UK as temporary residents for work or study were entitled to free healthcare (Foreign and Commonwealth Office, 2015) .",

In other words, the grounds-of-justice approach weakens the contrast been domestic and foreign policy, implying that it is not acceptable to give priority to domestic concerns in higher education policy, as is currently the case (Risse, 2020) . Consequently, whilst student mobility from countries where the necessary conditions of just distributions already exist would remain at the discretion of the host country, providing higher education access for students from countries where they do not may be considered as a means of contributing to institutional development in the students' home country. Risse (2012, p. 81 ) notes that it is not clear how much is required to fulfil the duty of assistance. However, existing policies serve to extract wealth from developing countries, perpetuating inequalities and denying access to knowledge, and are most damaging to those countries towards which the UK has the greatest duty of assistance. Pogge (2002) argues that those who play a role in reproducing a global order which disadvantages others have a duty to improve that order. This duty includes alleviating the effects of unequal institutions, which includes a highly unequal global system of higher education. Risse (2012, p. 293) suggests that wealthy countries at the top of this global order cause the harm to the global poor claimed by Pogge (2002) by 'not doing enough to make good on' the duty of assistance emanating from non-relational grounds of justice such as our common humanity. In other words, even if the claim that the idea of national sovereignty no longer carriers intrinsic moral weight (Enslin & Hedge, 2008) is rejected, the problem remains that the unequal system of global higher education can effectively be viewed as one part of a broader institutional order which is exploitative and requires of the UK, placed at the top of this order, a duty to ensure a just distribution of the things to which human rights generate entitlements which it is not fulfilling.",

In addition, the diaspora effect (Agrawal et al., 2011) may facilitate exchange and knowledge transfer between receiving and sending countries and encourage foreign investment in sending countries.

There are two main mechanisms, established in the empirical literature, through which brain drain can impede the development of institutions: Emigration of skilled individuals can undermine institutional reform by depriving states of the (highly skilled) individuals most capable of catalysing it and can deplete the state's pool of human capital, destabilising forms of production that are necessary if states are to provide citizens with primary goods required for the realisation of human rights. The states furthest from achieving the level of institutional development required to meet the needs and human rights of citizens are more likely to be negatively influenced by brain drain because countries with ineffective institutions are not only more likely to motivate citizens to emigrate but also less able to achieve some level of 'brain circulation' or 'brain return' (Gamlen, 2014) . Thus, countries in the Global South which lack good institutional foundations can fall into a vicious cycle, in which ineffective institutions drive emigration, leading to the persistence of ineffective institutions. This is why several authors have challenged the idea that countries in the Global South,with the exception of those with large economies such as India and China, benefit from outflows of highly skilled citizens (Brown et al., 2020; Gribble, 2008; Agrawal et al., 2011) . Thus, it is clear that reducing the barriers to accessing the UK higher education institutions could, perversely, contribute to the entrenchment of an unjust global order. Simply perpetuating a global institutional order which contributes to the institutional deficit would be undesirable.",

Yong (2016) suggests that in the case of medical brain drain, countries that possess 'minimally just institutions' would be required to apply targeted immigration restrictions to minimise medical brain drain from other states. In addition, the recipient state, bound by a duty to aid in the development of minimally just institutions resulting from shared membership of global order, should help to address the institutional deficits which cause the brain drain in the first place through cooperation with the recipient. The same logic applies to brain drain caused by international student recruitment. The UK has a duty to avoid recruiting skilled citizens of countries where it is unlikely that the negative effects of brain drain would be outweighed by the positive effects of brain circulation, brain return or the diaspora effect. Alternatively, if student mobility is encouraged, then for students from these countries, policies designed to create educationally channelled labour migration should be avoided. One implication is that the recent return to the pre-2012 poststudy work visa policy, which entitles international graduates to two years to work in the UK and was implemented with the hope of attracting skilled workers from overseas (Adams, 2019) , would be untenable.",

This perspective stands in contrast to suggestions made in policy-focused contributions to the debate on student brain drain to date, which tend to put the onus in terms of reducing brain drain on the source country (e.g. Gribble, 2008; Ziguras & Gribble, 2015) . Determining the overall effect of mobility would be complex, would require careful analysis and would be highly idiosyncratic across geographical contexts (Gamlen, 2014) .

Whilst the expansion of distance learning has the potential to contribute to knowledge transfer and thus the development of institutions, and reduce problems of brain drain, it is also possible that without careful consideration around implementation, any of the three prima facie reasons against assistance in institution building would apply. The first reason is that distance learning expansion has the potential to be an ineffective measure, in that distance learning platforms, especially those with a profit motive, may act as competition for domestic institutions, inhibiting their growth and development. The second reason is shaping institutions in a paternalistic way and the third is creating dependency. To mitigate these issues, the UK universities may focus on developing partnerships with universities in the Global South to aid in the development of such platforms. These partnerships could be 'transformational' rather than 'transactional' (George-Mwangi, 2017), focusing on collaborative efforts and avoiding patriarchal approaches to knowledge transfer: An emphasis on power dynamics would be imperative, in line with the agencyoriented and participatory view of assistance that is necessary to avoid creating paternalism or dependency (Sen, 1999) . Overall, whilst this example is not without potential issues, it demonstrates that there are practical alternatives to existing models that could be implemented at the institutional level, supported by appropriate policies at the national level, in order to use the UK's higher education capacity to contribute to the development of effective institutions in other countries.",

This conception led to several suggestions for changes to the current system that would allow the UK higher education institutions to contribute to global justice, rather than injustice. The analysis resulted in two key points. The first is that if the normative peculiarity of the state is taken as a starting point, it is still clear that current practices around international student recruitment in the UK are unjust because, for all intents and purposes, international students are members of the states where they reside during their overseas sojourn. That is to say, they are subject to the same legally and politically immediate kinds of coercion and norms of reciprocity that characterise membership and are therefore subject to the same strong justice demands. In addition, the argument could be made that denying access to knowledge for students from low-and middle-income countries, in particular, represents a failure to fulfil moral duties that exist beyond the state.",

            "text": "At the same time, the article diverges from other works calling for global equality of opportunity to access to UK higher education, in that it argues that reducing the barriers to study in the UK for international students may be counter productive, given the possibility that doing so may have the effect of entrenching structural inequalities between states. This is because doing so may inhibit the development of effective institutions in source countries for several reasons. Thus, in terms of future policy shifts at both the national and institutional level, the grounds of justice approach suggests that reducing the negative effects of international student mobility (such as brain drain) and aiding the development of foreign higher education systems should be a priority. To avoid the three prima facie reasons against assistance in institution building, which are perhaps more problematic than Risse (2012) acknowledges, I highlight the necessity of taking a participatory view of assistance that emphasizes the agency of recipients, their role as co-generators of solutions, and takes as a fundamental aim the avoidance of dependency.",
