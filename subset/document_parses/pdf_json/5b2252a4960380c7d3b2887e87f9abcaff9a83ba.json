The peripheral regions of the Greater Toronto Area (York, Durham, Halton) would not enter lockdown until later the following month.

            "text": "Lockdowns in the urban core reduced overall visits to shopping malls and restaurants but increased visits to peripheral regions, where restrictions permitted indoor dining and shopping for non-essential businesses. These heterogeneous restrictions may lead to unintended consequences, undermining lockdowns in the urban core and driving residents from zones of higher transmission to zones of lower transmission. In this analysis, shopping malls appear particularly likely to be affected by regional variation in restrictions. Regional non-pharmaceutical intervention frameworks could avoid this by implementing restrictions spanning both the core and periphery of urban areas or by using interregional travel restrictions. These concerns are likely generalizable to other major metropolitan areas, which often comprise interconnected but administratively independent regions. 6 6. Althouse BM, Wallace B, Case B, et al.
