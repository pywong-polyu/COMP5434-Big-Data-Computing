Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, patients receiving a laboratory test for COVID-19 were identified. The primary outcome was comparison of positive COVID-19 testing in those who received the influenza vaccine versus those who did not. Secondary end points in patients testing positive for COVID-19 included mortality, need for hospitalization, length of stay, need for intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. Results: A total of 27,201 patients received laboratory testing for COVID-19. The odds of testing positive for COVID-19 was reduced in patients who received an influenza vaccine compared to those who did not (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.68-0.86; P < .001). Vaccinated patients testing positive for COVID-19 were less likely to require hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73; P < .001), or mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.78; P = .004) and had a shorter hospital length of stay (risk ratio, 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.89; P < .001). Conclusion: Influenza vaccination is associated with decreased positive COVID-19 testing and improved clinical outcomes and should be promoted to reduce the burden of COVID-19.",

As of February 2021, more than 106 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 2.3 million deaths have been reported globally. 1 The clinical spectrum of illness caused by COVID-19 is broad, with severity of disease ranging from mild symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome with rapid deterioration. 2 Pre-existing cerebrovascular, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal diseases, as well as hypertension, diabetes, COPD, and age greater than 60 confer higher susceptibility to infection by COVID-19 and greater risk of mortality with infection. 3, 4 Importantly, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors are more likely to experience severe disease resulting from both direct and indirect cardiovascular complications of COVID-19, including myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. 5 Clinical trials of dexamethasone 6, 7 and Remdesivir 8 have shown a reduction in complications in very ill COVID-19 patients, and while effective vaccines against COVID-19 from both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been approved for use in the United States, they are not yet broadly available, making it imperative to explore the effects of currently available medical interventions that may lessen the susceptibility to and burden of disease.",

From the onset of the pandemic, our institution's testing criteria followed directly along with updated Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. Any patient with symptoms of COVID-19, close exposure or recent high-risk activity could call the screening hotline or their healthcare provider and would be referred for testing. Starting on April 30, 2020, all patients being admitted to Michigan Medicine were screened for COVID-19, regardless of symptoms or recent exposure.

A weighted Cox proportional hazards model was employed to evaluate mortality differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated COVID-19 positive patients with results expressed as hazards ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. The association of influenza vaccination status with length of stay in hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients was assessed using a weighted negative binomial model, with results expressed as rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. For those who were vaccinated, the relationship between timing of vaccination and COVID-19 testing with each outcome was assessed by including a continuous covariate for the number of days from vaccination to COVID-19 test. This model additionally controlled for the timing of COVID-19 testing with respect to the beginning of test availability to account for changing COVID-19 positivity rates over time. There was a small amount of missing data on patient comorbidities, including chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, age, race and ethnicity, and a larger amount of missing data on BMI and smoking status. Missing values were included in all descriptive summaries and multivariable analyses as their own category for categorical covariates. A small number of patients (n = 14) had more than one hospitalization during the study time frame in which they tested positive for COVID-19. For these patients, their index hospitalization was used in assessing the length of stay, mechanical ventilation, and need for intensive care outcomes. Four COVID-19 positive patients were still hospitalized at the time of data collection and were therefore excluded from in the analysis of length of stay. Due to collinearity of chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension, these variables were combined into a single indicator for the presence of any of these comorbidities in the multivariable and propensity score weighted models. A 2-sided P value <.05 was used to indicate significance. All analyses were performed in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.).",

There has been recent speculation about potential protection from COVID-19 conferred by the influenza vaccine, 10 and we have further strengthened this suggestion through the use of retrospective chart review and patient level data. Consistent with previous research, 3,4 we found higher rates of COVID-19 in older patients and in those with preexisting comorbidities. Recent data has also suggested an association between influenza vaccination and reduced mortality from COVID-19, 11-13 as well as a decreased need for intensive care treatment and invasive respiratory support. 12 The results of our study lend support to the decreased need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients who received the influenza vaccine, as well as identify a lower rate of hospitalizations and length of stay in those who were vaccinated. Rates of infection with other respiratory pathogens in our study cohort was low, and no patients were identified as having both COVID-19 and influenza, resulting in minimal confounding of our results by COVID-19 and influenza co-infection. Additionally, we found that outcomes were independent of the length of time between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 testing. This is a slight contradiction to a recent report from Italy demonstrating the greatest protection against COVID-19 in elderly patients who received the vaccine in close proximity to COVID-19 exposure as compared to several months before. 14 While we did see decreased mortality in the influenza vaccinated group, the association was non-significant.

            "text": "While we were able to control for many patient comorbidities known to be associated with COVID-19 risk in our analyses, the observed protective association between the vaccine and COVID-19 may be confounded by differences in health and social behaviors or disparate socioeconomic factors between those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. A decrease in all respiratory viral infections was seen in a number of countries in 2020, likely due to interventions such as physical distancing, mask wearing, community education and lockdowns. 16, 17 In the state of Michigan, the first positive case of COVID-19 was on March 10th, 2020, with school closures, banning of large group gatherings and restrictions on visiting healthcare and residential facilities put into place March 13th, with closure of most public places by March 16th. On March 23rd, an official \"stay at home\" order was issued and on April 26th a mask mandate put into effect. Given the rapid implementation of these restrictions following the first positive cases which extended into June, 2020, the data from our cohort is largely confined within these strict public health interventions. Discrepancies in adherence to these guidelines between influenza vaccinated and unvaccinated patients could bias the observed association. A prospective study accounting for these differences is needed to explore the possible protective effect of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Another factor to consider is the impact of the so-called healthy user effect, which refers to the observation that the reduced risk in patients who receive the influenza vaccine may be independent of protection against the influenza virus and rather due to bias from the healthier patient population who typically receive preventative therapies. 18 When controlling for several variables that could impact the risk of developing pneumonia, the association between influenza vaccination and protection against adverse effects becomes insignificant. 19 While our descriptive study cannot discern mechanisms, a hypothetical, yet plausible immunologic mechanism that could explain the apparent protective effects of influenza vaccine against COVID-19 is a process called trained immunity. 20 Classically, vaccinations activate an adaptive immune response via T-helper cells to produce a memory cellular (macrophages, NK cells) and humoral (antibody mediated) response to destroy antigen-presenting cells on repeat exposure to a similar antigen. However, emerging data on epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells suggests that exposure to a second, non-specific stimulus could trigger a targeted and heightened proinflammatory response. 21, 22 This \"heterologous immunity\" could explain the nonspecific cross-reactivity that vaccines have against unrelated pathogens. Trained immunity has been demonstrated with the heterogenous effect of the bacilli Calmette-Gu erin (BCG) vaccine against infectious diseases such as yellow fever or malaria, and even certain malignancies. 22 Additionally, recent research from the Netherlands found that the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine was able to induce an improved cytokine response after stimulation of immune cells with SARS-CoV-2. 23 Further, the measles vaccine has been shown to have survival benefits beyond the expected protection against the measles virus alone, as suggested by a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality in vaccinated children, with only 4% explained by prevention of measles-related deaths. 24 More studies are necessary to understand any potential role of trained immunity with influenza vaccine and COVID-19 infection. Prior to approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, the potential of non-COVID-19 vaccinations to curb infection rates was explored. Improved outcomes correlating with BCG administration has been postulated 25 and decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection rates have been seen in individuals who recently received a Polio, Haemophilus Influenza type B (HIB), Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR), Varicella, pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), Geriatric Flu, Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B vaccine. 26 Our study is the first of our knowledge to explore the association between the standard influenza vaccine and COVID-19.",

This is especially of concern in the elderly and in those with preexisting medical conditions who experience increased morbidity and mortality with influenza infection 33 and are also at an increased risk of severe infection with COVID-19. 3, 4 In particular, influenza has been associated with an increased risk of myocarditis, 34 aortic dissection, 35 myocardial infarction, stroke, and death 36 in those with cardiovascular disease, and administration of the influenza vaccination has been shown to decrease the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in this population. 37 Annual influenza vaccination has therefore been identified as an important intervention in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in those with coronary and other atherosclerotic vascular disease, designated as a class IB recommendation in the updated AHA/ACC guidelines. 38 The increased risk of cardiovascular complications due to COVID-19 in these patients, 5 combined with a potential protective effect against COVID-19 lend further support to the importance of the influenza vaccine in this population.",
