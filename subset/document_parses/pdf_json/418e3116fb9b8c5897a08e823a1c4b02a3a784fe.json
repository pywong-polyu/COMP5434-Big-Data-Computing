            "text": "While China has decreasing female labor participation and increasing marital instability, compared to the rest of the world, its female labor participation rate is higher on average. The effect of female labor force status on couples' marital satisfaction, as one of the main factors for evaluating marital quality, has been separately discussed, including extensive margins considering whether women are in the labor market and intensive margins on women working hours per week. This study analyzed data from the 2014 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) using a binary logit model and a stability test. Results showed that the work hours, rather than the occupational status, of women affect marital satisfaction. In addition, regardless of the gender role attitudes held by the couple, marital satisfaction increases when women are in the labor market. This study has retroactively reviewed the effects of women working outside the home on marital quality. The dual roles of Chinese women, as both employee and homemaker, have been socially accepted. However, the requirements of maintaining multiple roles often contradict and present conflicts among the roles, time, and pressure, in the long run, giving rise to marital dissatisfaction.",

            "text": "Although China has a higher female labor participation rate compared to other countries, the female labor participation rate in China has decreased dramatically, from 73% in 1990 to 61% in 2018 (see Figure 2 ). Gender equality policies from plan-oriented economies contributed to the increased labor participation rate between 1949 and 1978 in China, reaching about 90%. However, during that era, overworked women were a common phenomenon (Pan, 2002; Li and Li, 2008) . With the transfer to a market-oriented economy after 1979, macro-level factors of the market system, economy development, and micro-level factors related to family needs have mutually contributed to the decrease in female labor participation. In a market-oriented economy, the market is the chief driver of labor allocation, not the government. Females were able to make independent decisions regarding whether to enter the labor market. Thus, part of the decline in female labor participation could be attributed to individual decisions (Pan, 2002) . Organizations transformed into rational employers to balance costs and benefits. Female and male employees started to compete for the same positions. Due to medical liabilities unique to the female gender and gender discrimination toward assumed insufficient female productivity, female employees lost their competitive advantage, which partly explained the decline in female labor participation (Pan, 2002; Li and Li, 2008; Wu, 2010) . With economic development, however, the rise in individual income levels increased the demand for leisure time; therefore, some females left the labor market. Through this process, domestic labor division was strengthened (Ding, 2008) . Since China's economic reform, governmentsupported caretaking has been gradually terminated, shifting childrearing, and eldercare back to households (Ji, 2015; Qi and Dong, 2018) . Therefore, the traditional expectation from women to care for children and the elderly has also contributed to low female labor market participation (Ma et al., 2011; Zhu, 2019) . Therefore, gender inequality in the country is reinforced by political and economic decisions, and Chinese women who wish to work undertake two opposing roles-being full-time employees and homemakers-which reveals a discrepancy between egalitarian household economic relationships and complementarian household labor divisions, ultimately increasing tension within families (Robinson, 1985; Zhu, 2019) .",

This transition consequently has altered family formation, structure, size, and the relationships between husbands and wives, and between parents and children (Xu and Ocker, 2013; Ma et al., 2018; Liu, 2019) . A new marriage law, enacted in 1981, featured a simplified divorce procedure that shifted control of marital decisions from extended families to individuals, who became empowered to independently determine whether to begin or end a marriage, especially enabling development for women (Pimentel, 2000; Xu and Ocker, 2013; Ma et al., 2018) . Thus, social acceptance of divorce is increasing, and people can pursue divorce without limitations. Indeed, a vast majority of divorce proceedings have been initiated by women (Platte, 1988; Xu, 2012) . Thus, the divorce rate increased from 0.18\u2030 in 1978 to 3.20\u2030 in 2018 (see Figure 1) .",

            "text": "Most studies have concentrated on marital effects on female labor participation. Theories of domestic labor division and work-to-family conflicts explain marital effects on gender differences in labor participation, where female employees are more likely than male employees to postpone work tasks due to family issues (Ogawa and Ermisch, 1994; Yu and Lee, 2013; Cai, 2019; Jiang and Dai, 2019; Wu, 2019) . However, few studies have explained the retroactive effects of female labor participation on marital issues. Furthermore, female labor participation and marital stability have a bilateral relationship. On the one hand, there is no clear causal relationship between female labor participation and marital instability. Based on gender role differences, the loss of economic power exchange between the genders when women are employed and the independence of working women have contributed to the positive causal relationship between a rise in female labor participation and increasing marital instability (Parsons, 1949; Ross and Sawhill, 1975; Booth et al., 1984; Becker, 1991) . However, Greenstein (1990 ), Oppenheimer (1997 , Rogers (1999) , and Sayer and Bianchi (2000) found little empirical support for the positive causal relationship between female labor participation and marital instability. On the other hand, there does exist a clear positive causal relationship between marital instability and female labor participation. Increase in marital instability contributes to the rise of female labor participation, especially for women with high divorce risk and who are not employed (Johnson and Skinner, 1986; Greenstein, 1990; Ogawa and Ermisch, 1994; Rogers, 1999) . Xu and Ocker (2013) argue that although the topic of family life has not been extensively researched in China, marital stability is essential to a familycentered society, in that it is intricately connected to fertility and aging issues. Ma et al. (2018) further posed a question that required research regarding how women's labor participation development affects marital instability in China.",

The argument positing a positive relationship between marital quality and marital stability is empirically supported by Booth et al. (1985) and Xu (2010) . Xu (2012) further supports that marital quality not only directly and positively affects marital stability but is also an intermediary to other factors, ultimately affecting marital stability. Furthermore, marital satisfaction, as a crucial index of marital quality, has positively influenced marital stability and contributes to spiritual and physical health (Wilcox and Nock, 2006) . Indeed, marital satisfaction itself also has direct and indirect positive effects on marital stability, in that a satisfied couple contributes to a stable marriage. Marital satisfaction itself is a useful predictor for marital stability; also, it is a mediator for other factors affecting marital stability (Hicks and Platt, 1970; Udry, 1981; White and Booth, 1991; Sanchez and Gager, 2004) .",

In addition, there are gender differences in marital quality evaluation, where Bernard (1972) argues that women experience lower marriage satisfaction than men. However, Jackson et al. (2014) find little evidence to support gender differences in marital satisfaction. Additionally, wives are affected by marital characteristics and perceptions of unfairness, while husbands are affected by their employment (Vannoy and Philliber, 1992; Blair, 1998; Wilcox and Nock, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014) . Nock (2001) further argues that men are more significantly advantaged by their marriages than women because men have benefited from the status of being married, regardless of marriage quality. Conversely, women are more likely to describe marital advantages based on quality experiences.",

Gender roles also affect marital satisfaction, fertility decisions, domestic labor division, and labor participation decisions (Feng and Xiao, 2014) . Furthermore, individuals are more likely to encounter marital problems when their counterparts' gender role attitudes exceed their own expectations (Vannoy and Philliber, 1992; Li et al., 2017) . Vannoy and Philliber (1992) emphasized that gender roles, not female labor participation, affect marital quality. Traditional gender role attitudes toward women negatively impact human capital acquisition, educational return, and labor supply (Kosteas, 2013) . However, in more gender-equal societies, women and their husbands are more significantly incentivized to support female labor participation (Yu and Lee, 2013) . Over the past 20 years, Chinese women have become more egalitarian than men, while men have remained more conservative in every age cohort (Liu and Tong, 2014; Yang, 2014; Sun, 2018) . Indeed, Liu and Tong (2014) conclude that women who are more egalitarian toward gender roles are typically classified in higher socioeconomic statuses, make financial contributions to their families, have equivalent or higher occupational statuses, and exert familial assertiveness with their counterparts.",

The average time devoted to performing household chores for women per day is 2.1 h, which is 2.4 times higher than that for men (0.75 h). Women also engage in 53 min of childrearing, compared to 17 min for men (National Bureau of Statistics of China., 2019). Yang (2014) concludes that gender roles in China have become more egalitarian, but attitudes around domestic labor division tend to be conservative. Most employed Chinese women work full-time jobs but are still responsible for unpaid care work; therefore, women have double or triple roles as dual-earners, housekeepers, and oftentimes caregivers (Yang, 2014; Qi and Dong, 2018) . Thus, with the burden of housework, women encounter psychological and emotional risks, which indirectly affect marital quality. Husbands' reluctance to share household responsibilities will increase marital tension, especially for women who believe in egalitarian gender roles (Robinson, 1985; Blair, 1998; Wilcox and Nock, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014) . Additionally, wives who perform less housework will decrease their husbands' marital satisfaction (Zhu and Qiao, 2015) .",

Ogawa and Ermisch (1994) further argue that women with low earning husbands experience financial strain and increase the likelihood of divorce. Women prefer to marry men with better socioeconomic conditions. Gender income differences perpetuate a conservative pattern of domestic labor division, given that women, on average, earn lower wages than men. However, if women have a higher income and occupational status than their husbands, and husbands are reluctant to accept this development, married couples are likely to experience a decrease in marital satisfaction and increase in the risk of divorce (Zhu and Qiao, 2015; Sun, 2018; Liu, 2019) .",

Given the lack of childcare services in the market, society has reverted to the traditional roles of women as caregivers, leaving them with the ultimate responsibility (Ji, 2015; Qi and Dong, 2018) . There is clearly a negative correlation in China between the number of underage children and their mothers' potential to participate in the labor market; it is more likely for mothers to exit the labor market when children are under the age of 6 (Ma et al., 2011; Jiang and Dai, 2019) . In addition, Vannoy and Philliber (1992) argue that there are discrepancies in how the number of children and their ages affects couples' marital quality evaluations. Ye and Xu (2000) further argue in favor of a mutually connected relationship among a family life cycle, children, and marital duration, as children can decrease their parents' marital satisfaction.

The statutory retirement age for women is uniquely differentiated among various firms; it is 55 years for women cadres and the self-employed, 50 years for female workers, and 60 years for senior female experts, while a majority of the women retire at 55 years. Thus, for the purpose of this study, the retirement age was considered to be 55 years. Retired female workers are included with those who are not in the labor market. Cases of cohabitating women were excluded, considering only participants joined in legal marriage.

Through the process, some occupational codes were missed due to inappropriate match between CSCO and ISCO-88.

The former three questions relate to traditional gender role attitudes. DeVellis (2011) argues that an alpha value of more than 0.7 denotes a good credential of scales, and a value between 0.60 and 0.70 is acceptable. The value of Cronbach's alpha for the former three questions was 0.6421, which is acceptable. However, if included, the fourth question largely decreases the credential levels. Therefore, the former three questions were used to evaluate the differences in gender role attitudes. Three measures were added to eliminate the dimension by standardizing extreme values. With a baseline value of 0.5, if the standardized values are close to 1, the interviewee's gender role attitude tends to be traditional; otherwise, if close to 0, it tends to be more modern. Interviewees and their spouses were assigned to four categories, including both traditional and modern gender attitudes, or it was recognized if the couple held opposite gender role attitudes. Finally, an intersection variable with gender role attitudes and female labor participation was established, which evaluated how interviewees and their spouses' gender role attitudes affect couples' marital satisfaction separately when the wife is in the labor market.",

The average number of children at home consisted of no more than two, and nearly half of the cases had only one child.

Gender inequality implies that women and men unequally share not only house chores and childrearing in domestic work but also responsibilities and rewards in market work (Mennino et al., 2005) . Indeed, Ma and Rizzi (2017) argue that while egalitarian attitudes have been fully accepted by women, they are reluctantly adopted by men. Wives who have egalitarian attitudes but deal with unequal domestic work divisions are more likely to report low marital satisfaction (Wilcox and Nock, 2006) . Furthermore, Mennino et al. (2005) find negative effects on individual's behaviors and moods when the needs of work and family are competing for personal time, energy, and attention.

            "text": "Role, time, and pressure conflicts are interconnected. Pressure conflict originates from the role of being a good mother and the financial support of intensive childcare. Hays (1996) mentioned intensive mothering and defined good parenting as \"childcentered, expert-guided, emotionally absorbing, labor intensive and financially expensive.\" (Hays, 1996, p. 8) . Budds (2021) found that intensive mothering as a normative standard had been identified among countries like the UK, the US, Australia, and Sweden. Elliott et al. (2013) argue that intensive mothering led to the rise of mothers' pressure, regardless of different racial/ ethnic and social-economic mother cohorts. Mothers can easily blame themselves for the problems their children encounter. Intensive mothering is common in China. In addition, there is a tendency to criticize mothers prioritizing work over motherhood. Cui (2017) argues that ambitious women are socially accepted in the workplace but are regarded as irresponsible in performing family duties at home. Almost 70% of women are employed, and many women experience role conflict between being a good mother and an employee (Zheng, 2019) . With the mutual effects of the onechild policy and the development of market economy, the fertility rate and the number of children decreased, and simultaneously, accumulated resources have centered on investment in children, which finally brings about child supremacy (Zheng, 2019) . Based on the China Family Panel Study in 2014, Ma (2018) estimated that direct care costs for a child from birth to 17 years of age are 191,000 yuan on average, 273,200 yuan in urban areas, and 143,400 yuan in rural areas. Indeed, the cost of raising children in low-income families is significant. Hui (2017) further analyzed direct economic costs from preschool-age children, showing that the annual average cost is 6,561 yuan, 10,297 yuan in urban areas, and 5,945 yuan in rural areas. Therefore, female labor participation is required to support the extensive costs of caring for children. Consequently, time conflict reveals that married couples have allocated most of their time to work and children, leaving a shortage of time to devote to themselves and each other.",

In the consecutive research of CFPS in 2016, no more than 20 cases resulted in divorce, which reveals that marriages with low marital satisfaction can endure. Xu (2012) further argues that although some interviewees admitted that their marriage could easily dissolve, marriage in China is still highly cohesive and stable. Jiang and Dai (2019) further argue that creating a much more flexible work form is an important policy to promote female labor participation. Further research is required in the context of COVID-19 and to investigate the effects on marital quality when more women choose to work from home. As Platte (1988) argued, every time a new revision to the Marriage Law is enacted in China, it promotes a sudden increase in the divorce rate. After the enforcement of the Civil Law, changes in marital dissolution and how the new law aids individuals to meet the requirements of divorce should be researched.",
