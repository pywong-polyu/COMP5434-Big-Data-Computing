In addition, adherence to specific infection control procedures tends to be lower in the geriatric setting, because collaboration of patients with regard to basic hygiene measures is difficult to achieve. 13 There have been only a few reports about the epidemiology of seasonal influenza outbreaks in acute-care geriatric hospitals that also include a detailed molecular characterization of the circulating strains. Here, a large nosocomial outbreak of influenza A/H3N2 that occurred in a large geriatric hospital in Switzerland during the winter season 2011 to 2012 is described and a detailed virological and epidemiological analysis provided.",

The goal was to characterize the different genetic groups of the circulating strains in the hospital and determine the putative common origin (clusters) to better understand nosocomial transmission dynamics. Viral specimens with a cycle value at threshold of <30 were processed and submitted to HA1 gene sequencing. Because of economic constraints, only one gene was determined using sequencing analysis. Primer sequences and PCR conditions were applied according to the standard operating procedures of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre at the National Institute for Medical Research (London, UK). Ribonucleic acid sequences for the HA1 gene were assembled using a desktop software application framework for the organization and analysis of biological data, with a focus on molecular sequences and related data types (MUSCLE program, Geneious, Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). 18 Overall, 986 nucleotides of the HA1 gene were extracted using a computer program that eliminates poorly aligned positions and divergent regions of an alignment of deoxyribonucleic acid or protein sequences (gBlocks, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) 19 and maximum-likelihood trees were estimated using a software that estimates maximum likelihood phylogenies from alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences (PhyML, South of France Bioinformatics Platform, Montpellier, France). 20 One thousand bootstrap replicates were performed using the general time-reversible model for correcting nucleotide substitution rates. HA1 sequences of 21 influenza viruses detected in the Swiss community using the Swiss Influenza Surveillance network were introduced in the phylogenetic analysis. All trees were rooted on the influenza A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) strain.",

Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were not detected. One patient who tested positive had been sampled at the emergency department of the general hospital the day before the admission to the geriatric institution, and three were not sampled but fulfilled the clinical criteria for influenza infection, having clinical symptoms and signs of influenza and residing in close contact (same room) to patients with confirmed infection. Overall, 73 cases fulfilled the case definition for influenza infection (mean age 85.3, 62% female). Eleven (15%) had a positive nasopharyngeal swab within 72 hours after admission and were considered community-acquired. Sixty-two (85%) were considered healthcare associated, with an attack rate ranging between 12% and 34% in different wards.",

            "text": "Several nosocomial influenza outbreaks have been reported in the medical literature. Seasonal influenza A strains circulating also in the surrounding communities caused most of these outbreaks. An analysis of three influenza outbreaks that occurred in nursing homes in the Spanish Navarra region found that influenza virus A (H3N2) was involved in all three outbreaks and that the genotyped strains were characterized as A/Stockholm/18/ 2011(H3N2), coinciding with the strain most frequently found in the general population during that season, 21 although no advanced molecular analysis was performed, and it was therefore impossible to track the transmission dynamics within those institutions. The current findings are in concordance with details from a previous outbreak that was sustained by multiple entries of different viral clusters from the community. 22 Likewise, a recent investigation of an influenza outbreak in a French hospital showed several clusters in patients and HCWs, confirming the current study's findings that distinct influenza strains may circulate simultaneously in geriatric healthcare institutions. 23 This study has important implications for hospital epidemiologists and clinicians. During the early phase of an institutional influenza outbreak, high adherence to infection control measures is mandatory to contain further spread of influenza, but as observed on some floors of this geriatric hospital, several factors may contribute to viral spread: the multiple comorbidities of frail patients, the difficulties in effectively geographically isolating cases because patients share dining or common rooms as the only means of social interaction, the difficulties for many of those patients in adhering to personal hygiene recommendations because of cognitive limitations, and the potential weakness of the immune response to influenza vaccination in elderly adults. In addition, asymptomatic cases (patients and HCWs) may be important vectors of influenza transmission. However, a recent meta-analysis failed to establish firm evidence that preventive strategies help contain the spread of influenza infection within institutions for elderly adults. 24 This lack of evidence to support any single preventive measure against influenza transmission in hospitalized elderly adults is due to the paucity of high-quality clinical trials and related methodological challenges, including molecular diagnostics and clustering effects.",
