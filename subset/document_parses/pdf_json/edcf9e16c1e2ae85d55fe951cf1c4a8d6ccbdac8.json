Model outcomes support continuation of working from home policies to reduce public transport use, and risk mitigation strategies in the context of social venues opening, such as >30% population-uptake of a contact-tracing app, physical distancing policies within venues reducing transmissibility by >40%, or patron identification records being kept to enable >60% contact tracing.",

Two months after these policies were introduced, available epidemic data indicate that they were successful in disrupting the spread of COVID-19, with fewer than 55 cases per day diagnosed between 12 April and 8 May, down from a peak of 469 diagnosed cases on 28 March [2, 3] . Acknowledging that maintaining these restrictions for an extended period would be socially and economically unfeasible, the federal government released a framework for a COVIDSAFE Australia [4] on 8 May. This framework outlined a three-step sequence of policy options across the education, retail, hospitality, sport and health sectors that would enable their reopening under sustainable conditions, and allowed states and territories to adopt different policies at different times based on their specific COVID-19 conditions.",

Epidemic modelling is a crucial tool that can provide insight into the likely specific and combined impact of relaxing individual control measures, as well as the time required to monitor and observe the impact of relaxing these measures.",

Populationlevel models are simpler and faster to produce, but they can only provide population-average estimates of the impact of policy changes. This is because they divide a population into a small number of discrete risk categories and assume homogeneous mixing and transmission risks within each category. In contrast, agent-based models use a set of autonomous 'agents' to represent a population and offer a more complex method for simulating individual-level characteristics and human behaviour [5] . In reality, the risk of COVID-19 transmission is highly heterogeneous and driven by the contact networks of individuals, which are dependent on age, household structure and participation in different social and community activities.

Importantly, the model suggests that it could take more than two months to detect increases in new infections from a change in policy, and therefore care should be taken in introducing multiple policy changes within short time periods.

In the model, contact tracing is effective for known contacts (Table S7) ; however, transmission to unknown community contacts can still occur, with frequency dependent on the mixing allowed by the policy environment. Transmission to an unknown contact would only be detected through their eventual symptomatic testing, allowing opportunity for them to further transmit during their infectious/presymptomatic stage. As with the index case, some of these additional infections will be of known contacts and effectively traced and isolated, however it is the chains of transmission through unknown contacts that may represent a minority of new cases initially, but if allowed to continue provide an increasing cumulative risk for epidemic expansion. It is therefore essential that accessible and efficient testing sites are available to complement contract tracing programs and detect community transmission from unknown sources. Once community transmission is detected, interventions to suppress a second epidemic wave would be required, for example geographically targeted testing or re-introduction of restrictions, to reverse the increasing trends projected in our scenarios. These interventions have not been modelled in this study and further work is required to assess how outbreaks can be managed without needing a complete policy reversal.",

In particular, these findings support the Victorian government's decision to extend work from home directions for people who are able until at least July 2020, to minimise use of public transport [1] . Further modelling work could assess whether staggered work starting times (to limit the number of riders), increased ventilation and cleaning, or face mask recommendations could mitigate the risks associated with increased public transport use. Policies creating large networks with random mixing were also found to be high risk even when they only affected a small subset of the population. For example, even though a minority of the population attend sporting events regularly, the random mixing of large numbers of contacts at a sporting event creates connectivity between smaller, clustered networks of known contacts, such as workplaces and households.",

Importantly, the app also relies on a well-resourced, timely contact tracing and testing system to be in place to follow-up people identified as potentially exposed. As of end May, the COVIDSafe app had been downloaded by approximately 6 million Australians. This represents approximately 24% of the population, meaning that the app could trace at most an additional ~6% (24%*24%) of contacts.
