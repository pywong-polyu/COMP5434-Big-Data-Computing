In this work, we propose a SEIRS pandemic model with infection forces and intervention strategies. e proposed model is characterized by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework with arbitrary parameter settings. Based on a Markov semigroup hypothesis, we demonstrate the effect of the proliferation number R S 0 on the SDE solution. On the one hand, when R S 0 < 1, the SDE has an illness-free solution set under gentle additional conditions. is implies that the epidemic can be eliminated with a likelihood of 1. On the other hand, when R S 0 > 1, the SDE has an endemic stationary circulation under mild additional conditions. is prompts the stochastic regeneration of the epidemic. Also, we show that arbitrary fluctuations can reduce the infection outbreak. Hence, valuable procedures can be created to manage and control epidemics.",

            "text": "Recently, perturbations have been incorporated into deterministic models of pandemics under reasonable conditions. Subsequent models have been proposed under stochastic assumptions. Gray et al. [14] proposed a stochastic susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model and investigated the influence of perturbations on the contact rate. Tornatore et al. [15] devised a stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) framework and demonstrated the presence of a limit on the reproduction incentive. A stochastic susceptible-infected-vaccinated-susceptible (SIVS) model was created by Tornatore et al. in [16] . Ji and Jiang [17] examined the characteristics of a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model under low perturbations. Lahrouz and Omari [18] addressed the extinction conditions within a nonlinear stochastic SIRS framework. Zhao et al. [19] examined a stochastic SIS model with inoculation. For this stochastic SIS model, Lin et al. [20] demonstrated the presence of stationary dispersion. Cai et al. [21] extended the SIRS model to account for the force of infection and the stochastic nature of the problem. Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) were used for the model construction. Mummert and Otunuga [22] investigate the scalability of an approach for solving a nonlinear system of ODEs by Euler's method. e system describes susceptibleexposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SEIRS) epidemic disease in the prey where the predator-prey interaction is given by the Lotka-Volterra type. All parameters grouping in the above 4 groups are discretized with a fixed step in a given interval. e parallel algorithm allows to receive a large number of solutions of the system of ODEs. Using these solutions, we can select those cases of system's parameters in which the dynamics of the population is stable and the disease is controlled. Talkibing [22] has proposed a stochastic version of a SEIRS epidemiological model for infectious diseases evolving in a random environment for the propagation of infectious diseases. is random model takes into account the rates of immigration and mortality in each compartment, and the spread of these diseases follows a four-state Markov process. Mummert and Otunuga [22] adapted generalized method of moments to identify the time-dependent disease transmission rate and time-dependent noise for the stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-temporarily immune-susceptible disease model (SEIRS) with vital rates. e stochasticity appears in the model due to fluctuations in the time-dependent transmission rate of the disease. e method is demonstrated with the US influenza data from 2004-2005 through 2016-2017 influenza seasons. e transmission rate and noise intensity stochastically work together to generate the yearly peaks in infections. ere has been much work already done on the stochastic aspects of the epidemic model. For example, Norden [23, 24] described the stochastic SIS model as a logistic population model and investigated the distribution of the extinction times both numerically and theoretically. Ref. [25] introduced environmental stochasticity into the disease transmission term in a model for AIDS and condom use with two distinct states. In a second paper, Dalal et al. [26] introduced stochasticity into a deterministic model of internal HIV viral dynamics via the same technique of parameter perturbation into the death rate of healthy cells, infected cells, and viral particles. Another way to introduce stochasticity into deterministic models is telegraph noise where the parameters switch from one set to another according to a Markov switching process. As a special period of the development of infectious diseases, the incubation period has a far-reaching impact on the spread trend of different infectious diseases, some of which are very short and some of which are very long. However, in this study the SEIR model with stochasticity is missing or rare.",

See [28, 29] for more details. e infection force H(I) affects the infected people and has been proposed in earlier models as a key factor in deciding the epidemic transmission. e infection force H(I) in the model incorporates the adaptation of people to epidemics. For instance, H(I) might diminish as the number of infected people rises because of the way that the population may in general lessen the contacts rate. is has been translated as the \"mental\" impact [3] . is effect could be enforced by necessitating that the epidemic force H(I) expands for small I, while this force diminishes for large I. e infection force H(I) can be expressed as \u03b2I/f(I), where 1/f(I) represents the reduction in the valid contact coefficient \u03b2 due to the intervention strategy [2] . With no such strategy, f(I) \ufffd 1, the incidence rate reduces to the bilinear transmission rate \u03b2SI. To guarantee a non-monotonic epidemic force, two assumptions are made:",

We simulate the SDE solutions with f(I) \ufffd 1 + aI 2 . For the convenience of display, the simulation is set as 100 times 100 in the space-time range, the abscissa represents the time, and the ordinate represents the number of patients. e simulations can help us to investigate how the ecological perturbations and the harmfully idle periods influence the spread of epidemics. In particular, we consider the global characteristics of a general SDE model with infection forces for both the deterministic case (without infection forces) and the stochastic case (with infection forces). In the first set of simulations, the parameters of the stochastic model are set as follows: \u03bb \ufffd 0.23, \u03bc \ufffd 0.01, \u03b1 \ufffd 0.36, \u03b2 \ufffd 0.52, c \ufffd 0.45, \u03c3 \ufffd 0.6, \u03b4 \ufffd 0.31, v \ufffd 0.13, \u03b7 \ufffd 0.25, and a \ufffd 0.1 (see Figure 1 ). e results in Figure 1 are based on a stochastic reproduction number of R s 0 \ufffd 2.8917, which is more than 1. We take the initial conditions to be (S t , E t , I t , R t ) \ufffd (0.9, 0.06, 0.04, 0). It is easy to see that the system is oscillating. Next, we study how environmental oscillations affect the spread of epidemics by reviewing the global dynamics of the general SEIRS model. Figure 2 . It is easy to see that the deterministic system is stable. To understand the influence of the environmental noise on the system, we increase gradually the disturbance parameter \u03c3 \ufffd 0.15, 0.35, 0.55, and 0.75, while keeping the other parameters unchanged. e results are shown in Figures 3-6 . From these figures, we can conclude that increasing the intensity of the system disturbance gradually leads naturally to more disturbances of the relevant quantities. However, when the noise level is above a certain threshold, these quantities are severely disturbed at the beginning but then stabilize gradually. Figures 7-9 discuss the influence of the change in a variable on the system. e conclusion is that with the increase in \u03b1, the system has stronger disturbance and worse control ability. erefore, the incubation period is an important variable in disease control. e existence of the incubation period will lead to the difficulty of disease control. We computed the time series and confidence intervals of each variable, as shown in Figures 10 and 11 . From the simulations, we can see that the stability of the system is affected, and the fluctuation range is big. For this set of simulations, we set the parameters as follows: \u03bb \ufffd 0.001, \u03bc \ufffd 0.01, \u03b1 \ufffd 0.75, \u03b2 \ufffd 0.1, c \ufffd 0.25, \u03c3 \ufffd 0.35, a \ufffd 0.001, \u03b4 \ufffd 0.05, ] \ufffd 0.1, and \u03b7 \ufffd 0. 33. ere are many variables in the system. We only discussed several representative variables in detail. In the actual disease control, we can discuss the influence of each variable on the system, so as to better control the spread of disease.",

Individual responses go from maintaining a safe distance from infected people to wearing defensive covers, or taking immunizations. Intervention approaches seek to change human behavior, to decrease the contact rates of susceptible people [6] . Compared with other models, such as literature [21, 46] , this model establishes a four-variable random infectious disease model, which adds the influence of incubation period, which is more in line with reality. At present, there are few studies on relevant theories and simulation. Natural infection forces affect the spread of epidemics. In this study, we investigated the components of a stochastic SEIRS model with a general contamination force. e stochastic effects were considered by incorporating a multiplicative background noise in the development conditions of both the susceptible and exposed populations.",

Firstly, the generation number R s o can be used to control the stochastic elements of a SDE model based on the Markov semigroup assumptions. If R s o < 1, and with gentle additional conditions, the SDE framework has a disease-free solution set, which implies the eradication of the epidemic with a likelihood of 1. When R s o > 1, and again under mild additional conditions, the SDE framework has an endemic equilibrium. is prompts the stochastic persistence of the disease. e number R S 0 is the main control variable of random infectious disease model control, which should be considered in practice. In addition, the change in initial value may also lead to uncontrollable results of the system, which brings greater challenges to infectious disease control.",
