Currently, the WHO is launching the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which is working on diagnostics, treatment, vaccines and health system strengthening. It includes COVAX, which is supporting the development of 9 vaccines, with more in the pipeline, and aims to fairly distribute 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021. 5 In Saudi Arabia, a group from the biomedical engineering faculty from Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University used the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict the expected daily number of COVID-19 cases. The results showed that the trend in cases was due to continue growing if strict precautionary steps and control measures were not implemented to limit the spread of infection. 6 The Saudi government announced its first case of COVID-19 on 2 March 2020 when a patient from outside the country was confirmed as being infected. The infection was detected as a result of the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) applying a protocol for detecting the virus across all the country's national borders. 7 As of 20 October 2020, there were a total of 7,403,020 tests performed since the pandemic started, a total of 342,583 confirmed cases and 8487 were active cases, with 844 cases requiring ICU admittance, and a total of 5201 deaths. Surprisingly, the recovery rate has been high, with a total of 328,895 recovered cases, resulting in a case mortality rate of 2% and a recovery rate of 98%. 8, 9 As is the case worldwide, this crisis has affected healthcare at the population level in Saudi Arabia. However, following the recommendations and guidelines of the Saudi MOH and the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control (SaudiCDC -Weqaya), 10, 11 the Saudi government implemented scientific measures to control the spread of COVID-19 from the moment the crisis was announced, and internal and external lockdowns in the early stage of the pandemic were successfully implemented.",

TH mobile applications (eg, Seha, Mawid, Tawakkalna, Tabaud, and Tetamman) have found effective tools to facilitate delivering healthcare to persons with COVID-19 and tracking of COVID-19 patients. 29 Before the pandemic, a cross-sectional survey on the knowledge, attitude, and practice of Saudi and non-Saudi parents to TH mobile applications (eg, Seha and Mawid) was recently conducted. The study reported that 86% of the respondents acknowledged the potential benefits of these mobile applications and had used them before to book appointments for their children. 30 In another public survey, 51% of the users were satisfied with the current services of TH mobile applications (eg, Seha and Mawid). 31 During the pandemic, there were >2 million users for the TH applications established by the Saudi MOH. 29 Current estimations of different TH mobile application users in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic listed in \"Goggle Play and Huawei AppGallery\" are shown in Figure 2 . There was remarkable higher user of Tawakkalna application reaching >7 million users up to date, this application developed to show the health status of its users through color codes at the highest degree of safety and privacy. It provide more than 30 services, also allows individuals to contribute to breaking the chain of infection by reporting infected cases or gatherings that violate the adopted precautionary measures. The use of TH mobile applications was a considerable facilitator that shows the Saudi health-care system had been fully prepared to deal with outbreaks such as COVID-19.",

            "text": "Ambulatory care in urology practice in Saudi Arabia has received attention since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and demands greater attention from stakeholders. It is crucial to reach out to urology outpatients, the majority of whom are elderly and have added health issues and complications. Such patients might be at a higher risk of COVID-19-associated complications. Patients with soft indications can be managed via telephone and they can be sent home with advice for care. Clinical patients with urological complaints that need to be seen on an urgent basis are advised to stay outside and can be brought straight into a clinic. Facemasks are given to such sufferers, preferably before entering. If possible, detached access for entry is offered for outpatients. Delivering urology outpatient services required regulating how triage was measured and applied to patients through means that do not depend on FTF care. Prescheduled outpatient appointments are screened and patients with nonurgent urological conditions are consulted via telephone and are prescribed treatment and asked to follow up. Patients in need of a physical examination are prioritized depending on the cause of the urological disease, such as suspected malignancy, obstructive uropathy, and immediate postoperative cases. Patients presenting with macroscopic hematuria are placed on empirical therapy, thus delaying the recommended cystoscopy by one to two months. 32 Prostatic biopsies and cystoscopy for patients at high risk of malignancy and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for obstructive ureteric calculi are allowed to proceed. Indeed, various experts recommended managing cases with prostate imaging reporting and data system (PIRADS) score 4/5 as planned, 32 avoiding delays of more than six weeks for symptomatic patients as European Association of Urology (EAU) suggested. 24",

            "text": "In retrospective cohort study, at the beginning of COVID-19 spread, data from China among 34 asymptomatic patients who underwent elective procedure reported that 44% required ICU and 20% died. 33 Mathematically, in very early stage of COVID-19 pandemic, the epidemiological model called Susceptible Infectious Exposed Recovered (SEIR) have been found as suitable model for COVID-19 spread predictions in Saudi Arabia. 34 They predicted number of infections can be lowered to 0.4 million by September 2020. This study demonstrates that, with a stricter level of lockdowns, the COVID-19 curve can be effectively flattened in Saudi Arabi. After the detection of the first COVID-19 case in Saudi Arabia, strict nationwide policies were implemented to limit the transmission of the disease by implementing mass lockdown of cities, shutdown of schools and businesses, travel restrictions, implementation of testing protocols, and the use of novel technologies to trace suspected and confirmed cases. 10, 11 All these efforts helped to achieve a slow curve during the first two weeks of March. Elective surgeries were running as usual throughout the country. However, in late March, the number of cases increased dramatically despite these strict policies. Therefore, the Saudi MOH recommended rescheduling all elective non-urgent surgeries except for organ or life threatening and oncological cases. 10, 11 All governmental hospitals applied these recommendations, whereas surgical practice in the private sector continued at a much slower pace. These prompt and vigilant actions were taken by the MOH and all hospitals for many reasons, the main one was to prepare all the hospitals throughout the country to respond to any COVID-19 crisis scenario. 10, 11 In countries where the healthcare system collapsed and mortalities increased during the pandemic, the cause was mainly HCP exhaustion, the unavailability of ICU beds and ventilatory support facilities. 35, 36 Therefore, these actions were taken to unburden as many of these facilities as possible, without exhausting the healthcare system with nonurgent stable cases that could be delayed. The Saudi MOH and SaudiCDC 10,11 illustrated the plan and provided recommendations and guidelines to all the hospital and healthcare facilities in the country. Table 1 shows hospital admission criteria for COVID-19 patients while Table 2 shows ICU triage and admission criteria during the COVID 19 pandemic. Figure 3 shows algorithm infection control precautions and recommendations for elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency procedures that were life-or organ-threatening and those for opioid-dependent pain were continued all over the Kingdom. Regarding oncological procedures, most of the hospitals adapted the European Urology Association (EAU) guidelines that were developed by The Guidelines Office commissioned by the Rapid Reaction Group (GORRG) on 19 March 2020. 24 In these guidelines, DovePress cases were classified and color-coded based on their level of priority from low priority to emergency ( Figure 4) . Accordingly, all cases were assigned to their corresponding level of priority and a decision was made to postpone or to proceed. When any elective surgery was scheduled, the policy mandated screening all patients with a nasal and/or oropharyngeal swab within 48 hours prior to surgery while still an outpatient. For patients with respiratory symptoms and in need of an emergency surgery, a COVID-19 test was performed, and the patients were treated as a positive case to minimize the risk of spreading the infection. When operating on a COVID-19 positive case, all necessary precautions were advised. 24 The number of working staff in the operating room was kept to the minimum.",

Finally, the quick move to online education posed many challenges. However, there were lessons to be learned, providing a chance for the urology community to adapt and improve our forms of communication for the future. Adoption of technology is important not just in clinical practice, but also in communication and administration during these pandemic times. Overcoming the current global health crisis will be difficult, but through creative approaches in teaching, we think that as urologists we will move forward to improve and adapt. Our community will successfully move through the COVID-19 period with a sustained focus on our community wellbeing and academic success.",

Time-Sensitive Procedures (MeNTS) Scoring System called Questionnaire-based Surgical Prioritization (QSP), expert opinion-base (EOP), and individual surgeon-based (ISP) approaches result in significantly different case prioritization. QSP did not meaningfully stratify urologic cases, and EOP and ISP frequently disagreed.

These recommendations may have possible implications for urology practice in both the forthcoming \"adaptive\" and the future \"chronic\" period of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the outpatient setting, prostate biopsies and elective surgeries (eg, benign urological conditions) are most likely to impact the future urology burden workload. While in the inpatient setting, elective procedures for lower-risk PCa and kidney cancers, nonobstructing urolithiasis, and BPH are the most pertinent contributors to this burden. There were concerns regarding the COVID-19 transmission risk through surgical smoke production during MIS. Some UASs recommended special precautions to perform such procedures, urological MIS should be performed according to the most confident approach by surgeon, use of specific surgical smoke evacuator and CO2 insufflation with a closed system and proper aerosolized particles filtration, apply possible allowed lowest intra-abdominal pressure, and to reduce surgical smoke production they advised to decrease electrocautery power setting. 23 The use of TM showed potential role to optimize resources and procedures prioritization in the current and future pandemic. 23",
