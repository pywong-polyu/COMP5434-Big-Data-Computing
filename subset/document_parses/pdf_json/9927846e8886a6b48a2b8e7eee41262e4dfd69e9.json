A physical exam was notable for fever (36.9\u00b0C, 103.3\u00b0F), blood pressure (BP) 120/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) 96% on room air without tachypnea. His blood examination showed C-reactive protein (CRP) was 91.7 mg/L (normal range: 0-5 mg/L), white blood cell count (WBC) was 9310/mm 3 (4800-10,700/mm 3 ) with 1400/mm 3 lymphocytes (1300-2900/mm 3 ), and a platelet count was 261 \u00d7 10 9 /L (130-400 \u00d7 10 9 /L).

On the 5th day of hospitalization, his oxygen requirements increased and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Favipiravir and piperacillin-tazobactam were started with proning protocols. The patient progressed to SpO 2 70% on 100% FiO 2 with a non-rebreather mask (NRB) and was eventually intubated. Five days later, darkening and ischemic changes in the right toes developed, consistent with gangrene (Panel A-2). Doppler ultrasound revealed thrombosis in the right great saphenous vein and deep crural veins below the knee; in addition, there was no flow in the right distal dorsalis pedis artery.

COVID-19 may display a variable course in different populations around the world, and the reported mortality differs across various geographies. 1 The reported frequency of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is 25% in patients with severe COVID-19 in China who did not receive VTE prophylaxis; however, VTE was identified in up to 69% of European patients receiving prophylactic and treatment dose anticoagulation. 2, 3 The largest publication of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU (184 patients) demonstrated a cumulative frequency of thrombotic events in 31%: 25 of the 31 cases were due to pulmonary embolism, three were deep vein thrombosis, and three were arterial events (ischemic stroke). 4 Acute peripheral thrombosis has also been reported in severely ill patients with COVID-19 from Spain, some of which describe cutaneous findings similar to our patients. 5, 6 Interestingly, an Italian series of 384 patients (61 ICU patients) did not report any arterial thrombotic events. 7 To conclude, COVID-19 is a disease that can be seen with thrombotic complications. It is important to note that both arterial and venous thrombosis can occur. The development of these complications while on thromboprophylaxis suggests that increased anticoagulant doses may be needed for severely ill patients. The newly published Panel A.",
