Throughout the pandemic, young people have been exposed to unanticipated trauma as their fragile social framework was torn apart by separation from their peers, remote education, and missed milestones. In the months and years ahead, recognizing the toll of trauma on our youth and exploring ways to integrate trauma-informed care into primary care provision will become more critical (the Sala-Hamrick et al. paper in this issue). 4 We will also need to explore new ways to implement parent/child-centric practices into all facets of care at community health clinics, like the cascading care model (the Brabson et al. paper in this issue). 5 Depression is the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide, and the COVID-19 pandemic has made all of us more vulnerable. It will become even more critical to employ effective tools to identify those at the greatest risk of depression and anxiety to ensure early treatment leading to recovery, like the Jung/Myers tool (the Rickles et al. paper in this issue). 6 This is the kind of practical insight we have come to rely on from JBHS&R. While many will remember the COVID-19 pandemic because of what it took, I will remember it for what you gave, to your clients and your communities.",
