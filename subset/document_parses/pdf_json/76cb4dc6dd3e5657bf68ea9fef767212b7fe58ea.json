            "text": "Conclusions: The lower rate of asthma exacerbations in childhood was in this study paralleled with reduced TRAP levels during the pandemic. Synergic interactions of the multiple consequences of lockdowns likely contributed to the reduced exacerbations, including decreased exposure to ambient pollutants and fewer respiratory infections, identified as the most important factor in the literature. periods related to social measures adopted to limit the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, including a marked reduction of asthma referrals. 1, 2 This led to a growing interest in determining to what extent these lifestyle changes-such as school closures, stay-at-home orders, and working from home in combination with protective measures, including social distancing, wearing face masks, and washing hands frequently-might have influenced asthma triggers. [3] [4] [5] Asthma is a multifactorial airways disease: in predisposed people, exposure to respiratory infections, air pollution, and allergens may trigger asthma exacerbations. 6, 7 Infections are the main triggers of acute bronchospasm in children of any age, especially in the preschoolers. 8, 9 Sensitization to environmental allergens, such as pollen, is reported as a further important risk factor for the development of asthma exacerbations. 10 Regarding the role of air pollution, most studies reported how particulate matter (PM) smaller than 2.5 and 10 microns (PM 2.5 , PM 10 ) and the coemitted gaseous pollutants (NO, NO 2 , O 3 ) can induce airway inflammation, hyper-responsiveness, and oxidative injury to the airways, which can lead to asthma. 11 However, even if the international air quality standards for atmospheric PM are based on total mass concentrations, the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges that not every PM chemical component is equally important in causing airways disease. 12 Research on this issue is mostly focused on trafficrelated air pollution (TRAP) and has provided evidence of the links between adverse health effects and PM chemical composition. 11, 13, 14 Urban anthropogenic PM presents a threefold higher oxidative potential per unit of PM mass concentration than rural PM. 15 In this observational retrospective cross-sectional study, we aimed to identify how asthma-related referrals in children were affected by the restrictive measures during the entire 2020, in relation to the main features of potentially associated environmental triggers, that is, air pollution and pollen. The selected urban area of Bologna, in Northern Italy, represents an important population basin of about 400,000 inhabitants and can be considered an ideal setting for this study as it is one of the areas more dramatically hit by the pandemic, and also well-known for a high prevalence of respiratory disease and for being one of the main air quality European hotspot, characterized by PM levels well above the limit set by the European Air Quality Directive and by the WHO.",

Our center is an urban, academic, tertiary care Pediatric Emergency Unit, consisting of a PED with approximately 23,000 visits per year, a short-stay observation unit (SSOU), and a ward. For the purpose of this study, the triage acuity was divided into low-priority (white and green) and high-priority (yellow and red) codes. Triage acuity is defined by a four-grade color scale according to local and national protocols, which adhere to global triage guidelines. 16 A red code means that the condition is life-threatening and requires immediate evaluation: patients with critical vital signs, unconscious, respiratory arrest, gasping, severe pallor, or cyanosis at rest. A yellow code requires rapid medical evaluation and includes patients with altered vital signs, respiratory distress, pallor or cyanosis in crying, signs of acute asthma in a patient with a history of severe chronic disease, agitated or ill patients. A green code indicates patients with normal vital signs but relevant, acute-onset symptoms (such as cough, wheezing, etc.). A white code indicates patients with reported cough or respiratory distress, with normal vital signs and without asthma signs or symptoms in triage. 16 The outcomes (discharge, admission to the SSOU or to the ward) were also considered. Unlike PM properties, which have a direct impact on asthma exacerbations, NO 2 and C 6 H 6 are considered as they generally mimic specific anthropogenic sources (e.g., fossil fuel combustion). The considered measurements cover the time period from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020, and were recorded at an urban background and urban traffic sites.",

The area, in which the concentration does not differ from the concentration measured at the station by more than a specified amount, can be called the area of representativeness of the station. A determination of the area of representativeness is of value when monitoring data are to be used to calculate the exposure of the population (or materials, or ecosystems). Those criteria are the distance of the station from large pollution sources. For the purpose of the present study, we, therefore, chose two urban background sites, representative of population exposure at the urban scale of the City of Bologna, approximately the same one intercepted by users of Sant'Orsola University Hospital of Bologna; and a traffic site, which is useful to better highlight changes in emission rates of local trafficrelated sources.",

The risk associated with the proximity of children to strong local sources (exhaust and nonexhaust vehicular traffic) was therefore reduced, especially in inner-city urban areas, where vehicular traffic normally presents a higher share of emissions. Nevertheless, the actual impact of these observations cannot be clearly elucidated due to the influence of a myriad of coinciding events/changes that occurred in society during 2020. Other authors recently discussed the potential factors involved in the decline in pediatric asthma exacerbations during lockdown, 37 including improved air quality levels; however, a relevant role of the fall in the concentration of air pollutants still has to be demonstrated. Recently, also Fan et al., 38 for example, failed to demonstrate such a direct correlation. Pollen emissions, which are not impacted by changes in human behaviors and social restrictions, did not present substantial variations beyond their interannual variability during lockdown periods. On the other hand, the restrictive measures likely influenced exposure patterns in children by reducing physical activity and time spent outdoors.",
