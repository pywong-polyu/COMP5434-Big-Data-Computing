This concept is supported by various plant succession studies, which show that changes in a forest ecosystem may be described by averaging the growth dynamics in gaps of different successional ages (Watt 1947 , Bray 1956 , Curtis 1959 , Forman and Godron 1981 .",

New Zealand's small group of islands (landmass 270 000 km 2 ) have variations in climate, geology, and soil that offer a wider range of habitats than many much larger landmasses (Wardle 1984 , Molloy 1988 ). The three main islands (North, South, and Stewart) span 1500 km (13\u040a) of latitude and have a maritime climate, with sea level temperatures ranging from warm temperate in the north (mean annual temperature (MAT) \u03f3 15\u040aC) to cold temperate in the south (MAT \u03f3 10\u040aC). New Zealand is tectonically active, with mountain building continuing at rates of up to 12 mm/yr (Whitehouse 1988) . About 60% of the land is \u03fe300 m above sea level, and 70% is defined as hilly or steep (Molloy 1988) . The varied topography cuts across the prevailing westerly winds, modifying land temperatures and causing strong rainfall gradients. The North Island has a central volcanic plateau with an average elevation of 500 m and main axial mountain ranges running northeast to south. Rainfall exceeds 1600 mm/yr in these areas and can reach 6000 mm/yr. There are also sizable areas of lowlands and coastal plains. The South Island has a young mountain range running 700 km north to south. The many summits \u03fe3000 m create strongly differentiated climatic gradients. In the eastern lee of the South Island range, rainfall drops to a low of 300 mm/yr, whereas on the windward side in Westland and Fiordland, it may reach 12 000 mm/yr near the ranges.",

Beech species predominate in mountain regions of both main islands. Their wide ecological ranges enable their frequent occurrence in montane zones as well as lowland areas. In the northern warmer areas (north of 38\u040a S), the conifer Agathis australis dominates the forests in association with a mixture of hardwoods, podocarp, and beech species. Further south, lowland forests are characterized by emergent, long-lived, evergreen podocarp species Dacrydium, Podocarpus, and Prumnopitys.

The young landscapes and generally infertile forest soils in New Zealand (Molloy 1988 , Wardle 1991 ) similarly required models that relate soil nutrient status to species composition and forest stature (e.g., Aber et al. 1982 , Pastor and Post 1986 , Bonan 1990 . We chose the LINKAGES gap model Post 1986, Post and Pastor 1996) because it included these ecosystem processes without excessive data requirements. It has explicit feedbacks between light, water, and nitrogen availability, and their effects on stand composition and productivity. Previous gap models have related soil nutrient status to tree growth by species-specific sigmoid equations that reach maximum values at the highest reported basal area, or biomass, for a given region. The LINKAGES model eliminates these site-specific maxima by explicitly simulating water and nutrient availability and using them to influence tree growth (Post and Pastor 1996) . However, the model lacks some recent modifications in allometric relationships, growth equations, and spatially explicit modeling of the light environment (e.g., Leemans and Prentice 1987 , Martin 1992 , Pacala et al. 1993 , Prentice et al. 1993 , Bugmann 1996 . A complete description of LINKAGES is given in Pastor and Post (1985) .",

The model presented is intended as a basis for future development. Some characteristics of New Zealand tree species differ profoundly from those of eastern North American species. Therefore, we were careful to extend, rather than modify, the mechanisms of competition or nutrient cycling. This preserved the model's original ability to reproduce dynamics of the forests of eastern North America and allowed a com-GENERALIZED FOREST GAP MODEL parison of results with LINKAGES.

The model simulates, on a yearly cycle, the establishment, growth, and mortality of all individual trees in a 1/12 ha plot (0.083 ha), adjusted by the effects of climate, soil properties, and competition. Plot size corresponds to the average gap created by a dominant tree in eastern North American forests (Shugart and West 1977) . Initial diameter at breast height (dbh) is stochastically set between 1.27 cm and 1.42 cm. Monthly rainfall and temperature variables, together with soil moisture capacity and wilting point, determine available site moisture. As the canopy forms and develops, light availability to each tree changes, affecting growth rates and the establishment of new trees. Available soil nitrogen is initialized for the site and then determined annually by external inputs, losses due to leaching, and dynamics associated with processes of immobilization and mineralization during litter decomposition (Post and Pastor 1996) . Available soil nitrogen then affects tree growth and stand composition, which, in turn, alters litter quantity and quality and modifies decomposition rates (Pastor and Post 1985) .",

The clearest case is that of the long-lived conifer Halocarpus biformis, with a highest recorded growth increment of 0.8 mm/yr (Wardle 1991) , preventing LINKAGES from establishing it at all. Under LINK-AGES, the widespread, dominant conifers of the Podocarpaceae with recorded maximum annual diameter increments \u03fd3 mm/yr also struggle to survive in slightly less than optimal conditions. Slow growth is common in the understory for other New Zealand species as well. Seedlings of Nothofagus species, for example, remain in a quiescent state (\u03fd1.35 m tall), making only limited growth for decades until an opportunity is provided by the death of canopy trees (Wardle 1984) . Nothofagus fusca, normally one of the faster growing dominant species (Stewart and Rose 1990) , may grow in diameter by only 0.8 mm/yr under a dense canopy, with 70% of the poles in a typical stand passing through this stage (Kirkland 1961) . Baxter and Norton (1989) show a similar growth release behavior for Dacrydium cupressinum and Quintinia acutifolia, in which ring widths of young trees are \u03fd0.5 mm/yr under an intact canopy, but increase to widths of 2-4 mm/yr after the overstory trees are removed.",

Field examples show that Daniel (1975) estimated L c as 3.2 Mg\u00b7ha \u03ea1 \u00b7yr \u03ea1 in a New Zealand podocarp-broad-leaved forest; Benecke and Evans (1987) established that L c \u03ed 6.4 Mg\u00b7ha \u03ea1 \u00b7yr \u03ea1 from a Nothofagus truncata forest; and Hollinger et al. (1994) obtained L c \u03ed 5.9 Mg\u00b7ha \u03ea1 \u00b7yr \u03ea1 from a mature N. fusca stand. Leaf production may be greater in New Zealand forests because of a long growing season, combined with the evergreen habit of most tree species. Over a 2000-yr run of the model, simulations at a warm-temperate species-rich forest site at Riverhead, Auckland showed that the original decay multiplier was nullified in 99.9% of years on soils of low water-holding capacity, and in 66.2% of years on soils of high water-holding capacity. To compensate for differing New Zealand forest leaf production values and to retain Eq. 4 for American species, a scaling factor was applied to L a . This was obtained by multiplying each plant's litter mass by the average northern hardwood foliage mass of 92 g/m 2 (Whittaker et al. 1974 ) and dividing by the species' SLM. Over the simulated period, the model calculated mean values for L a of 2.70 Mg\u00b7ha \u03ea1 \u00b7yr \u03ea1 on low-water-holding capacity soils and 2.77 Mg\u00b7ha \u03ea1 \u00b7yr \u03ea1 on high-capacity soils. The SLM adjustment rescaled these mean values downward by nearly 50%, making them comparable with the L c of old-growth American forests in Eq. 4, and activating the decay rate multiplier in New Zealand forest sites. After this adjustment, the decay-rate multiplier on the simulated Riverhead forest plot was negated on just 0.3% of the annual cycles.",

We added a basic mechanism to LINKNZ to simulate disturbance. The type (wind or fire) and the mean disturbance return time can be set in the site parameters. The LINKNZ model will trigger that type of disturbance with a probability annually that is the reciprocal of the disturbance frequency. After windthrow, all trees on the plot are assumed to be dead and all biomass, including belowground root mass, is returned to the site for decomposition-nutrient cycling.

            "text": "Evaluation of forest ecosystem gap models is not straightforward. To construct definitive tests of simulated forest dynamics, several stands would have to be monitored for long periods while they were returning to old-growth forest. Even in well-observed eastern North American forests, a lack of historical data on succession has been acknowledged (Pacala et al. 1993 ). In addition, Rastetter (1996) has noted that each alternative used to evaluate modeled ecosystem response to global change fails to provide a severe and crucial test. Partly, this is due to difficulties in locating past or present ecosystem states comparable to those expected under climate change. For instance, how can valid data be obtained for evaluating long-term vegetation responses to increased CO 2 , when short-term chamber experiments are still inconclusive? We adopt recent evaluation methods for forest gap models to evaluate the ability of the model under current climates, but acknowledge that theoretical difficulties remain. Shugart (1984) and Shugart and Smith (1996) discuss procedures used for testing the results of gap models. Most include assessing the model's abilities to reproduce ''target patterns'' of stand or tree biomass increments, stand structure (basal area, density, stem diameter distributions) or composition (relative basal area, relative density) for stands of known age, successional trends in a chronosequence of stands, and forest response to disturbance as a ''natural'' experiment. Bugmann (1996) tested model predictions of species composition, biomass, and distribution on a range of sites in the European Alps. We assess LINKNZ similarly by comparing output with general characteristics of forest vegetation at sites throughout New Zealand. These sites are located across both temperature and precipitation gradients in habitats varying from diverse-species warm-temperate forests to limited-floristic cool-temperate forests (Table 1) . Pacala et al. (1993) tested their spatially explicit model against data from a short chronosequence (up to 100 yr), and against a long-term succession, by comparing species composition and basal area. We compare our model through time against studies of forest successional development on landslides in southwestern New Zealand (Mark et al. 1964 , Stewart 1986 ).",

These species make up \u03fe70% of total biomass at year 100, reduce to 50% by year 200 as the podocarps Dacrydium cupressinum, Prumnopitys ferruginea, and P. taxifolia increase, and become a minor component at 1% by year 500. Modeled community composition is similar to that at lakeside sites in the Taupo area (Wardle 1984, Clarkson and Nicholls 1992) . The successional patterns resemble a sequence described by Wardle (1991) for parts of this central North Island volcanic plateau area with a deep tephra soil, characterized by D. cupressinum-dominated mixed-podocarp forest establishing by 200-300 yr and developing by 400-500 yr into a large, mature podocarp-broadleaved forest.",

The model shows Prumnopitys and Podocarpus species, followed by Nothofagus species, beginning to establish after \u03f3200 yr (Fig. 3B) species. Apart from N. fusca (to be discussed), forest composition agrees with descriptions of the area (Wardle 1984). The drop-off in biomass over 30 yr at about year 900 represents mortality of the last of the original cohort of the long-lived, dominant D. cupressinum. The gap model predicts that the eventual ''steady-state'' forest composition of the major species at Taupo and Reefton may be similar (Fig. 3A, B) , with comparable patterns for W. racemosa and the podocarp species D. cupressinum, P. ferruginea, and P. taxifolia at both sites. Slight differences are evident, with Reefton predicted to have a larger beech component and B. tawa restricted to Taupo, as observed in nature.",

However, Franz Josef is located within the 150-km stretch of the South Island west coast where Nothofagus is absent (referred to as the ''beech gap'').

Other species present include Griselinia littoralis, Libocedrus bidwillii, and Pseudowintera colorata. This change in species composition with elevation corresponds with that commonly observed along the western slopes of the Southern Alps in New Zealand (e.g., Wardle 1991) . The total biomass in these simulated slope forests is about two-thirds that estimated for the lowland podocarp forests. This reduction is caused partly by a change in species composition from the large, lowland podocarp, Dacrydium cupressinum, to the smaller-statured podocarp, P. hallii, with the broad-leaved hardwood W. racemosa, and is exacerbated by the decline in biomass of the dominant M. umbellata.

When we imposed a mean disturbance return time of 300 yr and allowed fallen material to remain on site, predicted total biomass of Nothofagus species at Reefton increased from 5.5% without disturbance to 27.5%. The beech N. fusca is common in the area (Wardle 1984) , but in simulations without disturbance, it was virtually absent (Fig. 3B) . The introduction of disturbance allowed N. fusca to capture \u03fe12% of total biomass, increased N. menziesii from 5% to 16% of total biomass, and led to the establishment of a small amount of N. solandri. With this disturbance regime, the earlyestablishing and common hardwood Weinmannia racemosa retained a constant presence and more than doubled its share of biomass from 5.6% to 13.4%. These gains came at the expense of the podocarps, with the biomass of Prumnopitys species reduced by onehalf and Dacrydium cupressinum reduced by one-third to 26%, compared to a scenario without random disturbance.",

At the sites tested, the model does not establish any species where it does not belong, with the exception of the ''beech gap,'' to be discussed. For example, the commonly described pattern of colonization, which has the fast-colonizing Kunzea ericoides and Leptospermum scoparium acting as ''nurse'' species for Agathis australis or podocarps (Ogden 1983) , is reproduced in the Riverhead, Auckland simulation ( Fig. 2A) , as is the eventual replacement of Agathis by hardwoods and podocarps . In the initial 100-200 yr, the Riverhead simulation also shows the common hardwoods Weinmannia silvicola, Knightia excelsa, Elaeocarpus dentatus, the beech Nothofagus truncata, and Phyllocladus trichomanoides establishing in numbers, and then gradually being overtopped and replaced by Agathis (Fig.  1) . This successional sequence in these warmer temperate forests is described by Ecroyd (1982) and Burns and Smale (1990) . The model also reproduces observed changes in species composition for different soils. Dri-er soil sites favor longer term Agathis occupation, whereas moister soils suit hardwood species (Ecroyd 1982) .",

From a harvesting trial in a typical 130-yr-old Agathis stand in the Hunua Ranges south of Auckland, Madgwick et al. (1982) estimated the Agathis biomass component at \u03f3132 Mg/ ha. On Agathis-occupied plots, with Hunua climate data, the model predicts a mean \u03f3133 Mg/ha Agathis component at 150 yr. Huge biomass is possible in clumped stands of mature Agathis forest (Wardle 1991) . Hinds and Reid (1957) estimate that a representative area of a typical mature Agathis forest with 100 merchantable stems/ha could produce \u03fe400 Mg/ha, on average, of commercial timber. Madgwick et al. (1982) found that stemwood made up 64% of total Agathis biomass in their study; this factor generates an approximate total biomass estimate of 625 Mg/ha. This compares with the model estimate in which total Agathis biomass reaches a peak of 630 Mg/ha in 300-450 yr old stands. Near Riverhead, Ogden (1983) recorded basal areas of Agathis of 72 m 2 /ha for a \u03f3300-yr-old stand and 55 m 2 /ha for a young \u03f3120-yr-old ''ricker'' stand. In comparison, our model simulations predict lower mean basal areas of 62 m 2 /ha on 300-yr-old Agathis-dominated stands and 49 m 2 /ha at 125 yr (Fig.  2B ). Burns and Smale (1990) , on an intermediate-stage 200-yr-old site on the Coromandel Peninsula, obtained a total basal area of 62 m 2 /ha, of which 42% was contributed by Agathis. Our model, with their Coromandel site climate data, predicted a similar total stand basal area, but with an 89% Agathis component.",

Forest gap models incorporate stochastic elements to mimic many ecosystem processes and produce multiple simulations to obtain average results and calculate confidence limits. Uncertainty in model data and possible errors in Ecological Applications Vol. 10, No. 1 field data also obscure reconstructions of past events (Rastetter 1996) . Deviations between model and reality result from a number of sources. These include potential errors in site parameters such as climate or soil water-holding capacity, errors in species parameters, and flaws in our understanding (and in modeling this understanding) of how site and species characteristics interact and affect forest growth. The results from Lake Thompson are instructive. Our climate estimates for Lake Thompson are taken from a site 50 km distant, in an area of high relief and climatic extremes; our estimate of initial site fertility may also be imprecise. We use the same set of growth parameters for each species throughout New Zealand (ignoring ecotypic variation) and some of these parameters are relatively imprecise estimates. A chronic problem with testing gap models in this way is that the species potentially available on a plot exceed those that naturally occur (the model provides for an omnipresent seed source, ignoring seed dispersal mechanisms and differing arrival times). This results in a relatively high percentage of ''other'' species that may exist for only several years before dying off. In addition, during early establishment, the model initiates all individuals as equal-aged saplings with a mean stem dbh of 1.5 cm. Time required to reach this point is not explicitly accounted for and there can already be considerable age differences between individuals, depending upon their species' growth characteristics.",

The species characteristics given to LINKNZ were not altered nor were the species limited to those present in the Lake Thompson area. DeVelice (1988) presented a basic FORET-type model with allometric parameters set for the five tree species of greatest importance at the Lake Thompson landslides. Even so, his model overestimated the initial density of Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides and the subsequent density of N. menziesii. In these DeVelice (1988) simulations, N. menziesii accounted for nearly 50% of total stand density by year 80, whereas Mark et al. (1964 Mark et al. ( , 1989 found that its density was generally \u03fd10% of the total. The LINKNZ model produced a better approximation to field counts of these Nothofagus species, and predicted the increases in Pseudowintera colorata over time that were noted by Mark et al. (1989) . It did deviate from field observations by initially establishing podocarp species (not included by DeVelice 1988); although these species did not become a significant part of the site biomass until year 200 (Fig. 4B) , they lowered relative density predictions for the hardwood species. The simulated early and numerous establishment of these bird-dispersed podocarp species lends support to the contention of Mark et al. (1989) that the initial floristics model of primary succession (Egler 1954) , in which species arrive simultaneously and successively gain dominance according to their life history attributes, may not fully account for the early dynamics on these slip faces. In summary, although our results and those of DeVelice (1988) deviate in some details from the short-term pattern of succession reported by Mark and co-workers, the mature forest simulation of LINKNZ corresponded closely to that described by Stewart (1986) and Mark et al. (1989) .",

Our results, based solely on gap-phase replacement dynamics inherent in the model, support the primary succession theory of Egler (1954) and the early belief (Cockayne 1928) that Agathis is successional to a climax podocarp forest (Figs. 1, 2A) and that strongly Agathis-dominated forests would occur only in the first 400 yr after largescale disturbance. The gap size and frequencies produced by the model are a consequence of the comparative life history attributes set for the trees that occupy the site. Thus, long-lived trees will produce gaps only infrequently; in the case of Agathis, this frequency is so low that there is sufficient time for the shade-tolerant hardwoods and podocarps to become well established, reducing the likelihood that enough light would penetrate through the understory of a tree-sized gap to permit abundant Agathis regeneration. In a study of Agathis treefall gaps, Ogden et al. (1987) found that Agathis established in only a few, enough to maintain a presence but not dominance. They estimated that, owing to its longevity (mean \u03fe 600 yr), Agathis could survive on any site up to 1500-2000 yr. The corresponding simulation ( Fig. 2A) , without large-scale disturbance, shows Agathis declining from an initial dominance, but remaining a significant component of the forest for nearly 1600 yr.",

Cockayne (1926) suggested that this absence could be the result of insufficient time for beech to have recolonized the area since the end of the last glaciation (\u03f310 000 yr BP). Our results for sites within the ''beech gap,'' such as Franz Josef and Hokitika (data not shown), lend support to Cockayne's hypothesis. When beech is part of the available species pool, it can establish and become a permanent, if lowbiomass, component of the forest. Even when beech availability on the site was delayed 1000 yr to allow the forest to fully establish first, LINKNZ indicated that a small amount of beech could establish. This suggests that poor modes of dispersal in beech may play a more significant role than any total inability to compete. Wardle (1964) also suggests that New Zealand beech may compete less effectively with existing vegetation where the rainfall is high, such as on the west coast, than in the drier conditions to the east of the axial ranges. The LINKNZ model supports this contention, because the simulations show that beech requires a longer period of time to become established in the ''beech gap'' sites than on the drier, cooler east side of the South Island in the Craigieburn Range (compare Fig. 3B , C with Fig. 3F, G) .",

The model suggests that stochastic disturbances that create gaps larger than normal treefall size promote the establishment of some beech species. Wardle (1984) points out that beech can be outcompeted in low-elevation, high-rainfall areas owing to difficulties in finding suitable sites and increasing competition in the high-density, species-rich understories. Ogden (1988) describes the role of synchronized cohort mortality in the dynamics of beech and how disturbance promotes Nothofagus fusca establishment. When we included beech in the species pool and introduced wind-blow disturbances (300-yr mean return time) to the simulations at Franz Josef located in the ''beech gap,'' beech biomass increased by a factor of 5 to reach \u03f325% of the total; N. menziesii biomass doubled, and the fast-growing N. fusca established and attained \u03fe12% of total biomass. By contrast, a disturbance regime that removed organic matter from the site inhibited beech species establishment and produced a more typical low-elevation hardwood-podocarp forest. Ogden (1988) notes that N. fusca prefers higher fertility sites and would be expected to have difficulty establishing. At this low-elevation, low-fertility site, the model predicts that other species, such as the common hardwood Weinmannia racemosa, would capture the area and lead to the establishment of large, dominant podocarps such as Dacrydium cupressinum.",

An ecological interpretation of this behavior is that, as the fast-growing, light-demanding, even-aged stands of N. solandri var. cliffortioides thin, they become replaced by relatively evenaged stands of the shade-tolerant N. menziesii. When these N. menziesii stands senesce, the faster growing N. solandri var. cliffortioides begin to recapture the site. Because N. menziesii is longer lived and can continue to regenerate under its own canopy, these oscillations lengthen and decrease in amplitude over subsequent generations.",

Both species have wide, overlapping soil fertility, soil moisture, and climatic tolerances (Wardle 1984, Benecke and Allen 1992 ; G. M. J. Hall and D. Y. Hollinger, unpublished manuscript) . In New Zealand, these species form almost continuous alpine and subalpine forests throughout the axial mountain ranges of both main islands. Wardle (1984) found that in mixed stands, dense, smalldiameter (young) Nothofagus menziesii usually occur in conjunction with large-diameter (old) N. solandri var. cliffortioides and, conversely, stands with low numbers of large N. menziesii trees often have high densities of young N. solandri var. cliffortioides trees. Ogden (1988) further suggested that N. solandri var. cliffortioides will gradually be replaced by N. menziesii unless the stand is severely disturbed. In fact, the Craigieburn forests are essentially monocultures of N. solandri var. cliffortioides, with few other canopy species. Disturbance events such as wind, earthquake-triggered landslips, and heavy snowfall (Wardle 1984) frequently disrupt these subalpine and alpine forests on the eastern slopes of the South Island axial range. Age-diameter distributions indicate that stands may be severely damaged by gales at periods of \u03f3120-150 yr, and stands suffer minor damage at intervals of 20-30 yr (Wardle 1984 , Jane 1986 , Harcombe et al. 1998 ). When we investigated the influence of disturbance on the dynamics and biomass of N. solandri var. cliffortioides-N. menziesii forests by adding stochastic disturbance (blowdown of whole-plot biomass) to the dynamics of the model, the counter-cyclical pattern of succession was removed (Fig. 6B) . Furthermore, as the mean interval between disturbances decreased, the relative percentage and absolute amount of N. menziesii in the resulting stands decreased from a 70% dominance to \u03fd20% for mean intervals greater than one event every 120 yr (Fig. 7) . This model behavior provides support for Wardle's (1984) conclusion that stability favors N. menziesii and disturbance favors N. solandri var. cliffortioides, and suggests why N. solandri var. cliffortioides can be so dominant in disturbance-prone subalpine forests.",

The characteristics of New Zealand tree species are significantly different from those of eastern North American trees. New Zealand species are generally long-lived evergreens with low N and high specific mass foliage that is retained in the canopy for several years. Yet, a model that was based on ecological processes of tree competition and growth, litter decomposition, and N cycling that originated primarily in North America and was designed to simulate the ecology of eastern North American species, only required minor modifications to acceptably simulate general forest patterns and processes across climatic gradients in a range of New Zealand forest types. The most significant modifications improved the way in which the predecessor model, LINKAGES, calculated the forest floor light environment and modified the slow growth rate conditions that trigger mortality.",

They provided support for the model's underlying hypothesis: interactions among demographic processes determining plant population structure, microbial processes determining N availability, and geological processes determining water availability explain much of the observed variation in ecosystem C and N storage and cycling (Pastor and Post 1985) . In this framework, geology and climate act as constraints within which feedbacks between vegetation and light availability, and between vegetation and N availability, operate. By incorporating a simple disturbance regime into the model, we also supported the hypothesis that large-scale disturbance is of importance in shaping the dynamics and current composition of New Zealand forests (Veblen and Stewart 1982 , Ogden 1985 , Wardle 1991 ).",
