            "text": "Introduction During the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, while healthcare systems and hospitals are diverting their resources to combat the pandemic, patients who require spinal surgeries continue to accumulate. The aim of this study is to describe a novel hospital capacity versus clinical justification triage score (CCTS) to prioritize patients who require surgery during the \"new normal state\" of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology A consensus study using the Delphi technique was carried out among clinicians from the Orthopaedic Surgery, Neurosurgery, and Anaesthesia departments. Three rounds of consensus were carried out via survey and Webinar discussions. Results A 50-points score system consisting of 4 domains with 4 subdomains was formed. The CCTS were categorized into the hospital capacity, patient factors, disease severity, and surgery complexity domains. A score between 30 and 50 points indicated that the proposed operation should proceed without delay. A score of less than 20 indicates that the proposed operation should be postponed. A score between 20 and 29 indicates that the surgery falls within a grey area where further discussion should be undertaken to make a joint justification for approval of surgery. Conclusion This study is a proof of concept for the novel CCTS scoring system to prioritize surgeries to meet the rapidly changing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. It offers a simple and objective method to stratify patients who require surgery and allows these complex and difficult decisions to be unbiased and made transparently among surgeons and hospital administrators.",

Urgent elective care was defined as patients with spinal conditions that may lead to neurological deterioration if not operated on in the near future, while routine elective care was defined as patients with stable spinal conditions that can continue conservative treatment. NHS recommends delaying all elective spinal surgery, and only emergent and urgent surgery should be performed [5] . Similarly, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) recommends their members to cancel all elective Orthopaedic surgeries [6] , and the North American Spine Society (NASS) recommended that all elective spinal surgeries where spinal pain and dysfunction can be reasonably managed without surgical procedures should be postponed [7] . Based on NHS, AAOS, and NASS guidelines, Singapore Spine Society (SSS) defined emergency surgical conditions as unstable spinal fractures resulting from either trauma or pathological causes in patients with neurological deficits, cauda equina syndrome, or spinal infection, and has recommended that these cases should not be postponed despite the ongoing crisis [8] . The downstream effect of these changes is the accumulation of a large number of patients who require spinal surgery when COVID-19 measures ease.",

While we should strive to provide timely treatment for these patients, one must be cognizant of the possibility of a second or even third wave of COVID-19 cases until a vaccine or herd immunity is attained [9] . A triage algorithm is needed to ensure patients who require surgery more urgently or less resource-dependent are prioritized, to allow the healthcare system to maintain its capacity for a rapid response against the surges in COVID-19 infections and the institute financial viability. The aim of this paper is to propose a generic scoring system for spine surgery triage to assist healthcare institutions and physicians'decision-making in prioritizing the large number of patients who require surgeries during the \"new-normal state\" of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The \"flattening the curve\" approach using early infection detection, social distancing, and isolation has been the strategy of choice to reduce mortality rates from the COVID-19 pandemic [22] . Higher COVID-19 mortality rates were seen when healthcare systems unable to support the high numbers of COVID-19 patients [23, 24] . As the hospitals' capacity was stretched to the limit, all elective surgeries were cancelled to preserve its resource capacity. This has led to a downstream effect of a large backlog of patients who requires elective surgeries when the COVID-19 measures ease. Using a susceptible-infectious-recovered model, Leung et al. [25] predicted a possible second wave of COVID-19 infections. It is hence evident that when countries manage to control their first wave of COVID-19 infections, one must anticipate and place measures in place to ensure the hospitals' capacity will be able to tackle a possible second or third wave of COVID-19 infections until a vaccine is available or herd immunity occurs [9] . In this study, we proposed a 50-point triage system, with 4 domains, 4 subdomains, and 49 subdomain factors to triage the priority for patients' spinal surgery and objectively match the hospital resource allocations. This allows for the often complex and difficult decision of assessing the relative importance of different patients to be transparent and unbiased among surgeons, hospital administrators, and patients. It provides the evaluation of factors including operating theatre constraints, resource requirements for post-operative patient care, and the number of times the patients' surgery Values are presented as mean (Range) * p values < 0.05, indicating that there was a statistically significant difference between groups had been cancelled due to lack of hospital capacity to be reviewed, which were otherwise not considered in the established disease severity classification. Furthermore, the separation of providing care and making difficult triage decisions by the clinician can significantly reduce physician burnout and moral injury [3, 26, 27] . In the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res organization, guidelines and recommendations exist to assist surgeons in prioritization during wartime surgery, in the face of limited resources [28] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prachand et al. [29] described a generalized 5-point scale scoring system to assist in decision-making for all types of surgeries [3] , which may not be suitable for use to triage the multitude of factors needed for considerations in spinal surgery.",

Factors such as anticipated duration of hospitalization stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and the adequacy of hospital equipment will determine if the hospital can support the additional burden of an elective surgical patient places on the healthcare system, potentially risking the diversion of scarce resources away from COVID-19 patients. In Italy, when the public health needs for COVID-19 patients have exceeded the capabilities of the healthcare systems, the Italian Society of Anaesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) has published recommendations and ethical considerations to aid physicians in the decision-making process of prioritization [30] . In Australia, it has been reported that a maximal surge of COVID-19 cases would require an increase of 191% in ICU beds, 120% increase in invasive ventilators, 245% increase in senior doctors, and 269% increase in ICU nurses [31] . The incorporation of the hospital capacity domain to monitor the hospital equipment resources, ICU availability, hospital beds and ventilators in general anaesthesia requirements allow for flexibility in this triage system to meet the needs of this fluid state of COVID-19 situation.",

Patients' comorbidities have been reported as risk factors for postoperative complications arising from a variety of spinal surgeries [32] [33] [34] [35] . We used the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) classification, a well-validated simple tool, to assess the patients' comorbidities. It has been reported that a higher ASA grade predicts increased post-operative revision surgeries, length of hospitalization stay, wound complications, cardio-respiratory complications, and mortality, which in turn translates to an increased strain on the hospitals' resources [36] . Surgery waiting time, the number of times surgery has been postponed due to the pandemic, and the patient's COVID status should be taken into consideration as well. This is similar to the situation in organ transplantations, where these factors come into play for decision-making and surgical waiting time should be accounted for in prioritization of surgery [37, 38] .",

It carries the highest weightage in the CCTS to provide the differentiating power required to meet the recommendations set by the established international academic societies and the consensus obtained by the faculties in the study. Due to the impracticality to include all published spinal disease-specific score system into the CCTS, we designed the disease severity domain in the CCTS to be broad-based with subdomain categories as the type of spinal pathology, nerve deficit, the severity of condition and pain score. The severity of the condition subdomain was categorized into mild, moderate, and severe which was intentionally kept open to interpretation by the user and based on the surgeon's clinical judgment. Validated scoring systems that define the severity of disease were enclosed as an appendix and were recommended to be utilized in conjunction with the CCTS to avoid subjectivity. These include the thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS) [14] , spinal instability neoplastic score (SINS) score [17] , Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score [16] , MRI grading systems for central canal [39] and foraminal stenosis [40] , Cobb angles, Neck disability index (NDI) [18] , and Oswestry disability index (ODI) [19] . The visual analogue score (VAS) pain score was incorporated for pain subdomain in our score [13] , as Matamalas reported that patient-reported pain score was a predominant driving force for patients to demand for surgery [41] .",

The complexity of surgery reflects the potential risk of patients developing intra-and post-operative complications, which in turn requires additional hospital resources. Horn et al. [42] reported that with an increased number of spinal levels involved and longer duration of surgery, there is an increased risk of intra-and post-operative complications, leading to increased clinical and economic burden to the hospital. This increased inpatients' hospitalization and ICU stay put further strain on the scarce resources of the hospital. Blood transfusion requirement is another important consideration. In addition to the fact that blood donation and supplies have dwindled during the COVID-19 pandemic, Hu et al. [43] reported in a meta-analysis that patients requiring blood transfusion had a 3 times increase in the risk of developing post-operative infection after spinal surgery.",

It is simple, objective, and allows for the otherwise complex and difficult decision to become transparent and unbiased among clinicians, hospital administrators, and patients. It matches patient care to hospital resource capacity and reduces physician burnout and moral injury. The scoring system can also be easily modified to apply to other surgical specialties. As the hospital capacity and patient factor domain remain as constant universal considerations in this pandemic, only minor changes to the disease severity and surgery complexity domains for the specific specialty are required. A score range with recommendations to \"defer surgery\", \"consider for surgery,\" and \"proceed to list for surgery\", respectively, was defined. The third round of consensus was obtained from the survey via email correspondence. Each faculty received the revised score, a table with hypothetical patient scenarios calculations, and the proposed interpretation of the score range. The faculties were asked to indicate whether they agree or disagree with the interpretation of the proposed scoring table and score range. A consensus was defined a priori as 80% agreement across the faculties 13 .",

            "text": "After the study objectives, the structure of the scoring system, and initial parameters were determined by the lead author, the proposed system was refined using the Delphi method, spread across three rounds of analyses (Fig. 1) .In round one, the core structure of the scoring system with different domains, subdomains, and individual subdomain factors was presented to the faculties via a Webinar discussion platform. A consensus of subdomain factors for inclusion and exclusion in the scoring system was made, and the scoring system was revised. In round two, each factor of the scoring system was ranked for importance via an email survey. The faculties were instructed to rank each factor in isolation on a Likert scale of 1-10, where 1 represents the least important factor that determines the priority of surgery, and 10 indicates a maximal priority for surgery to proceed without delay. An open-text column was included for the faculties to give additional input. Each faculty was asked to complete the ranking individually, without consulting each other. The authors then calculated the mean and standard deviations of the collated responses from the faculties. Subgroup analysis by the department was performed, and the mean scores for agreement amongst the faculty were obtained. A second Webinar discussion was held with all the faculties to discuss the areas of agreement and disagreement. A consensus was reached on the priorities of surgical factors, and the domains, subdomains, and factors in the scoring system were consolidated. The final score and weightage of each factor were assigned and determined by the lead authors to meet the faculties' consensus, and guideline recommendations from NHS 5 , NASS 7 , AAOS 6 , and SSS 8 .A basic score unit of 0, 1, and 2 was assigned to each factor in the subdomain. The scoring system was designed such that a higher score indicates an increased priority for surgery to proceed. A 100-300% increase in the score number was made, depending on the subdomain weightage requirement, in accordance with the NASS 7 , NHS 5 , AAOS 6 , and SSS 12 guidelines. Calculations using the scoring system to triage hypothetical patient scenarios requiring surgeries for unstable spinal fractures with neurological deficits, cauda equina syndrome, single or multilevel cervical myelopathy, lumbar prolapsed intervertebral disc, 1-3 levels lumbar spondylolisthesis, adult and children spinal deformity were performed.
