Targeting CXCR7 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach to reduce pulmonary inflammation; however, its role and its crosstalk with the two chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4 via their shared ligands CXCL11 and CXCL12 is not yet completely understood. The present paper aimed to characterize the pathological role of the CXCR3/CXCR4/CXCR7 axis in a murine model of ALI. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhalation in mice resulted in the development of key pathologic features of ALI/ARDS, including breathing dysfunctions, alteration in the alveolar capillary barrier, and lung inflammation. LPS inhalation induced immune cell infiltration into the bronchoalveolar space, including CXCR3 + and CXCR4 + cells, and enhanced the expression of the ligands of these two chemokine receptors. The first-in-class CXCR7 antagonist, ACT-1004-1239, increased levels of CXCL11 and CXCL12 in the plasma without affecting their levels in inflamed lung tissue, and consequently reduced CXCR3 + and CXCR4 + immune cell infiltrates into the bronchoalveolar space. In the early phase of lung inflammation, characterized by a massive influx of neutrophils, treatment with ACT-1004-1239 significantly reduced the LPS-induced breathing pattern alteration. Both preventive and therapeutic treatment with ACT-1004-1239 reduced lung vascular permeability and decreased inflammatory cell infiltrates. In conclusion, these results demonstrate a key pathological role of CXCR7 in ALI/ ARDS and highlight the clinical potential of ACT-1004-1239 in ALI/ARDS pathogenesis.",

Furthermore, the mechanistic and functional roles of CXCR7 were evaluated over time using the selective and firstin-class CXCR7 antagonist ACT-1004-1239, which blocks CXCL11and CXCL12-induced \u03b2-arrestin recruitment (Richard-Bildstein et al., 2020) .",

Total BAL protein concentration was significantly increased from 24 h up to 72 h after LPS challenge, compared with control mice ( Figure 1B) . To determine the effect of LPS on inflammatory cell recruitment to the alveolar space, BAL immune cell phenotyping was performed using flow cytometry. LPS inhalation led to a time-dependent infiltration of CD45 + immune cells into the BAL compared with control mice, peaking 24 h after LPS challenge ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1 ). In control mice, the main BAL immune cell population was represented by tissue resident alveolar macrophages ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure  S1 ). In contrast, in LPS-exposed mice, 5 h after LPS challenge, neutrophils represented the majority of BAL immune infiltrates ( Figure 1D ). This early massive influx of neutrophils peaked 24 h after the LPS challenge before strongly decreasing 48 and 72 h post-LPS challenge ( Table 1) . Other BAL immune cells such as NK cells, B cells, pDCs, and classical CD11b \u2212 DCs also peaked 24 h after LPS challenge ( Table 1 ) but altogether represented less than 9% of the overall BAL population at any given time point ( Figure 1D ). In contrast, infiltration of inflammatory macrophages and T cells peaked later, at 48 h after LPS challenge (Table 1) , and together represented more than 20% of the BAL immune cells ( Figure 1D ). At 72 h post-LPS challenge, BAL immune cell numbers were still significantly increased compared with control mice ( Figure 1C and Table 1 ). Infiltration of neutrophils was also confirmed in the lung tissue by histology, 24 h after LPS challenge (Supplementary Figure S2) .",

The lack of effective therapy has been recently underlined by the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, which causes ARDS in 3%-5% of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Horie et al., 2020) . The preclinical ALI/ARDS model, induced by LPS inhalation in rodents, is a commonly used model, which manifests key features of human ALI/ARDS (Menezes et al., 2005; Matute-Bello et al., 2008) . In the current study, the consequences of LPS inhalation were characterized over time in DBA/1 mice, a strain of mice expressing both CXCR7 ligands (CXCL11 and CXCL12). In line with previous reports in similar models but not expressing CXCL11 (Lefort et al., 2001; Lax et al., 2014) , inhalation of nebulized LPS in DBA/1 mice induced key parameters recommended by the American Thoracic Society to detect the presence of ARDS in laboratory animals: LPS inhalation caused a rapid and significant recruitment of inflammatory cells to the alveolar space, especially neutrophils at early time points after LPS challenge followed by macrophages and T cells at later time points. Furthermore, LPS inhalation increased alveolar capillary barrier permeability. The LPSinduced breathing pattern alteration was also observed, which has been shown to be associated with altered lung function (H\u00e5kansson et al., 2012) .",

Previous reports have suggested that both the CXCR3 and CXCR4 axis play a pivotal role in the prolonged recruitment and/or retention of immune cells in ALI/ ARDS, exerting a damaging effect in the lung (Petty et al., 2007; Nie et al., 2008; Kelsen et al., 2009) . Consistent with findings from human patients and mouse models of ALI (Saetta et al., 2002; Petty et al., 2007; Hartl et al., 2008; Costello et al., 2012; Ichikawa et al., 2013; Ngamsri et al., 2017; Liao et al., 2020) , in this study using LPS-challenged DBA/1 mice, CXCR3 and CXCR4 ligands were elevated in the BAL, which was associated with increased BAL CXCR3 + and CXCR4 + cell infiltrates. In line with previously reported data (Petty et al., 2007) , the expression of CXCR4 on BAL myeloid cells steadily increased over time following LPS-induced lung injury. Importantly, the same observation was made regarding the expression of CXCR3, especially on lymphoid cells, suggesting a distinct role for CXCR3 and CXCR4 in the recruitment and persistence/retention of BAL infiltrates during ALI/ARDS.

Even though CXCL11 was found at lower levels than CXCL9 and CXCL10 in the BAL from LPS challenged mice, this FIGURE 5 | Antagonism of CXCR7 reduces LPS-induced ALI/ARDS. Treatment with the CXCR7 antagonist ACT-1004-1239 significantly reduced LPS-induced breathing pattern alteration (A), alveolar-capillary barrier permeability (B), and immune cell infiltrates in the bronchoalveolar space (C) compared with vehicle-treated-LPS exposed mice. Mice were treated with vehicle (LPS-vehicle; black) or ACT-1004-1239 (100 mg/kg, LPS-ACT-1004-1239) orally, twice daily, starting 1 h prior to LPS challenge (preventive setting; LPS-ACT Prev ; red) or 3 h after LPS challenge (therapeutic setting; LPS-ACT Ther ; hatched bar). Control mice were treated with vehicle and inhaled NaCl 0.9% (NaCl-vehicle; white).

Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 748740 chemokine represents the most potent CXCR3 ligand (Sauty et al., 2001) . To date, the role of the CXCR3/CXCR7/CXCL11 axis in preclinical ALI models has not been investigated as previous studies were conducted in C57BL/6 mice, a mouse strain lacking CXCL11 (Sierro et al., 2007) . We show here that antagonizing CXCR7 with ACT-1004-1239 not only led to the elevation of CXCL12 in the plasma, confirming previous data (Richard-Bildstein et al., 2020; Pouzol et al., 2021) but also of the inducible chemokine CXCL11, in a dose-dependent manner, confirming the inhibition of the scavenging activity of CXCR7 in vivo. In contrast, CXCR7 antagonism did not further increase the LPS-induced elevation of CXCL11 and CXCL12 concentrations in the inflamed lung tissue, but rather tended to normalize them, likely leading to a disruption in the chemokine concentration gradient from the blood to the injured lung tissue. Consequently, a significant reduction in CXCR3 + lymphoid and CXCR4 + myeloid and lymphoid cells in the BAL was observed upon treatment with the CXCR7 antagonist, suggesting an inhibition of directional migration of these cells from the blood to the inflamed tissue and/or a reduction in their retention in the tissue. The immunomodulatory effect of CXCR7 antagonism was consistently shown both in a preventive and therapeutic setting, highlighting its potential clinical impact on acute pulmonary inflammation. Besides the pivotal role of CXCR7 on immune cell infiltration to the BAL, expression of CXCR7 in the vasculature has been associated with a disruption of the endothelial barrier function (Totonchy et al., 2014) . CXCR7 antagonism with ACT-1004-1239, both in a preventive and therapeutic setting, successfully reduced alterations in the alveolar capillary barrier function as shown by a reduction in the overall protein content in the BAL following LPS challenge. Furthermore, CXCL12 has been shown to promote endothelial barrier integrity in vivo via CXCR4 (Kobayashi et al., 2014) and to enhance barrier function in FIGURE 6 | Summary of pathological role of CXCR7 and potential benefit of CXCR7 antagonism during ALI/ARDS. (A) CXCR7 functions predominantly as a scavenger receptor for its two ligands: the interferon-inducible chemokine CXCL11 and the constitutive chemokine CXCL12. Binding of its ligands leads to internalization of the CXCR7-ligand complex and ligand degradation. CXCL11 and CXCL12 also bind and activate the signaling chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4, respectively. The CXCR3/CXCR4/CXCR7 axes play an important role in lung inflammation. CXCR7 scavenging activity tightly regulates the extracellular levels of its ligands, facilitating the establishment and maintenance of CXCL11/12 chemokine concentration gradients and CXCR3 + /CXCR4 + cell migration from the blood to the inflamed lung. In addition, increased CXCR7 expression in the inflamed lung has been reported to be associated with breathing pattern alteration and endothelial barrier dysfunction. (B) CXCR7 antagonism with the CXCR7 antagonist ACT-1004-1239 exhibits immunomodulatory effects: by blocking the scavenging activity of the receptor and consequently increasing CXCL11 and CXCL12 plasma concentrations, chemokine gradients are disrupted, inhibiting CXCR3 + and CXCR4 + cell migration to the inflamed lung. In addition, treatment with ACT-1004-1239, by increasing plasma CXCL12 and/or by direct inhibition of CXCR7 signaling, ameliorates ALI-induced breathing pattern alteration and endothelial barrier dysfunction.",

These data suggest that the reduced vascular permeability seen in the ALI/ARDS model following CXCR7 antagonism could be a result of a direct effect on endothelial cells and/or indirect effect via increased CXCL12 concentration. An additional interesting finding of this study was the effect of ACT-1004-1239 on breathing pattern alteration following LPS challenge. Endotoxins have been related to pulmonary functional disturbances both in humans (Leaker et al., 2013) and mice (Lefort et al., 2001) and have been shown to exacerbate established emphysema in several experimental models (Kobayashi et al., 2013; de Oliveira et al., 2019) . Therefore, this aspect may be relevant to the pathogenesis of ARDS, especially at the late stages where emphysema-like lesions are present (Terzi et al., 2014) . In the present study, treatment with ACT-1004-1239 reduced the Penh increase observed within 2 h following LPS inhalation. Published data in similar models reported that LPS-induced Penh increase was dependent on TNF\u03b1 release (Schnyder-Candrian et al., 2005) . However, the effect observed with ACT-1004-1239 on this early breathing pattern change could not be explained by a reduction in LPS-induced BAL TNF\u03b1 elevation (data not shown). More studies are needed to unravel the mechanisms that account for this effect.",

In addition, the effect of CXCR7 antagonism on LPS-induced alveolar capillary barrier permeability increase was assessed 48 h post-LPS challenge, at the peak of the LPS effect (Figure 1B).
