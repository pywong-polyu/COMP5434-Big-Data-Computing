To this end, we exploit a simple SIS-like (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model with negative feedback between the infected population size and a collective economic resource associated with the average amount of money or income per economic agent. The coupling mechanism in such a system is supposed to be of activation type, with the recovery rate governed by the Arrhenius-like law. In this case, economic resource formally plays the role of effective market temperature and the minimum level of resource consumption is associated with activation energy. Such a coupling can result in the collapsing effect opposite to thermal explosion, so that the epidemic could ultimately drive the system to a collapse at nonzero activation energy because of the limited resource. In this case, the system can no longer stabilize and return to the stable pre-epidemic state or a poorer post-epidemic state. We demonstrate that the system's collapse can partially be mitigated by external subsidies meaning constant resource inflow from some external source or by means of debt interpreted as a negative resource. We also consider a simple quarantine scenario and show that it can lead to different socioeconomic outcomes, depending on initial resource (market temperature) and the minimum level of resource consumption (activation energy).",

A dramatic example is the spread of COVID-19 that had a domino effect on both the social and economic levels. Different countries and governments resorted to different mitigation strategies and quarantine measures [2] . Countries with a higher resource level (economic or financial) could use stricter quarantine measures, while for countries with a lower resource the use of such measures led to the economic collapse, at least for a number of industries and/or social groups. The problem of strategy selection reduces to problems of optimal control theory for feedback systems [3] [4] [5] or to the theory of games in a more general case [6] . The use of one or another action strategy reduces to the classical problem of choice [7] , i.e., to the definition of the sacrifice, when the salvation of someone or something is only possible at the expense of the other one.",

For population systems, such behaviors can be triggered by the onset and spreading of an epidemic, when many individuals become infected by some contagion [10] . The dynamics of epidemic-like processes is determined by transitions between the inner states of individuals, such as susceptible, infected, ill, recovered, etc. It is usually described in terms of mean numbers of individuals in these states. For economic systems, critical behaviors can be triggered by the onset of a financial crisis or bankruptcy spreading [11] , when many economic agents lose their money, * gandzha@iop.kiev.ua \u2020 kliushnychenko@iop.kiev.ua \u2021 lukyan@iop.kiev.ua income, or wealth. Such processes are described by another dynamical variable, usually associated with money, and are characterized by the distribution of money or income among economic agents. The equilibrium distribution of money or income in systems of economic agents was shown to obey the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics [12] [13] [14] [15] or, in a more general form, Planck and Bose-like distributions [15] [16] [17] . In this case, the average amount of money or income per agent is associated with the effective temperature, which is sometimes called the economic or market temperature [12] . The crisis state in such systems is regarded, in particular, as the one corresponding to the Bose-Einstein condensate-like state [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

This field results in transitions between two agent states (active and passive). To be consistent, it would be desirable to exploit the kinetic approach based on the Boltzmann equation, where the collision mechanism of epidemic spreading [20] as well as the resource or money redistribution [13, 21, 22] could appropriately be taken into account. Usually, such non-equilibrium processes are described using a more simple approach based on evolution equations for the averaged variables [23] [24] [25] , such as the mean numbers of active (susceptible) and passive (infected) individuals in population and average resource, which formally corresponds to the market temperature. As a matter of fact, collision mechanisms determine the form or symmetry of equations for the averaged variables and the corresponding rate constants, such as transmission rate, recovery rate, production rate, etc. To describe the socioeconomic interplay, we have to make some assumptions about the mechanism of coupling between the spreading process and resource.",

The counter effect on the budget was of direct and almost reciprocal character described by the same model function.

In the framework of our simple model, a formal field associated with contagion is absent. In general, eliminating a field that interacts with particles results in an induced particle-particle interaction and a memory effect (see, e.g., Ref. [40] ). In our case, this induced interaction between the agents affects the agent's inner state and is formally represented by the phenomenological collision term \u221d s(1 \u2212 s) in Eq. (2a), where any possible agent-agent correlations and memory effects are absent. It is the interaction that drives the system out of equilibrium. In this regard, the system's response on the contagion field can be considered in terms of system's response on a perturbation of initial conditions at t = 0,",

Thus, the system collapses at sufficiently high R 0 = \u03b2/ \u03b3 0 (high transmission rate \u03b2 or low recovery rate constant \u03b3 0 ) and/or sufficiently high E = E/ \u03c1 0 (high activation energy E or low initial equilibrium resource \u03c1 0 ). Otherwise, the system occupies either the disease-free equilibrium or endemic equilibrium. An additional resource deficit (large initial resource fluctuations \u03b4\u03c1(0)) can also lead to a collapse. Here we will show that the ultimate collapse considered in the previous subsection is not possible when \u039b > 0. On the other hand, there can coexist several distinct endemic phases that turn into the single endemic phase and the collapse phase in the limit \u039b \u2192 0.",

When an economic agent does not have enough money to pay his bills, he can borrow the required amount from an external reservoir (e.g., from a bank), and his balance becomes negative. When an agent with a negative balance earns some money, he uses this money to repay the debt until his balance becomes positive. The same ideology also applies to the concept of wealth, with negative wealth associated with debt [45] . In this work, resource \u03c1 is associated with average income per economic agent. By analogy to money and wealth, it can become negative if a group of economic agents described by Eqs.

Such a scenario is possible even when the basic reproduction number R 0 is smaller than unity, in contrast to the standard epidemic models, where the epidemic can spread only at R 0 > 1 [23, 24] . Collapse is generally caused by the reduction of the recovery rate \u03b3. Besides the effect of the Arrhenius factor, which identifies the probability that the individual may recover or get help (e.g., a medical service), the recovery rate can also go down when the rate constant \u03b3 0 in Eq. (1) gets smaller. In particular, the parameter \u03b3 0 formally takes into account the number of attempts the individual needs to make to get available response. In other words, the average time of delivery of medical services to the patients gets longer at smaller \u03b3 0 .",

We demonstrated that the system's collapse can partially be mitigated by external subsidies meaning constant resource inflow from some external source or by means of debt interpreted as a negative resource. On the other hand, social regulations involving quarantine measures can have an ambiguous effect. When the initial equilibrium resource value is high enough and/or the minimum level of resource consumption is sufficiently low, the use of quarantine measures significantly improves the general socioeconomic situation. However, implementing strict quarantine measures in the case of low resource can finally lead to the collapse of the system being initially either in the endemic equilibrium or even in the diseasefree equilibrium. These results provide a clear illustration to possible outcomes of epidemic-like systemic shocks.",

In this regard, it is interesting that our model given by Eqs.
