Limited data suggest pulmonary microvascular thrombosis may play a role in progressive respiratory failure.

COVID-19, first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has contributed at significant mortality in several countries with the number of infected cases increasing exponentially worldwide. 1, 2 COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern. Currently, there is no known effective treatment or vaccination is available in spite of many studies are ongoing. 3 The main way of disease transmission from person to person is via respiratory droplets among close contacts. 4 The real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs is used to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 after clinical and radiological features had suspected the diagnosis. One of the most significant poor prognostic features in those patients is redevelopment of coagulopathy and elevated ferritin. 5, 6 Elevated D-dimer are one of the commonest laboratory findings noted in COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. 6 Elevation of fibrinogen and other inflammatory markers is common as well. Lymphopenia has been reported in 30-50% of patients with COVID-19. 6 Herein, we report an unusual case of a child confirmed COVID-19 presented initially by dry cough without fever and complicated by massive acute pulmonary embolism and lung infarction and treated successfully with hydroxylchloroquine and azithromycin, in addition to anticoagulant medication.",

Although she had been on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, which were escalated to a combination of tazocin and vancomycin, her body temperature continued to spike daily. Antimicrobials therapy was stopped after the microbiological laboratories had reported negative blood cultures on multiple occasions. Due to the clinical manifestations of persistent fever and dry cough, radiological features of ground glass appearance and PE, in addition to laboratory testing of progressive leucopenia and lymphopenia, COVID-19 was suspected. On March 31 st , COVID-19 testing was performed by (rRT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab. While waiting the COVID-19 rRT-PCR result, the patient was started on daily oral hydroxylchloroquine 200 mg as a suspected with antiphospholipid syndrome because of PE and associated elevation of both antinuclear and antiphospholipid antibodies with elevated ESR and CRP Three days later, COVID-19 rRT-PCR results reported as positive which led to the addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine. The child remained clinically stable , afebrile, and on room air without any cardiorespiratory assistance. After two COVID-19 negative serial RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the nasopharyngeal swab, she was discharged home from anticoagulant therapy in a good condition with a repeat of CTPA in two weeks from discharge for evaluation of her clinical condition.",
