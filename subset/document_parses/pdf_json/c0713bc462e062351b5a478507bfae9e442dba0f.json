We employ the MIDAS-RV framework and construct the MIDAS-LASSO model and its regime switching extension (namely, MS-MIDAS-LASSO). First, among all considered predictors, the economic policy uncertainty indices (especially the equity market volatility index) and the CBOE volatility index are the most noteworthy predictors. Although the CBOE volatility index has the best predictive ability for stock market volatility, its predictive ability has weakened during the COVID-19 epidemic, and the equity market volatility index is best during this period. Second, the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model has the best predictive performance compared to other competing models. The superior forecasting performance of this model is robust, even when distinguishing between high-and low-volatility periods. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model even outperforms the traditional LASSO strategy and its regime switching extension. Furthermore, the superior predictive performance of this model has not changed with the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

First, the diversity of potential predictors poses a great challenge to the selection of predictors. For example, studies have determined the predictive abilities of macroeconomic and financial variables for stock market volatility (Nonejad, 2017; Paye, 2012) . In recent years, with the introduction of economic policy uncertainty indices, some studies have also determined the predictive power of some economic policy uncertainty indicators (e.g., the economic policy uncertainty index, trade policy uncertainty index, monetary policy uncertainty index, equity market volatility index and geopolitical risk index) relative to stock market volatility (Alqahtani et al., 2020a; Gupta & Wohar, 2019; Olasehinde-Williams, 2021; Paye, 2012; Yu et al., 2018) . In addition, studies have found evidence that the stock market can be driven by investors' psychology (Daniel et al., 2002; Tseng, 2006) and determined the predictive power of some market sentiment indicators (see, e.g., Gupta et al., 2014; Perez-Liston et al., 2014; Oliveira et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020a) . Other indicators, such as financial stress indices, have also been proven to have potential forecasting ability (Gupta et al., 2014; Singh, 2016; Sum, 2014) . The predictive abilities of these potential predictors tend to change with changes in various external factors, making it more difficult to find stable predictors.",

To solve these problems, some studies have used the key information from multiple variables extracted by dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares regression analysis (PLS) technology, to construct a forecasting model for achieving information integration (Asgharian et al., 2013; Cepni et al., 2019; Poncela et al., 2011) , and they have discovered the ability of PCA-and PLS-based prediction methods to improve the accuracy of volatility prediction. In addition, forecast combination methods can also be used as information integration methods, and such approaches have been proven to be helpful for producing accurate and stable forecasts Paye, 2012; Yang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020) . In recent years, with the rapid increase in computing power and the emergence of big data, machine learning techniques have gained wide attention and application in the field of financial prediction. For example, Ma et al. (2018) and Zhang et al. (2019b) employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method to forecast crude oil volatility with a large set of predictors, finding that the out-of-sample forecasting performance of LASSO is significantly better than that of models with individual predictors and combination approaches. Other studies have proven the superior forecasting effect of LASSO technology (Ng, 2013; Siliverstovs, 2015) , and LASSO is also the focus of this paper.",

            "text": "Refer to the existing literatures, we finalized the potential predictors included in the three categories of indicators. The economic policy uncertainty indicators considered in this paper include: (1) Global economic policy uncertainty index (GEPU); (2) US economic policy uncertainty index (EPU); (3) US monetary policy uncertainty index (MPU); (4) US trade policy uncertainty index (TPU); (5) US health care uncertainty index (HCU); (6) US equity market volatility index (EMV); (7) US infectious disease equity market volatility tracker (IDEMV); (8) Geopolitical risk index (GPR); and (9) US economic uncertainty related queries (EURQ). The market sentiment indicators considered in this paper include: (10) The CBOE volatility index (VIX); (11) ISEE sentiment index (ISEESI); (12) News sentiment index (NSI); and (13) US AAII retail investor sentiment index (AAII). The financial stress indices considered in this paper include: (14) The financial stress index provided by the Office of Financial Research (OFRFSI); (15) The financial stress index provided by St. Louis Fed. (STLFSI). All of these indicators are proved in the existing literatures to have significant impact on the price volatility of stock market, indicating that although not all of these indicators are directly related to the stock market, they all contain the important information that is significant enough to influence the stock market price volatility (Alqahtani et al., 2020b; Arouri et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021; Bekaert & Hoerova, 2014; Das et al., 2019; Dua & Tuteja, 2016; Gupta et al., 2014; He et al., 2021a; Liang et al., 2020a; Pi\u00f1eiro-Chousa et al., 2022; Smales, 2017; Wang et al., 2020a; Wen et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2018) . Economic policy uncertainty indicators other than EMV and IDEMV capture the level of macroeconomic uncertainty caused by different types of economic policies or major events (Baker et al., 2016; Caldara & Iacoviello, 2018; Husted et al., 2018) . In general, the release of economic policies or the occurrence of major events often lead to stock market price volatility by affecting real economic conditions (Al-Awadhi et al., 2020; Alqahtani et al., 2020b; Arouri et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021; Bontempi et al., 2021; He et al., 2021a; Hoque & Zaidi, 2019; Megaritis et al., 2021; Wen et al., 2022; , so exploring the predictive power of different economic policy uncertainty indicators is helpful for distinguishing the role of macroeconomic uncertainty caused by different types of economic policies or major events in driving stock market price volatility. Market sentiment is also closely related to stock market price volatility because it can reflect the investment intentions or expectations of market participants. It affects investors' subjective judgment of their future returns, which in turn affects their investment behavior and ultimately causes stock market price volatility (Bekaert & Hoerova, 2014; Liang et al., 2020a; Oliveira et al., 2017; Perez-Liston et al., 2014; Shapiro et al., 2020) . Financial markets are necessarily interconnected, so stock market price volatility is also subject to the stress of the whole financial market (Das et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2014; Singh, 2016; Sum, 2014) , this is also why we examined the predictive power of FSIs on stock market volatility.",

Meanwhile, some indicators, such as HCU and IDEMV, tend to have stronger impact on stock market volatility only because of the occurrence of certain events (e.g., COVID-19) (Bai et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020c) . These are also why the out-of-sample predictive power of some of the potential predictors considered in this paper, i.e. HCU, IDEMV and EURQ, on stock market volatility has not yet been discussed. 1 Besides, it also means that the predictive power of some of the potential predictors selected in this paper may not be robust. So, it is of certain implication for scholars and stock market participants to explore the role of some newly constructed forecasting methods in improving the predictive accuracy of stock market volatility by making full use of the predictive information of a large number of potential predictors. Considering that combination forecasting methods, dimensionality reduction methods and LASSO techniques are widely used in the studies about forecasting asset volatility with a large number of potential predictors, this paper also focus on comparing the role of these methods in improving the forecasting accuracy of stock market volatility. However, different from the existing literatures, we mainly compare the forecasting performance of these methods in the framework of MIDAS-RV model.",

Among them, the HAR-RV model is the most commonly used in high-frequency realized volatility forecasting (Ma et al., 2019; Santos & Ziegelmann, 2014; Tian et al., 2017) . However, different from most of these literatures, we mainly use the MIDAS-RV model and its several extensions to forecast stock market volatility. This paper is related to the work of , who forecasted the monthly stock market volatility with macroeconomic and financial variables, as well as technical indicators using the AR based combination forecasting methods, dimensionality reduction methods and LASSO techniques. In contrast, we explore the abilities of 9 economic policy uncertainty indicators, 4 market sentiment indicators and 2 financial stress indices to predict daily stock market realized volatility. Besides, we construct a MIDAS-LASSO model by combining the LASSO technique with the MIDAS-RV method, in reference to Marsilli (2014) , and compare its out-of-sample prediction performance with that of the MIDAS-RV-X model (the MIDAS-RV model extended by an additional predictor X), MIDAS-RV-PCA model (the MIDAS-RV model extended by PCA technology), MIDAS-RV-PLS model (the MIDAS-RV model extended by PLS technology) and some commonly used combination forecast methods (the mean, median, trimmed mean, DMSPE(1.0) and DMSPE(0.9), DMA and DMS). However, studies have found that a model with regime switching can be more efficient in forecasting asset volatility (Tian et al., 2016; Uddin et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016b ) than a model without regime switching, making us curious whether the MIDAS-LASSO model with regime switching can also improve the prediction accuracy for stock market volatility to a greater extent. Therefore, we further build a MIDAS-LASSO model with a Markov regime (MS-MIDAS-LASSO) and evaluate its prediction performance.",

First, compared with the widely used HAR-RV model, the MIDAS-RV model can better reflect heterogeneity because the estimation process of the MIDAS-RV model primarily utilizes a specific function to determine the weights of the multi-order lagged RV series, while the HAR-RV model directly calculates the equally weighted average of the 1-week lagged and 1-month lagged RV series (Ghysels et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2020; Santos & Ziegelmann, 2014) . Second, modelling asset volatility using the MIDAS-RV model and its extensions can better reflect the multi-order lagged effects of potential predictors on highfrequency volatility with fewer parameter estimates than the HAR-RV model, and is less prone to overfitting problems (Ghysels et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2020; Santos & Ziegelmann, 2014) . Thirdly, studies have proved that the MIDAS-RV model can obtain more valid prediction information from predictors and has better prediction performance than the widely used HAR-RV model (Ma et al., 2019; Santos & Ziegelmann, 2014) . Finally, as far as we know, there is no research that predicts stock market realized volatility by the MIDAS-LASSO model and its regime switching extension.",

First, compared to the financial stress indices and the market sentiment indicators (except for the VIX), the economic policy uncertainty indicators (especially the EMV) and the VIX are more noteworthy. Among these predictors, VIX has the best predictive ability, but its predictive power has weakened during the COVID-19 epidemic, making EMV the best predictor during this special period. The financial stress indices and the market sentiment indicators except for VIX mainly play a role in enhancing the accuracy of stock market volatility in periods of low volatility. Second, across all considered forecasting methods, MS-MIDAS-LASSO has the best out-of-sample forecasting performance, followed by the MIDAS-LASSO model. The forecasting accuracy of the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model even outperforms the traditional HAR-LASSO model and its regime switching extension. In addition, the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model still has the highest prediction accuracy during the low-volatility period when the prediction accuracy of the MIDAS-LASSO model is significantly reduced. Finally, the predictive performance of the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model remained the best, even during the special period of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

The main purpose of disaggregating the low-frequency predictors to high-frequency series is to facilitate the construction of the following information integration-based prediction technology and make all forecasting methods have the same underlying structure so that the predictions are comparable. 2 In this paper, a relatively large number of predictors are considered. However, studies have shown that in a data-rich environment, a forecasting model with only one predictor would ignore the valuable predictive information of other possible predictors, while a model with multiple predictors would cause the problem of identification and/or convergence (Asgharian et al., 2013; Li et al., 2020b) . As a well-known statistical process for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares regression analysis (PLS) technology can be used to collect the key information among multiple variables and thus are used in some of the existing studies to solve the above problems (Asgharian et al., 2013; Cepni et al., 2019; Poncela et al., 2011) . Therefore, to forecast with more valuable predictive information, we further construct a MIDAS-RV-PCA model and a MIDAS-RV-PLS model. These two models obtain the key information/common factors from all additional predictors by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares regression analysis (PLS), respectively. The MIDAS-RV-PCA model can be defined as below:",

The AAII used in this paper measures the difference between the percentages of individual investors who are bullish and bearish. AAII can reflect the expectations of individual investors in the US stock market and directly influence the investment behaviour of individual investors in the stock market. 5 Finally, since financial markets are interconnected and stock market price volatility can also be impacted by the stress of the whole financial market (Das et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2014; Singh, 2016; Sum, 2014) . As the result of global economic integration, the stock markets of individual countries are subject to the stress of both the financial market of that country and the global financial market (Das et al., 2019; Singh, 2016) . So, we further consider 2 financial stress indicators: (14) the financial stress index provided by the Office of Financial Research (OFRFSI); (15) the financial stress index provided by St. Louis Fed. (STLFSI). The OFRFSI is constructed from 33 global financial market variables, such as yield spreads, valuation measures and interest rates. The STLFSI is constructed from 18 weekly financial variables in the US: seven interest rates, six yield spreads, and five other indicators. 6 Our original data contain three different sampling frequencies, i.e., daily, weekly and monthly. The daily sampled data include the RV of the S&P 500, EPU, IDEMV, VIX, ISEESI, NSI and OFRFSI. The weekly sampled data include the AAII and STLFSI. The monthly sampled data include the GEPU, MPU, TPU, HCU, EMV, GPR, and EURQ. All the predictors with low frequencies are disaggregated to the daily frequency. The daily data cover the period from January 3, 2006, to August 28, 2020. 7 The results of the descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 .

The other prediction models cannot survive the MCS test under both the criteria of QLIKE and the MAE. However, under the MSE criterion, several individual models (the MIDAS-RV models extended by the MPU, EMV, IDEMV, VIX, NSI, OFRFSI and STLFSI), the MIDAS-LASSO model and several combination forecasts (MEAN, DMSPE (0.9), DMSPE (1.0), DMA and DMS) can also pass the MCS test with p-values smaller than 0.15 but larger than 0.1, implying their potential ability to improve the forecasting accuracy for stock market RV .

In terms of our considered predictors, the EMV and VIX have better out-of-sample forecasting ability than the other predictors, and the VIX performs better than the EMV. The evaluation results regarding the out-of-sample predictive performance during lowvolatility regimes are reported in Table 11 . We find that the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model still has the highest forecasting accuracy, but the prediction accuracy of the MIDAS-LASSO model is substantially reduced, and its R 2 oos does not exceed the R 2 oos values of other forecasting methods such as MIDAS-PCA and DMSPE (0.9). This further suggests that the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model performs better than the MIDAS-LASSO model in capturing regime switching with respect to stock market volatility. In terms of the predictors, the VIX is still the best predictor, but the forecasting ability of the EMV decreases substantially and can no longer improve the forecasting accuracy for stock market RV. However, different from the findings in Sect. 4, the forecasting performance of the MIDAS-VIX model can no longer exceed that of DMA and DMS. Finally, although our findings in Sect. 4 find that the three market sentiment indicators other than the VIX and the financial stress indicators have nearly no ability to improve the predictive accuracy for stock market RV, during lowvolatility regimes, we find that the ISEESI, NSI and OFRFSI have the ability to improve the forecasting accuracy.",

            "text": "Our out-of-sample forecasts cover the period after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 has had a great impact on the global economy and society; as a result, the US stock market has experienced turbulence. For example, the US stock market experienced four meltdowns in less than ten days from March 9 to March 19, 2020. The dramatic volatility of the US stock market during the COVID-19 epidemic poses a significant challenge to investors' volatility forecasting since some effective forecasting methods may no longer be valid during this period. Therefore, it is also particularly important to examine the forecasting performance of the tested forecasting methods in this paper during the COVID-19 epidemic. Table 12 shows the evaluation results regarding the out-of-sample prediction performance of all models during the COVID-19 epidemic. 9 We find that the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model can still pass the MCS test with a p-value equal to 1 under all three loss functions and can also significantly increase the forecasting accuracy with the highest R 2 oos , indicating that the superior forecasting performance of this model has not changed with the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. This time, the MIDAS-LASSO model still has a smaller R 2 oos than that of MS-MIDAS-LASSO but larger than those of the other models, indicating that the prediction performance of this model is also unaffected by the COVID-19 epidemic. However, the predictive powers of the EMV and VIX have changed during this period. This time, the ability of the VIX to improve out-of-sample prediction accuracy diminishes, and the EMV replaces it as the best predictor. In fact, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused great uncertainty in the global economy, trade, imports and exports as well as market sentiment, etc. The stock market price volatility during this period are also the result of multiple uncertainties. However, the VIX can only capture the changes of the stock market sentiment so its information content is not sufficient enough to predict stock market volatility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, since EMV quantifies multiple uncertainty Clark and West (2007) 's test method *, ** and ***Denote rejections of the null hypothesis at the 10%, 5% and 1% significance levels, respectively.",

            "text": "The empirical results first show that the economic policy uncertainty indicators (especially the EMV) and the VIX are more likely to produce better forecasting accuracy than the three market sentiment indicators and two financial stress indices. Among these predictors, the VIX has the strongest predictive power, followed by the EMV. Second, the combination forecasts and MIDAS-LASSO models usually have statistically significant relative forecasting performance. Across all forecasting models of interest, the MIDAS-LASSO model with regime switching has the best forecasting performance, followed by the MIDAS-LASSO model, indicating that LASSO technology can capture more valuable information from a large set of predictors than other information integration methods. The forecasting accuracy of MIDAS-LASSO with regime switching is also superior to that of the traditional HAR-LASSO method and its regime switching extension. When distinguishing between high-and low-volatility regimes, we find that the VIX is the best predictor under both scenarios. In addition, the economic policy uncertainty indicators other than GEPU either help predict high stock market volatility or low stock market volatility, but the market sentiment indices other than the VIX and the financial stress index (OFRFSI) exhibit statistically significant relative predictive performance only during low-volatility regimes. Across all considered forecasting methods, the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model still exhibits the best predictive performance during both high-and low-volatility regimes, but the MIDAS-LASSO model can outperform other forecasting methods except for MS-MIDAS-LASSO only during high-volatility regimes. We finally consider the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the predictive power of the VIX diminished, and it was no longer the best out-of-sample predictor, while the predictive power of the EMV increased, making it the best predictor during this special period. However, the MIDAS-LASSO model with regime switching still exhibited the best forecasting performance across all considered forecasting models during the COVID-19 epidemic. This paper has important practical implications. Firstly, the MIDAS-RV extension models (especially the MS-MIDAS-LASSO model) constructed in this paper are important extensions to existing volatility forecasting research methods and helps researchers and market participants to make full use of key information from multiple potential predictors to generate more accurate forecasts of asset volatility. Secondly, this paper explores the predictive validity of multiple indicators for stock market price volatility, which can help stock market investors to better utilize available information to predict possible stock market volatility and thus adjust their portfolios in time to reduce losses. Meanwhile, this paper is also helpful for derivatives market participants to make better use of the available information to price stock market derivatives more accurately and thus achieve higher returns. Finally, the empirical findings can also help the policy makers to make better use of the available information to formulate strategies timely to prevent and control possible risks in the stock market and make certain contributions to the stable and healthy development of the national economy.",
