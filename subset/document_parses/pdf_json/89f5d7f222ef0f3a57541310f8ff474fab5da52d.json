In order to mitigate the effects of air pollution, we must first understand it, find its patterns and correlations, and predict it in advance. Air pollution prediction requires highly complex predictive models to solve this spatiotemporal problem. We use advanced deep learning models including the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) to learn patterns of particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) over spatial and temporal correlations. We model meteorological features with a time-series set of multidimensional weighted directed graphs and interpolate dense meteorological graphs using the GCN architecture. We also use remote-sensing satellite imagery of various atmospheric pollutant matters. We utilize government maintained ground-based PM2.5 sensor data along with remote sensing satellite imagery using a ConvLSTM to predict PM2.5 over the greater Los Angeles county area roughly 10 days in the future using 10 days of data from the past in 46-h increments. Our error results on the PM2.5 predictions over time and along each sensor location show significant improvement over existing research in the field utilizing spatiotemporal deep predictive algorithms.",

Another method of inducing convolution is to perform convolution prior to the LSTM model. By modularizing the convolution operation and training a CNN to transform video-like inputs to 1-dimensional time-parameterized output vectors and using the output in a traditional FC-LSTM, we can achieve a similar level of learning and prediction based on spatial and temporal correlations.

We find that including meteorological features are essential to an accurate prediction of ambient air pollution. Air pollutants are closely correlated to meteorological data. Liu et al. (2020) found that of the 896 governmentmonitored air pollution sensors in China, 675 groundbased sensors reported an increase in carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and PM2.5 when there was a greater than 10% increase in wind speed at the same location. In addition to including meteorological data, we find that including a mixture of both remote-sensing satellite imagery of air pollution and ground-based sensor air pollution data is necessary for a robust and multifaceted approach to spatiotemporal air pollution prediction. Remote-sensing satellite imagery provides information on atmospheric air pollution, while ground-based sensors provide finer-grained information on air pollution at sea level or within cities. Since the level of air pollution may vary greatly with respect to altitude, we utilize both remote-sensing satellite imagery and groundbased sensor data as input to our model in order to fully understand and predict air pollution. Finally, we find that data from other air pollutants prove to be beneficial when predicting for a particular pollutant-in our case PM2.5. In our dataset, we utilize remote-sensing satellite imagery of nitrogen dioxide as an input feature when predicting for PM2.5. Nitrogen dioxide is an adverse air pollutant that is highly correlated to PM2.5 since a large portion of ambient PM2.5 is generated through the chemical reactions of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (Brook 2008) .",

To do so, we first construct a weighted directed graph representation with the meteorological data described in \"Implementation.\" The goal of the GCN architecture is to interpolate and predict a denser meteorological graph than the input graph. The task of interpolation is inherently an effective task to obtain highlevel learned feature embeddings. By utilizing a GCN for spatial interpolation, we can train a model to predict meteorological trends in areas not provided by the input graph; and thus, we can later use these learned correlations as input to construct a video-like sequence of spatially continuous predicted meteorological features over time in a geographical area. For our model, we adapted previous work by Wu et al. (2020) on spatiotemporal kriging with Graph Convolutional Networks to interpolate our nodes and edges of the meteorological graph. We train the GCN for this interpolation task by systematically \"hiding\" a small percentage of node and edge attributes. The model then learns to predict for the hidden meteorological feature values at these nodes and edges based on the disparity between the predicted hidden meteorological features for a time period against the ground truth meteorological features. Once the training is complete, the GCN is capable of interpolating a sparse meteorological graph into a dense graph containing various meteorological features. The GCN will create one such dense meteorological graph for each sample parameterized by time.",

The Environmental Mesonet database collects and records hourly Meteorological Aerodrome (METAR) Reports from Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) located near various airports and municipal airstrips within the continental United States. ASOS is primarily used by airlines and air traffic controllers to monitor meteorological features near and around airport runways. The METAR data provides a full hourly report of 17 groundlevel meteorological features including wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, dew point, precipitation, Air Quality Index (AQI), air pressure, air temperature, etc. The complete list of meteorological features collected from each site is presented in Table 1 . Within our geographic boundaries, there are 24 ASOS sensors providing full METAR reports. In order to use these meteorological features in combination with the model and create a meteorological graph structure, we needed to normalize the various units of these meteorological features. We did this by calculating each data point's percentile value. The percentile value is calculated daily and essentially is the current hour's raw value divided by the metric's maximum daily value. In this way, we normalize the units so that we retain the important meteorological information, but we do not need the domain-specific units it is associated with. Figure 2 describes the geographical area of interest and site locations for the raw meteorological features we collected. Our ground-based air pollution dataset was collected from the Southern California Air Resources Board AQMIS2 API. We collect ground-based sensor data on PM2.5 which is our prediction target. For the geographic range we have defined, there are seven PM2.5 sensors collecting hourly data in the following locations: Lancaster, Santa Clarita, Reseda, Glendora, Los Angeles -Main St, Long Beach, and Long Beach -Rt 710. These seven PM2.5 sensors are the only government-maintained PM2.5 sensors in the geographical bounds; however, there are various low-cost individually maintained sensors we chose not to use for evaluation of our model as we are unable to estimate the uncertainty error of such sensors.",

The Terra and Aqua satellites orbit the Earth every 1-2 days and provide imagery over 36 spectral bands utilizing the MODIS imaging instrument. The MAIAC algorithm is a highly advanced preprocessing algorithm that converts raw MODIS imagery to data analytics-ready images by retrieving atmospheric aerosol and air pollutant data from MODIS images, normalizing pixel values, and removing cloud cover masks. For our model, we use the MAIAC MODIS/Terra+Aqua Daily AOD dataset. AOD or Aerosol Optical Depth is a measure of the direct amount of sunlight being blocked by atmospheric aerosols and air pollutants. AOD is perhaps the most comprehensive measure of ambient air pollution and years of research has shown a strong correlation between AOD readings and PM2.5 concentrations in both atmospheric and groundlevel settings (Li et al. 2015; Xiao et al. 2017 ). The MAIAC MODIS AOD dataset we utilize as input to our model records the blue-band Aerosol Optical Depth at a central wavelength of 0.47 \u03bcm. The raw MAIAC MODIS AOD dataset provides a spatial resolution of 1-km/pixel for an area of 1200km \u00d7 1200km.

Note that the figure provides a visualization of the raw grid-like data of the MAIAC AOD imagery; and thus, the color values of the visualization correspond to AOD values, not raw RGB imagery. The brighter colored pixels in the visualization correspond to higher AOD values.

Our model utilizes data imaging NO 2 on one such imaging band with a central wavelength of 945.1 nm. Due to the orbital swath of the Sentinel-2 satellite, the images are collected with a temporal frequency of 46 h. Since this is the largest temporal frequency of all our data sources, we normalized all other data sources and set the temporal frequency of our total dataset to 46 h. The nitrogen dioxide in the satellite imagery is shown as the light blue cloudlike structures. It is important to note that the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery product of NO 2 that we use layers the NO 2 structures at the top of the image such that the background imagery of the terrain and ocean will not interfere with the imagery of the NO 2 structures.

We define static features as scalar measurements of individual meteorological features at a sensor location. For example, the node attributes for our meteorological graph include relative humidity, AQI, temperature, air pressure, dew point, heat index, etc. Edge attributes consist of nonstatic meteorological features that rely on or connect multiple sensors. For example, the edge attributes consist of the physical distance in miles from meteorological sensor locations, the wind speed, and the wind direction. For each time step, we can create a multidimensional weighted directed graph containing the spatial and distancebased information of all meteorological sensors and their recorded features. We then repeat this process to create these multidimensional weighted directed graphs for each time step of 46 h in the dataset. Figure 5 describes the weighted directed meteorological graph construction process. Algorithm 1 describes a step-by-step procedure of creating these weighted directed meteorological graphs for a single time step. We use the Keras ConvLSTM layer to implement our model.

We have now constructed a set of 3D input \"images.\" However, to construct a 5D tensor, we must bundle all input frames over time into many samples. We bundle five consecutive frames into a single sample, where each frame represents information at a time step of 46 h. Each bundle of frames then represents roughly 10 days or 230 h of remote-sensing satellite imagery and ground-based sensor data. Note that the input data bundles are staggered such that for example the first sample consists of data from frames 1-5, the second sample consists of data from frames 2-6, and so on. In this way, we continue to preserve a continuous flow of temporal correlations among samples. By constructing this 5D tensor, we can transform the 880 3D input \"images\" into a 5D tensor of shape (880, 5, 40, 40, 6) .

In designing our model, we include information on spatial and temporal correlations as well as meteorological features and related air pollutant matter data to understand, learn, and predict spatiotemporal PM2.5 air pollution. We utilized various state-of-the-art predictive models including the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). We created a time parameterized set of multidimensional weighted directed graphs to represent 17 meteorological features in 24 sensor locations within the greater Los Angeles county area. We then utilized the GCN architecture to perform convolution on neighborhoods of nodes in order to interpolate dense meteorological graphs using spatiotemporal kriging. We also used unsupervised graph representation learning algorithms to create high-level embedding \"images\" of the dense meteorological graphs and used these high-level embeddings as input to the ConvLSTM model. In addition to the outputs from the GCN, we also supplied government-monitored ground-based PM2.5 sensor data in grid form, NASA MODIS MAIAC AOD remote-sensing satellite imagery, and ESA Sentinel-2 nitrogen dioxide remote-sensing satellite imagery as input to the ConvLSTM. We then bundled the input data into samples consisting of five consecutive frames of data or roughly 10 days of data. We calculate the RMSE and NRMSE error values of the predicted PM2.5 values over the first 5 frames as well as the averaged RMSE and NRMSE error values of the predicted sample for each sensor location. We find that our results show significant improvement upon current research in the field utilizing spatiotemporal deep predictive algorithms.",
