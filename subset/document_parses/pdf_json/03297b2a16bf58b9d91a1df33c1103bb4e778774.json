            "text": "Nosocomially acquired coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reflects a failure in healthcare systems to prevent transmission and acquisition. Hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs) are fuelling the global pandemic and are associated with excess morbidity and mortality in both patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). Hospitals are facing challenges in preventing crosstransmission, particularly in settings with extensive community transmission prior to implementation of stringent social distancing measures [1] . Factors such as continuation of clinical services, surge in intensive care, uncertainty in transmission dynamics, staff-to-staff transmission, and shortages and inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) increased the difficulty in managing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in healthcare facilities. Understanding nosocomial acquisition, outbreaks, and transmission chains in real time are fundamental to ensuring infection-prevention measures are effective in controlling SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare. Tackling HOCI is vital to ensure patient safety, maintain public confidence and protect the health and wellbeing of healthcare professionals [2] .",

            "text": "Surveillance systems reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection [3] . National surveillance systems of HOCI have been developed in the UK to support understanding national trends, emerging issues and geographical areas of concern [4, 5] . However, they are limited by lack of resolution to clarify the finer details of transmission and acquisition events in a real-time manner to support infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions on the ground. Accurate, real-time recognition of HOCIs has the potential to improve patient outcomes, optimize IPC measures, and impact on the trajectory of the pandemic. In addition, surveillance will play a key part in healthcare recovery. To accomplish this, there is a need for standardized definitions to categorize HOCI cases, as well as surveillance systems which can be adopted globally and integrated with existing routine surveillance activities for other healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). HCAIs are frequently defined as development of disease more than 48 h after admission. However, such a definition is not suitable for COVID-19 considering that the incubation period between infection of SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms onset is up to 14 days with a median of 5 days [6] . At present, multiple definitions of COVID-19 infections within healthcare have been developed pragmatically, along with ad hoc approaches to deploy systems for monitoring of HOCI. To inform and enable the development of a standardized yet translatable approach, we aimed to review the current literature in surveillance systems that are in place to identify and monitor HOCI.",

            "text": "The literature search yielded a total of 292 non-duplicate citations. A flow chart of assessed studies is presented in Figure 1 . We identified 208 citations from Medline and EMBASE, eight citations from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and 76 citations from Medrxiv. 273 citations were excluded at the abstract screening stage; most were excluded because the study did not evaluate HOCI surveillance (N \u00bc 139). Whilst one publication provided a protocol of an international surveillance system, at the time of review no data were available and hence it was not included [18] . Of the 19 citations that were reviewed at the full-text screening stage (full-texts available for all), nine were included in this review [2,19e26] ; the remaining 10 were excluded as they did not address HOCI surveillance. Of the nine studies included in this review, four were from the UK [2, 23, 25, 26] , two were from the USA [22, 24] , and one each were from Hong Kong [20] , Korea [21] and Taiwan [19] . All of the studies were from the so-called 'first wave' of the pandemic. Surveillance was retrospective in four studies [22,24e26] . The quality of the included studies was appraised using assessment tools for interventional, observational, and case study designs. The quality grading of individual studies is included in the Supplementary data. Overall, the quality of studies was limited by their observational nature with short follow-up periods, and lack of prespecified protocols. Two observational studies [21, 22] were deemed to have strong quality considering the aims of reporting incidence of COVID-19 infections. Two prospective surveillance studies [2, 23] were deemed to have moderate quality when the comparison of efficacy of case detection was not compared against conventional approaches. One interventional study [20] was deemed to be of low quality (described escalating infection control responses) due to the absence of definition of outcome(s) of interest and providing pre-/postintervention comparison. The quality of two cohort studies [24, 25] was limited due to the lack of a comparable non-COVID cohort.",

One study [2] involved genomic surveillance to investigate HOCI, incorporating large-scale sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from patients and HCWs. Of the four studies with automated surveillance, three [19, 20, 23] reported real-time analysis of incidence data. One study [2] performed epidemiological and cluster analysis, and another [23] performed network analysis. The recipients of the reports were hospital management, and IPC professionals in two studies [2, 23] with front-line clinicians being additional recipients in one of these [2] .",

At the time when the review was conducted, none of the identified HOCI surveillance systems matched the surveillance definition developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in that the results of the surveillance were not provided by a central network [34] . The UK later introduced a centralized system, through a research consortium, to investigate HOCIs across providers [5] .",

Whole genome sequencing data has been used to demonstrated cross-transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between patients and HCWs [35, 36] . Therefore, it is important to consider assessing HCW infection that is epidemiologically associated with patients who develop HOCIs. In turn this will rely on robust systems, especially genomics-based surveillance in place for testing symptomatic and asymptomatic staff and collaborating with occupational health will be essential. As COVID-19 vaccination programmes expand globally, these surveillance systems may provide a robust method to assess the impact of HCW vaccination. In turn, vaccine uptake may form part of these surveillance systems.",

Therefore, some characteristics of surveillance systems may not have been adequately captured by this systematic review of published literature.

Second, our search strategy was not designed to focus on outbreak reports, which are likely to have been detected by some form of surveillance system. However, we believe that it is justified to exclude these reports as, presumably, their focus would be more on outbreak management strategies than on the surveillance system per se.",
