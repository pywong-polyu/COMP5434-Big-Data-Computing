The California Department of Motor Vehicles (CA DMV) has launched the Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program, which collects and releases reports related to Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement (AVD) from autonomous driving. Understanding the causes of AVD is critical to improving the safety and stability of the AV system and provide guidance for AV testing and deployment. In this work, a scalable end-to-end pipeline is constructed to collect, process, model, and analyze the disengagement reports released from 2014 to 2020 using natural language processing deep transfer learning. The analysis of disengagement data using taxonomy, visualization and statistical tests revealed the trends of AV testing, categorized cause frequency, and significant relationships between causes and effects of AVD. We found that (1) manufacturers tested AVs intensively during the Spring and/or Winter, (2) test drivers initiated more than 80% of the disengagement while more than 75% of the disengagement were led by errors in perception, localization & mapping, planning and control of the AV system itself, and (3) there was a significant relationship between the initiator of AVD and the cause category. This study serves as a successful practice of deep transfer learning using pre-trained models and generates a consolidated disengagement database allowing further investigation for other researchers.",

According to the definition from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) [2] , there are six levels of diving automation from Level 0 (No Driving Automation) to Level 5 (Full Driving Automation). While manufacturers are making the effort to deliver Level 5 AVs in the future, most AVs driving or testing on public roads nowadays are SAE Level 2 (partial automation), Level 3 (conditional automation), and Level 4 (high automation in geofenced areas) vehicles. Particularly, SAE Level 3 automation does not require the human driver to monitor the driving environment [2] , which allows the driver to shift attentional resources to non-drivingrelated tasks [3] . Even though the driver is required to be ready to take over control whenever requested, s/he may stay out of the control loop for a prolonged period, thus not monitoring the driving situation [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] . The transition of control from the AV to the human driver, also known as the Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement (AVD), plays a vital role in the Level 3 AV testing and deployment. Understanding the cause-and-effect relationships of the AVD not only helps to evaluate the safety and performance of the current AV systems, but also provides guidelines on redesign of the AV systems for improvement and the future regulations for AVs.",

            "text": "Generally speaking, investigations into AVD can be divided into two categories, 1) experimental studies in takeover transitions in driving simulators and 2) analysis of naturalistic studies. In the first category, many researchers examined the influences of critical factors on takeover performance, such as takeover lead time (e.g., [9] ), non-driving related tasks (e.g., [10] , [11] ), traffic densities (e.g., [9] , [12] ), emotions [6] , and drivers' characteristics (e.g., [10] , [13] ). This type of studies linked drivers' behavior to well-controlled takeover transitions and examined how critical human factors influenced takeover performance. For example, Du et al. [6] found that positive emotions (valence) led to better takeover quality, while arousal did not influence takeover time. However, due to the gap between driving simulation and naturalistic driving, their findings may only be transferred to real world in a specific scope with limitations. For example, it was found that participants' perceived risk in driving simulator was lower compared to that in naturalistic driving [14] .",

The CA DMV disengagement dataset consisted of specific disengagement reports in naturalistic driving submitted by testing companies from 2014 to 2020, covering important data fields, such as location, initiator, description of disengagement, which was perfect for analyzing the cause-and-effect relationships of AVD. For example, Boggs et al. [16] explored five W questions (i.e., who, what, when, where, and why) of AVD using CA DMV disengagement reports from September 2014 to November 2018. They found that 1) the test operators were more likely to initiate the disengagement on streets and roads than on freeways and interstates, 2) the major causes to system-initiated disengagement were software, hardware, and planning issues, and 3) system-initiated disengagement marginally increased compared to operator-initiated disengagement despite the advancement in AV technologies between 2014 and 2018. However, in order to conduct such studies, laborious manual processing of the reports is needed.",

For example, Du et al. [9] examined the effects of three factors on takeover performance, including drivers' cognitive workload, takeover time budget, and traffic density. They found that takeover performance was worse when the participants had a high level of cognitive workload, the time budget was small, and the oncoming traffic density was heavy. Wandtner et al. [11] investigated the effects of non-driving related tasks on takeover performance and found that visual-manual tasks significantly worsened takeover performance compared to auditory-vocal tasks. Clark and Feng [13] found that younger (age 18-35, n = 17) and older drivers (age 62-81, n = 18) showed different behaviors in simulated automated driving, such as different preferences for non-driving related tasks, different takeover reaction time, and significant impacts on driving performance. Gold et al. [4] designed takeover experiments, identified related variables, and developed regression models to evaluate takeover performance. Their study revealed the effects of key factors, such as time budget, traffic density, and repetition, on takeover performances. Markkula et al. [22] created simulation-ready human behavior models to reproduce qualitative patterns of important scenarios like \"an AV handing over control to a human driver in a critical rear-end situation\".

And the findings may be transferred to open roads to help improve the transition process of control from the AV system to the human driver. Even though Eriksson et al. [23] have found strong positive correlation between the driving simulation and on-road conditions for control transitions in terms of workload, perceived usefulness and satisfaction, on-road validation is still necessary for those results discovered through driving simulation. Not only because the AV system used in driving simulation cannot reproduce the driving experience provided by various AV systems developed by different manufacturers, but also only a small number of individual factors were considered in the models developed on the experimental data from simulators [4] , [23] . Furthermore, the number of participants for driving simulation tasks was mostly less than 100 and the number of records of experimental data was mostly less than 1000 [4] , [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] , [7] . The number of the participants and the amount of the data may limit the generalizability and scalability of those studies.",

            "text": "With the availability of the CA DMV dataset, many researchers focused on the exploration of the disengagement reports using traditional statistical and machine learning models. For example, Favar\u00f2 et al. [15] analyzed the contributory factors, disengagement frequencies of AVD with taxonomy and statistical visualization of disengagement overview and trends. Boggs et al. [16] used logistic regression to identify and quantify who, what/why, where, and when (5 Ws) of AVD, and they found that 1) it was more likely to have human operator-initiated disengagement than system-initiated, 2) the most frequent causes of disengagement of system-initiated were planning and software/hardware discrepancies, 3) disengagement was more likely to happen on local roads than on expressways, and 4) regardless of system improvement, the likelihood of system-initiated disengagement increased marginally compared to human operator-initiated. Wang et al. [17] used multiple statistical modeling approaches and classification trees to quantitatively investigate the underlying causes of AVD, and found that lacking a certain number of sensors significantly induced AVD. However, the researchers in these studies had to manually process the reports in various formats, which was time-consuming and laborious. Thus, these studies lacked the scalability to handle large-scale data and cannot be applied on new incoming disengagement reports to benefit future analysis. On the other hand, other researchers applied natural language processing techniques to process the text data automatically. For example, Alambeigi et al. [28] used probabilistic topic modeling to identify themes from the CA DMV crash reports. Their findings emphasized the safety concerns with transitions of AV system to human control. However, the number of crash reports was much smaller (167 reports in [28] ), compared to the disengagement reports. Banerjee et al. [29] applied the data pipeline method to process and analyze data from the system's perspective with over a million miles of cumulative autonomous miles, 5,328 disengagement reports, and 42 crash reports from 2014 and 2017. They found that 1) AVs were 15 -4000 times worse than human drivers in terms of accidents per cumulative mile driven, 2) perception, decision, and control discrepancies resulting from the AVs' machine-learning-based system were the primary causes of AVD, and 3) human operators of AVs had to stay as alert as drivers of manual vehicles. Such a method provide promises to automatically process the data systematically. However, the NLP model was based on keywords matching and voting, which could end up with many unknown instances when assigning the causes to a specific predefined category.",

At Stage 2, it used Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract information from the PDF format reports and exported to CSV files. Then those CSV files were filtered, cleaned, parsed, and finally labeled by human workers. At Stage 3, we proposed an NLP deep learning model based on ELECTRA (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately) [30] using transfer learning.

For the latest CVS format, it combined all the records together and released two final CSV files -Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement Reports and Autonomous Mileage Reports, which were easy to process and distribute to the public. For each record, the final Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement Reports contained 9 fields. In order to resolve these differences across different formats, we attempted to collect all the information in the previous years (2014 -2018) based on the latest format (2018 -2020). An OCR pipeline based on OpenCV [35] , Tesseract [36] and PyImageSearch [37] was built to extract texts from the PDF files, compile them, and export them to CSV files. As the PDF files submitted by various manufacturers were scanned, they were subject to random scaling, rotation, and skew. To fix this problem, a standard template was used as the reference to adjust other scanned disengagement reports to generate the de-skewed versions of images. The bounding boxes were then identified and the text within them were extracted. Next, raw texts were cleaned, filtered, and finally exported as CSV files. Finally, we collected the disengagement reports in the last 7 years (2014 -2020) and collected and inspected, manufacturer, date, initiator, location and description were selected as the fields for the consolidated disengagement database for further analysis.

Second, in order to gain taskspecific knowledge for extracting cause-and-effect relationships, ELECTRA was fine-tuned on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 [19] ).The SemEval-2010 Task 8 is a benchmark for multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals. In this dataset, we used the samples with annotated cause-andeffect relationships to fine-tune the ELECTRA model. Third, ELECTRA was post-trained on our consolidated disengagement dataset created in Stage 2 of the data pipeline to further improve the performance of the models. In order to compare with other popular NLP deep learning models, BERT [31] , DistilBERT [32] , and XLNet [33] were also included. These models were evaluated based on weighted F-1 scores and the cost of computational resources to select the best model. Among them, weighted F-1 scores calculated the average F-1 scores among labels weighted by their support to handle label imbalance existed in the training data and the cost of computational resources was measured by the time needed to train the models with the same configurations of the computer.",

Furthermore, the failure of different components -perception, planning, control [42] in the AV system also led to disengagement. Such failures could be caused by the environment and the system itself. Thus, a taxonomy (Fig. 4) covering both human driver trust and AV system failures, and environmental factors was generated.

Table  VIII and Table IX were the contingency tables for initiators between the categories and the subcategories. Table VIII shows that for AVD initiated by AV systems and test drivers, most causes came from the AV systems themselves. Table IX provided a more detailed insight suggesting that for AVD initiated by the AV systems, the planning stage was the most unreliable stage in the AV systems, while for AVD initiated by the test operators, the majority were caused by either the control stage of the AV systems or the discomfort felt by the test operators. In addition, Chi-Square tests for independence were conducted on the two contingency tables. There was a significant relationship between the initiators of AVD and the main categories, \u03c7 2 (2, 9511) = 571.53, p < 0.001. And the frequency of the causes in the subcategories differed significantly by the initiators as well, \u03c7 2 (8, 9511) = 1726.13, p < 0.001. According to the disengagement reports released by CA DMV, the initiator of disengagement was either the AV System when it failed to execute due to technical issues and thus requested the test operator to take over control, or the test operator when he/she felt uncomfortable with or did not trust the AV system and thus took over control proactively.",

From the figure, it was easy to find that Cruise started AV testing very early but paused at the end of 2018, while other manufacturers continued to test AVs until early 2020 when COVID-19 happened. After COVID-19 was gradually under control, they resumed the AV testing but had not reached to their full capacity yet by the end of 2020. Some patterns can also be identified from the figure.

When we used it for end-to-end token classification, the weighted F-1 score was decreased due to the significant increase in difficulty and complexity of token classification. Nevertheless, the ELECTRA-based model also performed best among the selected NLP deep learning models. Further research should be conducted to further improve the performance of the model. For example, the disengagement scenarios were described in specific domain language and the fine-tuning sample from the SemEval-2010 Task 8 was relatively small. Thus, NLP deep learning models can be further pre-trained in domain language and fine-tuned with a larger sample size of causeand-effect data.

More workers are needed to make the ground truth labels more reliable to improve the performance of the NLP pipeline.",

            "text": "The methods used in this study also have implications for future AVD analysis. As Bimbraw et al. [43] concluded \"Most cars are expected to be fully autonomous by 2035\", before that actually happens, AV testing still requires the presence of human operators which will generate a large amount of disengagement reports. However, the majority of previous studies heavily relied on manual work and their findings cannot be applied to incoming disengagement reports seamlessly. The weighted F-1 score of this study suggested that with transfer learning, pre-trained models with millions of parameters can be fine-tuned and post-trained to learn the domain knowledge of AVD and the task knowledge of specific analytical tasks, thus achieving satisfying performance close to human workers with much less cost and time. Furthermore, because of the scale of the future disengagement reports, the end-to-end pipeline approach used in this study is both efficient and necessary for the large-scale analysis of AVD that other researchers may be interested in.",

Therefore, additional researches on human trust towards AV and human comfort levels are important to further investigate and explain the manual takeover, which will be a solid step to solve unnecessary disengagement and lay the foundation for the future full automation. The results of various causes related to the AV system also suggest that discrepancies happened in perception, localization & mapping, planning and control were the primary causes that led to the failures of executing certain tasks by the AV system. Our NLP pipeline not only can summarize the cause-and-effect relationships in the taxonomy as shown in Table VIII, Table IX , and Fig. 5 , but also it can identify the specific cause-and-effect pairs that give the specific causes of the disengagement. The majority of prior studies focusing on the exploration of disengagement causes using taxonomy had successfully concluded the categories [15] , but they did not identify the specific causes, such as \"a wrong speed control command\" or \"software module generated a wrong path and froze\" that were valuable to manufacturers in terms of improving the AV system design and testing.",

The best model used in the pipeline was the product of the best practice of transfer learning followed by posttraining. A taxonomy covering both human operator trust, AV system safety, and environmental factors was introduced to better understand the causes. Other examples of the results produced from this pipeline were also presented, including AVD counts over the years, word cloud for specific cause categories, statistical analysis between two different types of disengagement initiators. Our model is also able to analyze future incoming AVD in a seamless way to update the current results, which show the potential of our proposed pipeline.",
