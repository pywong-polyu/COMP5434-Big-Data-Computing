Proning was first described as a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the medical literature over 40 years ago. The procedure was initially used as a last resort when all other treatments failed, but recent findings suggest the use of prone positioning should be included as a part of the early management of severe ARDS (Koulouras et al., 2016; Mitchell & Seckel, 2018) .",

            "text": "ARDS was first recognized during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and is characterized by poor gas exchange as a result of alveolar damage and excess fluid in the lungs that prevents oxygen from reaching vital organs. ARDS is a disease state that can result from pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, sepsis, and COVID-19. Nearly 200,000 patients are diagnosed with ARDS in the United States annually. ARDS is responsible for 10% of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions worldwide and occurs in 23% of patients who are mechanically ventilated. The hospital mortality rate for patients with ARDS is 46% and the ICU mortality rate is 38% (Mitchell & Seckel, 2018) . The characteristics of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 are similar to that of ARDS in patients with other underlying causes although some physiological differences have been observed and details are still emerging (Gattinoni et al., 2020) . In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 42% developed ARDS, and those patients had a mortality rate of 52% (Wu et al., 2020) . Vol. 62, No. 7, November 2020 , pp. 1069 -1076 Prone positioning has demonstrated effectiveness for treating ARDS: the 28-day mortality was 16% of for ARDS patients receiving prone positioning compared to 33% in a supine control group (Gu\u00e9rin et al., 2013) . The Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Thoracic Society, and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine all recommend the use of prone positioning for 12-16 hr each day for patients with ARDS (Alhazzani et al., 2020; American Thoracic Society, 2020; Mitchell & Seckel, 2018) . Placing a patient in prone position allows gravity to aid in mobilizing secretions from the posterior aspect of the lung field. Alveolar recruitment occurs as a result of drainage of secretions, allowing improved ventilator performance and blood oxygenation (Koulouras et al., 2016) . Proning benefits patients with COVID-19 who have developed ARDS in largely the same manner as for other ARDS patients. Proning for COVID-19 is being widely adopted and recommended for patients who have developed ARDS, and is even being prescribed by some clinicians for patients who are not ventilated (Bamford et al., 2020; US National Library of Medicine, 2020) .",

            "text": "The manual proning methods and lift-assisted methods with a repositioning sheet require healthcare workers to catch and lower patients as they are rolling to prone. This manual lowering increases the risk of extubation or line removal. The RotoProne and the lift-assisted method with straps both allow mechanical lowering, providing more control for managing the endotracheal tube and lines. Pressure injury is a risk for all patients in prone position, but the RotoProne may provide additional challenges to pressure injury prevention because patients on the bed are not as easily accessible for repositioning as compared to a standard hospital bed. The RotoProne alarms after 3 hr and 15 min to prompt healthcare workers to bring the patient back to supine (ArjoHuntleigh, 2019). This may be undesirable for clinicians attempting to follow recommendations that patients remain prone for 12-20 hr, while being repositioned as frequently as every 2 hr (Gu\u00e9rin et al., 2018; McKenna & Meehan, 2018) .",

Manual techniques of repositioning patients all require five to seven healthcare workers present. A minimum of two healthcare workers are needed on each side of the bed to rotate the patient and more may be needed for wider, heavier, or more medically complex patients. An additional worker, usually a respiratory therapist, is needed at the head of the bed to hold the head of the patient and manage the airway. The lift-assisted techniques with repositioning sheets do not substantially reduce the number of healthcare workers needed because of the substantial pushing and lifting forces required to physically rotate and lower the patient to prone. The lift-assisted technique using straps and the RotoProne require fewer healthcare workers because they eliminate the manual lowering activity as well as all other manual elements of proning.",

The patient must be decelerated against gravity out of concern for the endotracheal tube, lines, and skin tears. Mannion et al.

This lowering may even require lifting and sliding to properly place the patient and positioning devices. Furthermore, the element of lowering the patient requires substantial trunk flexion as healthcare workers stoop to lower the patient and the worker closest to the patient center of mass is likely to take much more load than adjacent workers. Using lift straps or the RotoProne to control the patient rotation eliminates the manual forces and provides mechanical control when lowering the patient.",
