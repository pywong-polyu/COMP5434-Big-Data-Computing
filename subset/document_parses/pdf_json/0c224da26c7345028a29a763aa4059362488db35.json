It outlines three main patterns of troponin elevation-acute MI, acute myocardial injury and chronic myocardial injury [2] . Acute MI is defined as myocardial injury with clinical evidence of myocardial ischaemia and can be subdivided into five types: type 1 (atherosclerotic plaque rupture), type 2 (supply-demand mismatch), type 3 (cardiac death prior to availability of troponin results), type 4 (percutaneous coronary intervention related), and type 5 (cardiac surgery related) [2] . In contrast, myocardial injury is defined as an elevated troponin without evidence of myocardial ischaemia, and is subdivided into acute and chronic injury depending on the presence or absence of an observed rise and/or fall in troponin levels, respectively [2] .",

There is also evolving evidence to suggest that each of these different patterns of troponin elevation has distinct clinical consequences [12, 13] . For example, patients with acute myocardial injury and type 2 MI appear to have worse short-term [14] and long-term [12, 13] mortality compared with patients with type 1 MI [7, 13, [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, the temporal association with subsequent cardiovascular complications, such as MI and heart failure (HF), are uncertain. Another critical difference between the diagnoses of myocardial injury and MI is the disparity in evidence to inform clinical management. While there is rich evidence to guide the management of type 1 MI, there is little evidence to guide the management of patients with type 2 MI and myocardial injury [19] [20] [21] . This is especially pertinent as type 1 MI accounts for a relatively small proportion of all detectable troponin elevations and myocardial injury is increasingly observed in clinical practice [4, 6, 10] .",

In July 2011, a 5th generation hs-cTnT assay was implemented across all public hospitals in the state by a single pathology service, with the same assay implemented at all facilities. Troponin results were linked to hospital records and International Classification of Diseases primary and secondary diagnostic codes, version 10 Australian Modified (ICD-10 AM). Each encounter was considered as a new episode of care (EOC). Each EOC for a given patient was linked longitudinally allowing representation to hospital to serve both as an outcome for the prior EOC as well as a new EOC. Transfers between hospitals were considered as part of the same EOC. All diagnostic codes for patients transferred between hospitals were evaluated to ensure all suitable cases were identified. Episodes of care were excluded from the analyses if troponin testing was not performed or if there was only a single borderline elevated hs-cTnT (29-52ng/L) since a troponin pattern could not be determined from these episodes of care based on published studies [22] [23] [24] [25] . Patients admitted through ED for elective coronary artery bypass surgery were also excluded due the expected differences in subsequent prognosis. Each EOC was followed up for a minimum of 12 months and was censored at the time of last known follow-up. The decision for all clinical management was made at the treating physician's discretion, independent of this study.",

While there exists a robust evidence-base to guide management and risk stratification of acute MI, especially for type 1 acute MI (atherosclerotic plaque disruption), there is a lack of guiding evidence for prognosis-modifying therapies for patients with acute and chronic myocardial injury [20, 21] . In this population-level cohort study, we characterized the temporal risk associated with different troponin elevation patterns and subtypes and examined the clinical outcomes after repeated presentations of myocardial injury or infarction. The primary findings of this study were: 1) the divergent profiles of subsequent risk amongst the different phenotypes of myocardial injury, 2) additive risk for subsequent MI in repeat presentations of acute myocardial injury with recognized CAD, 3) the value of troponin as a cardiac-selective risk stratification tool in patients with high burden of competing non-cardiac comorbidities, and 4) the high proportion of non-MI hs-cTnT elevations. To our knowledge, this is the first health system-level study to evaluate the individual temporal clinical consequences associated with different phenotypes of myocardial injury using a contemporary high-sensitivity troponin assay. Our study should inform the design of future clinical trials of current and emerging therapies that may impact cardiac outcomes among these high-risk groups currently not served by an evidence base to guide therapy. Our observation of distinct temporal profiles of subsequent clinical events may provide insights into potential underlying pathophysiology for each phenotype of troponin elevation Estimated hazard ratio of A) all-cause mortality, B) subsequent myocardial infarction, C) subsequent heart failure admission and D) ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac arrest in patients with acute myocardial infarction, acute myocardial injury with recognized coronary artery disease, acute myocardial injury without recognized coronary artery disease and chronic myocardial injury, relative to patients with no myocardial injury.

The acute MI group showed an expected pattern consistent with acute plaque rupture, with an early elevated risk for mortality, MI, heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias, which diminishes over time. Therapies with the likely greatest risk-modifying potential for this group are therefore acute coronary-specific therapies in keeping with current guidelines (i.e. antiplatelet therapies, early non-invasive or invasive anatomical assessment +/revascularisation, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) [19] [20] [21] . In contrast to acute MI, the myocardial injury groups did not show the pattern of early elevated ischaemic risk. Instead, the elevated ischaemic risk was only seen in patients with documented CAD and was more constant over time (Fig 2, S1 Fig) . Prior studies that have characterised outcomes following non-type 1 MI have been limited by relatively small sample sizes or have combined clinical endpoints such as recurrent MI and heart failure, thus making it difficult to propose putative mechanisms for poor long-term outcomes [7, 13, 16] . Consistent with these studies [7, 13, 16] , we observed a higher risk of long-term all-cause mortality in myocardial injury than in MI. It remains unclear whether this higher mortality in myocardial injury is due to fundamental differences in the mechanism(s) of troponin elevation, the influence of comorbidities, or the effect of disease-specific treatment available. Our observation that patients with acute myocardial injury without recognized CAD had higher all-cause mortality despite having lower subsequent ischaemic risk suggests that these patients may not benefit from therapies targeted at acute plaque rupture and may in fact be harmed by them due to the concomitant bleeding risk. This may be especially relevant during the Coronavirus-19 pandemic where acute myocardial injury is common and bleeding risk is high [31] [32] [33] [34] . Overall, we observed a lower 1-year mortality in the chronic myocardial injury group compared to other studies [7, 12, 16] , although after adjustment, the mortality risk of this group was comparable to the acute MI group (adjusted 1-year hazard ratio of mortality for chronic injury vs. acute MI: 2.53 vs. 2.25). Table 3 . Adjusted hazard ratios of 30-day, 1-year and 3-year all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, subsequent heart failure admission, and ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest in the acute myocardial infarction, acute myocardial injury with recognized coronary artery disease, acute myocardial injury without recognized coronary artery disease and chronic myocardial injury groups based on flexible parametric models. The relatively low unadjusted mortality may be partially explained by the fact that our analysis focused on characterization of patients' risk \"per encounter\" and patients who were initially classified as chronic myocardial injury may subsequently experience an 'acute injurious' event that preceded mortality and therefore the mortality risk was attributed to acute injury. Lastly, we found no association between myocardial injury (both acute and chronic) and markers of frailty (subsequent NOFF) or susceptibility to illness (subsequent pneumonia) after correcting for potential confounders. Whilst previous studies have suggested that troponin elevation may be non-specific in patients with highly competing non-cardiac comorbidities [35] [36] [37] , our findings suggest that troponin remains a useful tool for cardiac-selective risk stratification.",

            "text": "One of the key findings of this study was the observation of the large potentially modifiable risk for recurrent MI in patients with acute myocardial injury with recognized CAD, compared to the other two injury groups (acute myocardial injury without recognized CAD and chronic myocardial injury). In this study, we chose to additionally subdivide acute myocardial injury into patients with and without recognized CAD, under the hypothesis that these represent distinct mechanistic subgroups. In keeping with this hypothesis, we observed clear differences between these two subgroups especially in the risk of subsequent MI (Fig 2, Table 3, S1  Fig) . Specifically, we observed a greater than 3-fold increase in risk of subsequent MI in patients with acute myocardial injury with recognized CAD that was not observed in those without recognized CAD. The difference between the early elevated risk in acute MI and the constantly elevated MI risk in acute myocardial injury likely represent a mechanistic difference in acute plaque rupture versus more stable coronary artery disease (Fig 2, S1 Fig) . We also observed an incremental dose-response relationship between repeated acute myocardial injury with recognized CAD and subsequent ischaemic events (Fig 3) . This dose-response relationship was not detected in patients with acute myocardial injury without recognized CAD or chronic myocardial injury, further supporting the concept of distinct underlying pathophysiologies between phenotypes. A previous study has also observed a difference between these subgroups, as CAD was shown to be an independent risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with myocardial injury or type 2 MI [13] . Thus, our results would suggest the potential benefit of invasive or non-invasive anatomical assessment in patients with acute myocardial injury if coronary anatomy is unknown, followed by coronary-specific preventative therapies such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to mitigate their risk for subsequent coronary events. This, of course, requires clinical judgement in the balancing of the risks associated with vascular access (if invasive) and contrast-induced kidney injury. Overall, whilst previous studies have demonstrated an association between troponin elevation and poor outcome [7, 13, [15] [16] [17] [18] , our findings suggest that each pattern of troponin elevation likely necessitate distinct risk-modifying strategies to mitigate these outcomes. These concepts of coronary investigation and directed therapies require further prospective evaluation in randomized clinical trials, two of which are ongoing-The Appropriateness of Coronary investigation in myocardial injury and Type 2 myocardial infarction (ACT-2; ACTRN12618000378224) [26] trial Estimated hazard ratio of A) subsequent myocardial infarction(s) and B) subsequent heart failure admission(s) in patients with 1, 2, and \ufffd3 recurrent episodes of acute myocardial injury with recognized coronary artery disease (combined group 1 and 2), acute myocardial injury without recognized coronary artery disease (group 3) and chronic myocardial injury (group 4).

            "text": "Several limitations of this study should be considered. First, misclassification between patients with acute myocardial injury, chronic myocardial injury and acute MI is possible given the reliance of this study on the application of national coding rules, which may differ from clinical impression. However, this was mitigated with manual adjudication of over 6,000 EOCs and optimization of the classification criteria. Furthermore, consistency of diagnostic classification is known to be clinically very challenging especially in the setting of borderline hs-cTnT results and co-existent illnesses. In using standardized coding data and a trend towards under-diagnosis of CAD following adjudication, misclassification of encounters is likely non-differential, resulting in an underestimation of the effect estimates whilst preserving the direction of effect. Second, while we adjusted our models for key prognostic variables, residual unrecognized confounding and the impact of down-stream treatments may impact the magnitude of the observed excess hazard for various events. In part, exploring the association between troponin patterns and subsequent presentations with pneumonia and fractured neck of femur attempts to provide an evaluation of unmeasured confounding, and the lack of significant association with these recurrent events is reassuring. Lastly, we chose to use EOCbased rather than individual-level analysis allowing risk to vary dynamically with time, which may lead to correlated outcomes among frequent presenters. However, the impact of this bias is mitigated by the large available sample, the small proportion attributable to multiple repeated episodes within the same patient, and sensitivity analysis.",

In particular, we observed a significant and additive risk for subsequent MI in patients with acute myocardial injury with CAD, suggesting potential benefit of early anatomical assessment and coronary-directed therapies.
