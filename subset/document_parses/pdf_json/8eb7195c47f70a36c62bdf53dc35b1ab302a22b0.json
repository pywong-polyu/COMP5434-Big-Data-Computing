Education, health management, hobbies and sports, leisure and entertainment, as activities that could hold a fundamental place in many individuals' lives, are severely limited or completely blocked. Moreover, people could be more or less frightened about the current health emergency, living their own houses as a safe place or a prison, or even both at times, depending on personal tendencies and contingencies. What are locked down persons more unhappy about? Did the pandemic and the lockdown hit them as a traumatic experience, or as a weird, boring period where one just has to be patient? Was the lockdown even a positive experience for some? If yes, how?",

Such knowledge will be helpful to (1) identify which life areas (e.g., work, social relationships, hobbies and activities) have been affected by the isolation and how, so to orient future psychological support and mental health policies, and (2) understand which positive resources people have been able to employ in order to manage stressful factors, so to inform a societal comprehension of the lockdown phenomenon from the viewpoint of citizens. Moreover, lockdown and quarantine already demonstrated to influence many fields, ranging from market behavior (e.g., the increase of eCommerce utilization) [14, 15] to work and productivity (e.g., the forced digitalization of many job practices) [16, 17] .

During the quarantine, one participant (female, 31 years old, ID#7) remembered the most significant negative episode related to the limitation of movement due to the lockdown. She was not able to participate in her grandmother's funeral due to the restrictions to personal movement. This led the participant to perceive the lockdown \"like a prison\" which prevented her to be close to relatives in a time of need: \"The police said it was not a sufficient motive to get an authorization (to move). In the end there has been a small ceremony at my parents' house, and I was able to attend it just by video-call (. . .) When they said I could not go it was like the whole world was falling apart. (. . .) At first I thought, I just grab a couple clothes and go, but then. . . in that moment, I really felt the lockdown like a prison.\" The limitation to movement emerged as a significant event also when loved ones were ill or emotionally distressed and people felt a strong desire to be close to them. Indeed, for two other participants, the worst episode was related to the impossibility to reach and help loved ones who were ill or distressed. \"This friend of mine told me (at the telephone) that her father was in mortal danger (due to coronavirus): in that moment I thought how people are frail (. . .) I did what I could to help her at a distance but I felt impotent, useless\" (female, 26, ID#2); Impossibility to carry out daily activities during the quarantine. Three participants recalled the worst episode when they truly realized they could no longer carry out important daily activities during the lockdown (e.g., sports, hobbies). Routines were seen as beneficial for some participants and their interruption had a very negative impact on their psychological wellbeing. This seems common in people relying heavily on their out-of-home routine, passions, activities, to the point that the \"realization\" of the quarantine brings along disruptive emotions that tend to last long in their daily experience. \"The first weekend I realized I had nothing to do, and for the first time I realized it was not like a week of sick leave or something (. . .) and I felt like in a prison (. . .). Sometimes I still have this sensation of alienation and I don't know how to make it go away\" (female, 30, ID#18); \". . .the first day, when they said we cannot go out. This idea is devastating, like having a mental chain (. . .) it was when I read the newspaper and I got panicked, I just called all friends and relatives of mine and created pure alarmism, it was so bad (. . .) It is still this bad for me, I am just crossing days on the calendar (waiting for the end)\" (female, 28, ID#13); note-this participant was the only one in the sample who refused to report a positive event along with the negative one). In other words, the quarantine results in a strong personal constraint that forces people to abandon their daily activities and to rebuild a new daily plan by excluding previous habits. Interestingly, even in the narration of these episodes, people describe the lockdown \"like a prison\", emphasizing how the lockdown consisted primarily in a disturbing distortion of activities that normally support emotional stability.",

Events where the signs of the COVID-19 emergency were visible to the participants were classified as the most significant and representative of the quarantine experience, such as the sound of the ambulance in the night, the police cars on the streets with policemen guarding and enforcing the social distancing policies, and the quarrel between people queuing at the post office. For example, a 22 years-old young woman described that one night an ambulance stopped near her home. This immediately triggered the thought that some close person, such as a dear neighbour or relative, may have contracted the virus and was in critical conditions, generating apprehension and fear. Additionally, a 28 years-old woman recalled that, while she was walking her dog, she was stopped by the police and invited to return home. This episode led her to realize the gravity of the situation and made her feel at fault, almost \"like a criminal doing something bad\" (ID#15). These clear signs of the emergency also allowed the interviewee to understand that the COVID-19 situation was serious and allowed to \"realize that it was a really serious thing and we had to stay at home because otherwise (all of this) would be useless\" (female, 28, ID#15). Similarly, one participant talked about the tension easily perceived in ordinary life contexts due to quarantine, such as a supermarket or a post office, which become somewhat alienated by the situation. This participant remembered as the most significant and negative event the day in which he went to the supermarket: \"the row of trolleys at the supermarket parking with people who do not speak, harnessed, must keep distances. There is suspicion in the eyes of people. All of them are careful to see if someone would violate the rules [. . .] . I see that even the most normal things are different from the usual\" (male, 30, ID#20). Among people, escalation of tension may occur, as in the episode narrated by the participant who witnessed an altercation between two other customers, which he felt as the result of stress: \"I think it is the demonstration of the difficult moment that you are experiencing. it takes little to light up compared to normal situations in which maybe the reaction would have been different\" (ID#20). This led the participant to feel \"annoyance and irritation [. . .] (those people) not respecting the rules in a situation where they are trying to protect us. . . it annoyed me\" (ID#20).",

This complicated the return of her brother to his home, generating anxiety and concern about what could have happened. \"My brother had to move to reach his own family and did not understand how to do it, how to move.

The impossibility of having personal spaces and having to look after another person with whom the relationship had become problematic was extremely difficult during the quarantine. Additionally, it is possible that people experienced \"stress and panic\", resulting in family misunderstandings.",

Six participants recalled positive episodes related to the renewed opportunity to stay in touch with their loved ones. A young woman (31-years old) recalled as the most positive event the opportunity to spend a lot of time with her partner. Often, due to the busy working life, the relationship can be overlooked. Instead during the lockdown, the woman lives the whole day with her loved one, experiencing positive emotions and feeling supportive during the unpleasant experience of the pandemic.

Participants referred to the quarantine as \"prison\" multiple times, emphasizing how the lockdown consisted primarily in a limitation to freedom and a disturbing distortion of those activities that normally support emotional stability.

Additionally, it seems that quarantine has allowed people to attribute a new meaning to simple daily activities and to everyday gestures. Participants remembered episodes in which they rediscovered activities with a renewed, positive feeling due to successful adaptation.

The sensation of emergency is related to environmental signs that burst into the everyday routine, ranging from the close siren of the ambulance in the night to being notified of a loved one being in distress or danger. Recognizing quarantine as a national emergency on the basis of signs in everyday life has also led people to consider COVID-19 not as an event \"distant\" from personal experience, but as a very close danger that significantly impacted their own life. The sensation of emergency appears also connected often to the feeling of impotence. This way, it appears that the emergency situation do not only affect those who are directly involved by the health concerns (e.g., by contracting the virus), but also those who experience the situation from the safety of their homes, when external stimuli remind them of the concreteness of the risks and of their own limited agency over the situation.",

As in other forms of pandemic (e.g., SARS in Canada) in which people experienced symptoms of trauma similar to that of natural disaster or terrorist attack [39] , the COVID-19 pandemic can expose people to traumatic experiences. Unexpected emergencies and traumatic circumstances during the quarantine (e.g., the death of loved ones; the forced social distancing) may be related to intrusive fantasies and thoughts connected to the trauma, dissociations, and emotional burden. This could have a negative impact on social, working and relational functioning [40] . It is important to take into account individual differences (e.g., personality traits) [41, 42] and the possible traumatic consequences of the pandemic and rethink mental health provisions and psychological support for people in order to promote a reconnection between dissociated parts and the elaboration of traumatic experiences [43] [44] [45] [46] .",

Rather than collecting general opinions on the quarantine, this technique focuses on relevant episodes representing individuals' experience, without forcing them into predetermined categories. Another strength is that we carried out this research during the quarantine itself, collecting information on individuals' life within the exact context and period of interest. This allows us to collect feelings and memories at the time of the event, minimizing the risk of distortions and forgetfulness with direct access to the recent memory.",

In addition, interviews conducted via Skype present additional barriers and relevant information may be missed.
