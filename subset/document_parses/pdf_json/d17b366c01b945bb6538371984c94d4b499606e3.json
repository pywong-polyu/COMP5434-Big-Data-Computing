According to the most recent United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) data, an estimated 10.5% of U.S. households face food insecurity [1] . The USDA defines food insecurity as a reduction in the quality, variety, or desirability of a diet or a disrupted eating pattern and reduced food intake [1] . Those with the highest prevalence of food insecurity include African American (AA) and Hispanic individuals [2] . Food insecurity negatively affects diet quality, leading to health problems, including overweight and obesity, diabetes, and heart disease [3, 4] . A systematic review assessing the relationship between food security and dietary quality found that adults with food insecurity consume fewer fruits, vegetables, and dairy foods compared to adults without food insecurity [5] .",

To create a home-based dietary intervention that is affordable for populations with lower income, it is important to understand the food environment of these families, including opportunities and barriers for healthy eating at home. A study with 1500 families with low to middle income that solicited information on shopping, cooking, and mealtime habits found that participants went grocery shopping once per week and ate dinner at home 4 days per week [8] . Notably, participants identified food cost, time, and conflicting schedules as barriers to cooking meals at home but also commented that they feel they can overcome these hurdles to cook healthy meals for their families [8] . A cross-sectional study of 100 individuals with low income in Texas identified the following barriers to healthy eating: cost, time, transportation, lack of knowledge of healthy foods, lack of cooking skills, and distaste for healthy foods [9] . These data suggest that there is a need for an affordable, simple, and quick intervention to remove the stated barriers to cooking healthy meals at home.",

The $10.26 billion meal kit industry continues to gain popularity due to the convenience it provides by eliminating the process of meal planning and grocery shopping [12, 13] . Consumers of home-delivered meal kits tend to be between the ages of 25 to 44 years old, partnered or married with children in the house, have an advanced degree, a full-time job, and have a household income of at least $100,000 [12] . While individuals with low income cannot use SNAP benefits to purchase traditional home-delivered meal kits, grocery stores are also starting to offer these one-stop-shop meal kits, which are a SNAP-eligible purchase [12] .",

Inclusion criteria were (1) AA, (2) 18 years of age or older, and (3) primary food preparer in the household. Group 2 was a convenience sample of Hispanic participants recruited in-person from a community resource center predominately serving participants who are low income in Hollywood, Florida, United States. Inclusion criteria were (1) Hispanic, (2) 18 years of age or older, and (3) primary food preparer in the household. Group 2 focus groups and surveys were conducted in Spanish, the participants' native language. All focus groups were conducted in groups of five or six at the site in which they were recruited, and participants were divided among groups based on time in which they arrived at the site. The study participants, young children of the participants, and the researchers were the only ones present at the time of data collection. Three focus groups with each racial/ethnic group were sufficient for data saturation, or the point in which no new themes emerged regarding knowledge and preferences for meal kit [16] . Focus groups lasted approximately 45 min and were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. All participants received $25 for participation. This study was approved by the University of Florida's Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave informed consent.",

Differences in meal preferences in AAs tended to be generational, whereas Hispanic meal preferences differed based on country of origin. While there were generational differences among the AA participants, there was also the number of foods that were consistent among AA participant's food preferences, a consistency that could be incorporated into a culturally appropriate meal kit. Creating a similar meal kit for Hispanic individuals from different countries, however, would prove more challenging as food preferences vary widely by geographic region. Hispanic participants recruited for this study, representing eight different countries, were likely first-or second-generation immigrants and may not have experienced the same level of acculturation as American-born Hispanic families. As the participants' food preference reflected traditional dishes from their country of origin, nutrition interventions such as meal kits for these families would need to consider culture and food preferences in order to be most accepted. Culturally sensitive interventions have been shown to be more effective than usual care, as shown in Barrera's culturally adapted diabetes intervention for Latinas [21, 22] . While there is a need to be sensitive to cultural preferences when designing a diet intervention, such as a meal kit, it is also worth noting that participants overwhelmingly said they would be willing to try new foods, illustrating the need for further investigation in this area. Meal kits may provide participants with a cost-effective method for trying new foods as meal kits provide small portions of the ingredients, rather than, for example, an entire bottle of spices.",

Results from the meal kit questions of the focus groups suggest that meal kits are a new concept for participants, one that may require more consumer education prior to successful implementation with minority audiences with low income. A study on the acceptability of meal kits with adolescents who have obesity and their caregivers found meal kits promoted cooking at home, saved time, and were seen as an acceptable weight-loss intervention [10] . Similarly, our study found that most participants were open to the idea of trying meal kits, with major concerns centered around cost and quality (freshness and food safety). Traditional meal kits that are delivered to the home cost on average from $5-$15 per serving [23] . Due to the high cost per serving and inability to use SNAP benefits on home-delivered meal kits, this is likely not an option for audiences with low income. However, to save money and create a more cost-effective intervention, participants were willing to pick up the meal kits from a central location, such as a church, food pantry, or library. Grocery stores are also starting to offer these one-stop-shop meal kits, which can be purchased using SNAP benefits, another alternative to the traditional meal kits [12] . Picking up from a centralized location, whether it be a church or grocery store, would also ease food safety concerns. These concerns are not unfounded. Data shared at the 2017 Food Safety Summit and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlight how the lack of proper food safety procedures among some home-delivered meal kits resulted in an increased chance of food borne illness due to improper handling and chilling [24, 25] . By picking meal kits up from a centralized location, the foods can be refrigerated until distribution, allowing participants to enjoy the convenience of meal kits with a reduced risk of food safety concerns.",

Hispanic participants cited their desire to cook foods not included in the meal kit as a possible barrier to trying the meals kits. As traditional meal kits most often include three meals a week, notifying families that meal kit services still allow for flexibility to make their own meals is an important educational component. Additionally, a number of meal kit services currently on the market allow consumers to choose the meals they receive each week, further ensuring the meals account for individual food preferences [12] . Based on the findings from this study, previous meal kit studies, and current practices from commercial meal kit studies, a list of recommendations for future meal kit interventions aimed at improving food access and diet quality have been created. Briefly, consumer education is needed to inform individuals with low income about the concept of meal kits and about food safety considerations. Meal kits targeting this segment of the population should be affordable, preferably eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits. Recipes included should continue to be quick to prepare and may include educational resources of common cooking techniques. Finally, the recipes included in the meal kits should also be appropriate for minorities and populations with low incomes who are disproportionately at risk for diet related diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes [26] .",

Additionally, a strength of this study is the innovative nature of the data collected on meal kits, which will provide the foundation for a future meal kit intervention with an audience with low income. Limitations of this study include the inability to pilot test the semi-structured questionnaire with the target population prior to the focus groups and the use of small convenience samples with only two racial/ethnic groups. The sample size was limited due to the funding available to conduct the study. Finally, in addition to federal food assistance usage, future studies should ask for income data to qualify participants as low income. Participants were all recruited from facilities that support individuals with low income or those that reside in low-income neighborhoods. While it was expected that a high percentage of participants were receiving federal food assistance and therefore considered low income, only 42% of study participants actually reported receiving federal food assistance. It is possible that participants underreported their enrollment in federal food assistance programs as documented by the Urban Institute [27] .",

Meal kits are an innovative way to address these barriers but were a new concept for these participants. Both groups may benefit from utilizing meal kits as a way to quickly and conveniently eat more healthful dinners at home. Both groups identified a lack of knowledge regarding meal kits but a willingness to try them if affordable. While there are concerns related to cost, quality, and food preferences, these could be addressed by understanding the audience for which the meal kits are targeting and altering the method in which participants receive the meal kits to reduce cost while maintaining food safety. Due to concerns over taste, portions, and the desire to cook food in addition to what is provided in the meal kit, additional education about the meal kits in both populations is warranted. If implemented as a nutrition education intervention, the meals kits should be tailored to account for taste and cultural preferences. This study was completed before the COVID-19 pandemic. Since COVID-19, people have been cooking more at home, suggesting meal kits may be more favorable than before [28] . Meal kits may be a unique, pragmatic approach to improving diet quality of families with low income if the service is affordable, maintains high nutrition standards while accounting for dietary preferences of the target audience, and is easily accessible.",
