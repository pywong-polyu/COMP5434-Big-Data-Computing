In contrast, these ACE2 and TMPRSS2 modules were highly expressed in goblet cells in scRNA-seq from bronchial brushings. Cell-type deconvolution of the RNA-seq con rmed that smoking increased the abundance of several secretory cell populations in the bronchus, but only goblet cells in the nose.",

SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by utilizing host cell-surface proteins for viral entry (VE). VE proteins include angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which provides a binding site for the virus; proteases such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that can cleave the viral S glycoprotein; and cathepsin L (CTSL), which can also aid with S glycoprotein priming [1] [2] [3] [4] . Prior studies have attempted to establish associations between the expression of VE genes and clinical variables to identify factors that may in uence infection incidence or COVID-19 severity.",

Moreover, earlier studies with limited numbers of subjects led to the conclusion that race was associated with ACE2 expression 11 , which was not found by Smith et al in a larger dataset 5 . Lung airway expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was also found to be signi cantly up-regulated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with healthy subjects or in smokers compared with non-smokers 12 without adjustment of important factors such as age and sex. The goal of this study is to establish associations between VE gene expression and clinical factors leveraging a large number of airway samples with extensive clinical data, matched between nasal and bronchial compartment from multiple independent cohorts, and to identify the biological processes and cell types associated with the expression of VE genes in the nasal and bronchial compartments.",

Study participants were current or former smokers undergoing bronchoscopy as part of either a diagnostic workup or a screening process for lung cancer. Clinical data collected on samples included smoking status, sex, age, forced expiratory volume during the rst second (FEV1) percent Predicted, and, in the AEGIS study, lung cancer status (Supplemental Tables 1). Notably, we observed different patterns of association with smoking between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression between the nasal and bronchial epithelium. ACE2 was down-regulated in the nasal epithelium of current smokers in 1 out of 2 cohorts (p < 0.01) but strongly up-regulated in the bronchus in all four cohorts (p < 0.01; Figs. 1a and 1b; Supplemental Fig. 1a and 1b) . TMPRSS2 expression was not associated with smoking in the nose but its expression was up-regulated in current smokers in the bronchus in 3 out of 4 cohorts (p < 0.001). CTSL expression was down-regulated in current smokers in the nasal epithelium in 1 out of 2 cohorts (p < 0.01) and the bronchial epithelium in 3 out of 4 cohorts (p < 0.05). These genes were not strongly associated with other clinical variables (sex, age, FEV1% Predicted) across cohorts in either the nasal or bronchial samples in contrast to some previous studies 5, 8, 11, 12 . Adjusting for lung cancer diagnosis in the AEGIS cohort did not change these observed correlations, although positive lung cancer status negatively correlated with ACE2 expression in the nasal epithelium (p<0.05, Supplemental Fig. 1b) . Upon examining paired nasal and bronchial samples from the same subjects, a lack of correlation in the expression of each VE gene was observed between the two tissues (p > 0.05; Fig. 1c Table 3 ), suggesting that the biological processes that in uence the expression of these genes may differ across airway sites. To further explore the biological pathways associated with VE genes in each site of the airway, we developed co-expression networks using Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) 17 . We identi ed 58 and 48 gene modules within the nasal and bronchial cohorts, respectively ( Fig. 2a and Fig. 3b ) to those presented in Figure 1 to those presented in Figure 1 .",

Genes of the TMPRSS2 module in the nose were enriched in estrogen response and KRAS signaling pathways while the module in the bronchial epithelium was enriched in MTORC1 and TNF\u03b1-NF\u03baB signaling pathways. The lack of shared biological pathways mirrors the small number of genes shared by the nasal and bronchial modules for ACE2 (n = 5) and TMPRSS2 (n = 12). In contrast, the nasal and bronchial CTSL modules shared 177 genes (Fisher's exact test, p = 2.23E-10) and were both enriched in genes related to in ammatory response and TNF-alpha signaling pathways. Furthermore, in the bronchus, ACE2 and TMPRSS2-associated modules share enrichment in genes involved in the p53 pathway, adipogenesis, androgen response, MTORC1 signaling, and estrogen response (Supplemental Fig. 3c ). We also did not observe signi cant correlations between the eigengenes of each VE gene module in the paired nasal and bronchial samples ( Fig. 2d and Supplemental Fig. 3d ).

We also identi ed two bronchial goblet-like secretory populations: one characterized by high expression of CEACAM5 but not MUC5AC, previously described as peri-goblet cells 18 , and the other by high expression of HLA-DQA1 and MHC class II genes (Figs. 3a-b, Supplemental Fig. 4 ). In the nose, we discovered two club-cell-like secretory cell clusters (STATH+ and C15orf48+), as well as a novel cell cluster of \"keratinizing epithelial cells\" expressing genes involved in corni cation, epidermis development, and keratinocyte differentiation, such as SPRR3 and SPRR2A.

In the nose, the ACE2 module was moderately expressed across many cell types but was most highly expressed in C15orf48+ secretory cells and club cells. The TMPRSS2 module was predominantly expressed in the keratinizing epithelial cells, followed by C15orf48+ secretory cells. The expression of gene modules of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is different from the gene expression pattern reported by Sungnak et al in that TMPRSS2 gene expression was limited to ACE2+ cells 21 . In the bronchus, both the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 modules were expressed at the highest levels in the goblet cell population, in agreement with previous ndings 22 . The highest median metagene score for the CTSL module was in the neutrophils and macrophages in both the nose and bronchus; however, expression was also high in T cells in the nose and dendritic cells in the bronchus. We found very few cells co-expressing ACE2, CTSL, and TMPRSS2 at high levels -114 out of 34833 cells in the nose and no cells in the bronchus. On the other hand, we found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 modules were more likely to be highly co-expressed in nasal keratinizing epithelial cells (odds ratio = 7.56), nasal C15orf48+ secretory cells (N = 518, odds ratio = 7.36), and bronchial goblet cells (odds ratio = 16.80) (N = 806, Supplemental Table 6 , FDR q < 0.001). Thus, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were found to be expressed in different nasal and bronchial cell populations, which may be in uenced by smoking in ways that lead to their divergent correlation with smoking in the two airway compartments.",

Increased proportions of ionocytes in current smokers were also observed in the nose (1 out of 2 cohorts) and bronchus (all 4 cohorts). The proportion of ciliated cells was signi cantly lower in smokers in all 6 cohorts (Figs. 4a-b, Supplemental Figs. 7a-d, p < 0.05). While goblet cell proportions were signi cantly higher in smokers in both the nose and bronchus, the ACE2 module was highly expressed only in bronchial, not nasal goblet cells. These results may explain the lack of association of ACE2 expression with smoking in the bulk RNA-seq nasal data. Additionally, in the AEGIS nasal data (Supplemental Fig. 7 ) the fraction of keratinizing epithelial cells is increased and STATH+ secretory cells is decreased in current smokers, suggesting that shifts in these populations may be partially responsible for the differential correlation with smoking between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the nose.

Similarly, scRNA-seq data showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 modules were co-expressed in bronchial goblet cells but had distinct patterns of expression across nasal cell populations. Our high-resolution nasal scRNA-seq dataset containing over 30,000 cells allowed us to differentiate between secretory cell populations to show that C15orf48+ and keratinizing epithelial cells had the highest expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 modules, respectively. In contrast, we found that bronchial goblet cells had the highest expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 modules, and only the goblet cell population was increased in smokers in our deconvolution analysis. Of note, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 modules were also co-expressed highly within the peri-goblet cells in the bronchus, which was also observed by Lukassen et al 20 .",
