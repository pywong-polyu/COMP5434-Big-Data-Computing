To assess the risks from imported COVID-19 cases in South Korea, we suggest using the daily risk score. Confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by John Hopkins University Center, roaming data collected from Korea Telecom, and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker index were included in calculating the risk score. The risk score was highly correlated with imported COVID-19 cases after 12 days. To forecast daily imported COVID-19 cases after 12 days in South Korea, we developed prediction models using simple linear regression and autoregressive integrated moving average, including exogenous variables (ARIMAX). In the validation set, the root mean squared error of the linear regression model using the risk score was 6.2, which was lower than that of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA; 22.3) without the risk score as a reference. Correlation coefficient of ARIMAX using the risk score (0.925) was higher than that of ARIMA (0.899). A possible reason for this time lag of 12 days between imported cases and the risk score could be the delay that occurs before the effect of government policies such as closure of airports or lockdown of cities. Roaming data could help warn roaming users regarding their COVID-19 risk status and inform the national health agency of possible high-risk areas for domestic outbreaks.",

            "text": "Since coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019, a total of 11 451 030 confirmed cases, including 534 320 deaths, have been reported in 188 countries as of July 6, 2020 [1] . The first imported case in South Korea was reported on January 20, 2020; the traveler had arrived from Wuhan, China [2] . The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Korea rapidly increased February 19, 2020 onward, and Daegu city was identified as the epicenter of regional spread [2] . To delay the spread of COVID-19 without vaccines, governments in most countries have implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions such as home isolation, social distancing, airport closures, and international travel bans [3] . In Germany, the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases decreased after the enforcement of lockdown but increased after the lockdown was eased [4] . To prevent another COVID-19 outbreak after the ban on international travel is relaxed, the government should consider the risks posed by imported cases as the infection rate in other countries is accelerating. Air travel data are important factors in assessing the risk from imported cases of infectious diseases [5] . Mobile phone data can provide population travel information that can be used to estimate the risk of an epidemic [6, 7] . Mobile roaming data can be particularly useful as it can estimate near real-time air travel and determine the date and duration of stay at the destination [8] . A high volume of international airline travelers arriving from countries with many confirmed COVID-19 cases may increase the number of imported COVID-19 cases in South Korea. After the World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in most countries decided to enforce international travel bans. The International Air Transport Association announced that passenger demand in May 2020 dropped 91.3% compared to that in May 2019 [9] . Government response to COVID-19 can help estimate the risks from imported COVID-19 cases. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides a systematic cross-national and cross-temporal measure to understand how government responses have evolved from January 22, 2020 to the present day [10] . A stricter government response could result in fewer imported cases of COVID-19.",

Because of these reasons, the imported cases may have increased in early April. Therefore, the roaming data are correlated with the imported cases with a time lag of several days. The time lag for the forecast was selected as 12 days by cross-correlation analysis between the risk score and imported COVID-19 cases. The potential reason for the 12-day time lag in the forecast could be related to the period between exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the confirmation of infection.

In early April, the proportion of imported cases from Europe was the highest because the number of confirmed cases had greatly increased in Europe. However, unlike the risk score, the ratios of COVID-19 cases grouped by country did not have a time lag of 12 days. We hypothesize that the delay between the infected time and the reported time is similar for cases confirmed in other countries and imported in South Korea. Therefore, the time-series ratios of confirmed cases grouped by country could not be used to forecast ratios of the countries for imported cases after 12 days. However, information on the COVID-19 risk of the countries for imported cases can inform roaming users of the risk depending on their travel country and itinerary. Moreover, the residency information of the high-risk roaming users may help KCDC monitor risky regions in South Korea, where domestic COVID-19 outbreaks could begin.",

If international traveler information, such as roaming data, is available for a specific country, the risk score suggested in this study can be calculated to predict the imported COVID-19 cases for that country. However, our study has several limitations. The KT roaming data could not cover all international travel. Among those entering South Korea, there may be individuals who do not use KT services or use telecommunication providers other than KT. Furthermore, the roaming data cannot be disclosed because of the privacy laws of South Korea. Further research to develop prediction models for the domestic outbreak of COVID-19 based on the calculated risks of imported COVID-19 cases is warranted.",

            "text": "This study demonstrated the performance of the risk score of imported COVID-19 cases using roaming data. The risk score had a negative time lag of 12 days and is eligible as an input variable for the 12 days forecast of imported COVID-19 cases in South Korea. The roaming data could help warn roaming users that they are at a high risk of contracting COVID-19 and inform the KCDC of possible high-risk areas for domestic outbreaks using the residency information of travelers returning to South Korea. Although the roaming data cannot cover all international travel, the number of international travelers could be estimated using additional data from the government and passenger airlines. Therefore, we suggest using the risk score to forecast imported COVID-19 cases after 12 days. Further, it could help the KCDC to determine resource allocation for the quarantine system. ",
