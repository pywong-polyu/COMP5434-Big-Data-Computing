Along with necrosis and apoptosis, it is currently known that cells can use several alternative routes to trigger cell death [7] . In recent years, another type of programmed cell death, namely ferroptosis, has been described, which is accompanied by a large amount of iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation [8] . The review by Dai et al. [9] , describes in a thorough and comprehensive way the transcription factors involved in ferroptosis that can be targeted in different cancer types. The same group has also studied autophagy-dependent ferroptosis. Inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) with rapamycin is used to trigger autophagy [10] . The authors identified a role glutathione peroxidase 4, an antioxidant enzyme, in modulating autophagy-dependent ferroptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. The results demonstrated that treatment with rapamycin induces GPX4 degradation and consequently ferroptosis. In addition, researchers found that genetic silencing of GPX4 was sufficient to trigger autophagy-dependent ferroptosis [11] . These findings shed light on the mechanisms of stress response during cell death and suggest possible targets for cancer therapy.",

FR\u03b1 is a membrane protein involved in folate metabolism, with relatively low expression in normal cells, which is however upregulated in cancer cells [14] . The identified FR\u03b1-binding peptides were genetically introduced in human adenoviruses and showed specificity for cancer cells in vivo.
