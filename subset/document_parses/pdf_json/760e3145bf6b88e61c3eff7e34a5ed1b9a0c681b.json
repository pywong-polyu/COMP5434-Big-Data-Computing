In this \"infodemic\" context, the role of exposure to social media and its associated conspiracy beliefs on vaccination intent is not well understood. Previous research about the influenza vaccine revealed that rumors and misconceptions shared throughout social media platforms spread panic, provoke anti-vaccine attitudes and beliefs, and raises mistrust in vaccines; ultimately leading to vaccine hesitancy and reduced vaccination intent [1] . Vaccine hesitancy has been associated with under-vaccination, particularly in children [2] ; which is also accompanied by a rise in previously controlled diseases; for example, the CDC attributes the spread of measles to the reduction in measles vaccinations [3] . Furthermore, 41-50% of parents in the UK are unwilling to vaccinate their children [4] , and half of the US population did not take the seasonal influenza vaccine [5] .",

While the COVID-19 vaccine is being developed, its availability remains insufficient to ensure herd immunity without being trusted and accepted to the general population. It is thus important to explore the role of social media in shaping health behaviors related to acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine to plan successful vaccination campaigns. Recent studies revealed that mistrust in vaccines and anti-vaccine beliefs reduced COVID-19 vaccination intent in the USA [7] and identified certain factors that explained vaccination intent, including the trust in healthcare systems [8] and risk perception [9] .",

An analysis of Tweets regarding the COVID-19 pandemic showed that 24.8% and 17.4% included misinformation or unverifiable information respectively [17] . In this crowd of news communicated on the web, it becomes hard to control the scientific merit of information, and it has been observed that information involving sensationalization and fear are more attractive, persuasive and more shared by users than dull accurate scientific news. While the increasing use of social media around the world presents an opportunity for its use as an essential and effective health communication strategy to provide the public with the needed information about the risky and preventive behaviors in such emerging pandemics, it also represents possible threat upon the dramatization and exaggeration of information, thus contributing to the so-called COVID-19 \"infodemic\" [18] . In fact, this infodemic involved problematic social media use and spread of fake news that were associated with several harms including anxiety, suicidal thoughts, distress and insomnia [19, 20] .",

For instance, during the 2019 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, \"misinformation was linked to violence, mistrust, social disturbances, and targeted attacks on healthcare providers\" [28] . In addition, infodemics pose challenges for healthcare workers to find reliable information sources, and hinder rapid decision-making [29] . In fact, during the COVID-19 pandemic, several frightful non-evidence-based rumors have been widely disseminated across social media platforms, including: death forecasts; forecasts of shortages of ventilation ICU equipment; rumors about famous people contracting the disease; and warning against the use of anti-inflammatory drugs [30] . Notwithstanding, some of these rumors have even been adopted by scientific journals without sound evidence [30] . Furthermore, a recent study revealed that social media spreads misinformation regarding COVID-19; including: false claims (association between specific ethnic groups and the spread of COVID-19); conspiracy theories (e.g. 5G technology or mosquito bites transmitting COVID-19); and pseudoscientific health therapies (e.g. alleged cures, such as use of hydroxychloroquine and anti-malarials; drinking cow urine or disinfecting alcohol, which was responsible for the death of more than 5000 Iranians due to alcohol poisoning) [31, 32] . Van Prooijen & Douglas described the emotional and social determinants of conspiracy theories and identified feelings of anxiety and instability, fear and threat [33] .

A structured questionnaire was developed by the research team based on literature reviews about exposure to social media and beliefs in conspiracy theories during pandemics. A phone survey was adopted in order to enforce prevention measures and maintain social distancing to protect data collectors from the transmission of COVID-19. An estimated sample size of 2653 participants were calculated based on a 99% confidence level with population = 6.8 million and an alpha-error of \u00b12.5%. The sampling was based on all probable mobile phone numbers in Lebanon (\ufffd18 years old) that were taken from the Lebanese Ministry of Telecommunication website. The sample was randomly selected using the webpage: https://www.randomizer.org. The list of selected numbers was divided among four data collectors specially trained for the purpose of this research study. Data collectors called their assigned numbers in the list at least three times, and in case of no answer, replaced by the next number in the list. Data collectors read obtained verbal informed consent among those who accepted to participate. 1052 participants responded to the questionnaire, translating to a response rate of 40%.",

Examples of questions in this section include: \"What is/are your main source (s) of information about COVID-19? Tick all that apply: (World Health Organization (WHO); Ministry of Public Health (MoPH); WhatsApp; Facebook; Twitter; Instagram; TV/radio),\" and \"To what extent do you trust COVID-19 news from the below mentioned sources\"?

Section 4: 5 questions about perceived threat and conspiracy beliefs. Perceived threat was measured using the question: \"I believe that Covid-19 is a threat to me and my family\" (answer options: strongly agree neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree). Three pervasive conspiracy beliefs were explored asking participants: \"Do you believe that COVID-19 is artificially man-made in a laboratory\" (man-made theory), \"Do you believe that COVID-19 is business tool to sell vaccines and medicaments\" (business theory), and \"Do you believe that COVID-19 is a tool for population control to reduce the number of elderly people\"? (Population control theory). The answer options for questions in this section were: strongly agree neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree. Section 5: 1 question about the intent to vaccinate stating: \"If there is a vaccine against corona-virus, do you intend on getting vaccinated?\" with answer options: yes, no, unsure.

Although single participants expressed slightly higher more intent to vaccination than ever married (54.1% vs. 49.4%) the difference was not statistically significant. Vaccination intent increased with trust in news from WHO, MoPH and radio/TV with statistically significant differences. Almost half of participants who often (59.3%) and sometimes (45.5%) trust WHO news expressed intent to vaccinate compared to only 9% and 17% did not intend to vaccinate respectively. The percentage of participants remained slightly higher in those who intend than do not intent to vaccinate between people who rarely (38.2% vs. 25%) and equal between those who never (37.8%) trust WHO news. A similar picture was observed in the group differences (vaccination intent vs. non-intent) according to trust in news from WHO, radio/TV (Table 2 ). On the contrary, while vaccination intent did not differ significantly according to perception about the exaggeration of COVID-19 in the media it decreased with participant's perception about being exposed to wrong/ wake or unverified news about COVID-19, and with two conspiracy theories (artificially man-made theory and business tool theory). Much higher percentages of participants with significant differences between the groups who believed that they were never (53.3%) or rarely (56.1%) exposed to fake news intended, compared to only around 14% who did not intend to vaccinate. Participants who disagreed with conspiracy theories had high reported intent to vaccinate 65% for man-made theory and 74.3% for business theory with lower percentages who intend to vaccinate as they agreed with conspiracy theories. Believing in population control theory did not have significant difference in percentages who intend or not to vaccinate. As for conspiracy beliefs, the Chi-square test showed that 53.7% of males vs. 44.5 of females strongly agreed that COVID-19 is exaggerated in the media, and 38.8% of males vs. 32.3 of females strongly believed that COVID-19 is a tool for population control, showing significant association of these believes with sex (p = 0.03 & p = 0.04, respectively). Furthermore, 51.2% of unemployed vs. 42.3% of employed strongly agreed with the fact that COVID-19 is exaggerated in the media (p = 0.01). Both sharing news and posting news about COVID-19 on social media were negatively associated with belief in that Covid-19 is a threat (significant associations) (p = 0.02 & p = 0.003, respectively). Those who strongly believe in the threat of COVID-19 less often share and post news in social media. For instance, while 80.9% and 82.9% of respondents who strongly believe in the threat of COVID-19 never share and post news on social media, compared to a lower percentage of respondents who sometimes share and post news (63.2% and 50%).",

Furthermore, results of this study confirmed that vaccination intent increased with the trust in news from health institutions (WHO, MOPH, and radio/TV), in consistence with other studies which have shown that acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine among adults in the USA was influenced by trust in institutions [40] , that lack of trust in vaccine related to anti-vaccine attitudes or beliefs in the USA [7] , and that trust in the health system was significant determinants of a COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in the Middle East [41] , and that trust in research and in vaccines predicted intention to vaccinate among general population in Italy [39] . In contrast to other studies that highlighted younger age and lower educational as a predictor to vaccine hesitancy [7] , age and education had no significant association with vaccination intent in our study. Results concerning the absence of significant association between perceived threats of COVID-19 with intent to vaccinate, however, contradict those of previous studies that showed that perception of disease risk increases vaccination intent [40] in the general population, and that perceived risk of disease increased acquiescence to COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers [41] .",

Firstly, it is important to recognize that all measured exposure and outcome variables are selfreported which creates a possible source of information bias, especially when it is previously discussed that reported vaccination intent seems to be underestimated in surveys [48] . In addition, the current study is challenged by the character of the study population and its design. The cross-sectional design of the study poses some limitations to the validity of its results due to the difficulty to exclude confounders. Furthermore, almost all participants had at least a high-school education, the fact that could limit the generalizability of the results due to possible selection bias. Nevertheless, it could be argued that the majority of the Lebanese population is literate and thus the sample is more or less representative to the general population. Further bias could have also occurred due to the fact that the study did not take into consideration measuring the economic situation of the participants, although it is previously discussed how gross domestic product creates Covid-19 vaccination inequity [49] . This is the first study that explored vaccination intent in relation to belief in conspiracy theories in the context of infodemics.",

In response, in April of 2020, WhatsApp restricted message forwarding to only a single contact if a message had been shared with 5 users [56] as a means to control the spread of misinformation [57] . Facebook put warning labels on approximately 50 million COVID-19-related articles to also help in combating COVID-19 mis/disinformation, in addition to removing harmful content, and a new notification screen that provides context to the articles that are shared [58, 59] . Instagram has also taken a step in the same direction through \"removing COVID-19 accounts from account recommendations, removing COVID-19 related content from the Explore page unless posted by a credible health organization, and downranking content that has been rated false by third-party fact checkers\" [60] . These active reforms of social media platforms in collaboration with the WHO should be emphasized to continuously monitor and respond to fake news [61] . Similarly, the Royal Society of Public Health in England warns about the harms of spreading fake news in social media and urged for certifying the social media platforms that relying on credible source of information and not on popularity [62] . One should take into consideration to question the reliability of information not only on social media but even that information disseminated through some scientific journals with the pressure to publish and use of unverified non-peer reviewed preprints [63] .",

The danger of the infodemic should be acknowledged and firm measures should be put forth; this includes considering strict measures such as prison sentences issuance, as that taken by the government in Peru against those who create and share fake news [64] . Furthermore, when it comes to designing prevention strategies, it would have been interesting to explore the engagement of users in social media platforms according to the nature of messages and to explore the exposure and the vulnerability of the population to fake news and their engagement in social media networks according to socio-demographics, values and belief system to compare with results observed using content analysis of posts on social media platforms [65] . However, engagement in our sample (posting and liking information) was surprisingly low and thus belief in conspiracy was expressed in terms of self-reported data on a Likert scale and not in terms of actual posting, liking or sharing information. Moreover, it would have been of value to study more in depth the drivers of believing in the conspiracy theories as suggested by previous research [66] , however our study did not show significant correlation with socio-demographic groups except for age. While addressed in a recent study in Italy [67] , the role of mechanism of search behavior in social media is still not clearly understood; and this could be a topic of importance to discuss in future studies. Moreover, future studies could try to further understand the role of the socio-political factors in shaping willingness to vaccinate, as previously reported in a study about how politicization affect COVID-19 vaccination intent in France [68] .
