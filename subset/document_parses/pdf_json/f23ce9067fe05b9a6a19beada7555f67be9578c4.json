Conversely, IL-6 also works as a neurotrophic or tissue repair mediator regarding neuroprotection (5) . Therefore, the inhibition of IL-6 potentially makes the central nervous system vulnerable to various types of damage resulting in leukoencephalopathy. In addition, the combination of tacrolimus administration may worsen the disruption of the blood brain barrier and thereby increase the toxic effect of TCZ (6) . Prior MTX administration may be one of the potential causes of leukoencephalopathy, however, this is thought to be less likely because of the long range from discontinuation of MTX and the symptoms. TCZ induced leukoencephalopathy is rare (7, 8) , and this is the first case report that showed an improvement of both the symptoms and in the MRI findings after TCZ withdrawal. Comparing the reported TCZ-induced leukoencephalopathy cases including ours, the common MRI findings may be the diffuse high intensity on fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) with the laterality of the lesions. However, it is unclear that the present case showed improvement of lesions only in the right frontal lobe. The accumulation of further cases, and more frequent MRI or neurological examinations are required to clarify the mechanisms of TCZ-induced leukoencephalopathy.",
