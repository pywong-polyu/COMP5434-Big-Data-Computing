However, data on the kinetics of antibodies 3 months post-vaccination are currently lacking and are important to drive the future vaccination strategy. The CRO-VAX HCP study is an ongoing multicentre, prospective and interventional study designed to assess the antibody response in a population of healthcare professionals who had received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Two hundred individuals underwent a blood drawn within 2 days before the first vaccine dose. One-hundred and forty-two persons (71%) were categorized as seronegative at baseline while 58 (29%) were seropositive. Samples were then collected after 14, 28, 42, 56, and 90 days. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein were measured in all individuals at different time points. Using a one-compartment kinetics model, the time to maximum concentration was estimated at 36 \u00b1 3 days after the first dose and the estimated half-life of antibodies was 55 days (95% CI: 37-107 days) in seronegative participants. In seropositive participants, the time to maximum concentration was estimated at 24 \u00b1 4 days and the estimated half-life was 80 days (95% CI: 46-303 days). The antibody response was higher in seropositive compared to seronegative participants. In both seropositive and seronegative subjects, a significant antibody decline was observed at 3 months compared to the peak response. Nevertheless, the humoral response remained robust in all participants.",

Several studies have reported on the humoral response in vaccinated subjects but the results were only available after one administration of the vaccine and if the response after the second dose was evaluated, the follow-up of the participants was limited, i.e. below 3 months [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, a longer follow-up period is needed to assess the antibody kinetics in individuals after a two-dose regimen of BNT162b2. These data are important, especially since the question about a third dose has been raised by the pharmaceutical industries which will led to important societal, logistical and economical consequences.",

Nevertheless, it is important to notice that all participants still had a robust antibody response at 3 months. Moreover, the vaccination with BNT162b2 elicited much higher antibody titres at 3 months compared to the titres collected in serum from convalescent patients using the same assay (i.e. Roche Elecsys anti-S pan-Ig assay) [8, 9] . Using the half-lives derived from the kinetics model, we could predict a drop below the positivity threshold (i.e. 0.8 U/mL for anti-S) after 554 days for seronegative and after 1184 days for seropositive individuals. These predictions remain to date speculative and will need to be confirmed by subsequent sampling times but this could help to design vaccination strategies [10] . The aim is to keep sufficient antibody levels to protect vaccinated subjects against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 but also the related variants, which have all demonstrated some forms of immunity escape [10] . It has also been demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies better correlate with protection against infection than global serological testing and this may also serve in the future as a biomarker to ensure a proper protection at the patient's level [11] . A high correlation (r > 0.86, P < 0.001) between the anti-S assay from Roche Diagnostics and a surrogate virus neutralization assay was found [12] . However, a limitation of this study included the lack of measurement of neutralizing capacity measurement. Data about the contribution of the cellular immune response are also missing.",

In a population of 33 healthy adults having received the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine and followed up to day 209, the estimated half-live was 52 days (95% CI: 46-58 days) using an exponential decay model [13] . In a cohort of 188 unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (mostly not hospitalized: 174/188) who were followed for up to 8 months, the antibody half-life was 83 days (95% CI: 62-126 days) [14] . All these results were consistent with the results obtained in this study in both seronegative (i.e. 55 days, 95% CI: 37-107 days) and seropositive participants (i.e. 80 days, 95% CI: 46-303 days). Because the 95% CI are overlapping, we cannot conclude that half-lives are different between seropositive and seronegative participants. This study (EudraCT registration number: 2020-006149-21) has a planned follow-up of two years, with the next blood sampling campaign planned in July 2021. This will permit further refine the kinetics model and to provide a better estimate of the antibody response in both seropositive and seronegative individuals.",
