            "text": "Current evidences in resuscitation of adult sepsis have pointed to the importance of types of crystalloid fluid-related complications on resuscitation outcomes, but evidences are lacking in pediatric populations. In this study, the authors aimed to compare outcomes of pediatric sepsis resuscitation with different types of crystalloid. They randomly assigned pediatric sepsis patients requiring fluid bolus into three groups to receive either normal saline solution (NSS), Ringer lactate solution (RLS), or Sterofundin as fluid bolus therapy. Forty-two patients were included in the study. Median age was 29 mo and, weight 13 kg. After fluid bolus, the complications were not different among groups. However, in the RLS group, the patients who received large dose of the fluid showed significant reduction in urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) level. It is concluded that fluid bolus therapy with different types of crystalloid solution did not result in different outcomes but large dose of RLS was associated with greater reduction of uNGAL level, compared to other fluids.

In adult populations, there is a growing body of evidence that shows that balanced salt solution may have superior benefits as compared to unbalanced normal saline in resuscitation of both medical and surgical patients, especially when used in large amount. However, direct evidence in pediatric sepsis populations is scant. The present study aimed to report evidence for the use of balanced salt solution in pediatric populations with sepsis in comparison to normal saline. The primary objective of the study was to compare acid-base status after fluid bolus therapy with different types of crystalloid fluid. The secondary objective was to compare other PICU outcomes.",

This study was conducted from November 2016 to November 2019 after intensive review from the Institution Review Board, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bankok, Thailand. Informed consent was obtained from parents before randomization. After randomization, patients were divided into three groups to receive study fluid bolus [normal saline solution (NSS), Ringer lactate solution (RLS), or Sterofundin] in 10-15 min as resuscitation. Data from initial, 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h after fluid bolus were collected. Urine sample immediately after randomization and at 2 h after resuscitation was collected for urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) analysis [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . All data were analyzed using SPSS version 22.",

Similarly, previous retrospective studies in pediatric population with sepsis [10, 11] also pointed toward the same conclusion. The present study added prospective randomized, controlled trial data in this specific group of pediatric sepsis population, supported these recommendations, and made evidence slightly more solid. However, the present study had several limitations, as this was a small study, using small doses of fluid bolus, and the significant results of the present study were mostly laboratory data and biomarkers, not clinical outcomes.",
