Methods: We did a real-world, prospective observational cohort study where recruited high-school students and staff from two high-schools in Montreal (Canada) were followed from January 25 th to June 10 th , 2021. Twenty-five percent of asymptomatic participants were tested weekly by RADT (nasal) and PCR (gargle). Class contacts of a case were tested. Symptomatic participants were tested by RADT (nasal) and PCR (nasal and gargle). The number of cases/outbreak and number of outbreaks were compared to other high schools in the same area. Results: Overall, 2,099 students and 286 school staff members consented to participate. The overall RADT's specificity varied from 99.8 to 100%, with a lower sensitivity, varying from 28.6% in asymptomatic to 83.3% in symptomatic participants. The number of outbreaks was not different in the 2 participating schools compared to other high schools in the same area, but included a greater proportion of asymptomatic cases. Returning students to school after a 7-day quarantine, with a negative PCR on D6-7 after exposure, did not lead to subsequent outbreaks, as shown by serial testing. Of cases for whom the source was known, 37 of 57 (72.5%) were secondary to household transmission, 13 (25%) to intra-school transmission and one to community contacts between students in the same school. Conclusion: RADT did not perform well as a screening tool in asymptomatic individuals. Reinforcing policies for symptom screening when entering schools and testing symptomatic individuals with RADT on the spot may avoid subsequent significant exposures in class.",

Diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is predominantly based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which has a turnaround time (TAT) of 24-48 hours. Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) were used for years to diagnose other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. These tests detect the presence of a specific viral antigen and are usually performed on nasopharyngeal or nasal specimens. RADT are relatively inexpensive and can be used at the point-of-care. Their performance characteristics vary, but they usually have high specificity and moderate sensitivity compared with PCR [3] [4] [5] [6] . Given their rapid TAT, RADT allow for efficient triage, management and cohorting of exposed individuals 7 . The potential use of RADT is especially relevant in school settings, where COVID-19 outbreaks can interrupt in-person teaching, contribute to social isolation and negatively impact learning [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

RADT sensitivity was reported with a range from 28.9% to 98.3%, with improved RADT sensitivity in samples with high viral loads and in symptomatic individuals, with a specificity of 99.5% 16, 17 . PCRs' usual limits of detection (LOD) is 600-1000 viral RNA copies/ml, whereas RADTs usually have LOD 2-3 logs higher (10 5 to 10 6 ) 18 . Many studies have indicated the importance of high viral load dynamics with infectiousness and transmissibility 19, 20 . There is a strong correlation between cycle threshold (Ct) values and the ability to recover infectious virus and thus transmissibility: for each unit increase in Ct value, the odds of recovering infectious virus decreased by 0.67 being under 10% when Ct-values were > 35. Ct values of 17 to 32 corresponded to 10 5 and 10 1 SARS-.

We cannot infer whether PCR positive individuals were contagious. The study was performed before the advent of the delta variant in our region. Because RADT detects the N protein, we expect that its sensitivity and specificity would not be affected negatively, as viral loads of delta variant infections are reported to be higher 35 .

However, RADT does not perform well as a screening tool in asymptomatic individuals. In our study, teenagers were able to adequately proceed to self-collection of gargle specimens and nasal swabs, while supervised by a trained research assistant. It may be helpful to reinforce policies for symptom screening when entering schools, where symptomatic individuals, including students or staff could be tested with RADT on the spot. This would avoid subsequent significant exposures in class but would also allow students to attend school if symptoms were due to other viruses. A negative RADT could still mean that symptoms are due to SARS-CoV-2, but with a viral load too low to be detected and therefore less likely to transmit at that moment.",

The authors described the peak of RADT sensitivity as high as 100% on day 2 post symptoms onset, with a subsequent decrease to 56% by day 5.

Supplemental Appendix A : Sample size calculation As the school populations were fixed in size, we determined the precision with which we would be able to estimate our primary outcome. Given the non-linear nature of the epidemic process and the complexity of the quarantine and testing policies proposed, it was not possible to estimate precision through a direct calculation. We therefore implemented an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate through simulations the number of tests that would be performed, the likely results of the tests, and other outcomes of interest in planning the study (e.g. number of days in school, number of secondary infections). We implemented a variation of a previously described school-based ABM to adapt the characteristics of the school 29 . For simplicity, we did not model household transmission explicitly, although we did allow for infection outside of the school.
