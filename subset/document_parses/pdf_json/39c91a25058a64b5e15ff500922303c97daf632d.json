Apremilast is a recently approved drug, belonging to the small molecule phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, whose optimal safety and efficacy profile is somewhat affected by slow activity rate in clinical trials. Real world case series are suggesting a more consistent improvement, and with this additional personal investigation on 48 patients, we signal that 58% of patients achieved PASI50, and 19% PASI75 improvement in the first 8 weeks of treatment. Results at 16-week are remarkable, with overall 55% of patients achieving PASI 75, 21% PASI 90 and 14% PASI 100. Only 8 patients (18, 6%) had slightly improved, although satisfied with the regimen, and determined to continue. Noteworthy, our population was rather problematic in terms of comorbidities (86%), and resistance to other treatments, with only 28% na\u00efve to systemics, including biologics. Moreover, the observation period includes the Italian outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic, and further information on apremilast safety are provided, no one of the patients having stopped treatment. In such a critical period, the apremilast satisfactory speed of therapeutic response in a real-world setting has further strengthens patient's compliance to remain safely at home, which is the best strategy to limit contagion.

Thus, a study was conducted in a real-world setting at the Dermatology Clinic of the University of Cagliari to investigate the short-term clinical rate of response: at 8 and 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoints were efficacy and safety for difficult-to-treat areas and challenging comorbidities. Data collection was initiated in December 2019, and two months later, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak emerged, spreading across Italy and raising concerns about the risk of contagion and severity of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients. 4 Thus, enhanced surveilla nce has been arranged in this cohort of patients, advising them to continue the treatment and contact the psoriasis service on noticing the occurrence of any symptoms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 289, "end": 290, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 557, "end": 559, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 560, "end": 561, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1252, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical efficacy, speed of symptom improvement, and safety of apremilast for the treatment of adult psoriasis during the COVID-19 pandemic"}, {"text": "Forty-eight patients were recruited after they provided informed consent to participate in the study, comprising 25 men and 23 women, with a mean age of 59 years (range, 20-82).

Regular telephone recalls were performed to assess whether patients had discontinued taking the drug or had contracted COVID-19. We followed current experts' opinion 9 that apremilast is one of the safer options for moderate-to-severe psoriasis management due to its very specific, nonimmunosuppressive mechanism of action. Recent experience in a COVID-19 disease affected patient, who maintained apremilast treatment during the bilateral pneumonia course and recovered completely, confirms safety and compatibility with critical patient's management. 10 Exacerbation of psoriasis might have occurred as a consequence of stress burden, with the COVID-19 pandemic conferring severely limited wellness and opportunities to relieve anxiety and mood disorders through social activities. Of course, COVID-19, as well as certain medications currently used to control the disease, might exacerbate psoriasis, as recently reported. 12", "cite_spans": [{"start": 952, "end": 954, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical efficacy, speed of symptom improvement, and safety of apremilast for the treatment of adult psoriasis during the COVID-19 pandemic"}, {"text": "In this very critical period, the satisfactory speed of the therapeutic response to apremilast in a realworld setting has further strengthened patient compliance to remain safe at home and led to patients eventually enduring the initial side effects, although further studies are warranted to explore this topic.
