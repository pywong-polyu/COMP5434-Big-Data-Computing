Since November 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in over 102 million cases worldwide, 1 with 25 million confirmed cases in the US. 2 A respiratory infection that can be spread from person to person, COVID-19 may present with a range of mild to severe symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath. Individuals at a heightened risk are believed to be older adults and those with preexisting underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and respiratory illnesses. 3 The Centers for Disease Control identified people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLWH) as a population that may be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared with those of the general population. 4, 5 Data regarding the actual disease risk among PLWH is lacking. D'Souza et al distributed a telephone survey to asses symptom and testing prevalence to 3411 patients, of whom 61% were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. Symptoms were similar among HIV-positive and negative patients; however, a higher percentage of PLWH tested positive for COVID. 6 These data differs from other reports displaying PLWH have similar positivity rates. 7 PLWH are a unique population with uncertain and conflicting data regarding their risks for COVID-19 making it critical for healthcare professionals to truly understand how the HIV epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic comingle and affect one another.",

Aside from health complications, PLWH can also be confronted with further challenges including mental health, substance abuse, and societal stigmas creating a complex syndemic when occurring simultaneously with COVID-19. 10 In order to ensure optimal health outcomes and maintain viral load suppression rates during this global pandemic in PLWH, it is critical to prevent lapses in care, and ensure adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Viral load suppression is both an individual and public health concern as patients on ART with undetectable viral loads preserve their health and significantly reduce the risk of transmitting the virus along with other opportunistic infections.",

Additional baseline characteristics can be found in Table 1 . In addition, the lack of data regarding chronic disease states management other than HIV was identified as a limitation.

It This study provided evidence that pharmacy services including telehealth may be an option to collaboratively manage PLWH in order to maintain virologic suppression rates when in-person visits are not feasible or safe. It is believed that the refill authorizations performed by the clinical pharmacists, which included adherence assessments, prevented gaps in medication use and likely contributed to the nonstatistical difference in viral loads pre-COVID and post-COVID.",

SORBERA ET AL. 3When medication refill requests were submitted, the clinical pharmacists would perform thorough medication reconciliations and chart reviews, and order and assess laboratory work when appropriate in order to send electronic prescriptions and/or provide recommenda-tions to the provider. This was done for all 211 patients. As the clinic is composed of close to 1000 patients with approximately 45% being seen in the interdisciplinary model, 211 is not the total number of patients. It is likely that the remainder of patients had a sufficient supply of medication, including ART, as stable patients are commonly prescribed a 3-month supply. For refill authorizations, patients were frequently contacted by the clinical pharmacists to assess adherence and determine if laboratory work was needed or feasible. In general, laboratory work was only required for patients who had a recent history of ART non-adherence or detectable viral loads. The pharmacists entered a telephone and/or order-only encounter into EPIC for all 211 medication refill requests. For patients who completed audio-only or audiovisual telehealth visits, the patient care process was implemented through the established CPA. During interdisciplinary or pharmacotherapy visits, the clinical pharmacists would collect or verify any necessary information including but not limited to medication list and health/social histories, perform assessments, and develop and implement a patient-specific drug therapy plan. 4 | DISCUSSION In March of 2020, The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) released interim guidance for COVID-19 in PLWH, which has been periodically updated throughout the pandemic. This guidance states that telehealth services can replace face-to-face encounters for nonurgent care and adherence counseling, which was encouraged at the PATH Center. In addition, PLWH that are stable with suppressed viral loads should have routine in-person visits postponed to the extent possible. 12 This study highlights the potential impact of pharmacy services including telehealth on maintaining HIV RNA suppression rates. Although the DHHS guidance states that any planned switch in ART should be delayed, the clinical pharmacists at the PATH Center were able to collaboratively and safely transition regimens through the utilization of telehealth services without negatively impacting viralload suppression. This was not common practice and was done usually in the setting of safety and/or efficacy concerns. Additionally, as the guidance recommended postponing clinic visits when appropriate, patients were asked to present in-person to the clinic only if laboratory work was needed. It should be noted that post-COVID lab work likely occurred after an interaction with either a provider or clinical pharmacist as orders needed to placed following a patient assessment to determine the necessity. Generally, CD4 counts are obtained less frequently than viral loads at 3-12 months intervals depending on duration of viral load suppression and previous CD4 counts. Optional monitoring of CD4 count can be considered in those patients who have a CD4 count greater than 500 cells/mm 3 with consistently undetectable viral loads for at least 2 years. 13 Patients who had a lymphocyte panel obtained during the post-COVID time period were more likely to have uncontrolled or newly controlled HIV and therefore lower CD4 counts. This is evidenced in our findings by the lower number of lymphocyte panels obtained post-COVID, and the statistically significant differences in CD4 cell counts and percentages when comparing pre-COVID and post-COVID periods. Spinelli et al preformed a similar study were the investigators evaluated viral suppression rates after telemedicine was instituted due to shelter-in-place mandates in San Francisco. In comparison to pre-COVID-19, viral load suppression rates had a considerable decrease. The odds of viral nonsuppression increased by 31% during the pandemic despite telemedicine visits. The investigators stated that while telehealth visits offer patient convenience, it may result in less access to clinic-based social support services. Within this study, 16% of patients were homeless and were found to have higher odds of unsuppressed viral loads during the pandemic. 14 Although differing from our study results, the coexistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and HIV/AIDS epidemic is being highlighted revealing the increased in disease burden PLWH are likely experiencing. Limitations of this study include being retrospective and singlecentered, having a short follow-up time period, and having a decreased number of patients included in the post-COVID analysis. The long-term impacts of HIV management may not have been captured as post-COVID data were only collected between March and July 2020. If a patient had their ART modified during the study, the impact of this change may not have been observed. Also, mainly patients with uncontrolled HIV or a recent history of nonadherence",

Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the clinic, televisits were done by a provider and/or pharmacist limiting the ability to solely measure the impact of the pharmacist. Although visits were done by either a provider, pharmacist, or both, all 211 refill authorizations were completed by the pharmacists. The thorough chart reviews and constant communication required for authorizations is believed to have impacted patient adherence and suppression rates; however, there is a lack of objective data to confirm. Approximately half of the patients requesting refills completed a telehealth visit by a provider and/or pharmacists. It is likely that a portion of the patients who did not complete a televisit were relatively stable and had their visit extended to a later date. The continuity of care achieved and maintenance of viral load suppression rates allowed this vulnerable population to potentially have a reduction in risk factors associated with complications of respiratory or opportunistic infections.",

Institutional review board approval was deemed unnecessary by the institution.On and after March 13, 2020, several clinical interventions were implemented at the PATH Center to allow for a streamlined transition from in-person visits to virtual services. For medication authorizations, the nursing staff would forward refill requests to the clinical pharmacists through EPIC, the electronic medical record used by the PATH center. An EPIC inbox was created at the beginning of the pandemic allowing the PATH Center pharmacists to have access to one centralized inbox. Under a collaborative practice agreement (CPA) previously implemented, the clinical pharmacists would then review the patient chart, perform medication reconciliation, order and assess labs, provide recommendations, and e-prescribe medication. When needed, interventions were discussed with the provider and all encounters were documented within the EMR. Patients who required additional management of chronic disease states such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and anticoagulation were either managed in the virtual interdisciplinary visit or referred for a virtual pharmacotherapy visit. For telehealth or telephone encounters, Signal and GoogleVoice were used at the beginning of the pandemic which then transitioned to Doximity by May 2020. With Doximity, the clinic was able to use iPhones, iPads, Android devices, or a computer to connect with patients on a secure platform for telehealth visits. Clinical pharmacists utilized an accepted \"incident-to\" physician billing model, based on a facility fee, with a 99 212 level, or problem-focused visit.
