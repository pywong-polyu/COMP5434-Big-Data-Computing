In this article, we present a potential application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare and physical distance monitoring for pandemic situations. The proposed framework consists of three parts: a lightweight and lowcost IoT node, a smartphone application (app), and fog-based Machine Learning (ML) tools for data analysis and diagnosis. The IoT node tracks health parameters, including body temperature, cough rate, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation, then updates the smartphone app to display the user health conditions. The app notifies the user to maintain a physical distance of 2 m (or 6 ft), which is a key factor in controlling virus spread. In addition, a Fuzzy Mamdani system (running at the fog server) considers the environmental risk and user health conditions to predict the risk of spreading infection in real time. The environmental risk conveys from the virtual zone concept and provides updated information for different places. Two scenarios are considered for the communication between the IoT node and fog server, 4G/5G/WiFi, or LoRa, which can be selected based on environmental constraints. The required energy usage and bandwidth (BW) are compared for various event scenarios. The COVID-SAFE framework can assist in minimizing the coronavirus exposure risk.",

By implementing better systems for surveillance, healthcare, and transportation, contagious diseases will have less chance of spreading [3] , [4] . An IoT system, combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), may offer the following contributions when considering a pandemic [5] : 1) improving public security using surveillance and image recognition systems, 2) utilizing drones for supply, delivery, or disinfection, 3) contact tracing and limiting people's access to public places through apps and platforms empowered with AI. An IoT system for healthcare is typically composed of many sensors connected to a server; it gives realtime monitoring of an environment or users. In a pandemic, AI-assisted sensors can be used to help predict whether or not people are infected with the virus, based on signs such as body temperature, coughing patterns, and blood oxygen levels. Tracking people's geolocation can be another useful feature. During the outbreak of a contagious disease, tracking the distance between people can provide valuable information. Using technologies, such as Bluetooth, we can get a reasonable estimate of how much distance people maintain when walking in public places. This data can be used to warn people who are not physically distanced within a specific range, 2 m for example [6] , of a person, and thereby, potentially prevent further transmission of the virus. During the development of such platforms, it is also crucial to consider security and data management thoroughly to prevent abuse of personal information [7] , [8] . Governments may try to use these platforms and information for permanent surveillance after a pandemic to control and track people's behaviors.",

This process can be performed in many ways, each having its pros and cons although providing accurate estimations. A global positioning system (GPS) uses large power consumption. However, GPS accuracy can be severely degraded based on the position of a receiver and satellites, especially indoors [17] . The work in [18] has demonstrated the feasibility of using the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to locate the user in an indoor environment. The user carries a mobile which is connected to the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). The mobile sends a signal to several fixed position access points (APs), which are then fused using a Center of Gravity algorithm to locate the user. Chawathe [19] conveys the usage of Bluetooth beacons for geolocation tracking. Bluetooth is used everywhere from smartwatches to phones, but one problem of using this technology is the reflection of its signals, which makes it difficult to acquire accurate distance estimations. In [20] , a low-power tracking method for IoT systems is proposed. It uses an orientation sensor and accelerom-eter for geolocation tracking to reduce the use of GPS, which requires less power consumption. Recently, Apple and Google announced that they would be using Bluetooth for contact tracing of iOS and Android users [21] . Users can turn it on or off, and the data would only be given to trusted health authorities that follow specified privacy policies.",

The results are provided for five times a training algorithm with VOLUME 8, 2020 shuffling data based on hold-out validation (70% train-30% test) in Table 4 . Fig. 8 illustrates two examples of fuzzy rules and shows a risk of 0.79 and 0.07 for two people aged 45, with different genders, and similar shortness of breath. The first person has a low fever, and his cough rate is higher than the other persons. It is worth noting that the estimated rules in the fuzzy interference system may not be ideal and can be extended and modified over time based on received feedback. The closed-loop system requires more data and could be addressed in future work. Table. 5 shows scenario-specific activities with power requirements for the various activities measured at the laboratory. According to the measured power, we can quantify the overall energy demand based on scenario-specific activities. Smartphone app power analysis shows that 25 mA is used for all processing in the cellphone. The bandwidth requirement is based on a one-second volume of data generated by the PPG sensors and voice data at the specified sampling rate.",

Fig. 9 shows the hourly energy requirement for different transmission intervals; No Network and Scenario-2 require almost the same amount of energy, while Scenario-1 requires less than half of that as there is no offline processing in the IoT node itself. Since the node may need to be carried during only part of the day, the daily energy requirement will also vary depending on the duration of the operation. Scenario-1 is shown on a different scale for better visualization of the changes with transmission intervals. Fig. 10 shows the energy requirement for various durations of daily operation using 15-minute transmission intervals. It also shows that local processing requires more than double the energy, compared with that required to send the unprocessed data over the wireless link.",

On the other hand, Scenario-2 might be a better choice for rural areas with a lack of cellular network coverage. Therefore, the energy requirement can be reduced by increasing the data-transmission interval mainly for outdoor operation of the node. Table 6 provides a summary of recent similar systems available to fight COVID-19 with the help of digital technology. As shown the proposed COVID-SAFE system presents a more complete IoT framework than others and can be used to control the infection after the pandemic. Many countries have implemented contact tracing apps, which are similar to the one shown in [21] . However, these apps merely trace a patient's history and location, and notify users if anyone has contracted COVID-19 in the places they have recently visited. On the other hand, the proposed system provides hardware, sensors, and software (ML and mobile apps), which offer many other benefits, as shown in the table.",

The proposed system integrates a wearable IoT node with a smartphone app, by which the IoT sensor node can collect a user's health parameters, such as temperature and blood oxygen saturation, and the smartphone connects to the network to send the data to the server. The paper proposed a Radio Frequency (RF) distance-monitoring method which operates both for indoor and outdoor environments to notify users to maintain the physical distancing. Applying ML algorithms on body parameters makes it possible to monitor participant's' health conditions and to notify individuals in real time. A voice coughing-detector continually monitors the user's voice and records the number and severity of coughing. The fog-based server is implemented to process received data from an IoT node using a cellular network or LoRa connection. In addition, locally processing the data makes it possible to use the IoT node in the environments without internet connectivity or fog-based networks. The system can assist participants in monitoring their daily activities and minimize the risk of exposure to the Coronavirus.
