It is purported that the COVID-19 aftermath has resulted in losses that cannot always be encapsulated using this method. In search of reasoning, models and theories that explain the sweeping mass destruction that COVID-19 has caused, key concepts arise in terms of how we should deal with losses and in turn support patients in the health and social care sector, (notwithstanding formal therapeutic services). There is a crucial need to embrace ambiguous loss and disenfranchised grief into everyday terminology and be acquainted with these issues, thereby adapting how services/clinicians now embrace loss and grief work. Integral to this process is to recognize that there has been a disproportionate impact on Black and minority ethnic communities, and we now need to ensure services are \"seriously culturally competent.\" Primary Care services/IAPT/health and social care/voluntary sector are all likely to be at the forefront of delivering these interventions and are already established gatekeepers. So, this article discusses the prognostic therapeutic response to non-death related losses and grief, not restricted to the formal echelons of therapeutic provision.",

Grief is frequently defined as the normal response to loss (12) . Yet it is often inferred that death is not the only loss, but the only loss that legitimizes a grief reaction. According to Harris (1), a loss can be defined as an experience where there is a change in \"circumstances, perception or experience, \" and the individual is unable to return to a previous state. Her analogy of a shattered piece of glass that can be mended but never exists is useful in describing how loss is experienced. The idiographic positioning of the interpretation of loss in this definition is precisely what is needed to formulate the wide array of experiences that COVID-19 has inflicted on the population. Traditional approaches to grief have largely focussed on death and relational separation. The use of memory boxes and \"digital death\" literature posited important perspectives of keeping the \"memories alive\" or \"celebrating the life and contributions, \" they made to the idiographic journey. Digital methods of grief are particularly useful in helping young people grieve (13) . The use of storytelling, reframing and creating a narrative of the deceased is considered a way of coping (14) . The use of rituals around death have long been appraised and promoted to process death (15) . Some of these interventions may have a place in formal therapeutic junctures and create some processing of unresolved losses related to COVID.",

            "text": "There have been multiple complex and nuanced understandings of grief. Grief has been conceptualized as a disease (16) and as as a series of stages in time (17, 18) . Kubler Ross (19) famously formulated a five-stage theory of grieving based on her work talking to dying patients in a hospice setting. Although widely critiqued as presenting a simplistic and linear understanding of grief this model is widely used within therapy and has greatly influenced many practitioners' understanding. A preferred model is the Dual Process Model (20) which proposes that grief involves the individual in two separate but interrelated modes of grief. These are a \"loss orientation\" mode when the focus is on acknowledging and processing the emotions of grief and a \"restoration orientation\" mode when the focus is on engaging in coping with the world without the support of the deceased. Hence, the individual oscillates between periods of emotion and remembering and adjusting their lives. This model is preferred in terms of therapeutic psychoeducation or indeed managing COVID-19 related grief as it draws attention to the fact that isolation and lockdown have not only challenged individuals to process the emotions of grief without the physical presence of the extended family, friends, and professional support systems. This is epitomized by a new legal limit in the number of mourners at a funeral. However, it is also important to note that there have also been abundant challenges to restoration, requiring the bereaved to negotiate a world that is greatly altered without the support of those they loved.",

Doka (21) defines disenfranchised grief as grief that results when a person experiences a significant loss and the resultant grief is not openly acknowledged, socially validated, or publicly mourned. In a time when many are grieving the unanticipated death of loved ones, others may feel inhibited and disenfranchised from expressing the grief they feel at not being able to visit living relatives, particularly those who are frail elderly and/or in residential care. Indeed, Sudnow (22) , emphasized the concept of social death, in which the person is alive but treated as if dead. It is very easy to postulate that many individuals are feeling socially dead due to enforced restriction of social contacts currently. Another interrelated concept is that of ambiguous loss (23) . This is a loss that occurs without closure or clear understanding. A commonly cited example is that of a spouse of a person with dementia, who is both with and simultaneously without, their partner. The loss of a relationship during COVID can similarly be conceptualized as ambiguous grief as the loved one is both living but unavailable to normal contact. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that there are liberating losses (24) when people experience feelings of relief, freedom, or happiness when society expects sadness and distress. This may relate to an acknowledgment of the end of suffering after the ambiguous loss of caring for someone with dementia but may also be experienced when COVID restrictions have prevented the necessity of visiting the sick and dying.",

His seminal work, Western Attitudes Toward Death from the Middle Ages to the Present, presents four key periods in the past millennium. He documents an abrupt change in the mid 18th century when death becomes othered and dramatized. He highlights how family and friends have been enabled to mourn and freely display emotion from this time (27) . Death separated the living from the dead and the living were consoled through memories and mourning. He then shows how death became more hidden and shameful in the 19th century and was increasingly associated with old age. Indeed, the majority of people began to die in hospital with shielding of information about the death to spare the bereaved from emotional turmoil. Jacobssen (28, 29) proposed a fifth, more recent phase of spectacular death, where death and mourning have increasingly become spectacles, with a strong urge to create memories and memorials, both physical and digital for those who have died. Walter (30) draws attention to the way that dying, funerals, mourning and afterlife beliefs are continually evolving and that we must evolve new ways to manage dying, funerals and mourning. Walter (30) highlights how containing grief and emotion can be psychologically and socially necessary in high death rate situations and societies whilst expressing them can be productive in times of peace and security. The challenges presented by COVID-19 as death again occurs sequestered in hospitals but mourning and grief are continually being discussed in the public sphere and the living are confronted with multiple ambiguous losses embedded in restrictions to everyday life within a multicultural society (31) .",

Studies are well averse to the aspect that ambiguous loss and disenfranchised grief in people can take a toll on their livelihoods, often undetected and minimized as \"life-changes.\" Prior attempts to capture difficulties in response to change have been encapsulated by \"adjustment disorder\" and focus on behaviors rather than the root cause. In psychiatry, the diagnosis of \"Prolonged Grief disorder\" (34) or \"Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder\" (35) , is fairly new. Prigerson et al. (36) developed a psychometric validity of criteria where there is a heightened risk of persistent \"distress and function.\" PTSD and the relationship with grief are considered yet, the psychological measures unless used in conjugation with grief measures do not necessarily look at loss. A history of losses can be mesmerized by depression and anxiety disorder, the patient not disclosing the losses and the therapist working on symptomatology. Nevertheless, Diagnostic Criteria for DSM-5 Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder and ICD-11 Prolonged Grief Disorder criteria focus on the loss of a significant other by death. Harris (1) posits that in non-death losses the term chronic sorrow is more appropriate and points out key differences between the terminology. Inevitably, it means the presentations of COVID-19 losses in the form of chronic sorrow will need to be detected by front line workers and probably treated by primary care or voluntary sector talking therapy provision.",

The usual psychiatric evaluation or clinical presentation may need to be more investigative in nature, particularly where the presentation of the individual may be taciturn or morose. Not all individuals who experience grief and loss will likely be assessed or even formally diagnosed by a psychiatrist-many of these individuals will rely on a good formulation in psychological services and support from the wider health and social care services. Using a variety of psychological measures to triage, such as the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) instead of usual trauma measures should be given due consideration (37, 38) . All very well where there is grief, but more is needed in terms of designing psychological measures for the impact of COVID and less considered losses.",

The authors acknowledge that COVID-19 and BLM (Black Lives Matter) has given rise to the debate around whether the term BAME is suitable (51) . The contention around this terminology is ongoing, however, it is important to note that academically it is useful at this stage to use the term in accessing literature on the topic. The current revival of \"lay' and secularized practices of keeping loved one's memories alive including children are resurfacing in therapeutic responses to death. Every therapeutic community or service must develop rapid systems to embrace the aftermath of COVID related presentations and predict new ways of working. These in turn mean a review of how current responses to grief and loss may differ over the coming years, a bio-psycho-social consideration is much needed.",

Chaudhry et al. (54) postulate that the 64% BAME National Health Service (NHS) employed staff may have been deployed into high virus areas which resulted in disproportionate deaths. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the disproportionate impact on BAME families cannot be underestimated, \"not only have Black, Asian and minority ethnic people been overexposed to contracting COVID-19, but the economic impact of the pandemic is also likely to disproportionately affect these communities too\" [(55), p. 5]. Sze et al. (56) in a systematic review concluded that individuals of Black and Asian ethnicity are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and Asians may be at higher risk of ITU admission and death. Specifically, the Racial Disparities Unit (RDU) found an alarming impact of COVID-19 on Bengali and Pakistani communities mainly due to multi-generational households (57) . There is a disproportionate rate of deaths in these communities which must be considered and catered for, rather than the usual homogenisation of BAME communities.",

Empaths across the world, charity workers, keyworkers and religious aid all stepped up to buffer against losses. Despite the critique, in the UK there were pockets of financial support available to businesses, homeowners and employers. Yet, developing countries relied on spiritual strength and versatility to be resilient. The kind acts of individuals and organizations, and some infrastructure, have inspired hope and compassion. These altruistic human conditions serve as antidotes to the manifold losses experienced during the pandemic and must be acknowledged. Trzebi\u0144ski et al. (59) posited that the key ingredients to being resilient in the pandemic were, (1) the influence of meaning in life, (2) life satisfaction, and (3) assumptions on world orderliness and positivity, all of which will result in lower stress and anxiety responses. How society will respond long term to the losses of COVID is yet to be determined. All models of grief acknowledge that grieving takes time. Klass et al. (60) highlight the need for continuing bonds with the deceased to support healthy grieving and resilience. It may be that society will need to develop civic forms of national memorialisation or that a more individualized approach will be more beneficial in the long term. However, the restoration orientation of Stroebe and Schuts model (20) highlights that the cost will not just be emotional but in enabling everyone in society with the skills to reorientate to a post COVID world.",

The Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) is not a part of IAPT indicators, and there is now a pressing need for this to be included (36) (37) (38) . Furthermore, the identification of traumatic loss as part of a PTSD formulation is the best way to encapsulate the current paradigm and apply it to existing resources.

The target-driven services may have to adopt this method of delivery where loss is concerned.

Harris (1) makes important recommendations on supporting a person through loss and \"shattered dreams\" and avoiding the \"get over it and move on\" Western approach to non-death losses. This is likely to be a lifelong adjustment to loss, and the target-driven services may have to adopt this method of delivery where loss is concerned. Harris posits that training programs that focus on \"curing\" and \"fixing\" individuals are ineffective. The need for a validating and compassionate response where the clinician is present with the client is emphasized. A transdiagnostic and relationally driven model of assisting post-COVID generation needs to be developed for those who experienced loss is key to developing an understanding, and treatment packages for this population. Humphrey and Zimpfer (12), using a counseling approach, have presented useful methods to assess grief using the bio-psycho-social model, including spiritual and philosophical reasoning, and duly considers past \"losses\" to gain an understanding of current interpretation using a timeline approach. Losses across the lifespan may be key in understanding idiosyncratic responses to COVID\u221219, and this method of formulation presents intrigue and a focus on what is unanswered for the individual. The work of Humphrey and Zimpfer (12) is appraised to include the impact of anticipatory grief, and traumatic grief because of murder for example.",

The work of Mueller (79) in CBT traumatic grief is noteworthy. She recognizes the impact of COVID and embraces this into CBT. Rosner et al. (80) consider the application of CBT to complicated grief and this again can be adapted to COVID-19 losses. Working with the patient to stabilize, explore, and confront the most painful aspects of the loss are encouraged. Comprehensively, they posit a cognitive behavioral treatment manual for complicated grief disorder (CG-CBT) of 25 individual sessions. The longevity of treatment may be a concern in the implementation where shorter-term CBT or counseling therapy is considered in primary care services at least. Shear et al. (25) proposed a 16-session model of Complicated Grief Therapy (CGT), which may be a preferred protocol and proved more effective than interpersonal therapy in the RCT.",

The need to be culturally competent due to the disproportionate impact on BAME communities is pressing. Planning mainstream services and responses to COVID losses for BAME communities need to be embedded in service development and not an afterthought (see Table 1 ). We now need prognostic therapeutic approaches to ensure loss and grief interventions are not limited to death alone and be adaptive to the COVID generation. Essentially, the therapeutic costs of COVID-19 \"loss and grief \" are idiosyncratic, and therefore the treatment of it remains at the intersection of therapeutic understanding by service providers and employers.",
