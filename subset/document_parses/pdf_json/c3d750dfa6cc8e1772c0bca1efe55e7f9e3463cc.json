A recent repurposing effort has identified ebselen, a multifunctional drug candidate as an inhibitor of Mpro. Our docking of ebselen to the binding pocket of Mpro crystal structure suggests a noncovalent interaction for improvement of potency, antiviral activity and selectivity. To test this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized ebselen derivatives aimed at enhancing their non-covalent bonds within Mpro. The inhibition of Mpro by ebselen derivatives (0.3 \u03bcM) was screened in both HPLC and FRET assays. Nine ebselen derivatives (EBs) exhibited stronger inhibitory effect on Mpro with IC 50 of 0.07-0.38 \u03bcM. Further evaluation of three derivatives showed that EB2-7 exhibited the most potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with an IC 50 value of 4.08 \u00b5M in HPAepiC cells, as compared to the prototype ebselen at 24.61 \u03bcM. Mechanistically, EB2-7 functions as a noncovalent Mpro inhibitor in LC-MS/MS assay.",

The SARS-CoV-2 gene encodes a viral 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro, also known as Mpro) that controls coronavirus replication [3, 4] . Mpro is a cysteine protease containing a catalytic center responsible for specific enzymatic cleavage and serves as a target for antiviral drugs [4] [5] [6] . Based on the catalytic activity of Mpro, a widely used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay has been adapted for screen of various peptidomimetics and small molecules that show as Mpro inhibitors within a micro-to nanomolar range [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Interestingly, ebselen also forms a covalent bond with Cys145 and hydrogen bond with Glu166 (Fig. 1B) in the binding pocket that is consisted of residues His41, Met49, Phe140, Cys145, Ser144, His163, Met165 and Glu166.

The A series maintained the benzene group at N1 position. We chose a series of substituent group with different electrostatic potentials and electron density distribution, such as amino, hydroxy, methoxy, trifluoromethyl and halogen at para-or meta-position. The B series used pyridine with lower electron density distribution to replace the benzene.

As shown in Fig. 3 , molecular docking suggests that substituting 3-methoxyphenyl (EB2-7), 3-fluorophenyl (EB2-9) and 3-fluoropyridin-4-yl (EB2-19) group can increase the distance between the Se atom of ebselen derivatives and the Cys44 of Mpro with additional hydrogen bonds formed between the carbonyl groups and their surrounding residues His41 or Ser46. Moreover, the methoxy group of EB2-7 and fluorine atom of EB2-9 also forms hydrogen bond with Thr24 of Mpro, thus leading to their higher inhibitory activity on Mpro, as compared to ebselen. Among the three compounds, EB2-19 exhibits the most potent inhibition on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, likely due to the increased water solubility by the introduction of pyridine group. However, the hydrophilic EB2-19 may not easily pass across cell membrane, which may explain its weak antiviral activity. Except ebselen, EB2-7, EB2-9 and EB2-19, other ebselen derivatives were also tested to explore their structure-activity relationship. Four ebselen derivative (EB2-1, EB2-3, EB2-14 and EB2-20) containing amino groups were fitted into the binding pocket of Mpro. As shown in Figure S11, the bond distances between Se atom of EB2-1, EB2-3, EB2-14, EB2-20 and Cys44 of Mpro were 3.4 \u00c5, 3.6 \u00c5, 4.3 \u00c5 and 4.6 \u00c5, respectively. The amino groups of EB2-1, 2-3 and 2-14 can form hydrogen interaction with surrounding Thr25 of Mpro but not EB2-20, indicating that EB2-20 had a relatively weaker inhibitory effect on Mpro (Table 1) .",
