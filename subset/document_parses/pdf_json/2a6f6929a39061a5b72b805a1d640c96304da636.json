The main predictors of willingness to use telemedicine in the future were the necessity of using such services during lockdown, preference for going to a clinic, and satisfaction with telemedicine, alongside gender and having a chronic illness. Importantly, we found that a preference for visiting the clinic was negatively correlated with willingness to use telemedicine in the future. Education and being single were predictors of the change of mind regarding telemedicine. Participants with chronic conditions are more likely to use these services, and specific attention should be directed to their needs. A small portion of the study sample prefers live appointments with a physician.",

The synchronous method's major advantage is the efficacies gained by eliciting relevant details during the session by seeking additional information or data, and in many cases providing a clinical diagnosis or advice within the session. The ATA defines asynchronous telemedicine as \"store-and-forward transmission of medical images and/or data because the data transfer takes place over a period of time, and typically in separate time frames. The transmission typically does not take place simultaneously.\" This type of telemedicine is provided via a virtual clinic to which the patient does not need to come physically, but maintains communication with the health care provider in her own time through phone calls, video calls, and written correspondence.",

However, in the oldest age group (75 and above), only 43% reported using these services. Overall, around 60% of the study participants (N = 331) reported having used telemedicine. Jaffe et al. (16) noted that digital technology access and use has increased dramatically in the last decade among older adults. Therefore, despite the differences in the usage of various age groups, the fact that digitalization is becoming a part of regular life may eliminate the barrier to telemedicine use.",

Studies have found strong correlations between willingness, intent, and behavioral expectations (32) . Our findings show that gender and chronic illness are correlated with participants' willingness to use telemedicine in the future. Specifically, around 82% of males and 73% of females agreed that they would continue to use telemedicine in the future.

Around 80% of chronically ill participants agreed that they would continue to use telemedicine in the future vs. 73% of those not chronically ill, which is consistent with Edwards's et al.

The necessity of using telemedicine and satisfaction therewith positively correlates with willingness to use them in the future, while going to a clinic was negatively correlated with this intention. One possible explanation for these results stems from the premise of planned behavior theory (33) , according to which positive or negative attitudes toward a given action can predict one's intention and behavior. Accordingly, during the outbreak, some of the participants were already familiar with telemedicine. As a result, they expressed a high level of satisfaction with and willingness to use telemedicine in the future. The same reasoning can be applied to those participants who preferred to go to a clinic: Despite the lockdown, these participants were entrenched in their habit, were less satisfied with telemedicine services, and accordingly expressed no intention of using them in the future.",

The lockdown rapidly changed the picture, as most participants were compelled to use telemedicine as a nearly exclusive alternative. We propose that this impelled behavioral change triggered a change in participants' attitudes toward telemedicine, thus increasing their willingness to use it in the future.

As a small yet still significant portion of participants prefers a live meeting with a physician, it is also essential for HMOs to facilitate specific encounters based on this expectation, alongside identifying barriers to patients' using telemedicine. As telemedicine's use is dramatically increasing, there is a need to disseminate information about each service's availability and its use, and its advantages over face-to-face appointments.
