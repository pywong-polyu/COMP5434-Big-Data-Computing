However, the need for RNA extraction complicates testing due to increased processing time, high cost, and limited availability of commercial kits. Therefore, alternative methods for rRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 without RNA extraction were investigated. Nasopharyngeal and sputum samples were used to compare the sensitivity of three techniques: Trizol RNA extraction, thermal shock, and the direct use of samples with an RNase inhibitor. Direct, extraction-free use of primary samples plus the RNase inhibitor produced diagnostic values of 100 % sensitivity and specificity compared to standard protocols, and these findings were validated in a second, independent laboratory.",

            "text": "The high transmission rate and case counts demand fast, affordable, and efficient diagnostic tests that provide reliable results at low cost to patients who are suspected of having the disease (Smyrlaki et al., 2020) . Real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) is the standard diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 (WHO, 2020). Samples collected for rRT-PCR are processed by a number of methods to extract the viral RNA prior to converting it to cDNA with reverse transcriptase, and then PCR for specific SARS-CoV-2 targets using various primer-probe sets WHO, 2020) . Currently, the time required for SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis and the shortage of reagents are limiting factors in large-scale COVID-19 diagnosis in the population. Diagnosing the virus without RNA extraction and purification steps reduces the time required for sample preparation and amplification, the cost for molecular testing, and the potential for human error. Several studies have detected the virus in saliva, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swab samples without RNA extraction, some of which have noted a decreased sensitivity (Beltr\u00e1n-Pavez et al., 2020; Fomsgaard and Rosenstierne, 2020; Smyrlaki et al., 2020; Vogels et al., 2020) . This could be due to the high content of RNases in these samples that degrade the genetic material of interest (Pandit et al., 2013) . To address these limitations, this study described the standardization and validation of protocols for alternative sample processing techniques prior to SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR, using detection methods with and without RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal and sputum samples. Specifically, we evaluated two different extraction protocols, two extraction-free protocols, and two different rRT-PCRs using nasopharyngeal and sputum samples, and the best-performing protocol was then evaluated at a second laboratory. Our aim was to obtain a protocol that could be used regardless of the type of sample (nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples), and that proved to be reproducible.",

However, there are several factors that can interfere in the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2. For instance, detection can be compromised as SARS-CoV-2 virus may not be stable in these solutions and the genome can be easily degraded by RNases . In this regard, our results showed that direct amplification without RNAse inhibitors significantly increased Ct values by an average of 3.59 cycles. Hence, the use of RNAse inhibitor helps protect the viral genome and preserve detection of the virus in samples with low viral loads. Furthermore, our study presents a direct detection technique that can preserve the sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (100 %) of rRT-PCR reactions when performed without dedicated extraction. This technique likely relies on the detection of RNA from cell-free virus in the sample matrices, and it can be used on nasopharyngeal and sputum samples, thereby eliminating the time and reagents necessary for RNA extraction. Additionally, the cost of Table 1 Sensitivity of RNA extraction and extraction-free techniques using nasopharyngeal and sputum samples. Results of amplification with detection kit of Sun Yat-sen University and in-house rRT-PCR targeting N gene for all samples. RNA extraction using a commercial kit was 12.42 USD per sample in Ecuador at the time of the study, and the cost of RNase inhibitor was 0.22 USD per sample. Therefore, our direct technique represents a significant reduction in the costs of detection. Several studies have tried different thermal shock protocols as an extraction-free technique to detect SARS-CoV-2 (Beltr\u00e1n-Pavez et al., 2021; El-Kafrawy et al., 2021; Fomsgaard and Rosenstierne, 2020; Pearson et al., 2020; Smyrlaki et al., 2020) . Based on these data, we tested two different thermal shock techniques. Our results showed that these techniques, regardless of the temperature or the duration, increased the Ct values by more than 2.9 cycles and had reduced sensitivity (below 90 %). Previous studies have reported sensitivity values ranging from 51 % (Beltr\u00e1n-Pavez et al., 2021) to 91.4 % (Smyrlaki et al., 2020) when nasopharyngeal samples have been treated Fig. 1 .

Hence, samples with lower viral load at baseline suffer from RNA degradation during heating, which could end up reported as false-negative.",

This method uses a combination of proteinase K and thermal shock to bypass RNA extraction. However, results showed a loss in sensitivity as their Ct value increased 1.8 cycles. As mentioned above, our results from thermal shock protocols showed an increase of more than 2.9 cycles. Conversely, our direct technique presented an increase of 1.4 cycles, while maintaining 100 % sensitivity. These results suggest that proteinase K is somehow helping in the thermal shock reaction. The relative benefits of these two techniques may, therefore, depend on reagent availability and the workflow requirements in each laboratory.",

This difference has been previously reported on samples from patients in Wuhan , and can be explained as a competition between the loci of the target genes . Therefore, we considered a positive result when at least one target gene presented a Ct value below 40. A separate study with lentivirus compared Trizol RNA extraction and a commercial viral RNA extraction kit (Won et al., 2020) . Our study used a similar approach, and our results showed that samples processed with Trizol had similar Ct values and a 96 % sensitivity compared to a commercial RNA extraction kit. Nonetheless, this Trizol technique still requires time and reagents in order to extract RNA.",
