In particular, the linear Hawkes process has been well studied and widely used in practice because of mathematical tractability. However, in some contexts, a Hawkes model is not applicable because data is recorded in a discretetime scheme or an aggregated way. Thus, a discrete-time Hawkes model is appealing for applications. In this paper, we study large and moderate deviations for a discrete-time marked Hawkes process first proposed in [XZW20].",

Hawkes processes originate from statistical literature to model the occurrences of earthquakes and shocks after earthquakes, see [VJ75] . In contrast to a standard Poisson process, the intensity of Hawkes process depends on its entire history, which can model the self-exciting or clustering effect. In finance, most applications of Hawkes processes are about high-frequency trading [BH09, CDM12] . Furthermore, Hawkes processes have been used to model credit default and the arrival of company defaults in a bond portfolio [EKS13, GGD11] . Recently, Hawkes models have been applied in social networks. For example, [FSS + 16] modelled the rate of sending email for each officer at the West Point Military Academy. The more applications of Hawkes process can be found in seismology, neuroscience, cosmology, ecology, and epidemiology. For a list of references for these applications, see [BT07, Zhu13b, Lin09] .",
