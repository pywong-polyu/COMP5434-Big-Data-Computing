Considering the barriers suffered by immigrants and non-English-speaking families, we tested whether children with a preferred language other than English was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children from families with a preferred language other than English had a higher predicted probability of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.76; 95% CI, 2.07-6.67) during the first wave of the pandemic. This discrepancy continued into the second wave (adjusted odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.10-2.41), although the difference compared with families who prefer to speak English decreased over time. These findings suggest that children from non-English-speaking families are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and efforts to reverse systemic inequities causing this increased risk are needed.",

In a descriptive analysis of patients tested in the University of Washington medicine system early during the pandemic, the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was 4.6-fold higher among patients with a preferred language other than English than English speakers. 8 Similar findings were reported in patients of a large not-for-profit health-care system in the western United States, as having a primary language other than English was associated with a 2-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections. 9 Using data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Figueroa et al. 10 found that the factor most associated with elevated community risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was the proportion of foreign-born, non-U.S. citizens. Foreign-born individuals also had elevated proportionate mortality rates compared with individuals born in the United States, in an examination of death files in California. 11 Similar findings have been reported in other countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada. 12, 13 Together with our results, these studies highlight the disproportionate burden of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for immigrant families and families who prefer a language other than English, and support continued calls for large-scale interventions to reverse systemic inequities for those families.",

Language barriers may prevent identification of appropriate testing sites. 16 Other factors, such as distance to testing sites, need for an appointment, or perceptions that insurance or citizenship is needed, may also complicate an individual's ability to get tested. 15 Depending on immigration status, immigrants may avoid seeking medical care for fear of being deported. 10, 17 Immigrants may be excluded from unemployment or insurance benefits, and the financial ramifications of a positive test may be significant for individuals working for an hourly wage. 10, 15 These factors may prevent prompt presentation for care. In the absence of a positive test, these individuals are less likely to quarantine, preventing control of the spread of COVID-19. 15 Finally, lack of access to language-concordant public health information may allow misinformation to spread and increase risk of virus transmission. 17 To address these issues, every effort should be made to conduct large-scale studies of the impact of language on the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 17 Language data are often not collected during testing, and language is not a demographic field required by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 18 Improving the collection and tracking of preferred language will continue to be critical for testing processes to optimize contact tracing efforts and provision of individual guidance. More refined language data will also assist with targeted efforts to vaccinate individuals who prefer a language other than English.",

Efforts should be made to improve availability to testing for SARS-CoV-2, including locating testing sites in affected communities. Last, efforts should be made to ensure that immigrants and non-English-speaking persons are included in vaccination rollouts. This will require continued engagement with these communities to identify possible barriers to vaccination and to work to encourage vaccine uptake. 19 There are several limitations to this study. We compared positive tests from patients within a single health system within the United States. Our cohort was composed primarily of Blacks, and those with a preferred language other than English spoke Spanish predominantly. These findings may not be generalizable to other populations or clinical settings in the United States or other countries. In addition, we only captured positive test results from a single health system, and testing results in this study may not reflect the true positivity rate in our community. Although there are known limitations in how language is recorded in the EHR, 20 the higher SARS-CoV-2 positivity we observed among children whose preferred language was not English is consistent with greater infection rates reported in such communities. 6, 8 EHR data generally under-identify patients whose preferred language is other than English-meaning, limitations in how language is recorded in the EHR would bias our results toward the null.",

We identified disproportionately elevated SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in children from families with a preferred language other than English, which is consistent with reported findings in adults in the United States and other Englishspeaking nations. As we continue to track and address the disproportionate impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on historically underrepresented and marginalized communities across the globe, it will be important to track disparities experienced by communities who speak languages other than English. Including such communities in risk mitigation strategies is not only the equitable approach, but also one that will assist in overall efforts to curb the pandemic and prepare for future pandemics.",
