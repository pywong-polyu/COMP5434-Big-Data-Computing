            "text": "In a recent issue of this Journal, Politzer, Shmueli, and Avni estimate the economic costs of health disparities due to socioeconomic status (SES) in Israel (Politzer et al., Isr J Health Policy Res 8: 46, 2019). Using three measures of SES, the socioeconomic ranking of localities, individual income, and individual education, Politzer and colleagues estimate welfare loss due to higher mortality, productivity loss due to poorer health, excess health care treatment costs, and excess disability payments for individuals with below median SES relative to those with above median SES. They find the economic costs of health disparities are substantial, adding up to between 1.1 and 3.1 billion USD annually-between 0.7 and 1.6% of Israel's GDP. This paper is useful and informative. It is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive quantification of the economic costs stemming from health disparities in Israel. In spite of many social policies designed to level economic opportunity and social welfare generally, by most measures, Israel is among the most unequal in the distribution of income among all OECD countries (Cornfeld and Danieli, Isr Econ Rev 12:51-95, 2015). Politzer and colleagues expose the magnitude and sources of health-related loss that Israel faces because of such inequality and shows how the costs of inequality are borne to some degree by all members of society. This short commentary discusses the complicated relationship between SES and health and puts the findings from Politzer and colleagues in the context of the international literature on the subject.",

There are multiple pathways through which SES influences health, including its impacts on individual health behaviors and lifestyles, exposures to environmental stressors and toxins, and access to health care [6] . Going a step further, the SES-to-health model argues that SES is a fundamental cause of health because it embodies all of the resources one has available to avoid risks and minimize the effects of diseases [7] . The second dominant model sees the causal arrow as running in the other direction. The social selection model argues that poor health, due to genetics or one's environment, negatively affects SES and is responsible for the inverse association.",

Dohrenwend and colleagues' insight was that ethnicity, an element of SES, cannot be an effect of a psychiatric disorder. Thus, conditional on non-ethnic measures of SES (education and occupation in the paper), higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Israelis of North African descent relative to Israelis of European descent supports the SES-to-health model and, in particular, the marginalization of North Africans in Israel causing higher rates of psychiatric disease.",

Consider just the causal effects of education on mortality. The relationship between education and mortality has been the subject of numerous quasi-experimental studies that exploit changes in compulsory schooling laws in the US [9] [10] [11] , Sweden [12, 13] , the UK [14, 15] , the Netherlands [16] , and France [17] . Some studies find higher education substantially lowers mortality rates [9-13, 15, 16, 18 ], yet others find education has no effect [14, 17, 19] . In a recent review of the education and mortality literature, Galama, Lleras-Muney, and van Kippersluis conclude that there is not a single causal effect of education on mortality but that there is strong evidence for an effect of education on mortality in certain times and in certain places [20] . Similar debates in the literature rage over the extent to which income [21] [22] [23] and income inequality are causally related to health [24, 25] .",

Accounting for this, Politzer, Shmueli, and Avni also made conservative assumptions that offset this and might underestimate the costs of health disparities.

However, as this commentary describes, such causal effects vary according to the nature of the disease being considered and the precise context in which the causal effect was estimated. Politzer, Shmueli, and Avni's work takes a step back from this puzzle and shows us that under a reasonable set of assumptions, the costs of health disparities in Israel are large in magnitude. After-tax income inequality is high in Israel realtive to other OECD countries [29] . Policymakers should consider the economic costs of health disparities when evaluating the merits of policies that would lessen or exacerbate existing inequalities.",
