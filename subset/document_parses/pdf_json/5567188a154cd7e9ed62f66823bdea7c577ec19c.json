A stochastic agent-based model of COVID-19 intracellular dynamics is introduced here, that incorporates essential steps of the viral life cycle targeted by treatment options. Integration of model predictions with an intercellular ODE model of within-host infection dynamics, fitted to patient data, generates a generic profile of disease progression in patients that have recovered in the absence of treatment. This is contrasted with the profiles obtained after variation of model parameters pertinent to the immune response, such as effector cell and antibody proliferation rates, mimicking disease progression in immunocompromised patients. These profiles are then compared with disease progression in the presence of antiviral and convalescent plasma therapy against COVID-19 infections. The model reveals that using both therapies in combination can be very effective in reducing the length of infection, but these synergistic effects decline with a delayed treatment start. Conversely, early treatment with either therapy alone can actually increase the duration of infection, with infectious virions still present after the decline of other markers of infection. This suggests that usage of these treatments should remain carefully controlled in a clinical environment.

These include the structural proteins that make up the virus: the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the spike (S) protein, as well as the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Fig. 1a) . N protein forms a complex with the genomic RNA (gRNA), and thus aids its compaction for ease of packaging within the viral envelope. The S protein binds the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor on human cells and is therefore essential for cell entry. The model also includes non-structural proteins that are important for the viral life cycle, such as the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC), and keeps track of the numbers of gRNAs (and subgenomic sgRNAs) at different stages of the replication process. These include both the original plus-sense template of the RNA molecules, as well as their negative-sense variants that arise transiently during transcription. There are nine negative-sense sub-genomic RNAs (-sgRNAs), corresponding to different gene products. In particular, there is an individual one for each of the structural proteins, allowing the virus to produce these components in the different quantities required for formation of viral particles [5].",

Here we provide a brief summary of the main reactions. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. The former is translated from the open reading frame ORF1a, and the latter from the overlapping reading frames 1a and 1b [23] via a -1 ribosomal frameshift during the translational elongation step. The relative frequencies of occurrence of the ribosomal frameshift is a key mechanism of self-regulation of protein expression of the virus and hence an important parameter in our model, which is captured by the frameshift probability q [44].",

(-)sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription [16], where elongation of nascent (-)RNA continues until the first functional transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) is encountered. A fixed proportion of RTCs will disregard the TRS motif and continue to elongate the nascent strand, while the remainder will halt synthesis of the nascent minus strand and instead synthesise (-)sgRNAs [49] . The nine TRS motifs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome correspond to the nine sgRNAs produced, hence the choice to elongate or terminate synthesis occurs up to nine times during the elongation process [38] . The (-)RNA and (-)sgRNAs produce positive-sense RNAs by recruiting RTC. The sgRNAs are translated to form proteins using cellular ribosomes. In the final step, a gRNA and the structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) form a new virion according to an assembly reaction that takes the stoichiometry of the different viral components into account [5], and the virus particle is then released from the host cell. 2/17 3/17 6/17 15/17",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a recently emerging infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [40] . After outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, and of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, this is the third outbreak of a coronavirus since the turn of the century. Mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission at the population level have been instrumental in controlling the spread of the virus, but a detailed understanding of within-host infection dynamics is still lacking. Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus in Group IV of the Baltimore classification of viruses. Compared with other single-stranded (ss)RNA viruses, coronaviruses have the longest genomes. The smallest RNA viruses, for example, are only \u223c 1-4kb in length, and HIV has two copies of a \u223c 10kb genome, whilst the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a positive-sense, ssRNA molecule of \u223c 30kb. As a consequence, the viral life cycle of coronaviruses is distinct from most other ssRNA viruses, and existing intracellular infection models, e.g. for hepatitis C virus [4] , cannot be applied here. Therefore, we introduce here a novel intracellular model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, that incorporates essential steps specific to coronaviral life cycles. This model enables us to study in detail the viral dynamics inside an infected cell, and provides a framework to study the impacts of antiviral treatments on the infection dynamics within an infected cell. In particular, it enables us to quantify the impact of different treatment options on the viral load that is secreted from an infected cell.",

The model has been parameterised with data from 12 patients from a study in Singapore [58] , enabling us to generate a generic profile of disease progression in patients that have recovered from the disease. Model predictions agree well with experimentally and clinically measured parameters such as the duration of the incubation period, suggesting that this scenario is representative of disease progression seen in COVID-19 patients. We then use this model to study the infection dynamics in patients with different levels of immune responses by varying parameters associated with the immune response, such as the proliferation rates of effector cells and antibodies, and the rate by which effector cells remove infected cells. Comparison of different scenarios is based on tissue damage and viral load, highlighting the impact(s) of antibodies and adaptive cell-mediated immune response on infection dynamics.",

            "text": "This provides a framework in which to compare the impacts of different forms of antiviral therapy and assess their synergies. We focus here on two prominent forms of therapy against COVID-19: remdesivir, that inhibits virus production within an infected cell [7] , and convalescent plasma (CP) therapy, whereby CP derived from recently recovered donors is transfused to the patients as an additional support [18] . Recent studies have concluded that remdesivir is an effective antiviral treatment option for COVID-19 [7] . However, the rapid spread and novel nature of the disease make the detailed evaluation of effective treatment protocols difficult. Using mathematical models enables us to study in detail the effect of the drug remdesivir on viral load in a COVID-19 infection. Gon\u00e7alves et al. used a \"target-cell limited\" model to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infections [26] . They showed that if drugs such as remdesivir are administered very early, this may help control viral load, but may not have a major effect in severely ill patients. Iwanami et al. also introduced a mathematical model to describe the within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated that late timing of treatment initiation can mask the effect of antivirals in clinical studies of COVID-19 [34] . However, none of these models have included the impact of the immune response directly into their model, which plays an important role in the outcomes of the infection. In order to analyse different aspects of viral dynamics, studying the interactions between viruses and the immune system of the host is crucial [45, 3] . In this work we take the impact of the immune response on infection dynamics into account to perform a more robust analysis of different treatment options. Regarding the CP therapy several studies performed in various countries have shown that this treatment is effective against COVID-19 infections and its safety has been well established in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) on a large population [18, 36, 35, 2, 57, 24, 37] . However, finding the optimal dose and time for CP therapy is still debated [18] . Our intercellular model provides insights into the effects of different dosages and treatment starts in terms of infection-related quantities for CP therapy and this supports efforts in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For example, increasing the ribosomal protein production rate (SI Fig. S3a ) or the RTC nucleotide association rate (SI Fig. S3b ) decreases the time lag and therefore increases the number of virions released. By contrast, variation of the half-life of RTC or the formation rate of RTC from the constituent proteins does not have a significant effect on the time lag (SI Fig. S3c and d) . Figure 1b shows the time lag to the release of the first virion from an infected cell as a function of the ribosomal frame shifting probability q, and of the RTC elongation probability r. Figure 1b indicates that decreasing r results in a rapid increase in the time lag: for example, when r = 0.55 and the virus produces many sub-genomic fragments, this time lag is longer than 200 hours. This implies that viral load is maximised for the scenario that the RTC favours continuation of the transcription process when encountering a TRS. Given the importance of frameshifting in the coronavirus life cycle to control the relative numbers of different viral components, it has been argued that the virus will have evolved to optimise this ratio. In particular, frameshift signals have been characterized experimentally previously to have efficiencies in the range of 20-45% [6, 9, 31, 48] , although a recent study has suggested that the frameshift rate may be slightly higher [32] . Our model identifies an optimal value of 0.3 < q < 0.5 as the range with the lowest time lag and hence maximal virion release (Fig. 1b) , in good agreement with the experimentally determined range of 20-45%.",

During the replication process, RTC may insert remdesivir molecules instead of adenosine, resulting in capping of the strand and thus terminating replication [59] . We have included additional reactions into the model that describe remdesivir binding to the RTC complexes on the gRNAs and sgRNAs to capture this (see SI for details), and track the effect of a given, fixed number of remdesivir molecules per cell on the release of viral particles from an infected host cell.",

In Fig. 1c , a free concentration equivalent to 25 remdesivir molecules per cell is considered, corresponding to a concentration of \u223c 0.06 \u00b5M (see SI) [27] . The black solid curve indicates the viral load in the absence of treatment as a control, computed as an average over 200 stochastic simulations of the model. Magenta (long-dashed), green (dotted), red (dashed-dotted), and orange (dashed) curves show the impact(s) of treatment start at TPIs of 50, 30, 20, and 10 hours, respectively. Figure 1c demonstrates that starting treatment during the latent period reduces the total number of virions released significantly. Even given a later treatment start the rate of virion production is slowed down, but the earlier treatment is started, the stronger the reduction in the virion production rate. Our results are consistent with experiments that probed the impact of remdesivir on mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection [1] , which also revealed that starting treatment earlier and during the latent period is more effective, as is the case also in other betacoronviruses. Figure 1d shows the impact of doubling the drug concentration (equivalent to a concentration of 50 molecules of remdesivir per cell). In this case, starting treatment early during infection at 20 hours post infection reduced the number of virions released on average by more than half. However, starting treatment later in the infection, such as 30 or 50 hours post infection, decreases the number of released virions by a smaller fraction. This suggests that although an increased drug concentration can be beneficial, starting the treatment earlier is more effective at reducing viral load than an increase in dosage.",

We integrate results from this model into an intercellular model of within-host infection dynamics in order to probe the impact of the adaptive immune response on disease progression both in the absence and presence of antiviral therapy. Uninfected target cells (T ) are assumed to follow logistic growth with proliferation rate r T and carrying capacity T m . Inclusion of growth capacity of uninfected cells is important, because SARS-CoV-2 is detectable 4/17 in patients over 20 days after the onset of symptoms [60] , comparable to the time taken to regenerate the epithelium (up to 1 month [55] ). Uninfected cells are infected by free virions at rate \u03b2 . Although infected cells in the latent phase probably die at a somewhat lower rate than productively infectious cells, we assume that all infected cells die at approximately the same rate, \u03b4 , in order to minimise the number of free parameters that would complicate parameter estimation. Our intracellular model shows a time lag between infection of a host cell and the first release of new virions, consistent with experimental observation [5] . This effect is included into our intercellular model via a latent phase (L) with a lifetime defined as 1/\u03b3, where \u03b3 denotes the average transition rate from the latent to the productively infectious (I) state, i.e. when the cell sheds viral particles. The intracellular model also shows that virions are effectively released linearly in time.

Antibodies are produced at rate p A proportional to the viral load and are degraded at rate d A . After viral clearance, the antibody level is kept at a homeostatic level, because of the long-lived plasma and memory B cells. To represent this, we add a logistic term with proliferation rate r A and carrying capacity A m to the antibody equation. A fixed basal level of effector cells is assumed (\u03bb E /d E ), and upon infection the population of effector cells will expand at rate \u03b1(L + I)E [11, 29, 22] . L and I both have an impact on the immune response, because infected cells during the latent phase are producing viral proteins.

As \u03bb E /d E is the basal level of effector cells, it is assumed to be constant for each patient [11] . Thus, \u03b1 and \u00b5 are parameters that are likely varying in different patients. In particular, they would be expected to be lower in immunocompromised patients than for a patient with a healthy immune system [11, 28, 14, 22] . Figure 3d (red curve; see also SI Fig. S5 ) demonstrates that although reduction in the value of \u00b5 can increase the damage to healthy cells (T ) slightly, this effect is much stronger when reducing \u03b1 (Fig. 3g , blue curves). Even though decreasing either of these parameters causes a slower decline in viral load after the second peak ( Fig. 3e and h) , a smaller value of \u03b1 in addition increases the maximum of both peaks. Figures 3j,k,l (magenta curves in SI Fig. S5 ) model the case where just the humoral immune response is weakened, i.e. where the proliferation rate of antibodies r A is reduced [13] . In this case, viral load shows three peaks, and the damage to healthy cells recovers only slowly. This demonstrates that each component of the immune response plays a different, and crucial role in the recovery process. In particular, in immunocompromised or elderly individuals who have a weakened immune response, this could lead to significant tissue damage, with infections lasting much longer than for non-immunocompromised patients.",

As our intracellular model (Figs. 1c and d) suggests that starting treatment in the latent period is most effective, and would effectively block the production of virions, we set \u03b3 = 0 at the onset of treatment. This means that infected cells in the latent phase (L) do not transition to phase I, and begin shedding virions at a reduced rate (following a time lag \u03c4) compared with cells that were already in phase I at the onset of treatment. However, as our numerical results show that the delayed model (SI Fig. S6 ) has the same behaviour as the model without a time delay, i.e. \u03c4 = 0, (Fig. 3) , we set \u03c4 = 0.

Cells in phase L produce virions at the reduced rate of p(1 \u2212 \u03b5). Our intracellular model ( Fig. 1c and d) suggests that starting therapy during the latent period can reduce the level of virions released by \u223c 99% on average. We thus assume \u03b5 = 0.99 for the efficacy of remdesivir in cells in phase L. This is a good approximation, as all values of \u03b5 calculated from Fig. 1c are above 98%, regardless of treatment start time. Cells that were already in the productively infectious phase (I) at the time of treatment start are assumed to produce virions at rate p(1 \u2212 \u03b7), where \u03b7 \u2264 \u03b5 is the efficacy of remdesivir in these cells. Figure 1c indicates that starting therapy during the productively infectious period can reduce the level of released virions by \u223c 90% on average. Therefore we set \u03b7 = 0.9.

In this generic scenario, a treatment start 7 days post infection (dpi), which is approximately the time of the first peak in viral load, prevents the second peak from occurring (black dashed lines in Fig. 3 ). An earlier treatment start at 6 dpi also leads to the same result. However, starting treatment even earlier at 5 dpi (black dash-dot lines in Fig. 3 ) also reduces the damage to healthy cells. Even though free virus declines slower in this case, the area under the viral load curve (AUC), an infection-related quantity commonly used to help the assessment of a treatment against acute viral diseases [52] , is much smaller. In respiratory infections, even after viral clearance the immune response can cause respiratory and systemic symptoms in some incidences [52, 33] . A treatment start at 5 dpi results in a reduction in the peak of immune response cells, suggesting that early treatment perhaps could mitigate against this.",

We assume that these antibodies remove virions at rate k f , where 0 \u2264 f \u2264 1, implying that they are at most as efficient as the antibodies that are being developed by the body over the course of infection.

Our model enables the impact of CP therapy on viral dynamics to be studied for different treatment starts and doses, thus addressing the bottle-neck pointed out in the recent literature of finding the optimal dose and start for CP treatment [18] . Using again median values from Table 1 to generate a generic patient profile as a control, and using three immunocompromised cases that are presented in Fig. 3 (red, blue, and magenta curves, representing cases with reduced values for the immune response parameters \u00b5, \u03b1, and r A , respectively) we studied the impact of CP therapy. SI Fig. S7 shows the minimum level of therapeutic antibodies\u00c3 m that is needed to reduce the AUC by 25% and 50% as a function of the start of treatment (in dpi) and the factor f by which therapeutic antibodies are less efficient than those produced by the host during the infection. It indicates that the level of\u00c3 m that is needed for an effective reduction in the AUC is at most around 3 \u00d7 10 11 molecules/ml. This is in good agreement with clinical data, reporting a 200 ml dose of CP and A m = 4 \u00d7 10 12 molecules/ml (see Materials and Methods) [18, 50, 13] . Indeed, this implies that each dose would contain about 8 \u00d7 10 14 molecules, resulting in\u00c3 m = 2.6 \u00d7 10 11 molecules/ml on the basis of an average level of 3 liters blood in the body [43] . Hence, a reduction of the AUC by 50% is achievable. SI Fig. S7 also shows that AUC reduction is comparable in the range 0.7 \u2264 f \u2264 0.9, therefore we use the average value of this range ( f = 0.8) in our calculations. Our conclusions are robust for efficiencies \u2265 0.15, while for values of f below 0.15, the outcomes vary for different immunocompromised cases. Using these parameters, we present a comparative analysis between antiviral and CP therapy and explore their synergistic potential. Figure 4 shows that similar to the case of antiviral therapy in Fig. 3 , an early treatment start is more effective in the reduction of tissue damage and the level of AUC compared with a later therapy start (cf. SI Fig. S8 for the equivalent of Fig. 3 for CP therapy, cf. Table S3 for AUC values). While Fig. 3 reveals scenarios in which an antiviral therapy does not mitigate against tissue damage (such as a later treatment start at 6 or 7 dpi), Fig. 4 shows that using CP therapy can reduce tissue damage even for those delayed treatment starts. Interestingly, Fig. 4 shows that starting CP therapy early can increase the duration of infection more than for antiviral therapy, implying that for an early treatment starts using remdesivir 9/17 is more effective. By contrast, for later treatment starts CP therapy reduces the viral load faster and decreases tissue damage compared with remdesivir therapy. Our model also enables us to probe the synergies of these treatments options. Figs. 4c, f, i, and l indicate that for an early treatment combination therapy mitigates against a longer duration of the infection (cf . Table  S4 for AUC values). However, for later treatment starts any synergistic effects are minimal and combination therapy has the same outcome as CP therapy in isolation. Thus, unless infection is detected early, e.g. though an efficient track and trace system, treatment would likely start at a time when CP therapy in isolation would be as effective as combination therapy. Figure 5 indicates the impact of starting treatments after the onset of symptoms, i.e. the day on which symptoms were first reported by the 12 patients in the study [58] used for model fitting. Both treatments reduced the duration of the infection significantly (in 67% of the patients), enabling a faster recovery, or otherwise have no significant impact on the duration of the infection. However, in some cases in which the peak in viral load and the AUC are significantly reduced (Table S5) , the treatments have not decreased the duration of infection. This figure also shows that there are cases for which the duration of infection is not reduced by one treatment, but would be reduced by combination therapy of both treatments. In the other cases these treatment options have more or less similar effects, although CP therapy performs slightly better, and in these cases there is not a noticeable synergistic effect. ",

Vaccination options against SARS-CoV-2 are actively pursued and a number of treatments are now in use in the clinics, but there are still many open questions regarding when and how best to administer these treatments, either in isolation or in combination. Whilst modelling of disease transmission has already played a key role in informing policy makers [8] , models of within-host dynamics have not yet had a prominent role in combating the disease. There is a precedence of intracellular modelling for other viral diseases, such as hepatitis C virus [4] . However, such models cannot be readily transferred to coronaviral infection, as viral life cycles are very different. Here we introduce a within-host model of a SARS-CoV-2 infection that contains sufficient details specific to coronaviruses to enable antiviral strategies against SARS-CoV-2 to be compared and to analyse their synergies. We demonstrate this via a comparative analysis of an antiviral treatment (remdesivir) and CP therapy, which apart from steriod treatment are the most prominent forms of therapy currently used against COVID-19 infections. In particular, we compare disease progression for different treatment starts and dosages, and thus provide new insights into these therapeutic options.",

However, those models do not capture the impact of early treatment on the duration of the infection. Surprisingly, our model suggests that early treatment by either therapy alone can actually increase the duration of infection compared with a later therapy start, likely because suppressing virus production results in a reduced immune response. This implies that even though early treatment accelerates the recovery process and reduces the peak in viral load, the infection may persist for a longer time than later treatment, meaning that these patients may possibly still be infectious.",

Our model also enabled us to perform a comparison between the antiviral treatment and CP therapy, and explore their potential synergistic effects. The model reveals that early into the infection an antiviral treatment using remdesivir could be more effective than CP therapy, and a combination therapy can significantly reduce the duration of infection. However, for later treatment starts, CP therapy appears to be more beneficial than antiviral therapy, and there are no longer any significant synergistic effects that would warrant combination therapy. These insights from our within-host model suggest that the time course of infection should be considered when deciding on appropriate theraputic response to COVID-19 infection.",

During transcription of the full length minus strand by the RTC, the process can terminate at one of these TRS motifs, resulting in one of the 9 negative sgRNA being produced. In our model, when an RTC encounters TRS motif number k, it will continue the elongation of the negative strand with rate r \u00d7 t c , and terminate with rate (1 \u2212 r)t c , resulting in the production of (-)sgRNA k . Here, tr k is the rate of RTC transcription between the TRS at site k \u2212 1 and site k (Fig. S2) and each (-)sgRNA k for k = 1, 2, ..., 9, corresponds to sgRNAs for N, 8, 7b, 7a, 6, M, E, 3a, S (-)sgRNAs, respectively, whereas the k = 10 state with transcription rate t 10 denotes the rate to transcribe the remaining length of 22kb of RNA upstream of the structural genes.

In influenza, at approximately 5 to 7 dpi mitoses are detected at the basal cell layer, and regeneration of the epithelium begins. Complete resolution of the epithelial takes up to 1 month [55] . We therefore assume that the maximum proliferation rate for uninfected cells is small, and that r T = 0.1 day \u22121 . The number of host cells that express ACE-2 and transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS) is approximately equal to 10 11 (T m = 10 11 ) [5] , and we use T (0) = T m . As SARS-CoV-2 is a novel infection, we assume that E(0) = 0 and that the basal level of effector cells is low (\u03bb E = 1 and d E = 0.5 day \u22121 ) [12] . However, considering a higher basal level does not change model outcomes regarding the viral dynamics as \u03b1 and \u00b5, the proliferation rates of effector cells and removal rate of infected cells by effector cells, are estimated using viral load data fitting. Note that increasing \u03bb and decreasing \u00b5 simultaneously does result in the same viral dynamics, although it will change the value of the peak in effector cells. Since data is only available regarding viral load, we decided to fix the basal level of effector cells before finding other parameters [12, 13] . Initially there is no specific antibody, therefore A(0) = 0 and d A = 0.033 day \u22121 [13] . We use 1 \u00b5g/ml immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive control as a strong positive standard [50] . Thus, we assume A m = 1 \u00b5g/ml = 4 \u00d7 10 12 molecules/ml. Although we are setting the individual's antibody carrying capacity to a fixed value [13] , we also checked that variation of the parameter does not impact the qualitative results and therefore all conclusions remain valid. d A is measured for HBV infection, but it has been shown that r A A(1 \u2212 A/A m ) \u2212 d A A is equivalent to a logistic growth of antibodies with growth rate \u03c1 A = r A \u2212 d A [13] . Since we are fitting r A , fixing d A does not have a significant impact on the model. The same argument is valid for d E , and as we are assuming a fixed basal level (\u03bb E /d E ), changing d E would not have a significant effect on our results.",

Although we fitted patient data individually, which is suboptimal compared to population fitting using mixed effects, the outcomes of the model were in agreement with clinically measured values, such as the incubation period and the onset of appearance of antibodies in the body. The resulting parameter values are presented in Table 1 . Decreasing/increasing of V (0) (V (0) = 0.01 virion/ml or V (0) = 1 virion/ml) does not change the estimated values of parameters significantly and only changes the estimated incubation period by \u00b11 day.

As the 95% CIs have negligible width compared with the widths of the curves, given the logarithmic scale, we also added the mean plus/minus standard deviation as shaded green areas in order to reflect the noise in the data, especially for P4 and P6.

The remaining genes 3' of the replicase gene encode for the structural proteins S, M, E, N. Structural and non-structural proteins are translated from different messenger RNAs that are produced by the viral replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) from viral gRNA.

After translation of the pp1a gene, the ribosome can either frameshift -1 nt to the ORF1b reading frame, translating the polyprotein pp1ab, or terminate, releasing the polyprotein pp1a [4] . We model the -1 ribosomal frameshift as a reaction with rate q \u00d7 t f and the termination at ORF1a as a reaction with rate (1 \u2212 q)t f . These rates give a probability of frameshifting from the ORF1a to ORF1b reading frames of q. If the ribosome sucessfully frameshifts, it completes translation of the ORF1b reading frame with rate t 1b , terminates, and releases the polyprotein pp1ab. As the viral genome needs to bind to the RTC for replication, we assume that (+)RNA can have only one ribosome or one RTC on at a time. Details of the reactions are listed below. The polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are cleaved by two proteases, papainlike protease (PLpro; corresponding to nsp3) and a main protease, 3C-like protease (3CLpro; corresponding to nsp5). Polyproteins pp1a and contains the nsps 1-11 and pp1ab contains nsps 1-10 and nsps 12-16 [2, 5] . It has been proposed that nsp2-16 collectively constitute a functional RTC in infected cells [6, 7] . These nsps have their own specific roles in the replication process, but the functions of some of them are not well understood [8] . For example nsp12 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); nsp13 is the NTPase/helicase; nsp14 is a proof-reading exonuclease [2] . As the exact stoichiometry of these nsps in an RTC molecule is unknown [9] and nsp11 which is a part of RTC is only in pp1a, we assume that pp1a and pp1ab have equal impact on RTC formation and this step is modelled as follows: [10] . The other (+)sgRNA encode accessory proteins which are hypothesised to interfere with the host innate immune response and their functions are poorly understood [11] . Thus we only include Synthesis of S, M, N, and E proteins into our model. Furthermore, similar to previous work on intracellular modelling of HCV, where the number of free ribosomes is fitted to obtain the viral dynamics that was observed experimentally [12] , we assume that free ribosomes are at an equilibrium level, where sgRNAs are saturated with available ribosomes and produce protein at a constant rate t n , t m etc. The E protein is found in small quantities within the virion. We assume each SARS-CoV-2 virion has 100 copies of E protein assembled into 20 pentameric structures, and 300 copies of S protein assembled into 100 trimeric structures [13] . The level of M and N proteins in SARS-CoV-2 consists of approximately 2000 and 1000 copies, respectively [13] . Note that in this model we assume that SARS-CoV-2 has the similar levels of E, S, M and N proteins to SARS-CoV-1 which was reported for [13] . Similar to the previous intracellular models for HCV infection which have modelled the assembly and budding of virions as a single reaction [12] , we model the budding of a virion is modelled as a single reaction with budding rate k bud as follows:",

            "text": "Transcription of the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 occurs via the interaction of the RTC complex with genomic (+)ssRNA, genomic (-)ssRNA, and negative sense sub-genomic fragments. During transcription of (+)ssRNA, a subset of 9 sub-genomic minus strands, which encode all structural proteins, are produced through discontinuous transcription [11] . Each sub-genome contains a 5 leader sequence corresponding to the 5 end of the genome which allows interaction between host ribosomes and (+)sgRNAs. Each sub-genomic RNA consists of a single ORF that encodes for a structural or accessory protein [14] . In SARS-CoV-2, the order of these ORFs (from 5' to 3') is S, 3a, E, M, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and N [10] . The full length (+)ssRNA genome contains functional transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) motifs which are found at the 3 end of the leader (leader TRS) and in front of each of the 9 ORFs. During transcription of the full length minus strand by the RTC, the process can terminate at one of these TRS motifs, resulting in one of the 9 negative sgRNA being produced. In our model, when an RTC encounters TRS motif number k, it will continue the elongation of the negative strand with rate r \u00d7 t c , and terminate with rate (1 \u2212 r)t c , resulting in the production of (-)sgRNA k after extension by transcription of the 5 end of the genome [14] . The completed minus-strand sgRNA serves as a template for (+)sgRNA synthesis. Figure S2 illustrates the transcription reactions that we model in this work. For transcription from full length genome (+)ssRNA, RTC (denoted by RTC in Fig. S2 ) reversibly binds to 3' UTR with binding/unbinding rates rt on and rt of f , K d = 0.1\u00b5M [15] .",

It was originally developed as a treatment for Hepatitis C virus and later repurposed for Ebola [16] . Recent studies have pointed to remdesivir as an effective antiviral treatment option for Covid-19 [17] . During the replication process RTC may insert remdesivir molecules rather than adenine, which caps the strand and stops the replication process [18] . In order to model the impact of this drug, we assume that complexes with RTC in our model can bind (and subsequently unbind) to remdesivir molecules (Rem). Thus the new reactions have the following form: S1.4 Parameters for the intracellular model S1.4.1 RNA and protein decay rates Wada et al.

Half-lives of S-sgRNA and genome are measured as 5.96 and 5.41 hours, respectively. Therefore, we assume that half-lives of (+)RNA, (-)RNA, and all positive and negative sgRNA are 6 hours. Thus, their decay rate is equal to ln 2/6 hour \u22121 . Half-life of E protein is 1 hour [20] . We are assuming that half-lives of N, M, S, pp1a and pp1ab are also 1 hour. As half-life of the viral polymerase of HCV (like SARS-CoV-2 a +ssRNA virus) has been measured as 6 hours [12] , we assume that half-life of RTC is also 6 hours.

They have estimated that the forward rate constants for ribosome binding are in the range of 1-50 (\u00b5M s) \u22121 . In this model we assume that the binding rate of ribosome to RNA is 25 (\u00b5M s) \u22121 and its unbinding rate is 2 s \u22121 [3, 21] . RTC binds to RNAs with dissociation constant (K d = rt of f rt on ) equal to 0.1 \u00b5M [15] . It has been observed that increasing/decreasing RTC binding rate does not have a significant effect on the outcome as it will also increase/decrease RTC unbinding rate [22] . Therefore we consider that RTC binding rate is equal to 1 (\u00b5M s) \u22121 and the unbinding rate is 0.1 s \u22121 . The translation rates are computed using the length of each protein and considering a constant speed for the ribosome. We study the impact of changing of this parameter (ribosome speed) in Fig. S3a . We observe that by changing ribosome speed the model behaves qualitatively the same. Thus, we fix this parameter in other simulations and we assume that the speed of the ribosome is 10 amino acids per second. The replication and transcription rates of RTC are computed using the length of each RNA and considering a constant speed for RTC [10] . We assume that the speed of the RTC is 30 nucleotides per second [23, 24] , although this parameter has also been varied. See Table S1 for full details on these constants.",

As our intracellular model ( Fig. 1c and d) suggests that starting treatment in the latent period is most effective, and would effectively block the production of virions, we set \u03b3 = 0 at the onset of treatment. This means that infected cells in the latent phase (L) do not transition to phase I, and begin shedding virions at a reduced rate (following a time lag \u03c4 ) compared with cells that were already in phase I at the onset of treatment. Thus, we have the following equations for the numbers of infected cells and free virions;",

The ribosome translates the pp1a gene (ORF1a). After translation of the pp1a gene, the ribosome can either frameshift -1 nt to the ORF1b reading frame, translating the polyprotein pp1ab, or terminate releasing the polyprotein pp1a. Probability of frameshifting from the ORF1a to ORF1b reading frames is q. Figure S2 : Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 genome via the RTC complex. During transcription process a subset of 9 sub-genomic minus strands are produced through discontinuous transcription. The full length genome contains functional (TRS) motifs which are found at the 3 end of the leader (leader TRS) and in front of each of the 9 ORFs (Fig. S1a) . When an RTC encounters TRS motif, it will either continue the elongation of the negative strand or terminate the transcription, resulting in the production of (-)sgRNAs. Probability of RTC elongation is r. Table S1 .

The 95% CI (the confidence interval) is shown as a red shaded area around each curve, but is indistinguishable from it by eye due it its small size. The green shaded areas indicate the mean plus/minus standard deviation, reflecting the fact that some patient data (such as P4 and P6) are more noisy, resulting in bigger fluctuations in the fitted curves.
