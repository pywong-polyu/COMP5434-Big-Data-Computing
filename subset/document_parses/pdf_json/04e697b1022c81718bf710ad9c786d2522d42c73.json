With India reporting 3,47,65,976 cases to date, the growing concern about this pandemic among individuals across all age groups, primarily adults, in regard to health and safety, is completely justified. 3 The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a lot of disruption in the livelihoods of individuals owing to confinement. Although food procurement may not have been altered much during this period, there has been a marked change in the dietary patterns of individuals as reported by several studies. 4 The changes may be due to the effect of lockdown on the economic status or as a result of a decline in outside food consumption due to lack of access and/or fear of being infected.",

The dietary status of micronutrients is being investigated as a modifiable risk factor for COVID-19. A study conducted in the United Kingdom concluded that prevention of micronutrient deficiencies, identifying the target risk group who are at suboptimal nutritional status, and implementing safe and effective nutrition strategies may help in resisting the infection. 6 The Food Consumption Score (FCS), a tool validated by the FAO, categorizes foods under eight standardized groups and assigns each food group a value based on its nutrient contribution. 7 While the Food Consumption Score is primarily used as a means to assess household food security, it is also an effective indicator of the extent of diversity in an individual's diet.",

Some nutrients that help confer immunity are Vitamins A and C. 8 Vitamin A is known to enhance antibody responses to antigens and also prevents apoptosis, and deficiency of this vitamin brings about an alteration in immune function. 9 Vitamin C plays a vital contributor to immunity. There is substantial evidence of vitamin C's role in potentiating B-cell and T-cell proliferation in addition to the prevention of respiratory infections. 10 Spices are known to play a role in the maintenance of immunity. A study conducted during the progression of COVID-19 showed that countries with higher consumption of spices had a higher recovery rate from the condition. A higher death rate was also observed in those countries which had a lower per capita spice consumption. 11 The current study focuses on the impact of the pandemic on food habits of individuals quantified by the Food Consumption Score and compares differences in FCS between young and middle-aged adults. It also assesses the consumption of immune-boosting foods commonly consumed in India, including spices and gooseberries, and a comparison of the frequency of consumption of these foods before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Based on the World Food Programme tool, 8 food groups were considered for the purpose of calculating FCS. The consumption pattern of these food groups for a period of 7 days was recorded as per the guidelines. 6 R software version 4.0 was used to carry out the statistical analysis. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test was applied to check the normality. Since some of the variables did not exhibit normal distribution of data, nonparametric tests were carried out to ascertain the difference observed between the two time points for the said variables. Linear regression model was applied on FCS to understand the factors affecting the score. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise personal and sociodemographic details. Paired t-test, non-parametric Wilcoxon's signed rank test, McNemar test, Mann-Whitney U test, and linear regression were performed to test the objectives. p-value <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Table 1 comprises of a detailed summary of personal, sociodemographic, and economic data of the participants. It was observed that a greater number of respondents were female (61.01%). This online survey covered respondents from different states of the country and a higher number of respondents were from the southern states of India (79.8%). It was observed that a higher number of respondents belonged to Upper SES category (52.29%) as opposed to other categories.

This had a direct effect on their livelihood. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on jobs and the lockdown that followed was taken into consideration in order to determine if these factors affected the FCS. A telephonic survey conducted in Sonipat, Delhi, Chennai, and Vishakapatnam to assess the health, psychosocial and economic impacts of chronically ill people during the COVID-19 pandemic reported that there were about 59% of the total participants reporting reduced income, while there were about 38% of participants who lost their job. 15 In the present study, there were about 26% of total participants whose job routine was altered either by reduced salary, inappropriate and long working hours, problems due to improper facility to commute, stress, anxiety, and depression, or due to job termination. The SES score of the family was also used to check the proportion of individuals belonging to different strata of the socioeconomic classification.

It was observed that communication and social media were impactful in raising awareness on the effect of various home remedies in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Information regarding the consumption of immune-boosting foods, consumption of herbal juice or concoction, and other food items perceived as immune boosters, that were not included in our questionnaire, was collected. It was seen that there was a statistically significant increase in the consumption of herbal juice/concoction during COVID-19 times. A similar finding was reported in a survey conducted across various countries, wherein there were about 71.8% of total participants who were consuming Kadha (spices/herbal concoction) during COVID-19 as they considered it to help combat the viral infection, thereby boosting immunity. 19 There was a significant increase in the consumption of condiments, fruit, gooseberries, honey, Neem leaves, and spices during the COVID-19 pandemic except in the consumption of Aloe vera and dark green leafy vegetables. These results were in agreement with a study conducted in Saudi Arabia, in which subjects reported an increase in consumption of immune-boosting foods such as ginger, garlic, and turmeric. 20 Besides the above-mentioned foods, there are many varieties of fruits and vegetables like oranges, guava, papaya, kiwi, beetroot, eggplant, broccoli, and mushrooms among others renowned as immune boosters during COVID-19 times as they are rich in minerals like zinc, magnesium, and Vitamin C, D, and E. 21 Since the present study was based on an online survey, the authenticity of responses could not be ascertained, as a result of which the predictions made cannot be validated. For the computation of BMI, selfreported height and weight were used, which could be inaccurate. The information about pre-COVID times was gathered based on the person's ability to recall and may not be precise. Since the data on the socioeconomic status was calculated based on the participant's response, there is a possibility of under or over-estimating the SES. As a result of this, although the research question involved understanding the impact of the pandemic on individuals' dietary habits, these results may not be entirely representative of the population under study. The total number of participants was 218. A higher number can perhaps yield more *, **, *** indicates significance levels at 5%, 1% and 0.1% respectively.",
