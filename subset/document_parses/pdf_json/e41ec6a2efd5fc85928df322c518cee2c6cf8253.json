Most children and adolescents infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) often develop mild symptoms that do not require medical intervention (1, 2) . However, in early May 2020, several European countries reported the outbreak of a condition in children that caused severe multiorgan inflammation, with features similar to those of Kawasaki disease shock syndrome and toxic shock syndrome, which was possibly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Health organizations (such as the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) referred to this syndrome as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) (8, 9) . According to a preliminary definition, MIS-C is a hyperinflammatory syndrome that affects multiple organs, and its clinical features often overlap with those of Kawasaki disease. A systematic review conducted by Hoste et al. showed that patients with MIS-C had increased body temperature (99.4%); gastrointestinal (85.6%), cardiovascular (79.3%), shock (56.3%), and respiratory (50.3%) symptoms; and elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Furthermore, most (73.3%) patients required intensive care, 3.8% of whom reportedly required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (10) . However, no study has reported the rehabilitation procedure for children with MIS-C.",

At this time, the patient's symptoms of COVID-19 were mild, and the patient recovered with acetaminophen medication for fever. In addition, the patient had no notable complications thus far. In early March, he experienced abdominal pain and headache, and 3 days later, he developed fever (body temperature of 40 \u2022 C); therefore, he visited a regional hospital and was admitted. Abdominal distention, generalized rash, and hyperemia of the conjunctiva appeared gradually in addition to high fever. The pediatrician made a suspected diagnosis of MIS-C because the symptoms resembled those of Kawasaki disease and speculated that the case was triggered by COVID-19 and consequently administered \u03b3-globulins 85 g/day by intravenous drip to control the inflammation. After 4 days of hospitalization, his symptoms did not improve, even after \u03b3-globulin administration, and his respiratory function decreased due to pulmonary edema. Hence, he was transferred to the pediatric department at our hospital, where he had a confirmed diagnosis of MIS-C (Figure 1) . The patient was treated with cyclosporine (130 mg/day) and steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone sodium succinate 1,000 mg/day), after which his general condition gradually improved. On the 7 th day of admission to our hospital, the patient spent more time in bed, although he was able to sit and stand; hence, we encouraged him to walk within the ward to increase the level of activity. However, suddenly from this day, when the patient stood up or sat on the edge of the bed, his lower limbs turned dark purple, and he complained of numbness and pain. The pediatrician eliminated the possibility of an arterial lesion because there was no cold sensation in the lower extremities and the symptoms improved soon after elevation of the lower extremities. The patient underwent vascular Doppler sonography, which did not depict any significant thrombus. He presented with similar symptoms in the upper extremities.",

The patient's conjunctivae were not pale, and hyperemia was observed. There were no heart or lung murmurs. Echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 81.4%; normal right ventricular pressure; and extremely trivial regurgitation of the mitral, pulmonary, and tricuspid valves. The C-reactive protein level on the day of pain manifestation was 3.92 mg/dl, which dropped to 1.22 mg/dl at the start of rehabilitation. No exacerbation of inflammation was observed. The patient presented with clear consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale: E4V5M6) (11, 12) , and disorientation and communication problems were not observed. Manual muscle test (13) results showed that the muscle strength of both upper and lower limbs was level 4 (slightly lower than normal), and there was no obvious limitation in the range of motion of the joints. The patient had normal tactile, cold, and position sensation. The biceps and patellar tendon reflexes were in the normal range, and there was no increase in muscle tone. The patient was able to rise unaided from the supine position in bed to the edge sitting position. As soon as he sat on the edge of the bed, his lower limbs turned dark purple, and he complained of severe numbness and pain. The upper extremity symptoms that had been present on the other day disappeared, and the patient did not complain of pain during muscle strengthening exercises of the extremities in bed. Because the patient's pain symptoms improved with lower extremity elevation, we hypothesized that venous stasis was a contributing factor. Therefore, exercise therapy was implemented, with the patient in the standing position and an elastic bandage wrapped only on the lower left extremity to reduce venous stasis. The patient then complained of pain only in the right lower extremity, indicating that reducing venous stasis would contribute to pain relief. Subsequently, elastic bandages were wrapped around both lower limbs, and the patient could stand and walk indoors (Figure 2) . Although the patient complained of pain, he was able to walk for several meters. He was motivated to continue on the 2 nd day of rehabilitation because he was able to walk the previous day. He could walk indoors when aided by a nurse. The walking distance was extended during rehabilitation. On the 6 th day of rehabilitation, he was able to walk a short distance without wearing an elastic bandage. On the 7 th day, he was able to walk outside the ward (approximately 100 m) under supervision. An ergometer for the lower limbs was added to the rehabilitation routine to increase the exercise duration. On the 10 th day of rehabilitation, the patient no longer complained of pain in the lower limbs. On the 11 th day, he was able to bathe unaided, walk outdoors, and climb stairs. He was discharged on the 16 th day of rehabilitation (i.e., 23 rd day of admission) and could independently perform his ADLs.",

            "text": "The patient complained of pain when his lower limbs were lowered below the heart and was unable to get out of bed. Other diseases with similar symptoms, including chronic venous insufficiency and post-phlebitis syndrome, are caused by obstruction of venous return due to deep vein thrombosis, venous valve insufficiency, and decreased contractility of the muscles around the veins. Moreover, venous hypertension induced by fluid retention in the lower extremities due to rightsided heart failure may contribute toward the development of MIS-C. The symptoms include tenseness, heaviness, tingling, cramps, pain, and fatigue in the lower extremities, which exacerbate during standing or walking and improve with rest and elevation of the lower extremities. The treatment of chronic venous insufficiency and post-phlebitis syndrome entails elevation of the lower extremities, application of elastic bandages and stockings, and compression using pneumatic compression devices (19) . Lauren et al. posited that MIS-C is an important factor in the pathobiology of both vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction (20) . The patient did not have right-sided heart failure or venous obstruction, such as a thrombus, which would have interfered with venous return. We hypothesized that the inflammation had transiently spread to the veins of the patient, resulting in inadequate venous valve function and a tendency to develop stasis. There have been no reports of such symptoms occurring in children with MIS-C. The cause of symptom occurrence when the general condition was improving (rather than MIS-C onset) and the mechanism underlying pain generation were unknown. However, because the pain improved with elevation of the upper and lower limbs, we hypothesized that stasis in the veins was responsible for symptom occurrence. We successfully prevented venous stasis and reduced pain by applying an elastic bandage to the lower leg as symptomatic treatment. Compression therapy has been shown to reduce the amount of blood remaining in the veins of the lower leg and reduce the diameter of the veins, thereby improving the function of the venous valves and reducing venous reflux (21, 22) . Moreover, studies have shown that the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by surrounding endothelial cells and macrophages due to venous stasis are reduced by compression (23, 24) . It is possible that these mechanisms of action of compression therapy contributed to the reduction in pain. The patient's symptoms began to decrease after the initiation of rehabilitation. He was able to walk for a short distance without an elastic bandage by the 5 th day of rehabilitation, and the pain symptoms improved by the 9 th day. It is possible that the patient's symptoms could have been alleviated without rehabilitation. However, by adjusting the walking distance, endurance training load, and ADL training in a timely manner according to the pain level, the patient was able to return home early with ADL recovery.",
