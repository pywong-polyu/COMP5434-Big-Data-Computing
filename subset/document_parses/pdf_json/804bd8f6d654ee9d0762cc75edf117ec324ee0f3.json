While the risk of serious side effects from taking either of the PrEP medications is low, F/TAF has demonstrated less effect on bone and kidney health, and may be the preferred option in people with bone or kidney conditions, or in those at risk of developing osteoporosis or having risk factors for kidney disease, such as people living with diabetes or high blood pressure. As the risk of HIV sometimes overlaps with risks to bone and renal health according to race/ethnicity, poverty, alcohol/substance use, smoking tobacco, and taking other medications, F/TAF as an alternative PrEP medication allows the PrEP choice to depend on the broader health conditions of the individual. 'Personalized medicine' means that medicines can be chosen to suit an individual's biology, behavior, lifestyle, and overall health. The approval of F/TAF is the first step in personalization of PrEP medication, while additional options need to be researched to meet the requirements of all individuals at risk of HIV.",

The results of the DISCOVER study demonstrated that F/TAF was non-inferior to F/TDF for the prevention of HIV at the primary analysis (when 100% of participants reached 48 weeks of followup and 50% reached 96 weeks), and also when all participants reached 96 weeks, indicating that the two medications have comparable efficacy at over 99% [14, 17] .",

Triglyceride levels were increased at 96 weeks in the F/TAF arm, although the increase from baseline, while statistically significant, is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. No significant differences were seen between the study arms in the ratio of TC to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or LDL-C:HDL-C, both of which have greater predictive value for cardiovascular disease than the individual parameters in isolation [22] . Among participants receiving F/TDF at baseline, 3% of those who switched to F/TAF started a lipid-modifying agent versus 0.9% of those who remained on F/TDF (p = 0.03) [23] . Among PrEP-na\u00efve individuals, however, there was no significant difference in the rates of lipid-modifying agent initiation between the arms (1.3% vs. 1.0%, p = 0.27) [23] .",

Key criteria include the following:\\25 or[50 years of age, occurrence of bone-related conditions such osteoporosis or osteopenia, previous or current corticosteroid use, lifestyle factors that have a negative impact on bone health (e.g., history of tobacco smoking, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, alcohol use disorder, use of methamphetamines), eating disorders, vitamin D deficiency, or low body mass index. F/TAF should be considered in any PrEP candidate meeting one or more of these criteria. Fig. 2 Markers of renal function in individuals C 50 years of age using F/TAF or F/TDF for PrEP (DISCOVER study) (reproduced with permission from [17] ). Cr creatinine, eGFR CG estimated glomerular filtration rate (based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation), F/TAF emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, F/TDF emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, PrEP pre-exposure prophylaxis, RBP retinol binding protein, b2M b2 microglobulin. Median changes from baseline in (a) eGFR CG and (b), (c) proximal tubular protein to Cr ratios: (b) RBP:Cr ratio and (c) b2M:Cr ratio. p values at 96 weeks are derived from the Van Elteren test stratified by baseline F/TDF for PrEP to compare the two study arms Supporting Evidence F/TDF may be associated with declines in BMD when used for PrEP or HIV treatment, in comparison with F/TAF, which showed no effect on BMD [20] . A systematic review and meta-analysis included a mixed group of studies wherein F/TDF was used as PrEP, HIV treatment, and hepatitis B virus treatment [20] . When taken as PrEP, F/TDF was associated with a minor BMD decrease in the lumbar spine and total hip (mean differences of -0.82% and -0.81%, respectively), although a larger decrease in BMD was seen in the HIV treatment studies [20] . Importantly, two open-label studies from the Adolescent Trials Network of PrEP evaluated BMD changes in young adult/adolescent MSM [16, 94] . One study in individuals 18-22 years of age identified modest but significant decreases in BMD in the hip and whole body (median differences of -0.44% and -0.61%, respectively) with F/TDF at week 24 [94] . The other study included individuals 15-17 years of age and found a significant decrease in the total body BMD Z-score at week 48 [16] . A subsequent extension study showed that BMD Z-scores in the spine and whole body remained below baseline in individuals 15-19 years of age 48 weeks following discontinuation of PrEP [95] . Despite the potential effects of F/TDF on bone health, the CDC does not currently recommend BMD assessment before initiation of F/TDF, although individuals with a history of fractures, or at significant risk of osteoporosis, are recommended to be referred for appropriate consultation and management [26] . Although not specifically recommended by the CDC, BMD measurement may provide additional clinically important information to guide decision making before initiating F/TDF for PrEP and could be considered by clinicians.",

Given the importance of daily PrEP adherence for optimal effectiveness in preventing HIV, the candidate's preferences should be considered, and the DayTracker TM blister pack for F/TAF could be particularly useful for individuals who are at risk of forgetting to take their medication.

A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial found that implant-based release of the investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, MK-8591 (islatravir), for example, was generally well tolerated [103] . Moreover, an interim analysis of data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network 083 study reported that the investigational drug cabotegravir was superior to F/TDF in MSM and transgender women in preventing HIV acquisition when injected once every 8 weeks [104] . Additionally, the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 084 study recently reported on the HPTN website that a regimen containing cabotegravir injected once every 8 weeks was superior to daily oral F/TDF at preventing HIV acquisition in cisgender women-we await to see these results published in a peer-reviewed journal [105] . These long-acting agents have the potential to further revolutionize the choice of PrEP for individuals at risk.",

Two large Phase 2b trials of VRC01, a bnAb that targets the conserved CD4 binding site of the HIV envelope, are currently under way in humans. Modeling suggests that the overall prevention efficacy of VRC01 may be between 37 and 82% [108] , suggesting that the antibody therapy, while valuable, will not be an immediate substitute for pharmaceutical approaches.",

Lack of adherence may explain why the real-world effectiveness of PrEPs does not always match the efficacy levels observed in clinical trials.

While for some patients the longestablished F/TDF and the newer F/TAF may both constitute safe and effective PrEP options, for other groups the introduction of F/TAF, with its improved bone and renal safety profile, provides a valuable alternative. It represents an additional step toward personalization of PrEP depending on the individual's broader health status and preferences. As such, F/TAF may help to begin to address the disproportionately low uptake of PrEP among certain populations such as ethnic minorities. In particular, F/TAF may be the medication of choice for populations of cisgender men and transgender women at risk of HIV who are also at risk of developing osteoporosis or renal disease.",

Notably, the safety profile of F/TAF for individuals with renal-and bone-related risk factors may reduce the need for patients to attend clinics in person (although HIV testing would still be necessary).

While each factor individually may be insufficient to drive choice of a PrEP medication, taken together, these factors should be considered as part of the 'bigger picture' of the individual's current health, lifestyle, and medical history. It is possible that cost differences between the PrEP options described could be a consideration for HIV prevention programs, and cost-effective analyses should be investigated for current and emerging PrEP options in future studies. Nevertheless, with HIV prevention, as with many other biomedical interventions, providers should consider how the choice of a medication could contribute to or exacerbate other risk factors in a patient's life. As a result, the approach to PrEP should become increasingly individualized and patient centered as more options become available. development of a draft outline and subsequent drafts in consultation with the authors, collating author comments, copyediting, fact checking, and referencing, was provided by Emma McConnell, PhD, and Josh Lilly, PhD, at Aspire Scientific Limited (Bollington, UK).
