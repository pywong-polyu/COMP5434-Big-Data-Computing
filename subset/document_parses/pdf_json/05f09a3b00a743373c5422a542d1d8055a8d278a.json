These have relied on a rapid upscaling of testing capacity and a parallel mobilization of thousands of health workers recruited to perform contact tracing. Many European countries, as well as the USA, have in contrast been overtaken by the speed of the establishment and spread of the causative virus and have failed to anticipate the supply and logistics of large-scale testing and personal protective equipment. Since no vaccine will be available for several months or even more than a year, the control of this pandemic can be achieved only by a major social reorganization. Therefore, these latter countries were left with no choice but to adopt aggressive social-distancing measures so as to curb the pandemic below their health systems' capacity, with variable success. A paradox is that the somewhat delayed control of these pandemics through social distancing may have left these countries with a comparatively greater fraction of an immune population than that in countries in which the pandemic was quickly contained, which could play in their favor in the prevention of resurgences.",

However, from an economic and social point of view, confinement measures are not sustainable in the long run. In fact, a sustained economic slump will create negative health consequences, from 'deaths of despair' 1 to pressures on public-health budgets, which might thereby create more non-COVID-19-related deaths than confinement would save from this disease. In addition, social tensions linked to severe prolonged confinement, which negatively affects people quite differently, financially as well as non-financially, may get out of hand. A well-designed exit strategy is therefore crucial.",

RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests available in greater numbers than the estimated infected population would be used to quantify ongoing infections and inform contact tracing, isolations and quarantine. Serological tests might allow the correction of some false-negative results of virus-detection assays, the identification of non-contagious and potentially protected people, and quantification of the fraction of the population that contributes to 'herd immunity' 2 . Those last seroprevalence surveys might include finger-prick assays for mass screening.",

These tests would be first targeted at workers providing essential services (health, security and food). With upscaling of diagnostic capacity, the tests would support the progressive de-confinement of groups of populations on the basis of their expected contribution to the transmission and risk profile and the results of both RNA tests and serology tests in order to gradually restore economic and social activity safely. For example, de-confinement is less urgent for retired senior citizens and for people who can work from home. An important question that cannot be avoided even at an early stage is whether schools should be re-opened, given that young people are less at risk of contracting COVID-19. This is a complex question that lack of space prevents us from addressing here. Suffice it to say that if a government decides to reopen all or a part of the education establishments of the country, care should be taken to minimize Credit: Anilyanik/DigitalVisionVectors/Getty comment the risk of transmission to the teaching staff and their families, with the help of high-priority testing. And if the decision is the opposite, maximum effort should be deployed to reduce the blatant inequalities that result from distant schooling.",

In countries in which there are issues of financial access to healthcare, the cost of testing would need to be subsidized so that cost is not an obstacle to its wide application.",

Priority for testing such low-risk people should be given to those operating in sectors considered essential. Such an approach would slowly build up 'herd immunity' , which would reduce the intensity of future waves of the pandemic. The goal should be for everyone to eventually rejoin their normal lives and thereby avoid the stigma of two 'types' of citizens: those who are immunized and risk free, and those who are not. In any case, this risk is not permanent, since it will be much reduced once a cure and/or a vaccine is (are) found.",

Quantitative mathematical modeling should be used as soon as possible to ensure that the proposed sets of actions would be safe, to make certain that the level of transmission and severe cases remain below the health system's capacity, to fine-tune the timing and phasing of actions, and to inform the decision on target groups that will be gradually released from confinement.",

However, the successful management of this crisis will depend mainly on the support of the population. Allowing some types of workers to return to work while preventing others from doing so is liable to cause tensions aroused by feelings of positive or negative discrimination, and these feelings may actually differ depending upon whether the worker is a wage earner or an independent worker or entrepreneur. This dimension has to be thought over, and the rationale of any measure must be carefully explained to the population. The same applies to the questions of how to organize the quarantine of infected people to avoid a resurgence of the pandemic, and how to manage inequalities in access to health care. Citizen ownership will be essential to ensure that solidarity prevails over discrimination. ",
