            "text": "Abstract According to the current international guidelines, high-risk patients diagnosed with pathological T1 (pT1) colorectal cancer (CRC) who underwent complete local resection but may have risk of developing lymph node metastasis (LNM) are recommended additional intestinal resection with lymph node dissection. However, around 90% of the patients without LNM are exposed to the risk of being overtreated due to the insufficient pathological criteria for risk stratification of LNM. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a noninvasive biomarker for molecular residual disease and relapse detection after treatments including surgical and endoscopic resection of solid tumors. The CIRCULATE-Japan project includes a large-scale patient-screening registry of the GALAXY study to track ctDNA status of patients with stage II to IV or recurrent CRC that can be completely resected. Based on the CIRCULATE-Japan platform, we launched DENEB, a new prospective study, within the GALAXY study for patients with pT1 CRC who underwent complete local resection and were scheduled for additional intestinal resection with lymph node dissection based on the standard (pT1) CRC with a negative margin in the US, European, and Japanese guidelines include submucosal invasion (>1000 \u00b5m), lymphovascular invasion, high-grade tumor budding, and poorly differentiated histology. [1] [2] [3] However, the rate of LNM indicated by these guidelines is only 6%-16%. 4 Therefore, around 90% of the patients without LNM are exposed to the risk of being overtreated with a recommendation of additional intestinal resection because of the insufficient/ unclear pathological criteria for risk stratification of LNM. To reduce these unnecessary additional surgical resections, a new high-quality marker for determining the risk of LNM is necessary.",

Circulate-Japan encompasses an observational (GALAXY study) and two randomized phase III trials (VEGA and ALTAIR). 7 Based on the CIRCULATE-Japan platform, we launched DENEB, a new prospective study, within the GALAXY study for patients with pT1 CRC who underwent complete local resection and were scheduled for additional intestinal resection with lymph node dissection based on the standard pathologic risk stratification criteria for LNM.

Locally resected tumor tissue will be collected from registered patients as formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded sample, and blood samples will be taken within 4 weeks before additional intestinal resection, followed by a personalized, tumor-informed ctDNA assay of Signatera\u2122.

The ctDNA assay will build new evidence to establish a noninvasive personalized diagnosis that will help to avoid unnecessary treatment and guide appropriate treatment for patients with CRC.
