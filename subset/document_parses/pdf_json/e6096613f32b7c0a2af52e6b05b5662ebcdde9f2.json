Additionally, we do not assume that images contain single lesions, thus the framework supports both focal or wide-field images. Specifically, we propose a two-stage approach in which we first identify all lesions present in the image regardless of sub-type or likelihood of malignancy, then it estimates their likelihood of malignancy, and through aggregation, it also generates an image-level likelihood of malignancy that can be used for high-level screening processes. Further, we consider augmenting the proposed approach with clinical covariates (from electronic health records) and publicly available data (the ISIC dataset). Comprehensive experiments validated on an independent test dataset demonstrate that i) the proposed approach outperforms alternative model architectures; ii) the model based on images outperforms a pure clinical model by a large margin, and the combination of images and clinical data does not significantly improves over the image-only model; and iii) the proposed framework offers comparable performance in terms of malignancy classification relative to three board certified dermatologists with different levels of experience.",

Many of the skin lesions of concern are screened by primary care physicians (PCPs). In fact, up to one third of primary care visits contend with at least one skin problem, and skin tumors are the most common reason for referral to dermatology [3] . High volume of referrals places a strain on specialty care, delaying visits for high-risk cases. Given the expected rise in baby boomers, with sig-nificantly increased risk of skin cancer, there is an urgent need to equip primary care providers to help screen and risk stratify patients in real time, high quality and costconscious fashion. PCPs have variable experience and training in dermatology, causing often low concordance between their evaluation and dermatology [3] . A consistent clinical decision support (CDS) system has the potential to mitigate this variability, and to create a powerful risk stratification tool, leveraging the frontline network of providers to enhance access to quality and valuable care.",

Herein, we propose a two-stage approach to detect skin lesions of interest in wide-field images taken from consumer grade smartphone devices, followed by binary lesion classification into two groups: Malignant vs. Benign, for all skin cancers (melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and most common benign tumors. Ground truth malignancy was ascertained via biopsy, as apposed to consensus adjudication. As a result, the proposed approach can be integrated and generalized into primary care and dermatology clinical workflows. Importantly, our work also differs from existing approaches in that our framework can detect lesions from both wide-field clinical and dermoscopy images acquired with smartphones. This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we present the problem formulation and the proposed approach. In Section 3 we describe the data used, the implementation details and quantitative and qualitative experimental results. Finally, in Section 4 we conclude with a discussion of the proposed approach and acknowledge some limitations of the study. ",

In our case, we consider three possible choices for C, namely, i) C = 1 denoted as one-class where the model seeks to identify any lesion regardless of type; i) C = 2 denoted as malignancy in which the model seeks to separately identify malignant and benign lesions; and iii) C = 8 denoted as sub-type, thus the model is aware of all lesion types of interest. Note that we are mainly interested in finding malignant lesions among all lesions present in an image as opposed to identifying the type of all lesions in the image. Nevertheless, it may be beneficial for the model to be aware that different types of lesions may have common characteristics which may be leveraged for improved detection. Alternatively, provided that some lesion types are substantially rarer than others (e.g., dermatofibroma and vascular lesions only constitutes 1% each of all the lesions in the dataset described in Section 3.1), seeking to identity all lesion types may be detrimental for the overall detection performance. This label granularity trade-off will be explored in the experiments.

Note that the model is able to accurately identify lesions in images with vastly different image sizes, for which the lesion-to-image ratio varies substantially. We attribute the model ability to do so to the FPN network that allows to obtain image representations (features) at different resolution scales. Further, in Figure 5 we show through a two-dimensional t-SNE map [27] that the representations produced by the lesion detection model (combined backbone and FPN features) roughly discriminate between malignant and benign lesions, while also clustering in terms of lesion types.",

However, usability of these algorithms in the real-world remains questionable and must be tested prospectively in clinical settings. Consumer-grade devices produce images of variable quality, however, this approach mimics the clinical work flow and provides a universally applicable image capture for any care setting. The utility of wide-field clinical images taken with smartphone was recently demonstrated by Soenksen et. al for detection of \"ugly duckling\" suspicious pigmented lesions vs. non-suspicious lesions with 90.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 90.0-90.6) and 89.9% specificity (95% CI: 89.6 -90.2) validated against three board certified dermatologists [28] . This use case demonstrates how clinical work flow in dermatology can be replicated with MLbased CDS. However, the limitation is that the number needed to treat (NNT) for true melanoma detection from pigmented lesion biopsies by dermatologists is 9.60 (95% CI: 6.97-13.41) by meta-analysis [29] . Hence, the task of detecting suspicious pigmented lesions should be compared against histological ground truth rather than concordance with dermatologists, for improved accuracy and comparability of model performance. Furthermore, pigmented lesions are a small subset of the overall task to detect skin cancer, as melanomas constitute fewer than 5% of all skin cancers. Our approach utilizing wide-field images to detect lesions of interest demonstrated encouraging mAP, IoU and Recall metrics, considering the sample size used. This primary step is critical in the clin- ical workflow where images are captured for lesions of interest but lesion annotation is not possible in real time. An ideal ML-based CDS would identify lesion of interest and also provide the likelihood of malignancy and the sub-type annotations as feedback to the user. Our study demonstrates malignancy classification for the three most common skin cancers (BCC, SCC and Melanoma) vs. benign tumors with smartphone images (clinical and dermoscopy) with encouraging accuracy when validated against histopathological ground truth. The usability of this algorithm is further validated by comparison with dermatologists with variable levels of dermoscopy experience, showing comparable performance to dermatologists in both clinical and dermoscopy binary classifica-tion tasks, despite low dermoscopy image data (11%) in the Discovery set. This two-stage model, with the current performance level, could be satisfactorily utilized in a PCP triage to dermatology (pending prospective validation) at scale for images concerning for malignancy as a complete end-to-end system. Interestingly, the additional ISIC high-quality dataset (predominantly dermoscopy images) improved performance across both clinical and dermoscopy image sets. This suggests that smartphone image data can be enriched by adding higher quality images. It is unclear if this benefit is due to improvement in image quality or volume, and remains an area of further study.",

Limitations of the study include a small discovery image dataset, predominantly including light and medium skin tones, and with less than 2% of images included with dark skin tone. However, this may represent the bias in the task itself as skin cancers are more prevalent in light-followed by medium-skin tones. Given the large range of skin types and lesions encountered in clinical practice, additional images may improve performance and generalizability. At scale, image data pipelines with associated metadata are a key resource needed to obtain inclusive ML-based CDS for dermatology. Improved image quality and/or volume improves performance as demonstrated by the ISIC dataset incorporation into the model, however, this theoretical improvement in performance needs validation in prospective clinical settings. While the pure clinical model incorporates a comprehensive list and accounts for temporal association of this metadata with detection of lesions, it is not an exhaustive list as it does not include social determinants such as sun-exposure behavior and tanning bed usage; two critical factors contributing to increasing incidence of skin can-cer. In particular, metadata including lesion symptoms and evolution is missing and should be incorporated in future studies. Finally, it should be noted that lesions included in this study were evaluated and selected for biopsies in dermatology clinics.

To develop the model we consider a single institution, retrospective collection of skin lesion images taken with smartphones with and without dermoscopy from Duke University Medical Center patients of age 18 and older from 2013-2018. The discovery dataset consists of 7,752 images from 4,185 patients with 8,243 manually annotated lesions, from which 4,696 (57%) lesions in 3,425 images are malignant. In terms of skin tone, 6,529 images (6,947 lesions) are light, 1,118 images (1,183 lesions) are medium and 105 images (113 lesions) are dark tone. Lesions were manually annotated as bounding boxes (ROIs) by a dermatology trained medical doctor (Dr. Kheterpal, MK) using a in-house annotation application. Diagnoses taken from the biopsy reports associated with the lesion images were designated as the ground truth (Malignant vs. Benign). 159 images) for validation.
