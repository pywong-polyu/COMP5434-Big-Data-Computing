Methods: Ward/ICU rooms had IAQ parameters monitored in real-time, including volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Surface and three air samples with different exposure times were collected in each room and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using quantitative Rt-PCR. Environmental sampling and IAQ data were compared to provide information about viral spread. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 6/10 rooms and 9/30 air samples, which is proportionally higher than previous studies. Sampling time confirmed to be crucial to viral detection. No correlations between IAQ parameters could be associated with positive/negative samples even when aerosol-generating procedures were performed. Conclusion: Environmental sampling of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be used as an indicator of occupational safety. IAQ is also a potential tool but requires further research.",

In addition, before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, this subject was not studied deeply, with just a few authors pointing to different findings and with heterogeneous methodologies. 3 Currently there is a need to comprehend aerosol dynamics and indoor air quality (IAQ) inside the healthcare setting, due to the demand of producing appropriate data to guide medical practices in the current and future pandemics. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate IAQ parameters and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) on air and surface samples collected in a COVID-19 dedicated hospital.",

            "text": "Environmental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still not deciphered and may be one of the keys to achieve COVID-19 control 4 ; however, a high heterogeneity is usually seen among experiments concerning this theme. 6 Besides using different sampling instruments and strategies, they are frequently conducted in different places (eg, hospital toilet, corridor), what hinders data extrapolation since each of those spots has different ventilation dynamics. Additionally, parameters such as temperature and air humidity play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 viability, 7 but only a few studies performing air sampling have specified its underlying environmental conditions. 8 In view of those issues, the purpose of using an IAQ sensor was to better establish the conditions in which environmental sampling was being conducted and to investigate possible relationships between them. To allow further comparison and reproduction of this experiment, the sampling process was simplified as much as possible, what is characterized by the sampling device that only assembled a vacuum pump, a rotameter, and a hose to connect to a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane; the flow rate was set to 5 L/min to simulate the standard respiratory minute ventilation; rooms with similar characteristics and typical routines were chosen. Even with those simplifications, we were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 6 out of 10 rooms or 9 out of 30 air samples what is proportionally higher than most similar experiments that frequently dot not detect or have a low positivity rate as pointed in a recent systematic review that analyzed 11 experimental studies concerning airborne transmission of COVID- 19. 9 Environmental Sampling and Indoor Air Quality Duration of the exposure is considered a crucial factor for disease transmission, 10 but this has been essentially demonstrated in 11 Previous studies concerning air sampling did not test different exposure times, [12] [13] [14] and, thus, the finding that only one out of the six rooms with positive air samples did not have a concomitant or isolated positive LES, adds more evidence to the principle that the duration of exposure is a cornerstone to COVID-19 transmissibility. The timeframe after the onset of symptoms that a positive swab Rt-PCR may be collected is controversial, but at least 2 or 4 weeks should be considered. 15, 16 Across the evaluated rooms, positive samples were obtained from units where patients had more than 50 days since the beginning of the symptoms, suggesting that not only swab-tests may be positive for longer periods, but also the surrounding environment. 17 The finding that all ward rooms, where only individuals with respiratory manifestations initiated in the previous 10 days at the latest were staying in them, had positive air/surface samples is in accordance with Chia et al that found a higher positive rate of environmental sampling in rooms with patients in the first 7 days of the illness. 18 Another important finding is that positive surface samples were only obtained where the air sample was positive as well. Considering that the evaluated rooms had their door and windows closed and were not shared with other patients, this result suggests that aerosol deposition may be one of the elements to have an environment with contaminated surfaces. Moreover, this could be clinically relevant for the safety of healthcare workers inside those facilities since surface swab together with IAQ parameters, which are much easier to be done than air sampling, could be used as an indicator of an environment with potential risk of transmission, triggering disinfection measures, and adjustments in IAQ such as temperature and air humidity which play a crucial role in the survival of several viruses. 19, 20 IAQ evaluation was focused on the parameters that may be classified as ventilation indicators (TVOC and CO 2 ) and total suspended particles (PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.0). Low TVOC and CO 2 concentrations have been associated with proper ventilation inside buildings, and it is reasonable to infer that decreased levels would also result in low levels of PM in the air, an association that has already been hypothesized elsewhere. 21 However, in this study, while the levels of TVOC/CO 2 did not surpass the recommended standards, such as 1000 ppm for CO 2 , 22 using them as indicators of good ventilation was not straightforward, since correlations between PM and TVOC/CO 2 could not be found in any room.",
