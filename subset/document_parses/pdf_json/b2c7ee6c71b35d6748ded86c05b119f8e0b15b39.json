Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services in particular are having to explore remote working methods to continue functioning. Australian IAPT services have utilised remote delivery methods and disruptive technologies at their core from inception. This was to maintain fidelity and clinical governance across vast distances but has allowed training, supervision and service delivery to continue virtually uninterrupted through coronavirus restrictions. On this basis, key recommendations for remote working are outlined. Remote methods are defined as (1) real time delivery, (2) independent delivery and (3) blended delivery. These are applied across three broad areas of remote training, remote clinical supervision and remote service delivery. Recommendations may be of great benefit to IAPT training institutions, clinical supervisors and service providers considering a move towards remote delivery. Challenges, adaptations and examples of applying remote methods are outlined, including case examples of methods applied to low-intensity and high-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy. Remote methods can safeguard service continuity in times of worldwide crisis and can contribute to reducing the impact of increased mental health presentations post-COVID-19.",

One example is the declarative, procedural and reflective (DPR) model of therapist skill development, based on information processing theory (Bennett-Levy, 2006) . This highlights three principal systems of skills and knowledge acquisition, categorised as declarative, procedural and reflective. This DPR model provides the framework that can account for why different training methods are needed for different elements of therapist skill. Reflection is identified as pivotal to therapist skill development. The DPR model is used as a core framework for remote training and supervision in Australian IAPT.",

            "text": "In Australia there are clear practical advantages in terms of flexibility, optimising resources and cost efficiency, with the ability to deliver CBT training, supervision and services over vast distances. There are three different time zones within Australia. One state, Queensland, does not have daylight saving so for part of the year there are effectively four. Australia is roughly 2500 miles long from east to west. This is roughly the same distance from east to west coasts of the USA or a flight from London to Baghdad. Flying is the primary form of transport between most major cities. Travelling from Melbourne in the state of Victoria to the neighbouring city of Adelaide is a distance of 450 miles, requiring an 8-hour drive or 1 hour flight. In rural and remote areas, IAPT workers may be based in health centres 3 to 4 hours drive from their nearest team members. They already use video or telephone conferencing as standard, for referral meetings and other service requirements. Australia does not have the wealth of postgraduate trained and accredited CBT practitioners and supervisors compared with the multi-professional CBT training and minimum standards of the UK . This means there are not sufficient trained therapists and supervisors in local services to set up IAPT with the same structure piloted in the UK. For example, a low-intensity CBT practitioner in rural Western Queensland and a supervisor based in Adelaide would require a 3-hour flight plus a further 19-hour drive to meet face to face. Without remote training and supervision, Australian IAPT services would not be able to match the clinical supervision specifications of the UK model (Turpin and Wheeler, 2011) . Given these challenges, remote working is essential for the small pool of trainers and supervisors trained to UK requirements. This established system of remotely delivering IAPT training, clinical supervision and services has proven robust for working through the coronavirus pandemic. Other organisations may benefit from these adaptations when traditional methods of operating are disrupted during such challenging times.",

The primary risk within IAPT services is risk to self via attempted suicide. Supervisors having remote access to a CCMS are key factors in clinical governance and suicide prevention . Psychiatry guidance from the COVID-19 Suicide Prevention Research Collaboration and suicide risk and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic published in the Lancet (Gunnell et al., 2020) specifically recommends remote service delivery. The guidance states, 'Mental health services should develop clear remote assessment and care pathways for people who are suicidal, and staff training to support new ways of working. Helplines will require support to maintain or increase their volunteer workforce, and offer more flexible methods of working. Digital training resources would enable those who have not previously worked with people who are suicidal to take active roles in mental health services and helplines. Evidencebased online interventions and applications should be made available to support people who are suicidal.' This promotes early intervention with NICE-recommended treatments such as low-and high-intensity CBT for clinical depression as effective suicide prevention strategies in themselves. To fulfil this important function remotely, a number of clinical procedures can be followed to support practice that supervisors need to ensure operate efficiently. This can include conducting specific IAPT risk assessments, triggered by measures such as the PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001) , policies such as same day recording of session notes and access to a duty supervisor via telephone, within office hours. The latter allows support and discussion for any same day step up due to suicide risk that cannot wait until planned supervision.",

This can regard application of idiosyncratic case formulation or aspects of a specific CBT model such as delivering treatment for panic disorder or behavioural activation for depression. A declarative aspect is evident via case presentation. This can be made more procedural and experiential by conducting role-plays or reviewing audio recordings of sessions. Trainees are asked to prepare samples of specific recordings with a section of a session that they (1) think was delivered well and (2) think they need to improve on. The supervisor can further enhance procedural and reflective skills by adhering to a Socratic approach., e.g. asking a trainee to identify their own thoughts, feelings and what they were trying to achieve at a particular point of a recording, or role-playing with them acting as the client. The reflective element of DPR is further developed by trainees summarising from declarative case presentation and procedural, roleplay or recordings. This reflection would include: what they are hearing in supervisor feedback? What are they observing now? What can they take back into their practice? What will they do the same and what will they do differently next therapy session? remote intervention only, with video or telephone-based triage, assessment, treatment and followup.

The remainder of the 6-week initial intensive training block is delivered remotely. Following the 6-week block, the trainees build up a caseload of clients and have 90 minutes individual supervision per week and 2 hours group supervision per month, all delivered remotely via videoconference. Client contact after 6 weeks is a continuation of role-play practice as per the DPR model (Bennett-Levy, 2006) . In low-intensity CBT, a DPR remote service delivery example Delivering CBT via telephone requires an agreement on appointment time and who will make the call. Posting or emailing low-intensity guided self-help materials, measures and treatment diaries in advance allows joint access in-session. Using telephone requires clinicians to be more aware of auditory cues such as tone of voice, any audible shifts in affect and allowing for silences. Having role-played telephone sessions previously in training based on DPR is of benefit. Clinicians adept at working via telephone ask clients to draw a rationale as they deliver it. They use the analogy of a clockface starting at 12 for a maintenance rationale of triggers, thoughts, feelings and behaviours. This is surprisingly active and collaborative from the outset. Clients with a computer or smartphone can opt for audio-visual appointment and can observe non-verbal cues. Frequent summarising is important by the clinician, as is two-way feedback during remote working. Remote working is predominantly self-directed rather than therapist-assisted, with planning and reviewing graded exposure, behavioural activation and experiments, etc. using diaries and worksheets. In building a case load, regular practice and clinical supervision is a continuation of DPR from training. Client contact repeatedly reinforces the procedural element of DPR, in turn allowing repeated and arguably deeper reflective experiences via weekly clinical supervision. competency assessment is conducted in weeks 5 and 6 with role-plays of an assessment and a treatment session, which must be passed before seeing live clients. This DPR based competency assessment is an additional level of rigour where practitioners are recruited from non-graduates and non-health professionals, more akin to an apprenticeship model for low-intensity CBT training . A further 3 days of workshops are delivered remotely via videoconference over the 12 months training. Once qualified, low-intensity CBT practitioners continue to receive 2 hours monthly group supervision and 1 hour of weekly individual supervision.",

Working remotely means that much of the online content is declarative, therefore repeated procedural role-plays are built in during and between sessions to meet skills acquisition requirements. Seeing live clients early in training is a deliberate continuation of the DPR process. This allows trainees to quickly build up a caseload supported by weekly supervision as an ongoing reflective component. This repeated practice over 12 months allows for submission of clinical competencies as a means to assess and endorse CBT skills. See Fig. 1 for a timeline of the low-intensity training.",

            "text": "In 2017 Australian high-intensity IAPT training commenced for existing health professionals. The high-intensity service was deliberately designed to run alongside the existing low-intensity service and became Australia's first stepped care IAPT service with a low-intensity CBT and high-intensity CBT step. High-intensity CBT trainees receive 1 hour per week clinical supervision over the 12 months delivered remotely. On completion of high-intensity CBT training they receive a minimum of 1 hour per month supervision, again delivered remotely. High-intensity trainees see clients and receive CBT supervision after 2-week initial training, with client contact being a continuation of role-play practice as per the DPR model (Bennett-Levy, 2006) . High-intensity trainees complete a blend of online and face-to-face workshop in adherence to the IAPT high-intensity curriculum and NICE guidance. This covers more complex presentations than low-intensity CBT including obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Due to high-intensity trainees already having caseloads, e.g. in their work as psychologists, competency assessments are completed differently from low-intensity training, with a mid-and end-of-course clinical competency. Mid-course competency requires submission of a CBT assessment session. End-of-course competency requires submission of two treatment sessions, one for depression and one for anxiety. These are assessed using a validated competency tool, the ACCS (Muse et al., 2017) . See Fig. 2 for a timeline of the high-intensity training.",

            "text": "Working remotely offers flexibility for service users and case management efficiencies for workers to tackle practical problems of distance, travel and time. Operating remotely is essential across vast distances. It can be adopted by face-to-face services temporarily or partially in times of crisis such as pandemics. Certain resources and requirements are needed to optimise this. Service providers operating remotely have noticed few or no disruptions due to coronavirus even with workers and clients in isolation. The IAPT Competencies Frameworks (ucl.ac.uk/research/research-groups/core/ competence-frameworks) for therapy and supervision could expand to include basic competencies for remote working. Interventions and principles for remote training, supervision and therapy are the same as face-to-face CBT, with the difference being in the delivery method. Caution should be expressed during a pandemic with limited opportunities for clients to conduct 'socially based' experiments or homework activities. CBT may require more creativity with idiosyncratic treatment plans during periods of enforced isolation. In some cases, this may be worth postponing if sufficient opportunities to test the model cannot be made possible. Delivering low-intensity CBT training and therapy entirely remotely appears an acceptable option to clinicians and service users. Certain high-intensity CBT skills workshops may be better delivered face-to-face. If delivered online, the procedural and reflective components may require augmentation. This can be done insession using virtual breakout facilities of the VLE for skills role-plays and exercises or by setting them between online sessions. Additionally, clinical supervision can incorporate these more active training and education elements on top of case discussions. A DPR model can facilitate and structure skills acquisition during remote learning. The evidence base for delivering CBT by more flexible methods is emergent but further research is required. Further randomised controlled research into remote service delivery, building on Richards et al. (2015) are required, as are more randomised controlled trials to strengthen the evidence for or against remote training and supervision. Any prevailing attitude that working face-to-face is the gold standard in training and service delivery may need to be suspended until additional evidence is gathered.",

Soon clinicians may be able to incorporate this into remote working practices.
