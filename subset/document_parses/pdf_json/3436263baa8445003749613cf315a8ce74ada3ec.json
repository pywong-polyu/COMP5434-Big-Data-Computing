Refugee children specifically are often coping with trauma and loss and are at risk for mental health difficulties. With staggering numbers of people seeking refuge around the world and 50% being 18 years or younger, research examining the effects of trauma-focused therapies for refugee children with PTSD is highly needed. Both Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy and the child version of Narrative Exposure Therapy (KIDNET) have been used for refugees, although these treatment methods have not been systematically compared. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effectiveness of EMDR and KIDNET, compared to a waitlist control group and with each other, offered to refugee children.",

Despite variations in prevalence rates, there is a consensus that mental health problems, such as PTSD, are higher in refugee children than in general populations [7] . A recent systematic review reports prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) between 19 .0 and 52.7% among young refugees and asylum seekers in European countries [8] . Untreated PTSD can lead to the development of anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or mood disorders such as depression or substance use disorders [9] . Ultimately, children's personality development may be affected by early traumatization. To prevent these harmful long-term effects, effective and timely treatment of PTSD is necessary.",

Several studies on the effects of traumafocused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) report a decrease in trauma-related symptoms in children from war-affected countries after TF-CBT, compared to a control group [12] [13] [14] [15] . Although results are promising, intervention studies focusing on traumatized refugee children are not only scarce, but also often methodologically weak [16] . As traumatized refugee children and adolescents are increasingly being identified as a specific group within the mental health field and their number is growing, it is needed to shed more light on the effects of trauma-focused treatment for this population. In this paper, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is described focusing on the effectiveness of two trauma-focused treatments, KIDNET and EMDR, compared to a waitlist control group in reducing PTSD symptoms and comorbid symptoms in refugee children. In Tables 1 and 2, an overview of the studies on EMDR and KIDNET in refugee children is presented.",

While initially designed for adults, adaptations were made from the start for the use of NET in children 8 years and older: KIDNET [19, 23] . KIDNET is focused on reducing posttraumatic stress symptoms by the technique of narrative exposure. By working through the child's biography and focusing on the autobiographical elaboration of traumatic experiences, KIDNET facilitates processing traumatic memories of traumatic experiences from the child's recent past [29] . The effectiveness of NET in reducing PTSD symptoms in adults has been established in several randomized controlled trials and several studies show promising results regarding the effectiveness of KIDNET in treating children with PTSD [30, 31] .",

The core feature of EMDR is that an individual recalls a distressing memory while also performing a secondary task (dual taxation), usually engaging in sets of saccadic eye movements. Both tasks compete for limited resources of the working memory. As a consequence, the distressing memory becomes less vivid and emotional [33] . The effectiveness of EMDR in reducing PTSD symptoms in adults has been established in several randomized controlled trials [34] . Moreover, many studies show promising results regarding the effectiveness of EMDR in treating children with PTSD [35] . While EMDR has been recommended by international guidelines, only two studies have been known to us that assess the effects of individual EMDR treatment in refugee children with PTSD symptoms ( Table 2 ). The results of the two studies demonstrated significant improvement on PTSD symptoms [24, 25] . However, serious disadvantages to the study designs included a small sample size, the lack of randomization, lack of self-report instruments, restricted age range of participants, and possible bias in assigning children to the treatment conditions (unequal subsample sizes).",

To assess the presence of a (partial) PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity the CAPS-CA-5 for DSM5 will be administered. The CAPS-CA-5 is a 30-item structured clinical interview assessing PTSD symptoms based upon DSM5 criteria for children and adolescents aged seven and above. Symptoms in relation to the past month are examined. Symptom severity ratings are based on symptom frequency and intensity, with a severity score of two or higher indicating the presence of a symptom. CAPS-CA-5 can be administered reliably by different interviewers, with a kappa coefficient of .75 for the Dutch (DSM-IV) version [45] and .80 for the English DSM5 version [46] . The Dutch CAPS-5 is a carefully translated instrument with adequate psychometric properties [47] . Furthermore, both the child version and the parent version of the CRIES-13 will be administered. The CRIES-13 is a brief self-report measure to screen children aged 8 years and above for the severity of PTSD symptoms. The CRIES-13 consists of 13 items to assess intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal. The CRIES-13 child version has demonstrated good reliability among war-affected children and adolescents [42] . A study evaluating the reliability and validity of the CRIES-13 child version in a large clinically referred sample in the Netherlands (n=395) reported an internal consistency using Cronbach's \u03b1 of .89 and a test-retest reliability coefficient of .85 [48] .",

Repeatedly and consistently, refugee children are at increased risk for mental health problems in particular posttraumatic stress (symptoms as well as disorder). Yet negative mental health consequences of experiences with war, violence, and disruption are reluctantly acknowledged and refugees are for several reasons not inclined to seek mental health care, even when this is available. This paper describes a protocol of a randomized controlled trial in refugee children 8-18 years, who reside with at least one caregiver, in the Netherlands. Two trauma-focused interventions are offered at a location close to the living location of the child and his/her caregiver(s). Consort criteria guide the methodology of the study.
