Within these contexts, trainers should make use of all the information available to adapt and refine their instructional methods during the training process. Sentiment analysis (SA) can give immediate feedback of the emotions expressed and help in the training process, although it has been used infrequently in educational settings, slow to assess, and bound to interpretative issues, such as gender bias. This research aimed to design and evaluate a SA gender-sensitive method as a proxy to characterize the emotional climate of teacher trainees in an online course. An explanatory case study with mixed methods was implemented among students of the Interuniversity Master of Educational Technologies (N = 48). Participants' messages were analyzed and correlated with learning achievement and, along with a qualitative study of participants' satisfaction with the Master's degree, to validate the effectiveness of the method. Results show that sentiment expression cannot be used to exactly predict participants' achievement, but it can guide trainers to foresee how participants will broadly act in a learning task and, in consequence, use SA results for tuning and improving the quality of the guidance during the course. Gender differences found in our study support gendered patterns related to the emotional climate, with female participants posting more negative messages than their counterparts. Last but not least, the design of well-adjusted teachinglearning sequences with appropriate scaffolding can contribute to building a positive climate in the online learning environment.",

In these online learning environments, according to Buckingham Shum and Ferguson (2012) , trainees interact to clarify their intentions, ground their learning, engage in meaningful conversations, and receive feedback from their trainers. In the COVID-19 context, the use of virtual learning environments (VLE) has become even more widespread, leading educators to re-conceptualize fundamental issues of teaching (Crawford et al., 2020) . These changes probably will have lasting effects on learning environments in higher education and will need to be reviewed and adapted to the new normality (Khan & Jawaid, 2020) .",

Consequently, how trainers manage the group's emotional states can affect not only trainees' emotional outcomes, but also their learning and success in the course (Alonso-Tapia & Nieto, 2019) . From the perspective of formative assessment, it is crucial to have an accessible measurement of the emotional climate of a group so that trainers can adapt and refine their instructional methods as the course goes on. Although several instruments for characterizing a group's emotional climate can be found in the literature, these instruments are based on observational tools and questionnaires (Fraser et al., 2021) . To improve the quality of formative assessment, it might become necessary to explore other methods for characterizing the emotional climate of a group which, in online learning environments, could involve studying trainees' exchanges of textual data. This information could therefore be used by trainers to improve teaching and learning processes in general (Pinger et al., 2018) .",

In recent years, with the spreading use of big data analysis, institutions have been able to apply increasingly automatic computational techniques to analyze participants' data. One of the techniques that has emerged is sentiment analysis (SA) or opinion mining, which uses artificial intelligence to analyze textual data in natural language with the aim of interpreting the emotions expressed by a group of participants (Barr\u00f3n et al., 2020) .

Traditional instruments for measuring a group's emotional climate are based on thoroughly-designed questionnaires aimed at retrieving a subjective report from each participant about his/her psychological state. These include the questionnaires developed by Fraser et al. (2021) for STEM classrooms or by Alonso-Tapia and Nieto (2019) for high-school students. Other traditional instruments use observational tools to capture the behavioral activity to infer the emotional climate, such as the Classroom Assessment Scoring System of Pianta and colleagues (2008) . More recently, with the generalization of the use of sensors, implicit detection of emotion has involved measuring physiological data, such as heartbeat, facial expressions, etc. (Feidakis, 2016) . However, none of these three approaches fits well in online learning environments. Firstly, the behavioral and measurement of physiological data is impractical. Secondly, because the asynchronous nature of online learning environments-even though some activities can be carried out synchronously-makes it futile to try to measure a group's emotional climate at a particular moment in time.",

Similar patterns were found in the analysis of female and male posts in social media (\u00c7oban et al., 2021) . These authors also found that male users posted more positive messages as they grew older, while the reverse was observed for females. Therefore, age would also influence the gendered patterns observed.

Second, an online questionnaire was distributed to participants immediately before the end using two open-ended questions (Appendix 2).

In order to train and test the SVM using a preliminary set-up to test the SVM's capacity to distinguish between positive, neutral, and negative information with a set of previously-tagged messages and their progressive improvement), we took advantage of TASS corpus, a set of tweets previously classified in different sentiment polarity in Spanish (Mart\u00ednez-C\u00e1mara et al., 2016; Villena-Rom\u00e1n et al., 2013 ) . A linear kernel was selected to classify the documents based on the fact that sentiment analysis corpus was classified in two different polarities. To preprocess text data, CountVectorizer tokenizer was selected. Furthermore, a pipeline was applied to get the best parameters for prediction. Finally, the parameters selected were as follows: { 'vect__max_df': 0.5, 'vect__min_df': 50, 'vect__max_features':1000, 'vect__ngram_ range': (1, 1), # unigramas 'cls__C': 0.2, 'cls__loss': 'squared_hinge', 'cls__max_iter': 1000}.

The aim of this phase was to transform opinions into a condensed form of information (categories) that could facilitate the subsequent comparison with results of SA and contrasts by gender. The process of defining and refining the opinion categories was based on a mainly-inductive cyclical process to optimize the total number of categories considered and the meaning given to each one. Two researchers participated in the refinement process to assess the consistency of the analysis. Opinion categories were defined with a positive or negative direction for contrasting with participants' results in the SA and were structured into two families: Master's training capacity for professional development (10 categories); and Master's managing capacity (3 categories). Additionally, identification categories (i.e., gender and teaching experience) were applied to participants' satisfaction. After matching opinion categories to identification categories, the corresponding \u03c7 2 statistic was calculated for two nominal variables to assess possible differences of participants' satisfaction according to their gender. From the analysis of the total frequencies and gender differences, relevant opinion categories were identified and considered for the purposes of this study. Therefore, relevant opinion categories were defined as the ones with a minimum frequency of 10 participants or with a significant difference in the gender distribution. The final categories and their frequencies are displayed in the results section.",

(2017) that female participants expressed more-negative views about their progress and self-perceived evaluation in online environments, but contradicts findings of \u00c7oban et al. (2021) and Sun et al. (2020) . Hence, the effect of participants' gender on emotional climate could be different according to the area, which reinforces the need for integrating a gender perspective in SA. When analyzed in detail, ratings within the diverse forums were different, suggesting different implications for participants in different forums and for the emotional climate of the group. Ratings in the discussion forum (EA1) were a highly positivite compared with other forums (around 73% to 78% for the 2018-19 and 2019-20 cohorts, respectively). According to the results and prior literature, this positive emotional climate can be related to the significant emphasis on the collaborative nature of the activity, as well as by the fact that both groups were composed mostly by females. Hence, females tend to enjoy morecollaborative activities compared with their male peers according to Atwood-Blaine and Huffman (2017). These findings also explain why a more-positive climate was found for the 2019-20 cohort for which women were in the majority. Therefore, and adding to previous research results, participants' gender distribution could be a relevant factor to consider when designing collaborative learning environment in online courses.",

Therefore, the overall preparation in terms of prior knowledge of topics and self-regulation were appropriate, which is key factor identified by Bakhtiar and colleagues for generating a positive socio-emotional climate in online collaborative learning environments.

In particular, sentiment expression in the forum related to the quantitative analysis activity (EA2) was linked with the most-negative climate for both cohorts. This task is usually considered as the most difficult by trainee teachers, with participants perceiving themselves as less competent and, consequently, sharing less-positive sentiments, in line with previous results (Djudin, 2019) . Hence, participants' preparation or self-regulation prior to the task was perceived as insufficient by trainees compared with the assignment, thus hampering a positive collaborative experience, in line with Bakhtiar et al. (2018) . These results show how the design of well-adjusted teaching-learning sequences with appropriate scaffolding also contributes to a positive climate in online learning environments, where participants feel that they are prepared to tackle the next step in the learning pathway. The relevance of participants' self-regulation skills in creating positive climates in online learning environments is also evidenced by the results of SA in the two cohorts. Participants in the 2018-19 cohort became more positive as they progressed in the subject, unlike the 2019-20 cohort participants who scored lower in the SA of the final activity (FA) compared with EA1. This trend could be related with participants' teaching experience and age, because the 2018-19 cohort was more novice and younger compared with the 2019-20 cohort. \u00c7oban et al. (2021) highlight that older female participants-a majority in the studied course-express more-negative messages. Following this interpretation, the more-experienced cohort would have initially higher self-confidence, which would have not been satisfied with the development of the subject's results-explaining the decrease in the positiveness of the climate. Conversely, the more-novice cohort would have less self-confidence initially but grow it during the subject-explaining the increase in the positiveness for this group. In summary, age would also act as a relevant factor influencing the climate of the group, mediated by possible differences in participants' self-regulation skills in line with Bakhtiar et al. (2018) .",

These differences seem to support gendered patterns found in SA results related to the emotional climate, with female participants posting more negative messages than their counterparts. Male participants are considered to hold more-positive self-perceptions compared with women (Shapiro et al., 2017) but, because no gender differences were found in participants' achievement, we interpreted male participants' more-critical opinions in the final satisfaction questionnaire as suggesting disappointment with the program caused by a mismatch with their self-perceived capacities (Table 3) . Conversely, female participants, who had expressed fewer positive sentiments in all forums but had achieved similar results than their male counterparts, would express a higher level of satisfaction with their achievements. The coherence between these results constitutes a first step in the validation of the effectiveness of the SA developed as a proxy of emotional climate.",

Male participants showed morepositive self-perceptions but would possibly experience disappointment with the program at the end. The proposed SA method has been found to be sensitive to these gender differences. These findings lay the ground to continue exploring the expansion of the potential of SA results as a comprehensive and real-time measurement of trainees' emotional climate and leveraging the potential of online learning environments for tailoring trainees' needs.",

Hence, automating SA would be favored between courses using the same VLE, which is usually the case within the same institutions. Otherwise, an adaptation of the natural-language processing code for retrieving the forum text would be needed for different VLEs (Villena-Rom\u00e1n et al., 2015) .",

However, we argue that these two aspects represent minor issues for large institutions, compared with the interpretative potential and the understandable results retrieved by this technique. Finally, because of the novelty of our proposal with Spanishspeaking participants, a greater number of analyzed messages in Spanish would help to refine the analysis and contribute with more insightful information for better understanding participants' learning needs and designing more gender-inclusive spaces. The interpretative potential, its degree of automatization, and the type of results retrieved, complemented with the qualitative analysis, make this assessment method easy to use by trainers, who could benefit from real-time group feedback on students' emotional climate.",
