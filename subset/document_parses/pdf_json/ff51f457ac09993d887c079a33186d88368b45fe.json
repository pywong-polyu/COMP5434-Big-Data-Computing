            "text": "Page 2 of 16 Brown and Reid Smart Learning Environments (2022) 9:20 focused hybrid simulations employ either wearable technologies, standardized patients, web-based technologies, or some combination of all three. Unver et al. (2018) defines hybrid simulation as the \"combination of more than one simulation modality in a single teaching or evaluation exercise\". Most hybrid simulation models discussed in the literature are limited, by design, in their scope, in that they are designed for a specific scenario. High fidelity simulators, on the other hand, such as SimMan 3G, bundled with the support software and optional packages, can be quite versatile yet can be cost prohibitive for many institutions, coming in at approximately 70,000 USD per device (Alsaad et al., 2017) . Within the healthcare education context, Tuzer et al. (2016) defines simulation as \"a realistic teaching/learning strategy that could be used to promote cooperation and communication between the disciplines without any risk of harm to patients\" as compared to training with mannequins alone, which provides minimal opportunity to practice interpersonal communications (Devenny et al., 2018) . There is much evidence in the literature for a need to further increase the realism, or fidelity, of simulation scenarios (Dunbar-Reid et al., 2015) . Indeed, Dunbar-Reid et al. (2015) posits that providing tools for the healthcare instructors to enhance simulation fidelity 'will, in overcoming the criticism of limited realism in simulation, allow educators to teach and assess interpersonal competency during simulation exercises' . Dunbar-Reid et al. (2015) goes on to say, 'when it comes to simulation training, it is important that the simulation mirrors real life scenarios as close as possible, such that the actions and words of healthcare students approximate what is expected in actual clinical situations. Simulation in general has been shown to provide a realistic learning environment that can be controlled by the educator , thus minimizing environmental distractions and allowing for uninterrupted feedback (Tuzer et al., 2016) . Finally, hybrid simulation has been shown to promote higher skill performance, knowledge acquisition, expansion of critical thinking and self-confidence . During research conducted at Acibadem University, Istanbul, Turkey, hybrid simulation participants reported that the simulation'made it possible to develop a connection between their education and real-world situations' while at the same time feeling more motivated towards their studies . Indeed, simulations are a recommended approach to healthcare education, in integrating communication and psychomotor skills, as these skills are intertwined in a clinical environment (Basak et al., 2019) . Additionally, simulations have been integrated in recent times into nursing education programs for the purposes of improving student's self-confidence in clinical practice .",

            "text": "This research focuses on the effective use of hybrid simulations in healthcare education, with the following overall research question: How can healthcare education, through simulation, be enhanced using wearable and web-based technologies and standardized patients? This research explores whether a low cost, configurable hybrid simulation platform (a set-up which combines wearable and web-based technologies with a standardized patient in a flexible format to support multiple healthcare simulations) can be built using readily available web-based and wearable technologies, and whether such a platform can be used in multiple healthcare education simulations for a variety of healthcare disciplines. As this is a hybrid simulation platform, the use of a standardized patient is an integral element to the effectiveness of this approach. The literature Page 3 of 16 Brown and Reid Smart Learning Environments (2022) 9:20 supports the idea that the use of standardized patients is a beneficial way to teach highlevel knowledge and skills (Tuzer et al., 2016) . The use of standardized patients in nursing education, for example, has become very popular in recent years (Basak et al., 2019) . Additionally, research has shown that the use of a wearable device with a standardized patient allows the patient to appropriately respond to student's questions as well as react appropriately within the context of the scenario (Devenny et al., 2018) . This paper first explores the general background of hybrid simulations and standardized patients as well as describes the research methodology and context in which the data for this research was gathered, followed by the results of the research. A discussion is then presented on how others can benefit from this research as well as the boundaries of the research relative to the inferences drawn from the paper, finally recommendations for further research are suggested.",

Unver et al. (2018) found that students participating in a hybrid simulation training session better recognized the significance of communication and cooperation with team members. The same participants reported that the use of hybrid simulations improved their selfconfidence, critical thinking, and decision-making skills. Unver et al. (2018) also found that their hybrid simulation was so realistic that students reported a feeling that they were 'real nurses' during the simulation. Indeed Dunbar-Reid et al. (2015) argues that more authentic learning opportunities are made available to students with the use of hybrid simulations due to the 'enhanced physical, functional and psychological fidelity ' . Tunzer et al. (2016) concluded that hybrid simulation as a teaching modality should be 'integrated into nursing curriculum as an active learning methodology' that is linked to clinical practice. Unver et al. (2018) found that integrating hybrid simulation experiences throughout a nursing curriculum was seen as a positive experience by students. Similarly, Nassif et al. (2017) found that the use of hybrid simulation fosters a perception of ease and comfort by the students which could boost the student's confidence in their ability to effectively communicate with the patient. Indeed, hybrid simulation was a recommended approach to healthcare education by the participants of the Hybrid Simulation in Teaching Clinical Breast Examination study over the use of a tabletop model (Nassif et al., 2017) .",

Coffey et al.

Readily available Arduino software from the WiFiNINA library ((c) 2020 K. S\u00f6derby for Arduino) was used to control the vibration motor through a wi-fi connection.

The vibration was felt by the standardized patient, causing her to act accordingly. The number of vibrations was mapped to the appropriate cue, in that one vibration meant cue one, etc. As a back-up, simple cue cards were also created by the research team and made available to the principal investigator, so that they could be held up in line of sight of the actor in the event of a technology failure.

This channel of communication provided maximum flexibility and configurability in that any relevant information that was in keeping with the simulation scenario could be displayed and edited in real time. The bedside monitor display was designed using the free features of a website development software called WIX. This software allowed the researchers to develop a simple display showing applicable patient information. Once the site was developed, it was 'published' to the internet which allowed the site to be viewed using a browser on a second laptop connected to the internet, this second laptop acted as the bedside monitor display. The data was changed and updated in real time using the online editor built into the WIX website development platform. One of the challenges encountered during the initial design of the simulation was that changes made to the data did not show up on the bedside monitor unless the website in which the data was displayed was manually refreshed. This obstacle was overcome by simply installing an auto refresh plug-in on the Google chrome browser. This plug-in allowed the researchers to set the refresh time in the range of two seconds to sixty minutes, for this research a ten second interval was chosen as an appropriate refresh rate. This allowed enough time for the principal investigator to make changes to the data and publish the new data between refresh cycles, as required (Figs. 5, 6, 7) .",

However, most students completed the pre-test in just a few minutes as they were not able to answer, in any detail, most of the questions on the pre-test. 16 Brown and Reid Smart Learning Environments (2022) 9:20 Once the pre-test was completed, students moved to the simulation room where the standardized patient (the actor) was already laying on the hospital bed. The instructor conducted a short briefing prior to the commencement of the simulation, providing the students with the context of the simulation (a client in the community where home care is required) and the applicable patient information. Because the students were early in their program, the instructor elected to use the scenario as an 'instructor facilitated' simulation, where the instructor coached the students as a single group through the scenario, prompting them regarding what to ask the patient, and what to look for and observe. This approach is indeed different from that of a 'student-experienced' simulation where the student(s) are left alone to navigate the simulation in its entirety, thus determining themselves what questions to ask and what course of action to take as they observe and gather the necessary patient information. At the same time, the principal investigator was changing patient information as displayed on the bedside monitor and cuing the standardized patient with one of the three cues as previously rehearsed. The evidence of the actor's authenticity bore out when she received cue two, spontaneously sitting up and needing to go to the washroom. Both the instructor and the students thought that the actor really had to go to the washroom and thus were prepared to take a break from the simulation! Ironically, the instructor thought the need to use the washroom was not part of the simulation even though it was an agreed upon cue and discussed prior to the commencement of the simulation! This indeed speaks to the acting skills of the standardized patient, the realism of the simulation and the instructor's immersion in the moment as a professional healthcare provider. Indeed, it speaks to the advantage of employing a standardized patient. A similar effect was evidenced by Dunbar- Reid et al. (2015) where there appeared to be a blurring of the boundaries between simulation and reality.",

On the pretest, three of the students answered question one correctly; stating the signs of congestive heart failure whereas in the post test, 5 of the six students answered correctly. The results are almost the same for the second question regarding the patient's wellness identification; on the pre-test, three of the students answered the question correctly, whereas in the post-test, all six students answered the question correctly. In the pre-test only one student was able to provide the correct symptoms of congestive heart failure whereas in the post-test al 6 students were able to answer correctly. And finally, on the question of techniques which can be employed to ensure patient comfort upon the discovery of congestive heart failure, only one student was able to answer this question correctly, whereas in the post test, 2 students gave the correct answer. It should be noted that ethics approval did not allow the collection of any personally identifiable information from the pre or post-test, and therefore the data could only be compared as a group versus as individual students. These test results give strong indication that the configurable hybrid simulation platform used as an intervention enables students to meet course learning outcomes. These results address the first research question.",

All three students, who took part in the focus group, reported that the simulation was very realistic. As one student reported \"it felt very real when the patient sat up with shortness of breath\". Students reported the ease with which they were able to communicate with the patient because the patient was able to talk back. One student noted that the \"ability to talk with the patient vs a mannequin eliminated the awkwardness from the simulation\". This ease of communication may improve the student's future ability to 'connect' with their patients, as a patient's confidence in their caregiver has been shown to be greatly influenced by the caregiver's ability to interact in an effective and re-assuring way with the patient (Devenny et al., 2018) .",

These comments give a strong indication that the students gained confidence because of the simulation, and they felt that this confidence will be brought into the workforce. Feedback from focus group Page 14 of 16 Brown and Reid Smart Learning Environments (2022) 9:20 participants indicated that all students perceived that the use of a standardized patient along with the supporting technologies provided a very realistic learning experience that closely approximated a real-life scenario.

The web page authoring tool, WIX, did not incur any cost since only basic functions were required to develop a bedside monitor which were available in the free version of the tool. This research has shown that off the shelf hardware and software can be packaged into a hybrid simulation platform that can serve as a flexible, configurable teaching tool that can be easily employed in multiple disciplines for multiple scenarios. Considering its capabilities and cost, this simple yet flexible and easy to use hybrid simulation platform may be an appealing alternative for resource constrained educational institutions.",

The ease of use and affordability of the platform makes it a compelling tool to employ in any health-based education curriculum to enable students to meet a selection of course learning outcomes. The adaptability of the platform to a variety of scenarios within different health-care disciplines may make this a compelling approach for a diversified cross-section of learning institutions.The findings of this study are limited, as the research was conducted with only six students from one healthcare discipline, based upon one simulation scenario. Additionally, of the six students, only three were able to participate in the focus group which restricts the generalization of the conclusions regarding student's confidence and would require further studies with larger groups of students. A convenience sample was used to test the simulation platform as this was the only group of students available during the simulation timeframe which was during the world-wide Covid-19 pandemic. As this simulation was tested with first term students the results may be different for other disciplines or more advanced students.While this research has provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of hybrid simulations in educational settings, the context, and the restrictions in which this research was conducted have led to several future research recommendations. The first of these includes the testing of this simulation approach with a larger group of students to ascertain a greater cross-section of student type and abilities. Additionally, this research was conducted with first semester students; it would be helpful to conduct similar research with more advanced students to measure the attainment of learning outcomes and building of confidence. Research could also be conducted around the building of the student's confidence by interviewing the students several months after graduation to get a sense for the students' confidence in the workplace and how that confidence can be tied back to the simulation experience. Furthermore, expansion of the platform could be developed to determine the limits of the platform in providing more complex scenarios with multiple patient cues, more bedside monitor data and a larger assortment of body sounds relative to the scenario.Future research could also be conducted to use this simulation approach to develop emotionally engaging scenarios which may prepare students to better cope with a high emotion real-life situation. (Ignacio et al., 2015) .Author contributions CR designed the simulation scenario. CR determined the standardized patient cues. WB analyzed and interpreted the student data. WB was a major contributor in writing the manuscript. CR reviewed and edited each version of the manuscript. Both authors read and approved the final manuscript.",
