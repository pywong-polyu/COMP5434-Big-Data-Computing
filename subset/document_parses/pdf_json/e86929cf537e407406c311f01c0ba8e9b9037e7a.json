The rapidly increasing number of patients presenting with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring intensive care unit admission and ventilatory support has imposed a significant problem of sustainability for the healthcare system. As it became evident that \"flattening the curve\" of the contagion was mandatory in order to avoid a collapse of the healthcare institutions, the Italian government imposed several measures promoting social distancing. On March 1, schools and churches were closed throughout the country and strict hygienic measures were adopted in all public spaces. 1 Soon after, on March 8, the entire-Northern Italy region was quarantined 2 and 3 days later such restriction was extended to the entire nation. 3 The lockdown imposed the temporary closure of all nonessential businesses and people were invited to stay home except for essential needs (ie, \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

Recently, Garcia et al 5 have also reported a reduction in STE-ACS cardiac catheterization laboratory activations in the United States, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The causes underlying this phenomenon are largely unknown; however, a significant decrease in the incidence of cardiac diseases seems unlikely. A more sedentary indoor lifestyle may have reduced hospital admissions related to exertional angina but cannot explain the global reduction of SECDs. The hypothesis that patients may avoid referral to hospitals dealing with COVID-19 preferring \"COVID-free\" hospitals, cannot be claimed as well. interventions and pacemaker implantations, and all of these hospitals were designated to be involved in the management of COVID-19. Moreover, hospital referral for SECDs is based on local regulations limiting patient preference and a decrease in cardiovascular emergencies has also been reported in the nearest hub centers. 6 It is our opinion that fear of contagion might have contributed, at least in part, to the unpredictable reduction of SECDs. The ubiquitous presence of COVID-19 news on mass media, spread of fake news on social media, and the lack of verified information on the aforementioned dedicated precautions to limit in-hospital spread of the disease have contributed to the perception of hospitals as unsafe. According to this hypothesis, the drop of SECDs admissions to our division appeared more evident in the second and third 10-day period of March 2020 in an inversely proportional fashion to the curve of infected people, which at that time reached more than 100 000 cases in Italy. Interestingly, the greatest reduction was in non-STE-ACS admissions (\u221276%), probably because non-STE-ACS clinical presentation was more nuanced than that of STE-ACS. Consistently, we observed a higher proportion of pacemaker implantations for syncope and dizziness, which are more specific symptoms than generic fatigue. Our study does not provide data on mortality; however, considering the number of ACS of March 2019 in our hospital, 37 patients are missing. Based on data showing that the mortality of untreated ACS patients might be between 30% to 40%, 7 we could estimate about 11 to 15 ACS deaths in 1 month. Moreover, about 20% of patients presenting with symptomatic bradyarrhythmia require temporary emergency 8 ; therefore, of 23 patients absent in comparison with 2019, we could estimate a further 4 to 5 deaths. As proof of this, recent data suggest a significant increase in mortality in Udine during this period, which was not fully explained by COVID-19 cases alone. 9 For this reason, some cardiac patients may be dying at home. The impact of this phenomenon on the incidence of cardiovascular diseases in our region in the immediate future is hard to predict and may include higher incidence of late presenters complicated myocardial infarctions, as recently reported, 10 but also heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Our experience might suggest that other countries' healthcare institutions facing the initial phases of SARS-CoV 2 outbreak should adopt adequate public information policies. This might avoid, or at least cushion, this counterproductive phenomenon. In addition, cardiologists might reeducate the public to recognize early symptoms of life-threatening cardiac conditions and seek appropriate care in a timely fashion.",
