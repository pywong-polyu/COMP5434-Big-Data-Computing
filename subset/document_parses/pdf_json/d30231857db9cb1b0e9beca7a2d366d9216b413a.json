We defined impact as changes as a consequence of shielding to different aspects of everyday life, including actions and attitudes, healthcare delivery, mental health and well-being, lifestyle behaviours and social interaction. Some of these aspects such as access to healthcare delivery, have not been investigated for this population previously. In terms of attitudes and actions (AAA), emerging evidence from the USA suggests that despite concerns about infection, there was a lack of critical knowledge and limited changes to the plans or routines for people identified as at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection. 5 Therefore, to understand the impact, and contribute evidence for healthcare policy and networks to support people effectively and address unmet needs, we have delivered a time-sensitive study of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated UK government guidance has had on people identified as at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Specifically, we explored the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on access to healthcare, health and lifestyle behaviours, and mental health among UK adults identified as at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19.",

The survey comprised seven sections using a combination of closed and open questions: 1. Participant demographics. 2. Awareness, AAA relating to COVID-19 including whether participants had been diagnosed with COVID-19, experienced symptoms, and took actions to reduce infection and spread. 3. Impact of COVID-19 on management of health conditions and use of technology. 4. Impact on mental health and well-being, and depression including the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) 7 and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). 8 5. Lifestyle-related behaviours; diet, alcohol intake, physical activity type and amount, sleep quality and amount, smoking behaviour, e-cigarette use and recreational drug use. 6. Interaction with others regarding changes in other people's behaviour towards participants and feeling stigmatised and discriminated. 7. Additional comments.",

WEMWBS, PHQ-9 and concerns regarding COVID-19 were treated as continuous outcomes. Logistic regression models were used to model (1) actions taken to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19, (2) the impact of COVID-19 on the management of health conditions and (3) the technology platforms used to receive healthcare. Responses regarding the impact of COVID-19 on lifestylerelated behaviours were modelled using multinomial and adjacent-category logit models assuming proportional odds.

Following this, the 118 features (114 personality, 4 sentiment) were used as input into the multiple machine learning models, which were used in two settings: unsupervised (clustering) and supervised (classification or regression). We also investigated to what extent features obtained from a language sample are predictive of concerns, mitigating actions, impact on lifestyle behaviours, and well-being and depression scores in the context of COVID-19.

Nearly half of the sample reported using telephone care, with people aged 70 years or over less likely to use telephone care.

The majority of participants reported that they were satisfied with the new platforms and the information provided to manage their health conditions, and importantly would welcome continued use. Notably, people living in higher deprivation reported greater uncertainty about continued use which may identify concerns regarding internet poverty and inability to access digital care within this community. It is imperative that new technologies for supporting people living with health conditions are accessible for all, and does not disproportionately impact subgroups of the population and potentially widen health inequalities. Indeed, the higher prevalence of chronic health conditions among people living in more deprived communities, and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 infection on people living in poorer communities, highlights the need to address these concerns or uncertainty, given the likelihood of continued short-term and long-term use of new technologies to support patient care.",

This study demonstrates that for the majority of the sample, the pandemic has Open access led to worse mental health, with only 6% reporting an improvement. This was greater than the 35% of vulnerable people reporting worse mental health from the Office of National Statistics. 2 This may have been due to population differences but overall represents a consistent message that lockdown had a negative impact on people's self-reported mental health. In alignment, mean wellbeing was lower than the national average, 15 and depression was higher than that found in a general population sample from the COVID-19 Social Study. 16 The statistical analysis demonstrates that young women who are at risk of severe illness from COVID-19 report that their mental health has been most negatively impacted, have lower well-being and higher depression. This is consistent with other data showing that depression was higher in young people, 16 suggesting that the lockdown restrictions has more negatively impacted younger people and requires greater consideration. Moreover, people with a higher BMI or with multiple risk factors reported the highest depression, which may well be expected given the link between obesity and depression. 17 Given that this study highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people identified as at high risk of severe illness, policy-makers, community groups and health charities should consider how and in what ways they can best support or refer people whose mental health may have been compromised-which for many may go above and beyond their usual activities. This may involve policymakers considering how and in what ways to support in particular health charities to provide this care given economic challenges facing many during the pandemic and the reduction in access to clinical services. Artificial intelligence methods were applied to the data to consider how intrinsic factors, specifically personality and sentiment, derived from language samples could provide additional insights into people's actions and attitudes relating to COVID-19. Based on those intrinsic factors, the participants clustered into two groups. Crucially, the two groups differed significantly in their responses. Compared with the positive cluster (with higher dutifulness and cooperation scores and positive sentiment), the negative cluster had higher neuroticism, insecurity score and negative sentiment and reported higher levels of concern, greater negative impact on lifestyle behaviours, higher depression and lower well-being, alongside lower satisfaction with platforms used to deliver their healthcare during COVID-19. Furthermore, when predicting actions or attitudes for individuals, word vectors (features derived from language samples) achieved fairly good to good prediction performance (between 0.7 and 0.8 Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC)). On the other hand, personality and sentiment features were better predictors of depression and well-being than word vectors. Overall, current study data suggests that analysing language samples using Artificial Intelligence could yield useful insights into people's AAA relating to COVID-19 and effectively identify individuals at higher risk. Future work can explore the feasibility of using these methods as a preventative support measure, by using them within a digital environment to identify whether someone is likely to be more significantly impacted and offer them appropriate support.",

In addition, participants' weight impacted depression, with each unit increase in BMI, there was an increase of depression by 0.09; gender impacted depression with women reporting an average depression score that was 1.41 points higher than men; and participants with three or more indicators of high-risk reported greater depression with a mean increase of 4.78 compared with those with only one high-risk indicator (p<0.05 for all factors). Participants with chronic liver disease were more likely to report change to management of health conditions compared with prior to the COVID-19 lockdown (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.29 to 8.01); see online supplemental table S7. Participants with either diabetes, weakened immune systems or liver disease were more likely to report change to appointments (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.75); OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.93) and OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.16 to 12.16, respectively); whereas participants with spleen problems had a greater likelihood of reporting changes to their medications (OR 7.10, 95% CI 1.45 to 53.03). For each additional year of age, participants were more likely to report changes to elective surgery and their clinician (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06 and OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05, respectively). However, participants who were >70 years old were less likely to report other changes to regular healthcare support beyond those specified in the survey (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.88).",
