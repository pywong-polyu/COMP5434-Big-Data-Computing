            "text": "The marine sponges of the order Verongiida (Demospongiae: Porifera) have survived on our planet for more than 500 million years due to the presence of a unique strategy of chemical protection by biosynthesis of more than 300 derivatives of biologically active bromotyrosines as secondary metabolites. These compounds are synthesized within spherulocytes, highly specialized cells located within chitinous skeletal fibers of these sponges from where they can be extruded in the sea water and form protective space against pathogenic viruses, bacteria and other predators. This chitin is an example of unique biomaterial as source of substances with antibiotic properties. Traditionally, the attention of researchers was exclusively drawn to lipophilic bromotyrosines, the extraction methods of which were based on the use of organic solvents only. Alternatively, we have used in this work a biomimetic water-based approach, because in natural conditions, sponges actively extrude bromotyrosines that are miscible with the watery environment. This allowed us to isolate 3,5-dibromoquinolacetic acid from an aqueous extract of the dried demosponge Aplysina aerophoba and compare its antimicrobial activity with the same compound obtained by the chemical synthesis. Both synthetic and natural compounds have shown antimicrobial properties against clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Propionibacterium acnes.",

            "text": "representatives of this order lived in the waters of the world ocean in the province of Alberta on the territory of presentday Canada 505 million years ago. Modern representatives of the order retained the presence of the basic morphological principles of the structural organization of their skeleton, including their unique chitinous nature [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Due to the biomineralization of their branched chitinous skeletons, which can grow up to 1.5 m long [16, 17] these sessile sponges were able to effectively use their stiff and porous constructs for extracting feed by filtering water. However, as a result of water filtration, a huge number of pathogenic viruses, bacteria and fungi enter the inner space of sponge body and must be neutralized. Now, it is well recognized that verongiid sponges developed sophisticated and highly dynamic chemical defense system [18] due to biosynthesis over than 300 diverse brominated compounds (mostly bromotyrosines), which exhibit a rich variety of chemical structures [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] and have been classified into six main categories, including simple bromotyrosine derivatives, oximes, bastadins, spirocyclohexadienylisoxazolines, spirooxepinisoxazolines and other structural classes (see for overview [20] ). Functionally, they are recognized as multitarget drugs [29, 30] , with prominent antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic as well as antifouling activities (see for overview [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] ). Some of poriferan bromotyrosines showed antimetastatic activity [43, 44] as well as have been reported as effective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), that is a clinical marker of Alzheimer's disease [45] .",

            "text": "After early reports of isolation and characterization of such bromotyrosines as 3,5-dibromoverongiaquinol and the dimethyl ketal from two verongiid sponges Verongia fistularis and V. cauliformis in 1967 [52, 53] and 1970 [54] , numerous experimental and review reports concerning extraction, identification, biosynthesis, synthesis and modifications as well as practical applications of bromotyrosines of verongiids' origin have been published (see for overview [20, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] ). If the multitarget functionality of the biological action of bromotyrosines and their high pharmacological potential are no longer in doubt, the strategies for their extraction from biological raw materials or the development of key ways of efficient and inexpensive synthesis of corresponding analogous substances remain a controversial point. In connection with the latest developments in methods for cultivating verongiid sponges and extracting bromotyrosines with almost 90% yield, this direction is promising, although it may be limited by the specifics of environmental legislation in different countries [39] . An alternative way through the development of appropriate reactions for the synthesis of analogs takes place and is widely presented in the literature (see as examples [65] [66] [67] ). However, in this case, synthesis can be an expensive and multistep procedure. Organic solvents (i.e. methanol, chloroform, less often ethanol) are mainly used in most of the reported works for extraction of bromotyrosines from verongiid sponges, because of their hydrophobic nature. However, biologists are well aware that there are bromotyrosines that easily and very quickly diffuse into and miscible with seawater after mechanical damage of the sponge tissue due to predatory mollusk or fish [68] [69] [70] . Moreover, it is well known that bromotyrosines in representatives of Aplysinidae family within Verongiida order are synthesized within spherulocytes [68, 71] , highly specialized cells found within skeletal highly brominated [72, 73] chitinous fibers [37] (Fig. 1 ). These cells seem to be very sensitive to changes in their environment. They are capable of rapid self-destruction and the release of selected bromotyrosines (i.e. aerothionin and homoaerothionin) into sponge mesophyll as well as surrounding seawater [69, 70] .",

We anticipate that insertion of spherulocytes-rich skeletons of this sponge will lead to exudation of large amounts of bromotyrosines determined by osmotic shock. Due to the promising nature of this group of sponges in terms of their cultivation under marine farming conditionsand the prospects for practical application [39] , we considered it expedient to determine the presence of water-soluble bromotyrosines in them. Such bromotyrosines acted as an inspiration for the in vitro syntheses of corresponding analogs. Consequently, an additional goal of this study was an attempt to synthesize an analogue of water-soluble bromotyrosines in laboratory conditions and to conduct comparative antimicrobial tests on selected pathogenic and clinical bacterial strains.",

The compounds 1-3 have been previously reported to be present in A. aerophoba and other representatives of the order Verongiida [39, [75] [76] [77] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] , but this is the first report where these compounds were obtained from a room temperature aqueous extract of the sponge. 3,5-Dibromoquinolacetic acid (2) (Fig. 2) was first obtained by [54] as a component of the mixture resulted by acidic hydrolysis of the new brominated derivative obtained from the MeOH extract of the marine sponge Verongia fistularis. These authors also described first the direct synthesis of the 3,5-dibromoquinolacetic acid [54] , which included stages of bromination and oxidation as well as the final phase of chromatographic purification. The structure of the 3, 5-dibromoquinolacetic acid was confirmed by spectral data. Later, Minale et al. [76] obtained another secondary metabolite named aeroplysinin-2 (1) (Fig. 2) from the sponge A. aerophoba and defined its stereochemical structure. When aeroplysinin-2 was left, it was converted into 3,5-dibromoquinolacetic acid via a probable photochemical reaction [76] . Despite the species was later revised by researchers to A. cavernicola [20, 89] , aeroplysinin-2 was confirmed to be present in A. aerophoba [82, 84] .",

In natural environment, bioconversion of complex brominated isoxazoline derivatives into simple molecules occurs in 40 s [92] that represent a \"vivid example for dynamic bioconversions of natural products that generate highly efficient chemical weapons precisely when and where needed\" [34] .The rates of aerothionin exudate into artificial seawater were measured as 7.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u03bcg min \u22121 g \u22121 dry weight of the verongiid sponge A. fistularis for Table 1 against S. aureus (a-c); P. acnes (d) and K. pneumoniae (e) (scale bar 1 cm) native, undamaged and in well-lit shallow water habituating organism [68] . However, after a simulated injury, the sponge responds by exuding 10-100 times of the regular amounts under regular conditions. To the best of our knowledge, extraction of bromotyrosines from verongiid sponges using artificial seawater under laboratory conditions is still unknown. Therefore, we suggest that corresponding experiments with deionized as well as seawater extracts obtained from the sponge A. aerophoba under UV-light exposure in dependence of intensity, time and temperature as well as oxidation rate should be carried out soon. Unfortunately, there is still lack on data concerning the antimicrobial activities of natural 3,5-dibromoquinolacetic acid in contrast to the synthetic compound. There is a report about the moderate activity of 3,5-dibromoquinolacetic acid against gram-positive bacteria, without any effect against gram-negative bacteria [77] . (3,5-Dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid (5), which was obtained through a bromination step of synthesis, did not show any microbial growth inhibition as well.",

A broad antimicrobial spectrum for aeroplysinin-1 in micromolar range was also reported [20, 39, 75, 88] . These results may represent the potential of using future preparation of aqueous extracts containing a mixture of bromotyrosins'. Similarly, commercially available preparations containing a mixture of components in extracts with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity due to synergistic effect of the components.",

In contrast to previously reported data, while defining MIC and MBC for the synthetic and natural 3,5-dibromoquinolacetic acid, the MIC and MBC values were equal for both compounds at 125 \u00b5g/mL for S. aureus and 31.2 for E. faecalis. P. acnes (recently renamed as Cutibacterium acnes) [93] is the cause of inflammation and pustule formationin in 650 million people (reported in 2010) to have had chronic skin infection known as acne disease worldwide [93] . Interestingly, the alternative marine drug, named sargafuran, isolated from the brown algae Sargassum macrocarpum previously showed an MIC value of 15 \u03bcg/mL against P. acnes [94] . This value is twofold of the MIC value of 3,5-dibromoquinolacetic acid against P. acnes. Therefore, our results presented here represent the potential of using 3,5-dibromoquinolacetic acid as a scaffold that can be developed into novel and more effective drugs against C. acnes. Unfortunately, exact mechanisms of antibacterial activity of bromotyrosines remain poorly investigated. It was suggested that they can inhibit the DNA synthesis and, probably, DNA gyrase [20] . Recently, due to COVID problematic, studies on antiviral activity of poriferan secondary metabolites are in trend. The ability of marine demosponges to collect viruses in their bodies due to their water filtering activity is well recognized [95, 96] . How sponges neutralize viruses is still unknown. Intriguingly, selected bromotyrosines (i.e. aeroplysinin-1, 19-deoxyfistularin 3, purealidin B, fistularin 3 and 3-bromo-5-hydroxy-O-methyltyrosine) effectively inhibited HIV replication [97] . Corresponding experiments with isofistularin-3, aeroplysisin and 3,5-dibromoquinolacetic acid against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are in progress now in our Lab.",

Previously, the attention of researchers was exclusively drawn to lipophilic bromotyrosines, the extraction methods of which were logically based on the use of appropriate organic solvents. Without a doubt, this was not a biomimetic approach, because in natural conditions, sponges actively extrude bromotyrosines that are miscible with the watery environment. We suggest that, the existence of such watersoluble bromotyrosine derivatives, including 3,5-dibromoquinolacetic acid in an aqueous extract of the dried demosponge A. aerophoba, after a storage of the sponge at room temperature in the light, is an example of a chemical conversion of more complex bromotyrosines, that is originally exist in the sponge into smaller molecules. Such phenomenon reported in this study can be used as the basis for the development of new, effective and easy-to-solve key way for the extraction of certain bromotyrosines from aqueous extracts of their sponges.",
