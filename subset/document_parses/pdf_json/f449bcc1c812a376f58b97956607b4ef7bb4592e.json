This involves the free-flowing movement of knowledge, information, people, labour, resources, investments, industries and so forth. The significance of the mobilities turn literature within the humanities and social sciences is vast. This area of scholarship is still developing rapidly, in many interesting ways and it certainly has important connections to the development of 'landscape-isms'. The intention in this chapter is to provide an overview of this body of literature as it relates to the comparative context of Western versus Eastern Europe in terms of hitchhiking's survivability. It explores the idea of im/mobility in more detail, especially as a conditioned possibility of existence. The theme of mobility has seen yet another explosion of interest in contemporary ethnological and anthropological theory. Indeed, many scholars have regularly spoken of a mobilities return. Yet perhaps it is more appropriate to speak of a spin-or maybe even more apt still, to consider this trend as a u-turn-emphasising the utopian dimensions of this body of literature. Grounded in ethnography conducted within Western Europe, this study will nonetheless span wider crosscultural and spatio-temporal spheres when considering mobility: from the fleeting movement of hitchhikers in the Baltics which may last only for moments (or a lifetime), through to the fairly regular movement patterns of uber-taxi drivers; from the pseudo-pilgrimage ascensions of abandoned post-industrial or Soviet-era buildings by urban explorers, through to the existential longue-dur\u00e9e trope of 'free travel', as it occurs in the textual depictions of certain Eastern European poets as well as in the region's audiovisual representations made by other important cinematographic auteurs.",

            "text": "I have thus begun to uncover some of the hermeneutic significance of hitchhiking as a physical practice and compare this to how it occurs in different genres and fields. Some of the recent lessons about mobility from phenomenologically influenced conceptualisations and approaches are that the complexities and dialectics of transient environments grow in terms of dealing with concerns for the embedded or embodied (Fischer 2014) . Delineating mobility in a phenomenological framework is thus a deliberate attempt to map out the life-paths of human beings as a progressive move from 'home' to 'world', or from hearth to cosmos as the geographer Yi-Fu Tuan (1996) would say. With time, people grow into larger worlds. Not to do so is often seen as to live a stunted life. According to anthropologist Michael D. Jackson, the human's stages of maturation are celebrated in all cultures, because at each stage one enters into larger spheres of activity, responsibility and mastery (Jackson 1996) . A significant judgement against patriarchal societies is that women are made to stay in the domestic realm. Similarly, a judgement against hierarchical societies is that members of the lower classes are confined to limited spheres of interaction and subjected to forced migrations, whilst the elite have the possibility of enjoying the world without the fear of forced displacement. They are privileged in being both cosmopolitan and grounded (de Beauvoir 1960) . The ideals of the auto-stop community generally seek to extend this privilege to more and more members who once suffered constraint, but eventually no longer need to feel that the edge of their home is the edge of their world. This link, which I'm arguing exists between an ethos at the heart of hitchhiking and a phenomenological approach, is one that emphasises empathy. It highlights a concern for being sensitive towards, and thus drawing attention to, people's negative experiences. In thinking in terms of embodiment and agency, the notions of alternative mobilities such as narrowboat or barge living, caravanning as well as traveller settlements are all relevant (Aiken 1976; Okely 1987) . It is very much in this context of striving to understand the social significances of alternative travel schemes that the present work situates itself.",

Under these auspices, mobility becomes a site where the ego is not only produced but is also contested. Moral subjects are forged, represented, enacted, pathologised, witnessed and judged. Also under these auspices, the focus of interest shifts towards what is taken for granted, the mundane. Not only is the everyday a site of social importance but so too are the objects that are discarded, not noticed or ridiculed as trivial and meaningless. Here cars and road infrastructures are heralded for their primal cultural significance.

            "text": "Several social scientists consider that mobility is one of the more stratifying factors of everyday life. In such a context, it works as a model, mirroring class, position, cultural capital and similar indicators of social strata (Bourdieu 1984) . Spatial mobility thus functions as a tool, exposing the social and individual dimensions of privilege, whilst uncovering shortterm transnational displacement. One of my objectives in playing with fl\u00e2neurism, at least in terms of the stop and go motion of hitchhiking, is to provide a descriptive and analytical portrait for how some erratic travel can slow down time (Zinganel 2013) . By occasionally grounding the hectic mayhem of everyday twenty-first-century living, the non-linear narratives embedded in hitching adventures are full of potential; to free up our stifled imaginations and to unclog the silted up gutters of privilege. Consequently, accounts of what we may label 'adventure capital'-a subcategory of socio-cultural capital, should be genuinely destabilisingguiding us in the direction of hopeful futures, but equally harbouring a darker side. Yet the latter, the more sinister horizon for travel capital, is hardly new itself. It has existed for over a hundred years now-a murderous hand-axe to engineering's exploits of progress. Dialectically, however, we should nonetheless be open to concealed flashes of inspiration in order to point out alternative directions, or ways for rediscovering unnarrated messages from the past. Or to re-invent those horror stories that the media and analogous spheres of audiovisual/literary entertainment have glorified with the sensationalistic shock-horror techniques so vividly illustrated in A Clockwork Orange. 3 At the turn of the century, in parallel with a significant shift in the humanities and social sciences for an about-face in considerations towards the realm of mobilities (itself seen as turning, perhaps spinning around incessantly these days), such authors as Kaufmann et al. (2004) introduced the holistic idea of 'motility'. With the assistance of such qualifying notions as access, competence, appropriation, surveillance, subversion and so on, motility describes both the individual and social capacities or potential for achieving mobility. This term provides the opportunity for a set or nexus of notions to illustrate with nuance the setting of a situation's relational levels of mobility. It thus depicts forms of capital that may be linked with, exchanged for or repressed by other forms of capital. Compared with Pierre Bourdieu's (1986) definitions of capital from twenty years before, motility is a broader, vaguer and flatter (less hierarchical) term that some authors would even suggest acts as an umbrella concept. Due to its holistic character, however, motility claims to be more existential, allowing for the potential to adjust individual perspective to the changing dynamics of hyper-mobile modern societies. It offers pertinent methodological and analytical approaches that permit researchers to expand the range of capitals without abandoning other insights from studies on spatial and social mobility.",

Motility, as a hyper-hybrid notion, thus allows us to combine the spatial mobilities of social and individual experience. This is then reminiscent of Bourdieu's 'field of possibilities' as being ever regulated by structural dispositions, hence the range of one's capital and ultimately their habitus (Bourdieu 1984: 10) . Such intellectual circumnavigations allow Sven Kesselring (2005) to claim that mobilities cannot exist in the realm of pure freedom. Instead, they form ways in which individuals adapt their personal needs, wished and demanded from the collective conditions for the mobile. That is, from the options for creating one's life through movement whilst being influenced, not to say shaped, by rules and structures.",

The walls are the desk against which he presses his notebooks; news-stands are his libraries and the terraces of caf\u00e9s are the balconies from which he looks down on his household after his work is done. (1980: 37) Inevitably men, fl\u00e2neurs would stroll through the city to kill the time afforded to them by wealth and education. Their tendency for nonchalance meant that they would objectify the masses, treating the other passers-by and the surrounding architecture as riddles for interpretative pleasure. The act of the fl\u00e2neur symbolised privilege and the liberty to move about the city observing from a distance, not interacting; consuming the sights through a controlling but rarely acknowledged gaze, directed as much at other people as the goods for sale. An anonymous face in the multitude, the fl\u00e2neur was free to probe for clues that were unnoticed by other people, simpletons, caricaturised as domestic beings. In making apparent the spatial inversion between public and private, Benjamin brought the outside in and placed the inside out. This inversion was intended as a social subversion whereby leisure became one of the main tools behind creating an enduring persona for the fl\u00e2neur as someone not confined to an increasingly State-manipulated domestic sphere but who had the capacity, freedom and cultural capital to live within the world.",

With some socialist influence, they divided the world between those who were producers and those who were not. Populists were antagonistic to the values of the dominant leaders of the business community and shared a sense of urgency and an edge of desperation about the demand for reform. And it is this connection between a desire for change, increased leisure and the ability for movement through different spaces that connects the fl\u00e2neur to adventure. But despite being mobile in a number of senses, this urban type of trickster is nonetheless the embodiment of idleness, at least with regard to the production of socio-economic value. So we need to introduce another component before we can apply the relevance of this category to the topic of adventure. This additional element, also a product of modernity and the industrial revolution, is acceleration, rapidity, speed.",

For attention to the actual social experience of modernity's fascination with acceleration, one must move away from traditional theorists to the sociological impressionism of someone like Simmel.

One of the lessons from their studies is that urban movement is hegemonically restricted and controlled. Walkers exist within the built environment that they explore. Whilst some possibilities are denied to them, other possibilities open up. De Certeau calls this 'walking rhetorics' which suggests the idea of creativity for getting around obstacles. Now in the realm of 'buildering' (the climbing of buildings), urban exploration and parkour/free running, such ideas of overcoming the restrictions of urban planning through acrobatics and accelerated movement are part of the core rationale for these practices (Laviolette 2011 (Laviolette , 2016 .",

His work reveals the often pessimistically dark association between the dangers, risks and implicit violence associated with acceleration and the typically modern sensual aesthetic experiences it can engender. This is a discourse which embraces a range of transgressive and rebellious impulses chafing the smooth surface order of institutional modernity. And out of this is formed a narrative of speed which is 'unruly' both in its orientation and in its expression. Subversive and impetuous, conjoining hedonism with a particular sort of existential hedonism, this discourse constantly teeters on the brink of collapse into violence and chaos. (Tomlinson 2007: 9) From such a position, the euphoric landscape in which plays the accelerated body is no longer an enveloping sphere of tracts, expanses and panoramas. Rather, it is a beckoning foreground of special sites, niches and locations, each significant for how it technically engages the body in risky play. Indeed, the modern player as sensation seeker encounters the thrillscape as a patchwork of technical possibilities, each to be explored, tested and evaluated with the rules of the game and the singularly trained body in mind. To this attuned and sometimes exceptionally well-trained practitioner, vaguely defined assemblages of natural features transform into distinctly technical spaces and precisely describable arenas that invite exploration, penetration, naming, commentary, repetition and reputation. Whereas the idyllic landscape of the spirit offered the alienated subject the sublimely panoramic envelopment of backgrounds, the ecstatic landscape of the body decisively reverses this symmetry. For the new adventurer, panorama only really provides a setting for foregrounds that, in the game, grounds their body and rivets one's attention.",

It follows that by incarcerating sexuality, the automobile has the potential of alienating its youthful drivers from the sexuality that comprises them. And so, the elevation of motor vehicles to cultic status conveys malignant control of the machine over individuality. Some authors have even argued that the erotic appeal of the car derives from the combination of such feelings as control, omnipotence and self-enclosed regression.

The use of multiple meanings surrounded by a variety of discourses is what Daniels advances as the eloquence of images. Surely, however, the landscape is equally a livedin environment. Images provide one type of reality yet every landscape harnesses a wealth of human potential (Bender 1998). Roads, streets, avenues and boulevards are not simply links between points or corridors for travellers. Concrete and cobblestones literally consume space. In an average city more space is dedicated to the movement of vehicles than to most other activities. By relying principally on pictorial material, Daniels is able to quickly shift narratives but he does not put into question the observational points upon which he stands. For him, we have historical contexts which explain specific views and vistas. But we do not examine how to move between or change certain platforms of power. By examining the landscape from a static position, the visual analyst only changes his or her vantage point, without connecting or moving between the shifting perspectives. Constructions of historical contexts can be problematic when one is relying on images generated by the elite. In short, such a methodology helps recreate unequal balances of power. This is exactly where J. B. Jackson (1984) would be up in arms, by pointing out the absence of any vernacular landscape understanding. In essence his mission was to reveal the traveller's path, a path that is latent with power since it may not be accessible or noticeable to all. Jackson therefore reminds us that the tact of social scientists is suited to revealing the power latent within the layers of the landscape itself. This only becomes possible by relying on actual observations of human mobility. In so doing, we can uncover the patterns to city transport which are not obvious from the layout of the transportation network.",

Such a humanistic perspective examines human-environment relationships in terms of embodied ideas. It admits that what we see is greatly influenced by our attention, intention and interest. Further it is grounded in history, where events are always present, ever recurring and fused to terrain; where events are, for all intents and purposes, trans-temporal: renewed and confirmed each time that the words of stories, myths and legends are written or spoken (Ryden 1993) .",

And since different landscapes are peopled with different cultural groups, he or she is exposed to a vast extent of new experiences and demands which intensifies social as well as environmental learning. Dealing with this flood of environmental and cultural uncertainty is a lesson provided by few other mediums of education. ii. In perception studies, the discourse on sense of place frequently overlooks the dynamic aspects of such senses. The sensations giving substance to locales and landscapes are in perpetual flux however. New favourite places can be discovered or old ones abandoned as long as movement remains possible. We often consider the options of movement and relocation to free ourselves from the past. Indeed, feelings and place are intimately linked and in many cases the act of fleeing somewhere is driven by intense emotion or the desire to start life afresh. Consequently, when we 'hit the road' we are perhaps perceptually impaired given the significant push forces from the hearth. Because of our vulnerability, negative or dangerous images and situations might be ignored but the distortion need not be negative. Periods of mobility can also engender a heightened sense of environmental or cultural awareness. iii. Environmental preferences have an intriguing role in stimulating movement. People often discuss decisions to change residence in terms of the socio-cultural environment. This is equally true for travel plans. The traveller's anticipation of what to expect derives from numerous sources such as popular travel advertisements, hearsay, novels, films and so forth. Such discussions and information thus heighten our awareness of our own preferences. They blend together with our actual experiences to modify the preconceptions of our environmental information. Based on this information, we create patterns of familiar types of preferred places and panoramas which help guide our movement. iv. Soul searching whilst travelling is a common motif in road narratives. In this sense, the destination is never quite as important as the process of getting there-a process that bathes in the freedom from commitment and responsibility. Mobility thus opens to the esoteric. Movement is the means; the development of a kaleidoscopic self-image is the pursuit and a more satisfying self is the destination.",

Arguably perhaps, some authors have even suggested that car-oriented transport has predominantly altered our perception of place and replaced it with a rootless or placeless space-Marc Aug\u00e9's (1995) archetypal non-place. The car is now the instrument through which 'Westerners' express most of the social bonds linking them to their institutions and to each other (Bogart 1977; Sachs 1984; Widmer 1990) . Clear boundaries and centres of exurbansuburban landscapes have consequently disappeared. The claim would thus be about auto-mobility contributing to the dehumanisation of the landscape and to the de-authentication of sensorial experience. More recently, however, Tim Dant has chronicled a shift in attitudes. He indicates that for the first time in over half a century, at least in the UK, cars are not at the heart of 'broken-Britain'. Having consistently worked on vehicles and maintenance, he reveals evidence for a drop since 2007 in the numbers of both people passing their driver's test and car registration (Dant 2014) .

Despite using this medium to get around, their journeys are frequently interrupted and shrouded in various moments of exhilaration and vertigo. And, by their very presence outdoors along road networks, they are re-humanising the landscape. The effort involved in finding suitable stopping places, speedy routes and adequate shelter means they are able to physically and emotionally engage with places which many people only glimpse at. Indeed, if nothing else, a hitching endeavour means that one is removed from what most people experience during straightforward car trips. Instead, one is in a position to fully absorb certain elements of the roadscape environment. In so doing, one also learns how to adapt to new and unpredictable circumstances. Hitchhikers thus cause ruptures within the linearity of most vehicle journeys-symbolic of those fragmentations necessary in subverting certain aspects of modern petrol-fuelled transport.",

Hitchers often glance at the horizon of the oncoming road to evaluate the number of cars approaching and hence the likelihood of getting a lift. I have found in so doing that the hitcher risks being overlooked by motorists if their attention falters too far away from the motorists themselves.",

Instead, sight and sound, smell and tact, are thrust into the confined space of someone else's vehicle, in close quarters with another's presence. The solitude is broken and the continued benefit of a free ride depends on quickly grasping and respecting the driver's rules. The hitcher's image of solitude weakens as the image of the street or motorway, with its oases of rest and lifts, strengthen. So to paraphrase the geographer Yi-Fu Tuan, the symbol of happiness moves away from the sound of a kettle boiling at home to become the precious hum of an engine on the open road (Tuan 1971) .",

This guarantees them an exposure to different outlooks during the voyage as well as to various socio-cultural settings. At certain times, they will be sitting eight feet off the ground in the front of a lorry. At others, they will be sat in the cargo section of a pick-up truck, the leather seat of a Mercedes convertible, or the floor of a Volkswagen campervan. Additionally, each situation is an exposure to different class, gender and ethnic issues (Plumb 2014). As the clich\u00e9 goes 'beggars can't be choosers' and so the successful hitcher learns to be accepting of others.

The landscape makes the participant into a part of itself and the landscape's components appear to hitchers as biographical self-reflections (Meskell 2005) . As part of the environment, the hitchhiker leaves desirable or undesirable traces that will correspondingly be encouraged or discouraged by passing motorists. It is therefore important for those who study landscape to get an impression of the labour embodied within the roadscape since the notion of 'congealed labour', traditionally applied to artefacts, equally uncovers the rich human investment of creative mobility in the land. This is a reminder that hitchhiking is a political act, sometimes on a micro scale, sometimes with subtle, but farther-reaching consequences.",

The painting on the cover of their eponymous debut album from 1989 is titled 'Bye Bye Badman', which is also the name of a song on this recording. The lyrics are clearly an expression of the anger felt by political protesters when faced with oppression. Videos, news reports and meeting people who had been involved with the May 1968 riots in France had served as the catalyst not only for this song, but for shaping the particular style of their music, as well as producing a set of visual 'branding' associations that included lemons in their posters, t-shirts and set designs for live concerts. This is fine as a tangent for music buffs, but so what? Well, an online blog posting has explained the reasoning behind this visual symbolism. The guitarist of The Stone Roses, John Squire, the artist who has designed many of the band's visual promotions material, was the one who painted the cover of their first full studio record in a style \u00e0 la Jackson Pollock. We can see the French tri-colours on the top left corner, with three slices of lemon superimposed on the paint. In an interview many years later, he explained the political significance behind the work as such:",

You either walk or you take. Yet one could say that actually the entire journey is middle ground, balanced on a fine line. The freedom of this medium essentially means that hitchers take charge of their own destiny. Hence, it is not a randomly determined task. Implicit as well as explicit rules exist and the onus of responsibility for one's destination and safety lie largely with oneself. Because of this, we often witness that hitchers keep detailed travel logs in the form of journals, books, poems or songs. Either through contributing to online resources or by scribbling messages on lay-by barriers for others, they record the best places to get rides from; the routes they take; the number of lifts and time it takes to get around; and of course, they leave messages of hope and despair-funny, sad or cryptic. Indeed, hitching is an excellent example of a type of activity where the pen remains firmly in the hands of the participant. And it is to this theme of 'creative participation' and intervention that Chapter 5 returns to in a sinuous way.",

Moreover, it is not exempt from precarious moments of solitude since it involves a public exploration of both inwardness and awkwardness. Camus' rebel, Baudelaire's fl\u00e2neur, de Beauvoir's mnemonic life stories-all three figures are seekers, slowing down in some places, going faster in others-without ever being quite satisfied with what they find. This is an incessant hunt, revealing an anxiety and despair that some restless people admit to being prone to with such words as: 'not feeling good with the world one lives in -in search of something else that does not exist at the moment' (Mart\u00ednez 2015: 431) . Understanding the movement of people who resist normative and regulated forms of travel is especially pertinent in an age when Europe is experiencing a renewed growth in both xenophobia and populist politics, as well as concerns over mass extinction, melting icecaps, the overuse of plastics, the cost of nappies. 6 Conceptually and comparatively, we can extend this beyond Europe for a moment if we ever aim to truly highlight some of the key landscape depictions that are implicated in such a vernacular and creative setting for transport. Historically associated with labour emigration and exile, there are many literary examples that demonstrate how the erratic character of hitchhiking journeys acts as a form of resistance to modernity and poverty. 7 Increasingly the case within the framework of global markets, hitchhiking often factors as an exchange of a commodity that is non-transactional. 6 Name it what you will, austerity, economic crash, cultures of fears-the Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Chthulucene-they're here to stay. Like a bee in a bonnet or a prickly pear, it seems impossible but to talk of an uncertain future (Haraway 2016 I shall explore in Chapters 6 and 7, through my own 'intrusion' into the discipline of social anthropology, how I have traced back a narrative that gives me an identity as an interdisciplinary anthropologist. The European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA) 12th biennial conference in Paris in 2012 was when Tallinn University's Anthropology Department won the bid to host the following biennial conference in 2014. For me, it was a personal anniversary: ten years since first attending this organisation's event (in 2002 at the University of Copenhagen). Nanterre marked a decade of unfaltering 'pilgrimages' to this anthropology conference, even when I was experiencing the tyranny of distance in New Zealand from 2007 to 2010. My point is that the fl\u00e2neur type hitchhiker features a mixture of traits from other motilities characters, especially the tourist, nomad and the pilgrim. As such, they certainly illustrate archetypal ways of being a hybrid persona in the typology of mobility (Salazar and Coates 2017). They are captivating metaphors of the embodied imagination, in part because of their links to both the literary and the experiential activity of sensing the world first-hand as it were (Fig. 4.2) .",
