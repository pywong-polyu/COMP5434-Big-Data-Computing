Social media can provide a place for measuring a pulse of mental health in communities. Evaluating the changing use of language on social media can complement traditional survey-based approaches and provide new insights into the well-being of a country or region during a public health crisis. Social media could also enable early symptom discovery for diseases where the pathology is not completely known and is evolving. 1 We, therefore, created a dashboard (https://bit.ly/penncovidmap) to monitor and analyze changes in language expressed on Twitter over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic within the USA with a specific focus on mental health and symptom mentions.",

We calculated estimates for these four measures from the national declaration of emergency, on March 13, to May 6, and compared them to the estimates from the same period in 2019, controlling for day of the week and seasonality effects.
