Effects of sample size reduction on hazard ratios due to missing values were considered by comparison of the final model to a model excluding the respective variable. Censoring was applied to ICU survivors at the time of discharge to account for the possibility of an unfavorable outcome during the further hospitalization. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was employed alongside minimal Euclidean distance fitting to the (0, 1) point to determine the optimal cut-off values for variables included in the final model.

By contrast, a considerably higher proportion of patients in our cohort received rescue therapies including prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide and extracorporeal decarboxylation and oxygenation. These differences may reflect the large variability in therapeutic approaches applied in our cohort related to the international scope of this study. Given the relatively low mortality rate in our compared to other reports [4, 5, 7, 8, 17, 19] , together with the lack of clear evidence regarding the optimal respiratory management of critically ill COVID-19 patients, our findings suggest that a wide range of therapeutic approaches-which reflect the particular expertise of the participating hospitals-could be successful strategies in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients.

While markers of coagulation activation and microvascular dysfunction such as D-dimer and lactate levels, together with markers of renal dysfunction, were positively associated with ICU mortality, an inverse association was found for the P/F ratio as a measure of oxygenation deficit. These findings support previous observations of the presence of severe inflammatory reaction [5] and endothelial dysfunction [6] in these patients, thereby providing a plausible pathophysiological correlate to the severely decreased P/F ratio due to alveolar fluid accumulation.

The RISC-19-ICU registry provides the prerequisites for the development of risk scores in critically ill patients, and due to its collaborative nature the data presented here could be combined with databases of similar scope for joint data analysis. The limitations of the present study pertain mainly to the prospective data collection, which was performed in highly variable settings at 93 different collaborating centres at the peak of an unprecedented public health crisis. While missing values due to local differences in laboratory capability or resource availability were present and could potentially have led to effect over-or underestimation, efforts were made to mitigate this variability by rigorous monitoring of data quality and the use of linear mixed model analysis for the descriptive analysis. Further, lead-time bias was moderated by alignment of the data collection time points to the onset of critical disease status. Survival analysis during an ongoing crisis is associated with a potential survivorship bias in favor of patients with a short ICU length of stay with potentially more severe cases still residing in the ICU. However, by including into the outcome analysis only patients that had already been discharged from the ICU, censoring of the patients that were discharged from the ICU alive could be applied in the Cox proportional hazards model to account for the possibility of an unfavorable outcome during the further hospitalization and thus reduce Kaplan-Meier analysis of six of the defining model components (creatinine, D-dimer, lactate and potassium levels, the P/F ratio and ischemic heart disease) demonstrate their effect on ICU mortality over time; patients discharged alive from the ICU are noted as censored (B). the potential for additional bias. While hospital outcomes and followup assessments may be analysed in a future retrospective analysis, the present study is capable of providing insight during the ongoing pandemic. Finally, due to the international study design, the resources, policies and therapeutic approaches utilized in the participating centres and countries presumably were highly heterogeneous, which should be considered when interpreting the results presented here. Correction for clustering was not implemented into the statistical models to prevent an increased risk of type II error in light of the reduced number of patients admitted to certain centres at the time point of analysis as previously described [33] .
