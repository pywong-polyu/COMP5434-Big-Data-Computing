It also helps in gender empowerment and social upliftment of the rural/tribal people as mostly women and children are involved in rearing of indigenous chickens besides providing household nutritional security. Further, they cater to the needs of consumers for coloured birds and light-brown-shelled eggs in the niche market. Indigenous chickens are reported to be resistant to bacterial, protozoal, fungal and parasitic diseases as they were subjected to many years of natural selection under free-range or backyard systems of rearing (Besbes, 2009 ). Previous studies have reported the differences in immune competence traits between indigenous and improved chicken breeds owing to different genetic backgrounds. Nicobari, a slow-growing indigenous breed was reported to be relatively resistant to viral diseases like Newcastle disease, Marek's disease (Rai and Ahlawat, 1995) and infectious bursal disease Chatterjee and Yadav, 2008) . Furthermore, expression profiling of various pattern recognition receptor genes in indigenous and White Leghorn (WLH) birds revealed the highest expression of TLR1LB, MDA5, LGP2, B-Lec, IL1 \u03b2 and IL8 genes in Ghagus in contrast to WLH birds (Haunshi et al., 2017) . These receptor genes are known to play a significant role in innate immune competence. In another study, it was demonstrated that expression of the TLR4 gene in lipopolysaccharide treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells was significantly higher in indigenous chicken breeds (Aseel and Ghagus) when compared to improved (Dahlem Red and Broilers) chickens (Karnati et al., 2015) . Similarly, the expression of TLR4, TLR5 and TLR7 genes was significantly higher in indigenous breeds (Kadaknath and Aseel) than those of the WLH breed (Kannaki et al., 2010) . General immune competence as assessed by cutaneous basophil hy-persensitivity response against PHA-P and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+) count was also found to be higher in indigenous chicken breeds compared to the Dahlem Red breed (Yadav et al., 2018) . Recently in our challenge study, it was observed that the Nicobari breed was relatively resistant to fowl typhoid (Pastorella multocida) infection as mortality of the Nicobari breed was remarkably lesser as compared to the improved Vanaraja cross (Kannaki Ramasamy et al., unpublished data) . Therefore, it is evident that the genetic background of the chicken is known to influence the disease resistance and immune competence traits (Emam et al., 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 935, "end": 948, "text": "(Besbes, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1277, "text": "(Rai and Ahlawat, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1335, "text": "Chatterjee and Yadav, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1601, "text": "(Haunshi et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1983, "text": "(Karnati et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2159, "text": "(Kannaki et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2394, "end": 2414, "text": "(Yadav et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2664, "end": 2707, "text": "(Kannaki Ramasamy et al., unpublished data)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2852, "end": 2871, "text": "(Emam et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in chickens is known to play a significant role in disease resistance, immune competence and production traits (Miller and Taylor, 2016) including resistance to ectoparasites like northern fowl mites (Owen et al., 2008) .

Furthermore, the Ghagus breed was recently collected from its native tract (Six generations back), while WLH was subjected to selection for higher egg production for last several generations, and hence, some degree of inbreeding could have taken place in this breed. Previous studies also reported higher diversity in the MHC-linked LEI0258 locus in indigenous chickens of various countries.

The size of 403 and 565 bp alleles were confirmed by sequencing. However, the size of remaining alleles was determined by extrapolating the genotyped sizes. Therefore, the precise size of these alleles needs to be confirmed by sequencing. Nevertheless, the findings suggest the possibility of indigenous chickens (seven in Ghagus, three in Nicobari and two in WLH) possessing the unique alleles of the LEI0258 marker. Only BW3 (194 bp), 13.1 (381 bp), 19 (539 bp) and 19.1 (552 bp) serologically defined B haplotypes could be correlated among the three breeds. These findings are in conformity with the previous study, which reported that birds of Indian origin had completely unknown haplotypes, and only few serologically defined haplotypes (B2, B12 and B21) could be detected in four lines of indigenous chickens of India (Baelmans et al., 2005) , thus reflecting potentially interesting genetic pool in indigenous breeds. Ghagus and Nicobari breeds deviated from HWE. The deviation from HWE occurs due to selection (natural or artificial), missing genotypes, genetic drift, mutation, migration, population substructure, genotyping error, etc. (Chen et al., 2017) . Genotyping error in this study was ruled out as sizes of alleles were first determined on agarose gel electrophoresis, and the precise size of all alleles were then determined on automated analyser, and the procedures used were common to all three breeds. The possible reason for deviation could be missing genotypes, population substructure or natural selection observed in both indigenous breeds of chicken. Similar deviation from HWE was reported with high heterozygosity at MHC in chicken populations originated in China (Izadi et al., 2011) . Similar to the findings of our study, Mwambene et al. (2019) also reported significant deviation from HWE for the LEI0258 marker in 6 out of 10 indigenous chicken ecotypes of Africa. It was opined that deficiency of heterozygosity (lesser H o than H e ) or excess heterozygosity could be one among many reasons for the deviation. In our case perhaps excess heterozygosity observed particularly in Ghagus could be one of the reasons for deviation from HWE. Expected and unbiased expected heterozygosities were similar in all three breeds. Fixation index (F ), which indicates degree of inbreeding was the lowest in Ghagus followed by WLH and Nicobari breeds. F statistic (Fst) observed for this LEI0258 marker was 0.172.

Closer genetic relatedness observed between Nicobari and WLH was somewhat unexpected, and this can be explained by the fact that the Nicobari breed was reported to have originated from the crosses of different exotic breeds such as WLH, Australorp, Plymouth Rock, etc., and indigenous fowl of the Nicobar group of islands (Chatterjee et al., 2005) .

Survivability of hens is an important economic trait which has bearing on production performance. A positive association of 194 bp allele with egg production up to 72 weeks of age in Ghagus can be explained from the fact that the survivability of hens with the 194 bp allele was also significantly higher as compared to the reference allele (309 bp). Allele 309 bp, which had negative association with survivability of hens up to 72 weeks of age, also had negative association with egg production up to 72 weeks of age.
