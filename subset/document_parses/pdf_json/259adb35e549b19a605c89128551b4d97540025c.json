Despite evidence since March 2020 that wearing facemasks can effectively reduce droplet and airborne transmission of COVID-19 risk [4, 5] , the acceptability of wearing face masks in the U.S. public has varied dramatically, with low mask-wearing compliance [6, 7] . Many factors contributed to the phenomenon of noncompliance with mask wearing, including that it was not a prior norm in the United States, that COVID-19 was an unfamiliar risk, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explicitly discouraged the public to wear masks initially. Furthermore, public health messaging initially focused on surface rather than droplet and airborne transmission, contributing to the absence of a rationale for mask wearing as a protective behavior [8] . Moreover, wearing masks became highly politicized in the United States rather than a common sense measure, in part as the result of former President Donald Trump not role-modeling mask wearing and downplaying the seriousness of the public health risk of the coronavirus [9, 10] . The psychological literature has shown that risk perception, and not objective risk assessment, is a key important driver of behavior [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, we turn to risk perception theory to explain the differential public response to mask wearing.",

Empirical investigations have examined the public response to risk in terms of how risk perception intensifies or attenuates as a result of various amplification stations (e.g., media, social institutions, interpersonal interactions, social media) [15, 16] . The tenets of SARF view risk perception as a process in which risk signals (defined as messages about a hazard that affect people's perceptions about the seriousness or manageability of a risk) interact with psychological, social, institutional, and cultural processes in ways that intensify or attenuate perceptions of risk and its manageability, and shape risk behavior [17] . The experience of risk is, therefore, not only an experience of a physical threat, but also the result of processes by which groups and individuals learn to ascribe new meanings to risk and create subjective interpretations of risk [15] . We define COVID-19 risk perception based on Kasperson [14, 15] as a communication process situating risk perception cognitively, but also socially, culturally, and historically. We used this definition to describe what risk signals were discussed in mask-related tweets on Twitter, which can give insight into what shapes the public response to SARS-CoV-2 risk and mask-wearing risk mitigation efforts [15, 16] .",

According to SARF, at least four information mechanisms can contribute to the intensification of risk perceptions in the initial transfer of risk information: (a) volume of information about a risk; (b) ambiguity of information or the degree to which it is disputed; (c) the extent to which information is dramatized; and (d) the symbolic connotations of the information [15, 16] . In SARF, the metaphor of amplification from classical communication theory refers to how various social agents generate, receive, interpret, and pass on risk signals. This study applied SARF to the social media context to uncover and describe how the initial transfer of risk information (as shared on Twitter) gives insight into how individuals create and ascribe meaning to Covid-19 risk and mask wearing.",

These interpersonal platforms with a mass media reach play an increasingly important role in alerting people to disasters or pandemics [22, 24, 25] . The social media context consequently offers a space wherein not only are risk signals shared, but often risk messages are edited or passed on with new additional affordances and meanings ascribed to them that in turn, shape interpretation of risk and subsequent adoption of risk prevention behaviors [17] . Against this backdrop, we investigated how Twitter mask tweets described COVID-19 risk (explicitly and implicitly), how they intensified or attenuated COVID-19 risk perceptions, and how risk perceptions changed during the first 5 months of the pandemic. Our study aimed to gain a greater understanding of the factors shaping public COVID-19 risk perceptions, but also how findings can inform public health messaging strategies to increase message acceptance around mask wearing. On a theoretical level, the study aimed to advance insights into the effects of the social amplification and attenuation of risk as a result of how risk is conveyed on social media.",

We further filtered our dataset to remove tweets that only contained hashtags or user mentions (i.e., \"@\" or \"#\" prefixes) with no other words and non-English tweets. The dataset we used for this analysis was user generated content only. The dataset of tweets therefore, did not include instances where a user retweeted another tweet. This step resulted in a cleaned dataset of 592,317 tweets.

To ensure that emergent codes related to risk perceptions were discovered (i.e., saturation of codes), coders reviewed randomly sampled batches of 150 mask tweets from each month across the 5 months of data. Each coder reviewed and coded their sample of tweets independently, followed by the coding team meeting to discuss and compare how they labeled descriptive codes and interpreted each tweet for expression of COVID-19 risk. The coding team then iteratively developed the codebook describing how mask tweets covered topics as they related to risk. The coding team reviewed and discussed approximately 950 mask tweets to agree on interpretations of mask tweets, discussed how tweets reflected expressions of risk explicitly and implicitly, and reviewed the multiple ideas reflected in each tweet (a tweet could be labeled with up to three codes).

Fleiss' Kappa, which calculates the degree of agreement in classifying nominal codes over that which would be expected by chance, was computed for each code to assess intercoder reliability among the three coders [31, 32] . Kappa ranges from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement), with .61-.80 indicating substantial agreement and .81-.99 indicating almost perfect agreement [33, 34] . Initial kappa estimates were low for some codes. The coding team discussed discrepancies in tweet interpretation and clarified the codebook. New batches of 150 tweets were then coded independently to retest intercoder reliability, repeating this process until intercoder reliability of at least .60 was obtained to indicate substantial agreement among coders [32] [33] [34] .",

Tweets about who is at risk persisted and increased in the second phase of the pandemic (through end of May) to then persist across the third phase (June and July summer) but relative to \"mask behavior of others\" became less of a topic. Severity discussion, which peaked initially, witnessed a modest drop as discussion topic (relative to mask behavior of others, who is at risk, politicization, and guidelines) but then steadily increased in volume after March and peaked in the third phase of the pandemic after Memorial Day and beyond through summer. The volume of mask effectiveness tweets increased moderately throughout the 5 months. Mask guidelines as a topic peaked in Phase 2 (April 3, 2020) when the CDC changed its mask guidelines and dropped thereafter. See Fig 4 for external real-world events that occurred as Twitter mask discussions and risk perception themes evolved over time.

We did this through the perspective of citizens who actively participated in shaping risk perceptions as \"individual amplification or attenuation stations,\" by responding to, commenting on, and actively sharing risk messages with select networks, as documented on social media. Psychology and communication research have shown that perceived not objective risk motivates behavior [12, 13, 35, 36] .

While mask effectiveness tweets debated transmission routes, other mask tweets particularly \"behavior of others\" attest to the social experiences that contributed to constructions of COVID-19 risk that in turn, motivate behavior. Twitter users took advantage of the affordances of the social media platform to document, engage, amplify, and attenuate COVID-19 risk perceptions, including making sense of the unfamiliar risk. Mask tweets reflected the mediated and shared experiences of COVID-19, passing on information through weak and strong network ties, adding hashtags and hyperlinks to amplify or attenuate messages, and using mentions to draw the attention of various government authorities and stakeholders. Tweets expressed both the social experiences and the isolating and threatening experiences that COVID-19 posed as parts of the country experienced lockdowns, shelter-in-place orders, and school closures while the virus spread. Responses to mask wearing evolved from initial signals of alarm to calls for all to wear masks as desperate pleas to mitigate the very real and collective risk to society increased.",

Severity assessment as an aspect of risk perception has been recognized in multiple health behavior change theories [37, 38] .

Discussion about ambiguity in guidelines, disputes about the science of COVID-19 transmission, power struggles between government and public health officials, politicization, and social identity amplified and shaped risk perception (e.g., with mask wearing taking on new meaning for some). Debates between experts and government officials functioned to heighten uncertainty about the severity and prioritization of COVID-19 risk, the reliability of recommendations, and the trustworthiness of basic facts downplaying risk perceptions. Debates likely also increased public doubt about the state of knowledge and mask recommendations. Dramatization by former President Trump refusing to role-model mask wearing led to both heightened and attenuated risk perceptions. In contrast to increased media attention about the 2014-2016 Ebola virus outbreak [64] that reflected a negligible risk to U.S. citizens, risk from COVID-19 was downplayed by the government when, in fact, the real risk to the U.S. public steadily increased and was deadly, killing more than half a million people [2] .",

SARF contends that social amplification of risk occurs at two stages: in the initial transmission of information about a risk (we examined the social media context) and in the response mechanisms of society (behavioral, economic, and symbolic impacts).

For example, to reach young adults, the largest unvaccinated group to date, public health messaging may be more effective by tapping into social identity and social relational norms given the role of mask behavior of others and in-group identity having influence. Collective responsibility messaging delivered by in-group members may be needed to effectively reach a particularly subgroup whether young adults, a particular subgroup who identifies with a race/ethnicity, or political affiliation.",

First, the study was based on a random~1% sample of coronavirus and subsequent mask keyword-related tweets to examine COVID-19 risk perceptions. Different Twitter data-sampling strategies have shown that a random sample detected the same number of themes as a topic sample, suggesting that it was useful to qualitatively assess frequencies [67] . A second limitation involves the biases inherent in the data source of Twitter users, who represent citizens many of whom are young adults (ages 18 to 29 and comprise the largest group at 42%), more likely to identify as Democrat, to be highly educated, have higher incomes, slightly more likely to be men (62%), and more likely to be concentrated in urban and suburban geolocations [68] [69] [70] . Twitter users reflect a range of stakeholders, including media organizations. Therefore, we filtered out the top 100 media organizations from the final mask tweet sample to reflect predominantly citizens tweeting about masks and mask behavior. We also manually read and analyzed the 7,000-plus mask tweets to confirm the tweets were sensical and not generated by bots. A third limitation is that Twitter data covered the first 5 months of 2020 pandemic and may not generalize to Twitter discussions about later points in the pandemic after July 2020. Having said this, Twitter volume related to COVID-19 peaked during the first 5 months, representing a critical time period in which to analyze key conversational themes emerging about COVID-19 risk. Results may be generalizable to early critical stages of a public health crisis. Future research investigating how structural social media message attributes (e.g., hyperlinks, images, videos, mentions, retweets) amplify and attenuate risk perceptions, in addition to a content will contribute to elaborating on the dynamic communication process shaping risk perception on social media. Retweets were not available in our dataset given Twitter policy at the time of data collection. We did capture the proportion of tweets using hyperlinks, mentions, hashtags and questions to begin to understand the use of social media structural communication strategies in addition to content.",

Intensification and attenuation of COVID-19 risk communication on Twitter unfolded in unique, rapid, and broad ways during the first 5 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to diverging constructions of COVID-19 risk and consequently, divergent adherence to the recommended risk mitigation behavior of mask wearing. Individuals communicated their personal experiences, and realtime reactions to the emerging COVID-19 risk, sharing not only content, but directing reactions to the emerging risk, behavior of others and response to changing guidelines with the use of mentions, videos (both of observation of others and personal videos) as collective pleas were made to wear masks, as well as the emergence of mask hashtags about shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare providers to collective risk appeals with hashtags about masking for all or mask up \"a city\" and making appeals to social identities with #realmenwearmasks.",

The six derived themes identified reflect the multiple factors shaping risk perception dynamically in the sense-making process. Attention to social and group identity constructions of risk, normalizing public health recommendations through workplace policy and shifting away from individual responsibility in a politicized climate may prove advantageous for effective public health messaging. Our results indicate that citizens ascribed many meanings to masking and the simultaneous amplification and attenuation of COVID-19 risk complicates public health messaging. The social, psychological, and institutional experience of risk (behavior of others, norms, role modeling and messaging of government) come into play as much if not more so than objective risk perceptions and need to be taken into account in public health messaging when the goal involves increasing compliance with recommended risk mitigation behaviors.

Go on that trip. (March 3, 2020, TX). Rural states not yet experiencing COVID-19. My state of Indiana had 54 common flu deaths, and zero COVID19 deaths. There was no statewide closing of bars and restaurants over the 54 common flu deaths, no buying up of toilet paper, surgical masks or hand sanitizer. It all needs to be put into perspective (March 16, 2020, IN).Reported exaggeration of hospitalizations. Total current covid hospitalizations in Georgia are 783, that's 0.0007% of the population.
