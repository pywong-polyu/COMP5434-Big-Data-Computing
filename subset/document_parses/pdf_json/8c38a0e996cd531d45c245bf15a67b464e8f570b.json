Low SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers were furthermore present in intestine tissue samples 137 and rectal swabs of the vehicle source animals and their contacts, but were undetectable in the MK-138 4482/EIDD-2801-treated source group and co-housed contact animals. 139 140 Discussion 141Representatives of a number of animal species such as non-human primates 19 , dogs 20 , cats 20 , 142 ferrets 20 , hamsters 21-23 , and bats 16 were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 without prior species adaptation 143 when infected experimentally. Natural infection has been documented for felines 24 , dogs 25 and 144 minks 12,14 . Phylogenetic analysis of outbreaks in mink farms revealed prolonged intra-colony circulation 145 and zoonotic mink-to-human transmission 14 , driving our selection of ferrets, members of the weasel 146 genus closely related to minks, as a relevant SARS-CoV-2 transmission model. 147We noted strong viral inoculum amount-dependence of experimental infection of ferrets. Productive 148 host invasion characterized by robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract and appearance of 149 viral genetic material in gastrointestinal samples was only observed after intranasal delivery of 100,000 150 pfu of SARS-CoV-2. By comparison, natural infection through direct contact was far more efficient, to 151 which prolonged exposure of contact to source animals may have been a contributing factor. However, 152 nearly all contacts started to shed virus within less than 24 hours after the beginning of co-housing. This 153 timeline indicates that transmission must have occurred in most cases immediately after introducing 154 contact to source animals, despite the fact that shed viral titers of source animals were only 10 3 pfu/ml 155 nasal lavage in this disease period.156 Independent of experimental versus natural infection, none of the SARS-CoV-2 infected ferrets 157 displayed prominent clinical signs. The mink farm outbreaks may allow better appreciation of the 158 clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 in weasels, since data are based on a far greater number of animals. 159 Whereas only a small subset of the thousands of infected minks displayed severe respiratory signs, most 160 of those that died at the peak of farm outbreaks had developed acute interstitial pneumonia 12,15 . Possibly 161 a consequence of mild disease in ferrets, our complete blood counts showed no robust lymphopenia, a 162 prominent correlate of severe human SARS-CoV-2 disease 26,27 . 163 MK-4482/EIDD-2801 is currently being tested in advanced multi-center clinical trials 164 (NCT04405570 and NCT04405739), which explore drug efficacy in lowering virus shedding in SARS-165 CoV-2-positive non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients, respectively. These studies were launched 166 after successful completion of phase 1 safety trials (i.e. NCT04392219). Although dose levels applied in 167 these studies and human PK data have not yet been disclosed, Merck & Co. have released 28 that NHC 168 blood levels were safely reached in humans that exceed antiviral concentrations against SARS-CoV-2 in 169 primary human airway epithelia cultures (NHC EC90 approx. 0.5-1 \u00b5M 9 ). Our PK profiles for MK-170 4482/EIDD-2801 revealed that NHC plasma concentrations \u00b30.5 \u00b5M at trough (12 hours after dosing 171 based on a b.i.d. regimen) are reached after oral dose levels of approximately 130 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 172 in cynomolgus macaques and ferrets, respectively 4 . These calculations drove our decision to dose ferrets 173 at the 5 mg/kg level in this study, which represents a conservative estimate of a safe human dose 174 equivalent based on all available information. By coincidence, 5 mg/kg is close to the lowest efficacious dose of MK-4482/EIDD-2801 against seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses in ferrets 4,6 , 176 underscoring the high broad-spectrum antiviral potential of the drug. 177 Closely resembling our prior experience with influenza therapy 4,6 , MK-4482/EIDD-2801 was well 178 tolerated and orally efficacious against SARS-CoV-2, reducing upper respiratory virus load below 179 detection level within 24 hours of first drug administration when therapy was initiated after the onset of 180 virus shedding, and by nearly two orders of magnitude when first administered at the peak of virus 181 replication. Viral genetic material in gastrointestinal samples was likewise undetectable in treated 182 animals, which is consistent with previous observations of sustained presence of the biologically active 183 triphosphate form of NHC in all soft tissue but liver in different species 4,8,29 . 184 Importantly, treatment suppressed all transmission to untreated direct contacts, despite prolonged 185 direct proximity of source and contact animals and detectable virus shedding from source animals at the 186 beginning of the co-housing phase. This complete transmission block may indicate a bottom threshold of 187 shed SARS-CoV-2 load for successful spread. Since the antiviral effect of NHC arises from induction of 188 error catastrophe 4,7,8 , it is also possible that genome integrity of some EIDD-2801-experienced virions 189 shed from treated animals was only partially compromised. Incorporated NHC base pairs as cytosine or 190 uracil due to spontaneous tautomeric interconversions 30 . Limited presence of the analog in viral 191 genomes generated shortly after treatment start could have still allowed virus replication on cultured 192 cells for titration, but not successful host invasion. 193 Our prior studies with influenza viruses demonstrate that the MK-4482/EIDD-2801-mediated block 194 of respiratory viral transmission is not host species-restricted. Oral treatment with MK-4482/EIDD-2801 195 or NHC reduced shed influenza virus titers in ferret nasal lavages with potency and kinetics comparable 196 to the effect seen here against SARS-CoV-2 4 and effectively prevented influenza virus direct contact 197 transmission between guinea pigs 7 . If ferret-based inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by MK-4482/EIDD-2801 is predictive of the antiviral effect in humans, COVID-19 patients could become non-199 infectious within 24 to 36 hours after the onset of oral treatment. In addition to the direct therapeutic 200 promise of alleviating clinical disease, a shortened shedding period would safely allow reduction of 201 isolation times of SARS-CoV-2 positives and narrow the window of opportunity for viral transmission. 202Treatment with MK-4482/EIDD-2801, in particular when initiated early after infection, thus has the 203 potential to provide three-fold benefit: it may mitigate the risk of progression to severe disease and 204 accelerate recovery, ease the emotional and socioeconomic toll associated with mandatory prolonged 205 isolation, and aid in rapidly silencing local outbreaks.",
