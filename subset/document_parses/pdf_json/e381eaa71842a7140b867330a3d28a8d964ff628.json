            "text": "Even in urgent or elective surgery, current guidelines recommend avoiding surgical techniques which might spread viral particles. Ultrasonic energy devices are commonly used in head and neck surgery and they represent an alternative to the scalpel, electrosurgery, or laser. [8] [9] [10] [11] Bloodborne transmission has not been documented in SARS-CoV-2. However, aerosolization of blood through the use of this type of instruments has been reported. 12 They can easily produce a lowtemperature aerosol that cannot effectively deactivate the cellular components of virus in patients. In previous studies, activated corynebacterium, papillomavirus, and HIV DNA have been detected in surgical smoke, reporting the theoretical possibility of contagions related to exposure. [13] [14] [15] One study found that after using ultrasonic equipment in laparoscopic surgery for 10 minutes, the particle concentration of the plume was significantly higher than in traditional open surgery. 16 Despite the fact that these data are positive, given the type of surgery in which this type of scalpel is commonly used on the head and neck area, there is some controversy regarding it. 17, 18 The health effects of aerosols created by ultrasonic devices are not well documented, but considering the high viral titers in nasal mucosal, oral, pharyngeal, and pulmonary secretions, any operation that involves these surfaces is of high risk to the entire operating room personnel. 12 Although there are several publications that contain guidelines for aerosols reduction during anesthesia, management of the airway, endoscopy, or tracheostomy, 4, 12, 19, 20 awareness of best practices using ultrasonic devices is imperative because infectious aerosols arising from airway procedures were a key etiologic factor in prior coronavirus outbreaks. 21 The aim of this study is to summarize the available recommendations and the most relevant concepts about the technique during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",

The entry mechanism of a coronavirus depends upon cellular proteases which include, human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), cathepsins, and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that split the spike protein and establish further penetration changes. 24 Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual as well as a contact transmission (oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes). 25 Although fecal-oral spread has also been confirmed. 4 In a small study conducted on pregnant women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no evidence that there is transmission from mother to child. 26 SARS-coronavirus require binding between the receptor-binding domain of virus spikes and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 27 Aerosolized COVID-19 particles less than 5 \u03bcm, produced during various procedures, may remain airborne for up to 3 hours and may survive on surfaces for much F I G U R E 1 Flow chart of the search strategy based on the PRISMA Statement and critical analysis of the literature longer. 28,29,30(p1) SARS-CoV has been measured in air samples within 1 m of an infected patient in 11 samples over 8 hours suggesting a high risk for airborne transmission.

            "text": "The ultrasonic scalpel (US) unites the ability to cut and coagulate in the same surgical device. The equipment consists of a generator, a hand-piece (housing the acoustic mount and ultrasonic transducer, which is composed of piezoelectric crystals sandwiched between metal cylinders), and specific inserts. 31 The mechanism of action is based on transforming electrical energy into mechanical movement of 55.5 kHz frequency. These vibrations are transmitted along the handpiece to the instrument tip where they cause longitudinal displacements of 80 \u03bcm. This movement causes the blade to denature protein in the tissue to form a sticky coagulum of partly denatured proteins. 32 The effects of the US on tissues differ greatly according to its mode of action. Three main mechanisms are in operation to varying degrees: cavitation, heat generation, and protein denaturation. The process of cavitation arises from the creation, expansion, and implosion of cavities in liquids. 33, 34 Mechanical oscillations of the instrument tip cause internal tissue pressures to rise and fall rapidly. Once the cellular pressure falls below the vapor pressure of cellular fluid, vapor-filled cavities form within the cells. It is the force generated by the expansion and contraction of these that result in tissue dissection. The pressure exerted on the tissue by the blade surface collapses blood vessels and allows the coagulum to form a hemostatic seal, controlling bleeding by coaptive coagulation at low temperatures, ranging from 50 C to 100 C. By contrast, electrosurgery and laser coagulate by burning (obliterative coagulation) at higher temperatures (150 C-400 C).",

            "text": "Aerosol formation during procedures may be divided into patient induced or mechanically induced, as is the case with US. Aerosol particle size is inversely related to air speed and thus an aerosol generating procedure is any procedure capable of generating increased air velocities within the airway. 35 These procedures are associated with the possibility of increasing the risk of SARS-CoV transmission among health-care workers. 36 The interaction of ultrasonically activated devices with tissue produces a biphasic bioaerosol composed of tissue particles and a blood aerosol. This atomization that creates a mist has long been noted but few studies evaluated or explored it. [37] [38] [39] [40] It has been seen reported that the aerosols caused by this type of devices can be found more than 40 cm from their production area and for more than 1 minute in suspension, with various factors influencing their dispersion pattern and quantity (eg, type of scalpel tip or material being acted on). Fatty tissue generated 10 to 20 times more particles than lean tissue, probably due to its higher water content. Another study exhaustively evaluated the use of the ultrasound scalpel in muscle tissue, finding two large populations of particles (>500 nm and >500 nm), with mean size of 68.3 and 994 nm and a concentration of 6.10 \u00d7 10 5 and 1.48 \u00d7 10 3 /cm 3 , respectively. 38 As for its action in bloody surgical fields, this type of devices produce a spray with a particle counts ranged of up to 500 000 particles of blood/L. 37 The US is said by the manufacturer to produce a vapor, not smoke, and the process has been described as lowtemperature vaporization. This is concerning because cool aerosols in general have a higher chance of carrying infectious and viable material than do higher temperature aerosols. 41 The composition of particles created by the scalpel is morphologically intact and no viable cells and carcinogenic or irritant hydrocarbons (benzene, ethylbenzene, styrene, toluene, heptene, and methylpropene) were identified in one or more samples. 31, 42 In determining health hazards from inhaled aerosol particles, the respirable material that penetrates is of primary importance. Classifying aerosols by their initial size is relevant in relation to their dispersal patterns, but it is also important to classify aerosols according to where they deposit in the respiratory tract because pathogenesis can be influenced by whether a virus deposits in the upper or lower respiratory tract. 43 Dispersal and deposition depend on a variety of factors, and there is no exact cutoff for small and large droplets. Some authors use \u22645 \u03bcm in diameter as a cutoff for small droplets, while another possible cutoff between aerosol types is 20 \u03bcm, since aerosols \u226420 \u03bcm in diameter can desiccate to form droplet nuclei, and aerosols \u226520 \u03bcm do not deposit substantially in the lower respiratory tract. 44 The absence of evidence suggesting harm from inhalation of ultrasonic surgical smoke does not mean it is therefore safe. The possibility of disease transmission through surgical smokes exists, even though currently documented cases of pathogen transmission are rare. 41 The few existing data on the aerosolization of US (Table 1) , together with studies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and viability over time, suggest a considerably increased risk of disease transmission if this type of device is used in infected patients. 37 ",

Currently, there is no specific information regarding SARS-CoV-2, aerosolization with ultrasonic devices, and its infective capacity. Aerosol-generating medical procedures are increasingly being recognized as important sources for nosocomial transmission of emerging viruses. 35, 36 Therefore, all procedures that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions, such as nasolaryngoscopy, endotracheal intubation, non-invasive There is no information regarding any potential risk for electrocautery smoke or transoral laser resection generated smoke but it would be reasonable to take appropriate precautions in these settings too.",

In order to associate certain aerosol-generating medical procedures with nosocomial virus transmission, researchers need to test whether certain procedures generate aerosols with infectious virus, either through hospital sampling or laboratory procedures. 35 The ambiguity with which procedures and viruses require additional protective measures during these procedures may lead to breaches in protocol. Likewise, proper patient triage and diagnosis are the first steps to ensuring that precautions are undertaken when performing it.",
