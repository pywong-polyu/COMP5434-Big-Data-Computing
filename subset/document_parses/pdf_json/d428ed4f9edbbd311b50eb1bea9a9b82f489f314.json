Here, we report on a rapidly deployed active syndromic surveillance system for tracking COVID-19 in Israel. The system was a novel combination of active and passive components: Ads were shown to people searching for COVID-19 symptoms on the Google search engine. Those who clicked on the ads were referred to a chat bot which helped them decide whether they needed urgent medical care. Through its conversion optimization mechanism, the ad system was guided to focus on those people who required such care. Over 6 months, the ads were shown approximately 214,000 times and clicked on 12,000 times, and 722 people were informed they needed urgent care. Click rates on ads and the fraction of people deemed to require urgent care were correlated with the hospitalization rate ( R 2 = 0.54 and R 2 = 0.50 , respectively) with a lead time of 9 days. Males and younger people were more likely to use the system, and younger people were more likely to be determined to require urgent care (slope: \u2212 0.009 , P = 0.01 ). Thus, the system can assist in predicting case numbers and hospital load at a significant lead time and, simultaneously, help people determine if they need medical care.",

For example, Eysenbach 16 demonstrated that the percentage of flu-related ads which were clicked by users (also known as the clickthrough rate, CTR) searching for flu-related terms was well correlated with the number of influenza cases. Ad systems can be trained to focus on specific users, based on their location, demographics, and past interests, using a feedback mechanism known as conversion optimization. This feature of the ad systems was designed to help advertisers focus on users who will purchase a product, not just click on ads. In the context of health, conversion optimization was previously used to identify people who were likely to suffer from one of three types of cancer 17 and help them reach medical care earlier. In that work, ads were shown to people who were looking to self-diagnose one of three solid-tumor cancers. People who clicked on the ads were shown a clinically validated questionnaire whose output was used as the feedback signal to the advertising system. Responses to the questionnaire which were indicative of possible cancer were treated as positive feedback. Over time, the advertising system learned to focus on people who were likely to have questionnaire responses indicative of possible cancer, such that around 12% of the people who clicked on the ads had such questionnaire responses (from a baseline rate of under 1%).",

The first limitation means that, unless a very general symptom questionnaire is used, the active syndromic surveillance system can only be implemented once a disease has been identified and a questionnaire for it is designed. The second limitation means that only diseases with external physical symptoms can be addressed. Nevertheless, it may be possible to create a general purpose questionnaire that identifies serious or unusual symptoms, thus creating a system which detects novel diseases appearing in the population, without predefining the specific illness that needs to be tracked, overcoming the first of the above-mentioned limitations.",

A wider reach would have the benefit of helping more people reach a useful decision, but it might also reduce the lead time between measures of the ad system (CTR and ConvR) and pandemic indicators (cases and hospitalizations) as it would cause people to reach healthcare systems earlier. Notwithstanding this consideration, while search engines are by far the most widely used method for health-related searches 26 , not all segments of the population use the internet to the same extent.
