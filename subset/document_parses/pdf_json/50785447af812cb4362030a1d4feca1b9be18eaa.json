The intervention entails the establishment of 'green zones' for high-risk persons to live in, either within their homes or in communal structures, in a safe and dignified manner, for extended periods of time during the epidemic. To our knowledge, this concept has not been tested or evaluated in resource-poor settings. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield persons at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, during the COVID-19 epidemic in six communities in Sudan. Methods: We purposively sampled participants from six communities, illustrative of urban, rural and forciblydisplaced settings. In-depth telephone interviews were held with 59 members of households with one or more members at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Follow-up interviews were held with 30 community members after movement restrictions were eased across the country. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a two-stage deductive and inductive thematic analysis.",

Most participants found shielding acceptable and consistent with cultural inclinations to respect elders and protect the vulnerable. However, extra-household shielding arrangements were mostly seen as socially unacceptable. Participants reported feasibility concerns related to the reduced socialisation of shielded persons and loss of income for shielding families. The acceptability and feasibility of shielding strategies were reduced after movement restrictions were eased, as participants reported lower perception of risk in their communities and increased pressure to comply with social commitments outside the house.",

Acceptability is influenced by feasibility, and by contextual changes in the epidemic and associated policy response. The promotion of shielding should capitalise on the cultural and moral sense of duty towards elders and vulnerable groups. Communities and households should be provided with practical guidance to implement feasible shielding options. Households must be socially, psychologically and financially supported to adopt and sustain shielding effectively.",

The first COVID-19 case in Sudan was reported on March 13, 2020. The Government of Sudan immediately declared a national emergency [2] and enforced schools and universities closures [3] . Bans of mass gatherings [4] and border closures [5] followed shortly after. However, a reprieve in late March to let in stranded Sudanese travellers [6] may have resulted in the importation of more COVID-19 cases [7] . Following increasingly restrictive dusk-to-dawn curfews in Khartoum, the capital, a lockdown was started on April 18, 2020 [8] , and, soon after, movement restrictions were extended to other parts of the country [7] .",

The response in Sudan has been challenged by a pre-pandemic fragile health system, weak social protection systems and difficulties in accessing global emergency funding for COVID-19 [11] . Likely, the true magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic in Sudan is significantly underestimated by official statistics, as testing capacity is limited and fraught with operational and logistical difficulties [12] . Moreover, among 28 African countries, Sudan has the lowest levels of adherence to crucial prevention measures, such as maskwearing, physical distancing and compliance with movement restrictions [13] , which may partially be due to severe economic hardship faced by the population during the epidemic.",

Shielding of high-risk individuals, either within their homes or in safe communal structures, has been suggested as an alternative to widely-enforced social distancing measures such as lockdowns [14] . The approach recognises that, in these settings, high-risk individuals, especially older adults, usually co-reside with young people and children in large households [15] . In practical terms, shielding translates to living arrangements or 'green zones' where persons at high risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes (and their carers) are 'shielded' from COVID-19 infection for extended periods of time, through a drastic reduction in close contacts with others who continue to interact outside the 'green zone'. These zones could be created within the home, such as a room or dedicated space, or outside the home with a group of other high-risk persons from the family or neighbourhood. While shielding does not significantly affect transmission dynamics [16] , focusing limited resources on shielding higher-risk individuals aims to reduce pressure on health systems, prevent COVID-19 deaths and allow economic activities to resume. Through mathematical modelling, shielding seems to be effective at reducing mortality from COVID-19, particularly when coupled with moderate social distancing and high levels of self-isolation of those with mild COVID-19 symptoms [16] .",

We aimed to achieve a balanced sample of age and gender among household participants. We considered this sample size to be a manageable workload for volunteers working during an epidemic and the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in the first round, and an epidemic and rainy season in the second round. After a preliminary analysis of data for each site, we revisited the need to increase the sample size to reach data saturation.",

After the interviews were completed, interviewers were asked to listen to their recordings, familiarise themselves with the data and complete a summary report, summarising key ideas that emerged in conversations with participants. The interviewers were then invited to participate in group discussions with co-authors (SAEA, NA, NN, MD, IZ, AA), who used the reports to prompt follow-up questions and make use of the interpersonal dynamic of group discussions to generate new insights. These groups discussions were recorded and used by the co-authors to develop a summary report of preliminary findings for quick dissemination to Y-PEER Sudan, the Ministry of Health and other COVID-19 responders.",

Within the household, participants had concerns about the implications of segregation within the household on family well-being, with some suggesting less strict separation combined with infection and prevention measures such as maintaining hand hygiene within the household. Furthermore, a few participants raised doubts about the sustainability of full compliance with segregation within the household, particularly where none of the family members was unwell. These findings indicate that while shielding is widely acceptable, the effectiveness of shielding in these communities may be lower than predicted by mathematical models, which assume drastic reductions in contacts within the household [16] . Furthermore, this may indicate an intention-behaviour gap amongst participants who accept household-level shielding but question their ability to implement or sustain it.

Communication channels should combine mass communication with personal communication from trusted and influential figures in the local communities. Our study participants report that older adults tend to be least informed about COVID-19 and their levels of risk, and are less likely to comply with preventive behaviours in general. Other studies in Ethiopia and Bangladesh also found lower levels of knowledge about COVID-19, and inadequate compliance with preventive behaviours among older adults and individuals with chronic illnesses [36] [37] [38] . These findings indicate that shielding promotion requires a targeted risk communication strategy for those at high risk of severe COVID-19.",

            "text": "Our study has limitations. Firstly, in this study, we used interviews to explore the acceptability and feasibility of shielding. In acceptability research, focus group discussions are preferred over interviews as they have the advantage of allowing group members to collectively brainstorm and debate ideas, opinions, and recommendations [39] . However, given the movement restrictions posed by COVID-19, remote interviews were the appropriate choice for our study, and we are confident that we reached data saturation, as no additional themes emerged in the final interviews at any of the study sites. Secondly, we conducted the interviews remotely by telephone, which is subject to challenges including establishing rapport, absence of visual cues and contextual data, and the relatively short time of the interview to avoid respondent fatigue [40] [41] [42] . Thirdly, in this study, we inquired about the acceptability of a new concept of which the majority of study participants had no prior knowledge. It is possible that some participants provided their opinion without considering the implications of shielding on all aspects of their lives. However, given that reasons for and against acceptance were recurrent across participants and study sites, we are confident that this limitation had a minimal effect on the findings, probably in the direction of acceptance. Finally, given our study design, findings cannot be generalised to all Sudanese communities.",

Financial assistance by the Government of Sudan and other donors should be directed to interventions that support shielding, such as providing home-based treatment for shielded individuals, and direct financial support for families, including where the breadwinner is at high risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Interventions targeting shielding families and the larger community are needed to address concerns about psychological wellbeing and reduced socialisation of shielded individuals. Shielding promotion should adopt an approach that highlights and leverages local traditions for protecting and older adults and most vulnerable in times of hardship, and interventions for incentivising and celebrating local community action that supports shielding. For individuals and families that are shielding, supportive interventions may include psychological health guidance and support, distribution of shielding aids such as soap, face coverings and cleaning supplies, and innovative remote socialisation methods. To provide a supportive environment for shielding, shielding promotion should occur in the context of broader communication interventions and policy responses that enhance risk perception of COVID-19, address misinformation and incentivise compliance with preventive behaviours in the population.",

Promotion campaigns should include targeted risk communication and shielding promotion amongst individuals at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Households should be provided with practical guidance to implement realistic household-level shielding options, with social, psychological and financial support interventions to sustain shielding effectively. Furthermore, communities should be incentivised and rewarded for supporting and enabling shielding. ",
