First results indicate that a transformation towards an increasingly decentralized energy supply is necessary and, particularly in view of the volatility, demands corresponding requirements of the ICT infrastructure. It will be shown how the classic producer-consumer constellation is changed and a multitude of prosumers, i.e. actors, who are both producers and consumers of electricity, arise, and how they can be integrated into the grid structure. Core functionalities will be demonstrated with an integrated data and service platform which also allows the possible integration of supplementary services. In addition, the potential interdependencies from a more decentralized energy network towards regional and urban planning patterns will be assessed.",

            "text": "With the introduction of the German energy transition and the emergence of more renewable energies, electricity generation is becoming more heterogeneous, decentralized and dynamic [1, 21] . Hence, the classic producer-consumer constellation changes towards a multitude of prosumers, i.e. actors who simultaneously are producers and consumers of electricity. The use of renewable energies also leads to strong weather-related fluctuations in electricity production [21] . This means that the impact on the energy network infrastructure is inevitable, and the fundamental question must be, how the networks can be kept stable in the event of dynamic feed-in. In addition to conventional energy network expansion, the focus is on IT-based management of the available flexibility in the energy system. The power feed-in of distributed renewables and the demand of electrical power increase on the distribution level confront low-voltage grids by challenges ranging from unmonitored overloads over violations of the voltage range to backfeeding of electrical energy. Additionally, the volatility of loads and renewable energies makes it difficult to predict future grid states, to plan preventive measures, and to apply them if needed. These factors have a particular impact on the energy network infrastructure and raising the question, how the networks could remain stable. In order to address these points, one can physically expand the electrical grid and storage infrastructure, the power grid or by the means of digitization, make the existing grid smarter and more efficient. This paper exemplifies how to design the ICT backbone for the German energy network in 2035 with IT-supported management of the available flexibilities in the energy system. The results were achieved in the project Designetz, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology and is one of the largest German research projects on energy system transformation. The project area of Designetz embraces an exemplary mixed region with photovoltaic and wind facilities and areas, which have partly high renewable surpluses and nearby load centers (see Fig. 1 ). The project faces many individual solutions in twenty new demonstration projects as well as in eleven already existing projects, that are to be combined in a joint solution. Designetz develops technologies to balance the production and the usage of electricity between the regions by leveraging the flexibility of the aforementioned demonstration projects.",

This also applies to a sustainable and decentralized grid and an appropriate ICT system for a sustainable grid must therefore have a local, decentralized optimization of flexibility to make this possible. The transforming energy system will lead to an increasing number of prosumers and more and more actors will show flexible generation and consumption behavior. Hence, the development of a flexibility management scheme is essential. In addition, it will be the task of network operators to assess the effects of generation and consumption behavior, to keep the network stable and, if necessary, to compensate for network bottlenecks. At the same time, market participants such as aggregators and traders must also be considered. An ICT system for energy flexibility management must therefore enable existing and potentially new stakeholders to be dynamically linked [7] . Flexibility in the energy market is defined as follows: It is the change of feed or withdrawal in response to an external signal (price signal or activation) with the aim of providing a service in the energy system [6] .",

It is therefore necessary to make the participants in the system more flexible in order to be able to efficiently guarantee a reliable power supply. This is especially important in terms of the growing number of prosumers. A prosumer [10] can simultaneously draw electricity and, for example, also produce it via the solar system on the roof and feed it into the grid. Hence, the energy system transformation overcomes the old separation into producer and consumer of electricity or heat. They can increasingly help to keep the entire electricity system stable and thus contribute to a reliable power supply. This can also be lucrative for every participant, if utilities offer electricity prices that reflect the changed electricity supply.",

A data set that consists of meteorological data (e.g., global radiation, temperature and humidity) and the measured power output of the photovoltaic systems over some years is used to create the models. The approaches considered include artificial neural networks, random forest, and case-based reasoning. 2) Individual fine-grained load profiles of private households: a peak-conserving forecast algorithm is available that tries to maintain peaks in order to achieve a forecast of a meaningful load profile. The forecast algorithm was initially developed and used in the project \"Peer Energy Cloud\" [7] for individual fine-grained load profiles of private households and was gradually improved in subsequent projects; it is resource-efficient in terms of data and computing requirements and thus suitable for embedded systems.

Compared to the completely unconditional use of the network, considerable savings are possible, since the conditional and therefore cheaper use of the network can be selected for flexibly controllable consumer devices or manufacturers.

This enables flexible tariffs and complex delivery products (e.g., tenant electricity) as well as value-added services in the field of sub-metering (heat cost allocators, sensors, actuators). There are already a few offers for end consumers that combine a time-variable electricity tariff with the provision of an intelligent measuring system [11] .

The consequence is, that the complexity regarding the design of smart grids will also grow. Hence, in the light of the given requirements, there are some major challenges for realizing a smart energy grid for Germany in the future. First of all is the physical hardware site. Investments in the net infrastructure will be inevitable, because large, central fossil fuel power stations will be replaced increasingly with decentralized and unpredictable/volatile/uncertain/unreliable production. This raises questions regarding conventional storage capabilities as well as power-to-x approaches and innovative solutions (e.g., swarm batteries). The second challenge concerns the distribution networks and their control infrastructure which will also face a serious transformation in terms of the need for digitization.

The concept of smart cities for instance [4, 19, 22, 24] differs by definition, but always, the convergence of all relevant urban sectors and the interdependencies to the power grid are crucial. Further, the market penetration of the transport sector with electric vehicles' both in individual, freight transport as well as public transport, requires a respective charging infrastructure that will affect the local grids. Besides the necessary investments in the local electricity distribution network, the traffic sector itself is very important. With a growing number of e-vehicles as part of the mobility system, their batteries could play their role as part of a decentralized storage unit for electricity in general and locally produced electricity based on renewable energies, especially for the charging supply network. In this light, the importance of flexibility, which allow dynamic pricing, is growing as well as their role as a crucial part of the energy network [23] . Though, the effects are not limited only on the individual transport, but also local public transport and the interdependencies between long-distance and freight transport will have to be taken into consideration. In addition, totally new approaches like mobile charging stations [26] could set the guidelines for highly complex requirements for urban infrastructure, in terms of modularity, granularity and flexibility. General questions will arise, such as the existing gas station network's suitability for large scale electric charging. The position of the charging stations and the associated parking facilities will also play a significant role in shaping the future street scene. In order to find suitable locations for local mobility points for car sharing, this is of great importance. More than that, the whole process of charging has to be scrutinized. In addition, further questions will emerge such as re-use of old petrol stations or the different space requirements for charging queues for traditional and e-vehicles. The batteries in e-vehicles could be used as decentralized storage, especially for locally generated electricity from renewables and thus play an important role in the charging grid on a local level in urban districts. The development of areas and districts requires a new, innovative, flexible and digitized energy supply, that can be implemented by integrating renewables, storage options and e-mobility equipment.",

If energy will be transported from regions with greater production capacity (e.g., offshore wind farms) towards regions with a locally high demand (e.g., industrial areas), the respective hard infrastructure must be installed. For instance, as shown by scientific debate wind energy has a tremendous potential -especially offshore farms [27] -for a fast and cost-efficient nationwide development of the electricity grid. Hence, the great wind potential is primarily found in mountainous and coastal areas, wind turbines are most profitable in these regions while being the most sparsely populated areas in Germany. Therefore, not only must the general question of the legitimacy of the construction be answered, but also the transport structures for energy have to be built. High voltage lines that have not yet been realized are still required, especially from industrialized north, such as Schleswig-Holstein, to the urban sprawl of consumers in the south, for example Bavaria or Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The formal obligations for the respective approval procedures and strategic development plans are inevitable and they will be a guideline for further plans on lower planning scales. The political debate in Germany showed [18] that determining the route for the new power lines in a consensus-oriented democratic system could be difficult. From a regional planning perspective, the focus on the provision of services is of public interest. However, this could include investments in the entire power grid, such as conventional grid extensions and the strategic planning of power plants. The resulting requirements will subsequently have an impact on the planning objects at local levels, e.g., traces or transformer substations, either for new locations or for retrofitting of existing ones.",

            "text": "Relevant aspects in this perspective are for instance the potential location finding process, the formal approval of combined heat and power plants and district-based energy storage on a more local level. This is particularly important since the focus on district-based considerations increases in many cities. This also includes the energy perspective, even towards concepts such as self-sufficiency. Other aspects must also be considered at the local level, which is mainly linked to the respective urban planning procedures and the building permit procedures at the district and housing levels. These are requirements for urban land use planning that will procure the installation of multimodal system stabilizers in urban areas, such as power-to-x systems for public utilities. This is of high relevance because the avoidance of emissions is now seen as an essential part of urban planning. In addition, the respective security issues and constraints, like the location in a district perspective for numerous power-to-x facilities or the effects of power chargers on local grid levels are still open questions. The effects in the local scale in terms of the building perspective will also be fundamental. In this perspective, the understanding of a smart city begins with the advent of smart and connected homes. Crucial parts in this perspective are the integration of battery storages in buildings or the respective voltage lines to charge e-mobility cars to fit the demands of in-house charging for e-vehicles [13] . Hence, a data and service platform based on flexibility as a key element for smart city or also smart home solutions. These should bring more adaptability for their users, and consequently, this does not only mean comfort in controlling the house but also to be an active part of the power grid network as a prosumer. This potential could be monetarized by emerging business models, focused also on prosumers.",

It clarifies that, in addition to the pure IT-side and infrastructure consideration of requirements, that the business conditions will change for future networks. In the context of digitization, digitalization and digital transformation, this also means that the development of new business models based on new market mechanisms will emerge. The increasing number of actors and transactions, the resilience and high safety requirements for critical infrastructures, decentralized energy and IT infrastructures, as well as decentralized organization structures, such as contract processing, drastically increases the complexity of the energy network of the future. In the course of these complex requirements, blockchain-based solutions can also be a promising alternative through the use of smart contracts, especially in respective integration approaches in the urban platform.",

The respective needs -considered in the light of an increasing share of renewable energies, will tend to increase in their complexity. There will always be a correlation between energy production and energy use, the more supply on local levels, the more complex the networks will be. The more tools such as data and service platforms will come to every household, the more it will be used and the more important it will be that these trends and developments has to be considered from planners from the energy side, as well as from urban planners or even architects. Consequently, new emerging trends, such as e-vehicles or new consumer-based business models in smart homes with smart meters will have to be part of every consideration and defining the necessity for integrated development concepts. Therefore, regional and urban planners must include energy issues in their decision making, and integrated master plans will contain energy plans as obvious as traffic plans on every scale. Especially the interaction with smart and electric mobility and their requirements [3] . In terms of a modular data and services platform, a first approach is exemplified in the context of Designetz and on the basis of the preliminary results, the authors of this study are confident they'll achieve a coherent concept for the blueprint of the energy network looking ahead to the year 2035.",
