For the past two decades, infectious diseases have spread worldwide, resulting in numerous victims and a significant social burden [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . These include the viruses severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [1] , a novel influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 [2] , and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015 [3] that are transmitted through air and respiratory routes. As one of the most critical cases, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 and is an ongoing pandemic with unparalleled historical global impacts [4, 5] . As seen with these cases, the current global population is at a much higher risk than before due to its increased size and advanced transportation technologies. This may also allow biochemical weapon attacks using airborne microorganisms to take place, such as anthrax, chicken pox, or tuberculosis [6] . To prevent the spread of diseases or defend against bioterrorism, rapid and low-cost detection techniques are required which can be used in various regions with harsh conditions, such as rural and mountainous areas or places with limited resources.",

To measure bacteria, colony counting on solid cell culture media is one of the most traditional and widely used methods [16] .

Alternatively, aerosols and airborne pathogens can be collected on filter paper [18, 19] . Bio-aerosols in the air can be captured in the functional paper material during air pump filtration. In other types, induced inertial/gravitational movements in the sampler send aerosols to a pre-loaded solution [9] , with preservation of microorganisms. These techniques could be applied for the monitoring of airborne pathogens combined with appropriate biosensors. However, some aerosol collection techniques require heavy instruments, long sampling times, or additional complex settings. The availability of rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use techniques with effective aerosol analysis is still a technical issue [7, 20] .",

We collected bacteria with an air pump and then integrated an appropriate porous material in the handheld DNA extraction strip developed in our previous study [29] . Purified and concentrated DNA on the binding pad was usable for direct PCR analysis. The 3D printing case improved the connection between the air pump and DNA extraction strip to enable extensive application of the paper kit. To create a pathogen-contained air environment, we fabricated a closed cabinet system which produces aerosols with bacteria at different temperatures and humidity. In the cabinet system, we tested a collection of airborne bacteria on the paper kit for various working conditions using a cultured solution of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria.",

The workflow of the paper kit from airborne pathogen collection to obtaining the extracted DNA is illustrated in Figure 1a -c. The air sample was filtered through the porous structure of the sampling pad using the air pump, and bacterial cells accumulated on the pad ( Figure S4 ). Lateral flow separation through the porous materials in the paper kit was a rapid DNA extraction process [31] . The porous surface of the paper material has a strong binding affinity with DNA molecules based on capillary fluidics and the entanglement effect [32] . The principle of DNA extraction in the strip is shown in Figure 1d . The collected bacteria were lysed when they mixed with the dried lysis buffer on the sampling pad, and DNA molecules were released in the bacterial cell. The DNA was transported to the binding pad by lateral flow of the washing solution and was captured on the binding pad due to the difference in binding affinity within other porous materials [29] . Other contaminants such as cell debris, proteins, or dust particles in the air were removed from the wicking pad or filtered by the prior structure of the binding pad.",

In the cabinet system, we collected and analyzed airborne pathogens under the same conditions for the entire experiment. Various factors for airborne bacteria collection of the paper kit were tested under the same temperature (25 \u2022 C), humidity (50%), and number of bacteria (10 6 CFU of S. aureus) conditions. The first variable in the airborne bacteria analysis kit was the flow rate of the air pump. When the flow rate is too fast (>25 L/min), bacterial cells may not remain on the paper surface, and a slow rate needs a much longer time to obtain the collection result. Based on the experimental data, 20 L/min is the optimal flow rate of this paper kit (Figure 3a) . During the air sampling process, bacterial cells accumulated on the sampling pad during the collection time. We could find the collection time for high efficiency from the DNA analysis results by a 5 min interval (Figure 3b ). Temperature and humidity substantially affect the aerosol size [33] ; in the test results, the bio-aerosols containing bacteria in the cabinet were also affected by temperature and humidity. Under different temperature and humidity conditions, the number of airborne bacteria from the same nebulizing solution was also changed. The paper kit detected the number of S. aureus in the air under a different temperature and humidity, as shown in Figure 3c ,d. We verified the reliability of the paper kit when operated at 25-35 \u2022 C and 30-70% humidity. ",

We analyzed S. aureus in the air on three days in different seasons (Table 1) because S. aureus is one of the most common bacterial species in city air. The indoor temperature and humidity were similar on each test day; however, the airborne bacteria concentration differed according to the outdoor environment. The number of bacteria collected with the paper kit indicates the relative concentration of airborne bacteria. We estimated the concentration of S. aureus in the indoor air based on the flow rate and operation time of the air pump and compared these values to the colony counting results using an impactor sampler. Each calculation value from the paper kit was overestimated compared to the impactor results by culturing in the cell broth. This was a reasonable result considering the difference between molecular diagnosis (qPCR) and the cell culture technique because dead bacterial cells were also counted in qPCR from the remaining DNA molecules. Following the working procedure of the paper kit, airborne bacteria monitoring was conducted within 20 min, consisting of 15 min of collection and <5 min of DNA extraction. The collection time could be reduced for rapid detection according to the results in the cabinet. This low-cost paper kit can provide valuable information regarding airborne bacteria status in a short time. ",

Air collection within 15 min successfully detected airborne bacteria. Artificially contaminated air containing S. aureus bacteria in the cabinet was successfully analyzed at various concentrations. Indoor air was also simply analyzed using the paper kit and demonstrated reliable results for the concentration of airborne bacteria. The proposed air monitoring kit is simple, cost-effective, portable, and has mass producible aspects compared to other air sampling techniques. The entire process from sampling to obtaining the DNA analyte took 20 min, which can be reduced when the collection time is reduced. The collected samples and concentrated DNA on the paper kit can undergo PCR analysis after long-term storage during the shipping process [29] . We expect the paper kit could be applied in all locations, including those with limited resources and harsh environments, and become a suitable alternative for air monitoring for disease prevention, bioterrorism defense, air pollution, and other applications.",
