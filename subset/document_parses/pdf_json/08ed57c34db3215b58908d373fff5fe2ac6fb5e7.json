Often such an algebra arises as a subalgebra of some overall algebra for the problem at hand. There are various methods of defining a Boolean substructure, for example, introducing a special type or sort for the subalgebra and then stipulating one of the standard Boolean algebra axiom sets for it. However, the extra type may get into the way of automatic verification with tools that only support a single sort. Then the Boolean sort has to be simulated by a characterising predicate, and many otherwise equational formulas need to be enriched by a premise involving that predicate. This complicates specifications and may hamper efficient automatic treatment.",

To this end we first propose a succinct yet understandable set of axioms for Boolean algebras. Imposing these on the range of the complement operation, we develop a hierarchy of algebras with a Boolean subalgebra and further structure overall. The hierarchy ultimately specialises to antidomain semirings and Stone algebras.",

In computation models, elements of the Kleene algebra model state changes while tests model conditions on states.

It uses the well-known fact that the elements of a Stone algebra satisfying x = x form a Boolean subalgebra [16] .

Building block B 0 is used as a reference in the subsequent development and to prove results to be inherited by further, more special structures.

Except for the most basic axiomatisation, which imposes no extra structure beyond the Boolean subalgebra, the axioms assume that the overall algebra is a semilattice. The hierarchy has shed new light on the interconnections between several such approaches. The axioms are simple and perspicuous when translated into formulas of the respective theories. All of our axioms are (or can be written as) equations and hence well suited to mechanical support.",

It filters relevant lemmas, calls fully automated external theorem provers (such as E, Spass, Vampire) and SMT solvers (such as CVC4, Z3) and reconstructs proofs within Isabelle/HOL to avoid trusting external software. In several cases, Prover9 [26] was able to find a proof where the tools called by Sledgehammer failed. Since Prover9 is not integrated with Sledgehammer, we wrote a program that transforms the output generated by Prover9 to an Isabelle/HOL proof. The translation currently works for a limited range of proofs but could form the basis of an integration into Sledgehammer. Such an extension would be beneficial because Prover9 performs well for algebraic applications [6] .",
