In the other 11 patients, CRP levels were in or near the normal range within 1 week. Elevated IL-6 is the indication for TCZ use in COVID-19. The levels of IL-6 before TCZ administration ranged from 16.4 to 627.1 pg/mL (2 times to nearly 90 times higher than normal). After starting TCZ therapy, serum IL-6 level in 10 (66.7%) patients tended to spike shortly in first and then decreased. One patient (No. 13) demonstrated a persistent decrease of IL-6 after TCZ administration combined with MP. The clinical classification of these patients is mainly moderately ill and seriously ill patients. But in these four critically ill patients who failed the treatment (No. 1, 2, 3, and 7), a persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed. Except for patients No. 1, 2, 3, and 7, patient No. 15 also had a clinical outcome of aggravation. 4 | DISCUSSION In this study, we evaluated the effect of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 patients in real life. Our findings supported the effectiveness of TCZ in the prevention or treatment of cytokine storms induced by COVID-19. In most patients, acute phase reactant levels were decreased and the patients were getting to a stable condition reflected by a later gradual decrease of IL-6 after TCZ administration. Corticosteroids such as MP are the conventional agents used to fight cytokine storms. However, in the treatment of corticosteroids, a high dose and a long-time period were often required and follow with subsequent risk of side effects. In an attempt to provide a corticosteroid-sparing effect, TCZ was recommended in COVID-19 patients to prevent or treat cytokine storms. The rationale for the use of the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody TCZ in COVID-19 patients is based on our understanding of the role of IL-6 in this disease and the experience with this drug in the treatment of cytokine release syndrome caused by chimeric antigen receptors redirect T cells.

Considering the long half-life time of TCZ and the saturate properties of receptor binding, the dose of TCZ could be reduced when repeated use. IL-6 can be used to evaluate the severity of the infection and predict the prognosis. 7 Dynamic observation of IL-6 levels is also helpful in understanding the progression of COVID-19 and the response to treatment. IL-6 level tends to further spiked and then decreased in most patients after starting TCZ therapy. Actually, IL-6 is mainly eliminated via IL-6R-mediated clearance. 8 Binding of TCZ to IL-6R inhibits receptor-mediated clearance of IL-6, leading to its accumulation in serum. This is the likely explanation for the spiked IL-6 levels in TCZ-treated COVID-19 patients in this study. And a later gradual decrease of IL-6 might partly benefit from the inhibition of inflammatory activity by TCZ that resulting in stabilization or improvement of clinical outcome.Given the application of TCZ combined with PM in patient 13, we propose that PM might account for the persistent decrease of IL-6 in this patient since stopping PM administration trend to lead an increase of IL-6.
