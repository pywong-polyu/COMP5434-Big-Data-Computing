We develop a model that predicts such open-ended, sequential choices using a process of cued retrieval from longterm memory. Using the past choice to cue subsequent retrievals, this model predicts the sequential purchases and response times of nearly 5 million grocery purchases made by more than 100,000 online shoppers. Products can be associated in different ways, such as by their episodic association or semantic overlap, and we find that consumers query multiple forms of associative knowledge when retrieving options. Attending to certain knowledge sources, as estimated by our model, predicts important retrieval errors, such as the propensity to forget or add unwanted products. Our results demonstrate how basic memory retrieval mechanisms shape choices in real-world, goal-directed tasks.",

However, in real-world tasks such as online grocery shopping, the space of possible options is too large to be considered at once. Choices therefore depend on how options are retrieved from long-term memory (4) (5) (6) (7) . The task itself can provide the context to retrieve associated choice options. Here, we consider how a previous choice influences subsequent consumer choices in a goal-directed sequential decision task. Using computational models, we evaluate how different sources of knowledge influence choice by decomposing associative memory into its constituent components.",

We test this by developing associative representations of these knowledge sources [as in (20) ] before evaluating whether sequential choices are better explained by one or a combination of these representations. We also hypothesize that individual differences may drive shoppers to attend to certain sources of knowledge more than others. For example, a shopper driven by episodic memories of breakfast might retrieve butter then bread, whereas those relying on hierarchical knowledge may retrieve butter with other dairy products, as they would in the supermarket. We operationalize these processes of associative retrieval and attention in a computational cognitive model and show that it can predict sequential consumer choices. After each retrieval, we suggest that consumers accept or reject possibilities according to their goals. For example, shoppers may consider whether retrieved options are suitable for breakfast. However, goals are not modeled or enumerated here, as we focus on the contribution of different knowledge systems during sequential option retrieval.",

If not, then a new option is retrieved and checked for goal relevance until one is accepted. Similar heuristic strategies have been used in models of option generation for single choices (18, 19) .

This suggests that choices were nonrandom and were cued by their similarity with the prior choice. Sequential cued retrieval can be viewed as a ripple through memory, in that more recently retrieved items tend to be more similar (11) . As shown in Fig Histograms show that the similarity between consecutive purchases (averaged for each visit) was higher compared to when the order of purchases was randomly permuted (with 95% CIs).

Forgetting is often viewed as a failure of retrieval (26, 27) and could simply result from \"searching the wrong part of memory\" [page 40 of (28)]. The retrieval model used here (22) assumes that items will be activated according to a process of spreading activation (29, 30) . When operating on an episodic representation, this would tend to chain together products found together in the same basket (e.g., purchasing a Thai pepper may cue coconut milk, bamboo shoots, and other complementary ingredients). Thus, we hypothesized that shoppers relying on episodic knowledge, as measured by the attention weights from the best-fitting retrieval model, would be less likely to forget products, as they would tend to coactivate items often combined in pursuit of a goal.

This would not be predicted by many existing models of semantic memory retrieval (11, 12) and option generation (6, 7) , which rely on a single measure of association. Associative knowledge likely takes several forms [e.g., see (35) ], which is consistent with our modeling approach and results.

All results were consistent with those reported here, which is reassuring given that these transitions were perhaps best representative of memory-based search. In addition, the model that best explained sequential grocery choices also provided the best fit to sequential retrievals of foods, which were observed in a controlled laboratory task (detailed in section S3). Thus, while design features may help shoppers retrieve certain brands (e.g., brands of cola), shoppers still seem to depend on cued retrieval from multiple knowledge formats to determine what they will look for next.",

We hope that these findings Results show that relying on episodic or hierarchical knowledge predicted fewer forgotten items, whereas attending to semantic knowledge predicted more forgotten items, as measured by the use of a recommender system displayed before checkout. stimulate further work in the laboratory, where one typically has a higher degree of control for assessing questions of cause and effect. For example, an additional explanation for choices becoming slower and more dissimilar over time is that retrieved options are increasingly rejected as they become less goal relevant (e.g., goals become increasingly satisfied). Future laboratory studies could assess this claim by asking participants to choose options in the presence of more or fewer goals.

For example, shoppers relying on hierarchical knowledge could benefit from recommendations promoting episodically related products (e.g., \"goes well with...\"), whereas those relying on episodic knowledge could benefit from seeing semantically similar products (e.g., \"people also viewed...\").

The increase in hierarchical similarity over time is visualized in Fig. 2D. One might correspondingly expect choices to become slower over time, as more dissimilar options are slower to retrieve. Regression analyses of interresponse intervals (IRIs) conformed to this expectation. First, the standardized coefficients for episodic (b episodic = \u22120.137, 95% CI = [\u22120.138, \u22120.136], P < 0.0001), semantic (b semantic = \u22120.086, 95% CI = [\u22120.087, \u22120.085], P < 0.0001), and hierarchical knowledge (b hierarchy = \u22120.273, 95% CI = [\u22120.274, \u22120.271], P < 0.0001) were all negative predictors of IRI, indicating that more dissimilar options were slower to retrieve. Moreover, average IRIs appeared to slow over the duration of the trip (b timestep = 0.130, 95 % CI [0.129,0.130], P < 0.0001). This slowdown is shown inFig. 2C. Including variables representing the navigation method (e.g., keyword search) and the similarity across, each representation confirmed this slowdown as a general trend (full regression equation is in table S2), and this echoes similar patterns of slowing observed in category fluency tasks(10)(11)(12).",
