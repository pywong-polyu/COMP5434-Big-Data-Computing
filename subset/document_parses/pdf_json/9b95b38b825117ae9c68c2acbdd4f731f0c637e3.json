Materials and Methodology: As a primary step, we analyzed the frequency and functional profile of innate immune cells (NK cells/dendritic cells/monocytes) and adaptive immunity-driving lymphocytes (B cells/T cells/follicular T helper cells) by flow cytometry. Sixty cases of SARS CoV-2 infection (25 severe, 35 mild) and ten healthy subjects without SARS CoV-2 IgG were included. Disease-duration based analysis of immune profile was explored for early events differentiating the two disease forms. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by PRNT.",

Irrespective of the degree of industrialization or availability of medical infrastructure, all populations have been (and are being) affected. The number of cases worldwide and corresponding mortality rates are 31.6 million and 3.7% respectively. 1 The disease, COVID-19, varies from an asymptomatic infection and self-limiting mild disease to severe acute respiratory distress, multiorgan failure followed by recovery or fatal outcome. For any pathogen leading to variable clinical presentations and mortality, understanding of pathogenesis is of utmost importance. Initial studies identified older age and pre-existing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, etc., as high-risk factors for disease severity. 2 Viral sequence variation was not related to severity 3 and similar viral loads were detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. 4 The major focus of the scientific community has been to unravel the immunopathogenesis of the disease requiring a clear understanding of the immune response in both mild and severe disease forms. Due to the high transmissibility of the virus and biosafety concerns, studies are predominantly limited to blood investigations. An association of cytokine storm including high levels of interleukin IL-6 production with severe disease signifies pathological immune dysregulation. 3, 5, 6 Recent data suggest that antibody response is higher in severe disease. 7 Though studies on innate immunity are limited, 8 T cell and B cell responses are being actively investigated [9] [10] [11] In India, the first COVID case was reported on 30th January 2020. As of today, (September 23, 2020) 5.73 million confirmed cases with >91,000 deaths have been reported. Older age and existing comorbidities remain the high-risk factors. Of note, we observed significantly higher OD values in ELISA 12 and neutralizing antibody titers in PRNT (unpublished observations) in patients with severe disease than those presenting with mild infection. In view of the need to understand immunology of the disease in general and among the Indian population in particular, we attempted to explore the functional profile of innate immune cells (monocytes, dendritic cells, and NK cells), and adaptive immune cells (B cells, follicular T helper cells, CD4 T, and CD8 T cells) in SARS CoV-2 infected individuals presenting with asymptomatic, mild, or severe disease. Further, the dynamics of these immune cells and, relation to neutralizing antibody titers was analyzed. We found that certain earlier modulations observed during the first week of disease could differentiate between mild and severe infections.",

Interestingly, a reduction in dendritic cells was found in the SD patients (Table 4) . Comparison in relation to disease duration revealed an association of early (first week) reduction of mDCs with the mature phenotype (CD80 and CD86) and total pDCs with severe disease that continued for at least 2 weeks (Table 4) . Interestingly, patients with lower frequency of mDCs exhibited lower plasma IL-4 levels. Role of IL-4 in the process of maturation of dendritic cells is well documented. 16 For the first time, we show that early modulation of dendritic cells is associated with disease severity and could play a crucial role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. In-depth evaluation in terms of utility as a prognostic disease severity marker and treatment is warranted.",

In accordance with acute inflammatory response, both IL-6 and IL-10 levels increased in SD patients while IL-4, an anti-inflammatory cytokine predominated in mild disease helping prevention of progression to severe disease. Relation of IL-4 levels with frequency of mDCs is noteworthy. Importantly, IL-4 is observed to reduce the expression of the ACE2 receptor and may partially contribute to restraining viral entry. 37 Our study has a few limitations. The sample size was limited and very few samples were available in the 4th week of disease. Due to lymphopenia and restricted sample volume, the study was limited to a few markers.

The findings pointed out major defects in the maturation (CD80 and CD86 expression) of myeloid dendritic cells and reduction in plasmacytoid dendritic cell frequency, emphasizing compromised antigen presentation. Enhanced frequency of nonclassical monocytes could be an important event in maintaining vascular homeostasis in the inflammatory cytokine milieu formed due to the infection. Activated NK and CD8 T cell subsets observed in severe cases may enhance lung tissue injury and disease severity. Likewise, activation of T FH , and CD4 T cell compartments in these cases may lead to a transient higher humoral response observed during the acute phase of infection. However, whether these antibodies are protective or aid in disease severity remains unclear. Lower IL-21 receptor expression on B cells may lead to impaired proliferation and differentiation of B cells. Moreover, plasmablast cells showed a comparatively lower BCMA expression, a long term survival marker for plasma cells. Collectively, long term immunity is likely to be hampered, another observation being reported recently.

In summary, while confirming previous findings, our study revealed that Indian patients exhibited a different set of immunological modulation in SARS CoV-2 infection and identified additional prospective severity prognostic markers such as dendritic cells, activated CD8 T cells, IL-2+ CD4 T cells, and follicular T helper cells. Confirmation in larger cohorts and in-depth functional assays to understand the underlying mechanism(s) remains the way forward.",

Gating strategy used to distinguish different lymphocyte populations by polychromatic flow cytometry: The PBMCs from SARS CoV-2 infected cases were stained with given number of panels of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies to assess the frequency and functional profile of T cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells), follicular T helper cells (T FH ), B cells, Dendritic cells, and monocytes. List of the antibodies with their clones and fluorochrome dyes is provided as Supporting Information Table. Flow cytometry data were analyzed by using Cytexpert Version 2.4. (A) CD4 and CD8 T cells-Lymphocyte populations were identified based on forward and side scatter properties of PBMCs. The CD3 positive population was further discriminated to identify CD4 and CD8 T cells. Then CD8 T cells were analyzed for HLA DR & CD38 expression whereas the CD4 T cell population was analyzed for CD40L and IL-2 expression. (B) T FH cells-follicular T cells were identified based on PD-1 and CXCR5 expression on CD4 T cells as mentioned above. The T FH population was further inspected for ICOS and IL-21 expression. (c) NK cells-Natural killer cells were identified as CD3-CD56+CD16+/\u2212 (total NK cell population comprised cytotoxic NK cells (CD3-CD56+CD16+) and Regulatory NK cells (CD3-CD56+CD16-). (D) Dendritic cells-lymphomono gate was identified by using forward and side scatter properties of the cells. The cells were checked for Lineage cocktail (CD3, CD19, CD14, CD56, and CD20) positivity. Lineage cocktail negative cells were selected and checked for HLA DR expression. Thus, Lin-HLA DR+CD11c+CD1C+ cells were considered as myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) whereas Lin-HLA DR+CD11c-CD123+ cells were considered as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). (E) Monocytes-monocyte gate was recognized by FS & SS contour plot. Further, the CD3 negative cells from this population were screened for CD14 expression to identify the monocyte population. The monocyte population was further analyzed for CD16 expression to discriminate classical and nonclassical monocytes. (F) B cells and Plasmablast cells-B cells from lymphocytes were identified with the help of CD19 expression. For further differentiation, expression of CD27 (memory B cells), IgD/IgM (class-switched memory B cells [CSMB] and unswitched memory B cells [USMB]), and CD138 (plasmablast cells) was considered",
