Autosomal recessive (AR) complete IFNAR1 deficiency was reported in one 12-yr-old patient. Here, we studied seven other previously healthy patients aged 13 to 80 yr with unexplained life-threatening YFV vaccine-associated disease. One 13-yr-old patient had AR complete IFNAR2 deficiency. Three other patients vaccinated at the ages of 47, 57, and 64 yr had high titers of circulating auto-Abs against at least 14 of the 17 individual type I IFNs. These antibodies were recently shown to underlie at least 10% of cases of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. The auto-Abs were neutralizing in vitro, blocking the protective effect of IFN-\u03b12 against YFV vaccine strains. AR IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 deficiency and neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs thus accounted for more than half the cases of life-threatening YFV vaccine-associated disease studied here. Previously healthy subjects could be tested for both predispositions before anti-YFV vaccination.",

            "text": "The 17D live attenuated vaccine against yellow fever virus (YFV) was approved for use in humans by the World Health Organization in 1945. It has since been used to vaccinate more than 600 million people worldwide, with very high rates of seroconversion following the administration of a single dose, providing long-term protection (Monath, 2005; Monath et al., 2005) . About half the vaccine recipients develop transient low-level viremia detectable 4-6 d after inoculation, a timing similar to that for viremia after WT YFV infection. All live attenuated YFV vaccines in current use are derivatives of the 17D strain and produced by amplification in embryonated chicken eggs. Although initially considered to be the world's safest live virus vaccine, rare cases of life-threatening disease following vaccination with YFV-17D were subsequently detected from 2001 onward (Chan et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2001; Seligman, 2014; Vasconcelos et al., 2001) . Systemic disease with clinical manifestations of organ dysfunction is often reported as yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD; Seligman, 2014) , and cases with neurological manifestations are referred to as yellow fever vaccine-associated neurological disease (YEL-AND). The prevalences of these conditions are \u223c0.3 and \u223c0.8 per 100,000 vaccinees, respectively (Lindsey et al., 2016) . However, prevalence estimates vary, ranging, for YEL-AVD, from 0-0.01 per 100,000 vaccinees in Africa, to 0.02-0.31 per 100,000 vaccinees in Brazil, and 0.35 per 100,000 vaccinees in the United States, which is considered to be the most accurate estimate. The incidence of YEL-AND is estimated at 0.39 per 10 5 administered vaccine doses (range, 0.02-1.5; Lecomte et al., 2020) . Mortality rates vary depending on age, but approximatively two thirds of individuals die (Seligman, 2014) . The rate of severe adverse events seems to increase with age, particularly after the age of 55 yr, and is higher in men (Lindsey et al., 2016; Seligman, 2014) . Women in their prime childbearing years and patients with thymoma are also at risk (Seligman, 2014) . Severe adverse reactions have also occurred in association with various autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, and myasthenia gravis, suggesting an immunological mechanism (Martins et al., 2014; Seligman, 2014; Seligman and Casanova, 2016) .",

This study also highlighted the crucial role of type I IFNs in controlling live attenuated YFV-17D. Four other patients with IFNAR1 deficiency have been reported: a 9-yr-old child from Iran with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) live vaccine-associated disease (Hernandez et al., 2019) , a 2-yr-old child from Palestine with herpes simplex encephalitis (Bastard et al., 2020a) , and two adults, aged 26 and 38 yr, from Saudi Arabia and Turkey, with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia (Zhang et al., 2020b) . A case of YEL-AVD was also reported in a 1-yr-old patient with a suspected AR deficiency of IRF9, a component of the ISGF3 complex activated by both type I and III IFNs (Bravo Garc\u00eda-Morato et al., 2019) . Another child, with severe influenza pneumonia, had proven AR IRF9 deficiency but was not vaccinated against yellow fever (Hernandez et al., 2018) . Thus, inborn errors of type I IFN immunity can underlie lifethreatening disease following vaccination against YFV. We studied seven other unrelated and previously healthy patients, currently aged 35 to 80 yr, who had suffered from YEL-AVD (n = 5) and/or YEL-AND (n = 3; Table 1 ; Lecomte et al., 2020; Pulendran et al., 2008; Slesak et al., 2017) . All had suffered lifethreatening complications following vaccination with YFV-17D.",

            "text": "A rare homozygous essential splice variant of IFNAR2 in one patient In addition to the patient with proven AR IFNAR1 deficiency (Hernandez et al., 2019) , we studied seven patients who had experienced life-threatening disease following vaccination with the YFV-17D vaccine (Table 1) . We performed whole-exome sequencing in all patients. Principal component analysis confirmed that the patients were of different ancestries (Fig. S1 A) . We hypothesized that the patients developed YEL-AVD and/or YEL-AND because of monogenic inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) compromising the cellular response to type I IFNs (IFNAR1, IFNAR2, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 genes; Bastard et al., 2020a; Duncan et al., 2015; Dupuis et al., 2003; Hambleton et al., 2013; Hernandez et al., 2019; Hernandez et al., 2018) . We also considered possible defects of JAK1 and TYK2, although both encode proteins that are much more pleiotropic than the components of the ISGF3 complex (Eletto et al., 2016; Kreins et al., 2015) . We tested this hypothesis by searching for homozygous singlenucleotide variants or large deletions (copy number variants). We filtered out common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] > 0.01) and variants predicted to be benign (combined annotation-dependent depletion score below the mutation significance cutoff within the 99% confidence interval; Itan et al., 2016; Kircher et al., 2014; Fig. S1 B) . We also analyzed all genes underlying known IEIs (Bousfiha et al., 2020; Notarangelo et al., 2020; Tangye et al., 2020) . We found that one patient (P1) carried a homozygous essential splicing variant of IFNAR2 (c.840+1G>T). P1 is a 35-yr-old woman from Brazil who suffered from YEL-AVD at the age of 13 yr. She had no previous history of severe viral infections. 3 d after vaccination with YFV-17D, P1 presented with fever and digestive symptoms. She was admitted to the hospital 4 d later for epistaxis, hepatitis, and hypotension. She recovered with supportive care. Her sister died from YEL-AVD at the age of 19 yr, but no samples were available for this study (Fig. 1 A) . There were no rare variants in the other six candidate genes or in known IEI genes. The patient's homozygosity rate was 0.88%, and there were only seven other homozygous rare nonsynonymous variants in her exome, none of which was connected to antiviral immunity (Fig. S1 C) . The IF-NAR2 variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and was found to be present in the heterozygous state in both of P1's parents and in several other members of her family (Fig. 1 B) . This variant was present in the gnomAD v3.1 public database but was extremely rare (MAF = 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) and found only in the heterozygous state (Fig. S1 D) . Given the crucial role of human IFNAR2 in the type I IFN pathway (Duncan et al., 2015) and the previously described IFNAR1-deficient patient with YEL-AVD (Hernandez et al., 2019) , we hypothesized that the homozygous essential splice site variant of IFNAR2 might underlie the pathogenesis of the adverse reaction to YFV-17D in P1.

We thus performed exon trapping on the patient's genomic DNA (gDNA) to test the impact of the variant. As predicted, a complete loss of exon 8 was observed in analyses of mRNA from the patient but not in analyses of mRNA from a healthy control ( Fig. 1 , C and D; and Fig. S1 F). We also performed mutagenesis on gDNA to restore the patient's variant to the WT form, which restored normal splicing (Fig. S1 G). Human IFNAR2 is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein that constitutively binds JAK1 (Russell-Harde et al., 2000; Wilmes et al., 2015) . The loss of exon 8 is predicted to lead to a frameshift and a premature stop codon (p.Ser238Phefs*3; Fig. 1 , E and F). We first studied the expression of the mutant (MT) IFNAR2 by plasmid-mediated overexpression in HEK293T cells. Following the transient transfection of cells with plasmids containing the WT or MT IFNAR2 cDNA (isoform c), similar levels of IFNAR2 mRNA were detected for the WT, MT, and previously published variant (p.E104fs110*) when using a probe spanning exons 1 and 2 ( Fig. 1 G) . Western blot analysis of these cell extracts with a C-terminal tag showed the protein to be absent, consistent with the loss of exon 8 leading to a frameshift without translation reinitiation ( Fig. 1 H) . We then performed flow cytometry to analyze the cell surface expression of WT and MT IFNAR2 in transfected HEK293T cells. The MT protein was not detected on the cell surface ( Fig. 1 I) .",

We therefore searched for IgG auto-Abs against IFN-\u03b12 and IFN-\u03c9 by ELISA and with a Luminex assay. We found high titers in three (P2, P3, and P4) of the six patients tested ( Fig. 2 A and Fig. S2 A). P2 is a 62-yr-old man originating from and living in Germany, with no prior history of severe viral infections. At the age of 57 yr, 5 d after YFV-17D vaccination, before traveling to Zanzibar, he developed neurological symptoms consistent with YEL-AND, and his liver enzyme levels increased (Slesak et al., 2017) . He was also hospitalized 2 yr later, at the age of 59 yr, for influenza B infection with bilateral interstitial pneumonia. The blood sample positive for auto-Abs against type I IFNs was taken 6 mo after YFV-17D disease. P3 is a 50-yr-old Brazilian woman with no history of severe viral infections. She presented with YEL-AVD following YFV-17D vaccination at the age of 47 yr. 3 d after vaccination, she reported fever, headache, and myalgia, which rapidly worsened. She was subsequently admitted to the hospital with shock, acute renal and hepatic insufficiency, and thrombopenia. She was hospitalized in the intensive care unit for 2 mo. Of note, she reported a history of 3 mo of polyarthralgia before hospitalization, and a history of miscarriage and preterm birth for her two pregnancies. She was diagnosed with SLE during her hospital stay. Not coincidentally, women with SLE have been reported to be both at risk of adverse reactions to YFV-17D vaccination (Seligman, 2014) and prone to producing auto-Abs against type I IFN (Gupta et al., 2016; Howe and Leung, 2019; Mathian et al., 2019; Panem et al., 1982) . The blood sample positive for auto-Abs against type I IFNs was taken when the patient was 49 yr old, 2 yr after YFV-17D disease. P4 is an 80-yr-old man originating from and living in the United States, with no prior history of severe viral infections. At the age of 64 yr, 2 d after YFV-17D vaccination, he developed fever and digestive symptoms. His condition quickly deteriorated, and he was hospitalized 2 d later for hypotension, skin rash, high fever, renal insufficiency, cytolysis, and thrombopenia (Pulendran et al., 2008) . The blood sample positive for auto-Abs was taken 16 d after the onset of YFV-17D disease. Interestingly, all patients tested (including P2 and P3) had been exposed to several common viruses (Fig. S2 B) , and P2 and P3 were positive for anti-nuclear auto-Abs (Table S1 ). Three of the eight patients with adverse reactions to YFV vaccination studied therefore had high titers of auto-Abs to type I IFNs.",

            "text": "end of the IFNAR2 protein was used. GAPDH was used as a loading control. A representative blot from two independent experiments is shown. The auto-Abs are neutralizing and recognize most of the 17 subtypes of type I IFN We then investigated whether these auto-Abs were neutralizing in vitro (i.e., if they could block the activity of recombinant type I IFNs in an experimental assay). We incubated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from a healthy control individual with 10% plasma from a healthy control or from the three patients, and stimulated the cells with IFN-\u03b12 or IFN-\u03c9. We found that the presence of plasma from the three patients completely abolished type I IFN signaling, as shown by analyses of pSTAT1 induction following treatment with IFN-\u03b12 or IFN-\u03c9 ( Fig. 2 B and Fig. S2 C) . For P2 and P3, we also analyzed the induction of IFN-stimulated genes after 2 h of stimulation with IFN-\u03b12 or IFN-\u03c9, using type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) as a control. The incubation of cells with plasma from either patient led to the abolition of IFN-stimulated gene induction in response to either of the individual type I IFNs tested, but not in response to type II IFN. By contrast, induction in response to both type I and II IFNs remained normal in the presence of plasma from healthy control individuals (Fig. 2 C) . We tested the three patients for auto-Abs against the other 15 individual type I IFNs by performing ELISA with recombinant proteins for the 17 individual type I IFNs. We found that P2, P3, and P4 had auto-Abs recognizing at least 14 subtypes (Fig. 2 D) , a finding similar to that for most of the patients with life-threatening COVID-19 carrying auto-Abs against type I IFNs and autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1; Bastard et al., 2020b) , although two patients (P2 and P3) also had neutralizing auto-Abs against IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. S2 C) . The plasma samples from P2, P3, and P4 did not recognize IFN-\u03ba or IFN-\u03b5, at least in the experimental conditions tested. These two type I IFNs were not, however, sufficient to protect the patients from YFV-17D infection. Overall, we found that three patients presenting severe adverse reactions to YFV-17D vaccination had high titers of neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs and that these auto-Abs recognized most of the 17 individual type I IFN subtypes. The auto-Abs neutralize IFN-\u03b12-mediated protection against YFV-17D in vitro Finally, we investigated whether these auto-Abs blocking type I IFN in biochemical assays were also able to block type I IFNmediated protection against YFV-17D infection in cells in vitro. Plasma from P2 and P3, who had auto-Abs against type I IFNs, clearly blocked the ability of IFN-\u03b12 to protect Huh-7.5 cells from infection with YFV-17D (Fig. 3) . By contrast, plasma from two healthy donors without auto-Abs or from two other patients with severe YFV infection but without auto-Abs did not block the protective effect of IFN-\u03b12 (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, plasma from eight previously reported patients with life-threatening COVID-19 and auto-Abs against IFN-\u03b12 also blocked the protective effect of IFN-\u03b12 against YFV-17D (Fig. S3 ), in addition to that against SARS-CoV-2 (Bastard et al., 2020b) . Interestingly, the three patients reported here belong to two groups known to be at higher risk of displaying auto-Abs against type I IFNs: P2 and P4 are men over the age of 55 yr (Bastard et al., 2020b; Seligman, 2014) , and P3 is a 47-yr-old woman with SLE (Panem et al., 1982) . Finally, we found that the prevalence of auto-Abs against type I IFNs in our cohort of patients with severe adverse events following YFV-17D vaccination and without known IEI was significantly higher than the estimated prevalence in the general population (Bastard et al., 2020b; 37 .5% vs. 0.3%; Fisher's exact test, P = 6.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). It is also probably not coincidental that the two patients with inherited IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 deficiency were younger, at 12 and 13 yr, and did not display auto-Abs against type I IFNs. This suggests that the two mechanisms disrupting type I IFN immunity and resulting in YFV-17D disease are related but independent. This finding is reminiscent of our recent reports of inborn errors of type I IFNs and auto-Abs against type I IFNs in nonoverlapping groups of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia (Bastard et al., 2020b; Zhang et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020b) . Overall, these findings strongly suggest that the three patients reported here suffered adverse reactions to YFV-17D because of preexisting neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs, which targeted most of the individual subtypes of type I IFN, blocking their protective effect against YFV-17D.",

            "text": "Two members of our cohort of eight patients with YEL-AVD or YEL-AND have AR IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 deficiency, and another three have neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs. These results suggest that at least half the patients with severe adverse reactions to YFV-17D have inadequate type I IFN immunity. This may be the case for the 78 reported patients with YEL-AVD or YEL-AND, including our five patients (Martins et al., 2014; Hernandez et al., 2019; Lindsey et al., 2016; Seligman, 2014; Seligman and Casanova, 2016; Slesak et al., 2017) . These findings unambiguously place human type I IFNs at the core of protective immunity to YFV-17D. They have important clinical implications. First, patients with known inborn errors of, or auto-Abs against, type I IFN should not be vaccinated with YFV-17D. Second, patients with adverse reactions to YFV-17D should be tested for inborn errors of type I IFN immunity and for the presence of auto-Abs against type I IFNs. Third, both types of patients may benefit from treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03b2 in the course of YFV-17D disease, provided that they do not have auto-Abs against IFN-\u03b2 (such Abs were present in two of the three patients reported here but were absent from 99 of 101 patients from a previous report on severe COVID-19; Bastard et al., 2020b) . Fourth, patients with autoimmune manifestations, including SLE and thymoma in particular, should be screened for auto-Abs against type I IFNs before vaccination with YFV-17D, as, perhaps, should men over the age of 55 yr. Younger patients may nevertheless also be at risk of adverse reactions to YFV-17D vaccination due to preexisting auto-Abs against type I IFNs, as suggested by the case of an 8-yr-old patient homozygous for a hypomorphic RAG1 mutation who had defective adaptive immunity, multiple severe infectious diseases, auto-Abs against type I IFNs, and encephalitis after YFV-17D vaccination (Walter et al., 2015;  Table S1 , JCI80477sdt1). Moreover, the youngest patient with lifethreatening COVID-19 pneumonia and auto-Abs against type I IFNs reported to date was 25 yr old (Bastard et al., 2020b) , younger than the two patients with inherited IFNAR1 deficiency and critical COVID-19, aged 26 and 38 yr (Zhang et al., 2020b) . Although difficult in some regions, screening for both inborn errors of type I IFN immunity and auto-Abs against type I IFNs could, therefore, be considered for patients of all ages before vaccination with YFV-17D. Moreover, patients with auto-Abs against type I IFNs are likely to be at risk of developing an adverse event if vaccinated with the newly developed vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that uses the YFV live attenuated vaccine as a carrier (Sanchez-Felipe et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Pre-existing auto-Abs against type I IFNs can underlie different viral diseases Our findings also have implications for the pathogenic role of auto-Abs against type I IFNs. Our previous study on lifethreatening COVID-19 suggested that the auto-Abs against type I IFNs were causal of disease, rather than triggered by SARS-CoV-2 (Bastard et al., 2020b) . Indeed, they were already present in blood samples from 2 of the 101 patients, 95 of whom were men, collected before the onset of COVID-19. Moreover, they were detected early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the other patients, making it highly unlikely that these auto-Abs of the IgG type with a high affinity for type I IFNs were triggered by infection. Finally, these Abs are common in patients with two genetic diseases underlying severe COVID-19: APS-1 (Meager et al., 2006) and incontinentia pigmenti (Bastard et al., 2020b) . The three patients with auto-Abs reported here add weight to this conclusion. Indeed, they developed YFV-17D disease within 5 d of vaccination. We did not test their blood for the presence of auto-Abs before vaccination, or even during YFV-17D disease, but the presence of these Abs 6 mo (P2), 2 yr (P3), and 16 d (P4) later provides compelling evidence for an association with disease (Fisher's exact test, P = 6.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ), even without taking into account a previously reported patient whose YFV-17D disease may have been triggered by her many profound deficits of adaptive immunity other than auto-Abs against type I IFNs (Walter et al., 2015) . Assuming that the three patients had auto-Abs at the time of hospital admission for YFV-17D disease, it would have been almost impossible for them to mount a neutralizing IgG response against a self-antigen so quickly. Furthermore, one of the patients (P3) was diagnosed with SLE during hospitalization, and her SLE symptoms began 3 mo before admission, consistent with the occurrence of such auto-Abs, as reported in \u223c5-10% of patients with SLE (Gupta et al., 2016; Mathian et al., 2019; Panem et al., 1982) . The sex of the patient and age at the time of vaccination are similar to those in the other three known cases of SLE with YFV-17D disease (Seligman, 2014) . Auto-Abs against type I IFNs can therefore underlie severe COVID-19 or YFV-17D disease. Intriguingly, children with APS-1 and auto-Abs to type I IFNs have been vaccinated with MMR without any reported adverse reaction, despite the occurrence of MMR disease in several patients with inherited IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 deficiency (Bastard et al., 2020a; Duncan et al., 2015; Gothe et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2019) . This may be due to the activity of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03ba, or IFN-\u03b5 in APS-1 patients, whose auto-Abs typically neutralize the 13 individual IFN-\u03b12 and IFN-\u03c9 (Bastard et al., 2020b; Meager et al., 2006) . It is nevertheless tempting to speculate that other severe, unexplained viral illnesses, such as shingles and influenza, particularly but not exclusively, in patients with autoimmune conditions or in elderly men, may be caused by auto-Abs against type I IFNs.",
