            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and then spread all around the world causing the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic [1] . In October 2020, after the first pandemic wave, the United Kingdom faced a rapid rise in positive COVID-19 cases. This prompted deep SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing, which revealed that most of the viral sequences belonged to a new single phylogenetic cluster and led to the identification of a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage, defined as B.1.1.7. By the end of 2020, this new lineage became predominant in United Kingdom and it was defined as a variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 [2, 3] . Approximately in the same period, in South Africa, Brazil, and the United States of America, new circulating lineages were described for the first time, respectively designated as B.1.351 [4] , P1 descending from B.1.1.28 lineage [5] , and B.1.427/B.1.429 [6] . These last variants were also named as VOC because their polymorphisms enhance viral transmissibility and may enable the viral escape from vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies. All the VOCs are characterized by a typical mutational pattern, in which most of these mutations are located in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), the most variable part of the coronavirus genome [7, 8] , leading to an increased affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and consequently, to enhanced infectivity [9, 10] . Indeed, these new lineages are becoming predominant not only in the countries where they emerged but also in the neighboring ones. Thus, these findings suggest that viral evolution is ongoing and aims to adapt to the host and to acquire more fitness.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 entry requires sequential cleavage of the spike glycoprotein at the S1/S2 and the S2 cleavage sites to mediate membrane fusion [11] [12] [13] . A notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a polybasic site (PRRAR) at the junction of S1 and S2 [14] , which constitutes a furin binding site for proteolytic cleavage [15] . This polybasic site is absent from the SARS-CoV-2 closest-lineage B-betacoronaviruses [16, 17] , although similar polybasic cleavage sites are found in more distantly related coronaviruses such as HKU1 (RRKRR) and OC43 (RRSR) [18, 19] . The functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike is not completely understood, but it is likely to provide the virus with its unique crossspecies transmissibility and serve as a pathogenetic element in human infection [13, 20] . In avian influenza virus, acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites in hemagglutinin is known to convert low-into high-pathogenicity viruses [21] and to facilitate infection of a wide variety of cell types [21] [22] [23] . At the same time, there is evidence that promoting a more efficient cleavage of spike enables MERS-like coronaviruses from bats to infect human cells [24] . Interestingly, insertion of a furin cleavage site at the S1-S2 junction of SARS-CoV spike enhances viral infectivity [25] . More recently, Peacock et al. [26] showed that the polybasic cleavage site endows SARS-CoV-2 with a selective advantage in lung cells and in primary airway epithelial cells, by enhancing cell entry of progeny virions.",

The physical properties of the core region contribute to the binding strength of the furin substrate to the enzyme, while the polar regions facilitate the accessibility of the core region to the furin binding pocket [28] . Here, we describe the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 strains carrying mutation involving the substitution of a glutamine (Q) with a histidine (H) residue at position 675 (Q675H), within the polar region of spike proximal to the S1/S2 furin cleavage site. We also demonstrate that Q675H mutation contributes to the formation of a hydrogen bond (H-bond) network that facilitates the accessibility of the spike core region to the furin binding pocket and improves the orientation of arginine residues to increase furin binding strength to the viral substrate. Moreover, we highlight that Q675H mutation is the result of a process of parallel evolution, and that multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOCs displaying the Q675H mutation have recently emerged. Altogether, our results suggest that Q675H spike mutation may enhance viral fitness by ensuring a more efficient spike proteolytic cleavage.",

Briefly, a 10 \u00b5L multiplex PCR was performed with two pooled primer mixtures; the cDNA was reverse transcribed with random primers and it was used as a template. After ten rounds of amplification, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 \u00b5L of stop buffer and then the two PCR products were pooled and purified. The resulting solution was treated with 2 \u00b5L of CleanPlex digestion reagent at 37 \u2022 C for 10 min to remove non-specific PCR products. After a magnetic bead purification, the PCR product was subjected to a further 25 rounds of amplification in a secondary PCR with a pair of primers to produce the metagenomic library. Subsequently, purified libraries were quantified using the Qubit DNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, libraries were adjusted to 4 nM concentration and finally equal amounts of each library were pooled. Library pool was denatured with NaOH and further diluted to 8 pM. Pooled libraries were subsequently loaded in a 300-cycle sequencing cartridge and deep sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequencing raw data were checked for quality using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ accessed on 8 April 2021) and then analyzed with the specifically designed software SOPHiA GENETICS' SARS-CoV-2 Panel (SOPHiA GENETICS, Lausanne, Switzerland).",

Newly whole genome sequences from this study were then aligned with European SARS-CoV-2 genomes strains available in GISAID from March 2020 to March 2021. Low-quality genomes and nearly identical sequences (genetic similarity > 99.99%) were excluded, obtaining a final dataset of 1487 European sequences. The same principle was then applied to obtain the four additional representative datasets of the circulating VOCs generated by using downsampled worldwide SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in GISAID from November 2020 to July 2021. In particular, the B.1.1.7 dataset includes n = 1500 genomes plus n = 278 strains carrying the Q675H mutation; the B.1.351 dataset includes n = 1100 genomes plus n = 104 strains carrying the Q675H mutation; the P.1 dataset includes n = 1400 genomes plus n = 59 carrying the Q675H mutation; the B.1.617 + A.Y.x dataset includes n = 1776 genomes plus n = 664 carrying the Q675H mutation. Whole genome sequences were aligned with MAFFT (FF-NS-2 algorithm) using default parameters [33] .

Pymol mutagenesis wizard was used to model Q675H and D614G for both wild-type (wt) and mutant systems [36] . The DynaMut [37] , webserver was used to predict the effect of genetic variants on the stability and flexibility of Q675H mutant spike protein. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to estimate the stability and dynamics features of Q675 and Q675H. For this purpose, we used Amber 18 [38] package and the ff14SB force field parameters for protein. Each complex was solvated in a periodic cubic water box using the TIP3P water model with 10 \u00c5 between the solutes and the edges of the box, then a suitable number of Na + and Cl \u2212 ions was added to neutralize the whole system and mimicked a salt solution concentration of 0.15 M. Each system was energy minimized in 14 consecutive minimization steps, each step of energy minimization was executed by steepest descent method (2500 steps) followed by conjugate gradient method (2500 steps), with decreasing positional restraints from 1000 to 0 kcal/mol A 2 on all the atoms of the systems excluding hydrogens, with a cut-off for non-bonded interactions of 8 \u00c5. The systems were then subjected to two consecutive steps of heating, each of 100,000 steps, from 0.1 to 100 K and from 100 to 310 K in an NVT ensemble with a Langevin thermostat. Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm and 2 fs time step was used. The systems were then equilibrated at 310 K in 4 consecutive steps of 2.5 ns each in the NPT ensemble with random velocities assigned at the beginning of each step. Then, production runs were carried out for 200 ns. MDs were performed using the pmemd CUDA program of the Amber18 package and a server Tesla K20 Graphical Processing Unit. RMSD values were calculated for 200 ns of production runs by CPPTRAJ. The trajectories were analyzed to compare and observe the structural deviation between wt and mutant structures. Conformational ensembles of spike chains along the trajectories of MDs were analyzed in the differential geometry study using FleXgeo [39] . Furthermore, the conformational ensembles obtained from 50 ns of the trajectory, in which the RMSD values were stable along the trajectory, were clustered by CPPTRAJ using hierarchical agglomerative algorithm with epsilon 3.0. Hydrogen bonds analysis was carried out using CPPTRAJ obtaining the hydrogen bond frequency for each residue pair during the molecular dynamics. The most representative conformation of each chain was used for the protein-protein docking protein by Cluspro webserver [40] and binding affinities studies by PRODIGY webserver [41] . In the wild-type sequences, the number of those displaying a Q675H mutation in the spike pocket for furin binding, was considerably noteworthy. Indeed, in the considered interval of time, Q675H mutants represented 40% of all the analyzed wild-type sequences, leading us to hypothesize a role of this mutation in SARS-CoV-2 adaptive evolution. Of note, the Q675H mutation, among our samples, was found in the wild-type sequences only.",

In order to accurately determine evolutionary relationships of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Q675H mutants detected in Brescia within a similar European context, a maximum likelihood (ML) tree was employed. The dataset utilized in this analysis consists of European sequences collected from the beginning of pandemic to March 2021, and belonging to different lineages. As shown in Figure 2 , 5 sequences out of 11 displaying Q675H mutation we obtained gave rise to an independent cluster in the B.1 lineage. The 6 remaining clustered in the B.1.177 lineage with other European Q675H sequences, but scattered across the phylogenetic tree. It is worth noting that Q675H sequences represented in the phylogenetic tree cluster in different clades, in accordance with their lineage of belonging. This finding leads to the hypothesis of the emergence of Q675H mutation by homoplasy, a process of parallel evolution [42] , in which different populations, in different countries, have acquired the same advantageous genome mutations, multiple times, independently and in separate evolutionary clades [43, 44] .

The same happened with B.1.617.2 lineage, which became predominant in June 2021 with 82% of sequences belonging to this lineage and it increased its prevalence until September and October 2021, when it represented the totality of the lineages retrieved in the Brescia area. Therefore, it is likely to assume that the gain of fitness of wild-type lineages prompted by Q675H spike mutation itself had to be modest compared to mutations in RBD displayed by B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 lineages, which are known to confer a higher binding affinity of spike to ACE2 and increase virus infectivity [9, 10] . To attest to its role in virus adaptive evolution, we analyzed worldwide the occurrence of Q675H mutation in SARS-CoV-2 VOCs through GISAID available data (https://www.gisaid.org/ accessed on 1 December 2021). When VOCs firstly emerged, neither of them carried this mutation. However, as shown in Figure Figure 3D ). In fact, in September and October 2021, when B.1.617.2 lineage represented almost the totality of the circulating lineages, we observed the highest fraction of sequences carrying the Q675H spike mutation. Moreover, as expected, sequences displaying the Q675H mutation were scattered across the phylogenetic tree of each VOC (Figure 4 ). These findings further suggest that Q675H mutation may arise in phylogenetically distant VOCs by a homoplasy event. ",

Biocomputational studies were performed to explore the role of Q675H mutation in the context of the furin binding pocket. The Q675H mutation is located in the spike protein adjacent to the polybasic S1/S2 furin cleavage site 682-RRAR*S-686. The stability of the spike tertiary structure was evaluated using DynaMut web server [37] . Q675H mutation showed a positive (\u2206\u2206G value is 0.665 kcal/mol) and a negative (\u2206\u2206SVibENCoM value is -0.108 kcal.mol \u22121 K \u22121 ) change in vibrational entropy energy between wild-type and mutant proteins. A \u2206\u2206G above zero and a \u2206\u2206SVibENCoM below zero represent protein stabilization and stiffening of the protein structure, respectively. To further characterize the structural stability and dynamic features of spike expressing Q675 or Q675H, we performed 200 ns molecular dynamics (MDs) simulations starting from the 6VXX (close conformation) charm-gui model (aa 1-1146) without glycans. Stabilities of the trimeric form of the Q675 and Q675H were examined using the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of C \u03b1 atoms. The RMSD plot shows that the three chains of the Q675 and Q675H have a similar deviation of about 4 \u00c5 ( Figure 5 ). Then, the conformational ensembles of spike chains along the trajectories of MDs were analyzed representing protein backbone as a 3D regular curve, and characterized by curvature and torsion values per residue. We used the differential geometry (DG)-based representation of the protein structure [39] because it is optimal for backbone protein flexibility analysis and particularly advantageous for highly flexible regions of protein, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein loop containing the furin cleavage site. The visual inspection of the curvature (\u03ba) and torsion (\u03c4) values observed on the furin cleavage site loop shows that compared to Q675 chains ( Figure 6A-C) , a lower structural variability in spanning residues ranging from 675 to 683 in the Q675H chains was observed ( Figure 6D-F) . Further analysis showed that Q675H forms a distinct H-bond network involving residues at position 676, 677, 678, and 679 that are localized near the Q675H residue ( Figure 6 ). ",

In order to evaluate the capability of our models to interact with the furin binding pocket in the correct orientation, the conformational ensembles along the trajectory were clustered. Then, the side chain of R685 in position P1, R683 in position P3 and R682 in position P4 of the furin recognition motif were evaluated on the basis of their spatial arrangement at and around P1 and P4 residues of the furin inhibitor co-crystallized in the furin binding pocket. The three arginine residues were analyzed in every chain of the trimeric spike protein, according to their optimal orientation into the enzyme pocket ( Figure 7A ). For each chain, the representative conformation of the most-populated cluster was selected to study the interaction between spike and furin proteins by the ClusPro web server for proteinprotein docking [40] . The poses complexes obtained from the docking simulations were analyzed by visual inspection and filtered evaluating orientation of the arginine side chains compared with the orientation of P1 and P4 residues of the furin inhibitor and the lowest ClusPro score. As shown in Figure 7B , three active substrate conformations for Q675H and two for Q675 were selected considering arginines within the 682-RRAR-685 cleavage site: P1-S1 substrate conformation extends only the guanidine side chain of the R685 in position P1 into the S1 pocket; P1-S1/P3-S4 substrate conformation puts also the guanidine side chains of the R683 in position P3 in the S4 pocket; and P1-S1/P4-S4 substrate conformation extends R685 in position P1 and R682 in position P4 into the S1 and S4 pocket, respectively. The P1-S1/P4-S4 substrate conformation was observed only for Q675H. The P1-S1/P3-S4 substrate conformation arranged the three arginine chains in a non-alternating way, therefore the pocket S4 can be occupied by R683 in position P3 only, instead of R682 in position P4. This is because R683 in position P3 is closer to R685 in position P1 and generates a steric hindrance for R682 in position P4. The steric effect prevents the interaction of the R682 in position P4 with the S4 pocket. In the P1-S1/P4-S4 substrate conformation, steric hindrance among the arginines does not occur because of a y-conformation, which arranges the three arginines alternately and puts the two arginines R685 and R682 at the two arms of the y conformation, thus orienting them in the same direction. This means that the two arginine residues involved in the interaction with the enzymatic site of furin are not affected by the steric hindrance operated by the third one. Consequently, they are able to better fit within the furin binding pocket. 5JXH) .

Indeed, a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants with various deletions directly affecting the polybasic cleavage itself, or the flanking sequence QTQTN, were identified in cultured cells and found to easily emerge in vitro [46] [47] [48] . These findings indicate that an efficient mechanism for deleting these regions exists and that they are not fixed in the virus. On the other hand, the deletion of the polybasic region and of the flanking region QTQTN is rare in vivo [47, 48] , strongly suggesting that the entire region may be under selective pressure in humans [46, 49] . It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 variants with deletions at the S1/S2 junction of the spike protein cause no apparent disease in hamster, despite replicating in the upper respiratory tract as the wild-type virus [48] . However, unlike wild-type virus, mutants with such deletions did not cause pathological changes in the lung and did not induce elevation of proinflammatory cytokines [48] . These observations led Wang et al. [48] to suggest that the polybasic cleavage motif is a virulence element in SARS-CoV-2 and that its removal makes the virus more similar to a common cold respiratory coronavirus.",

In particular, we found Q675H mutants detected in our laboratory belonged to B.1 and B.1.177 lineages, and in the considered interval of time, they represented 40% of all the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 analyzed sequences. Our data was in agreement with a general increase of this mutation in different lineages circulating worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis suggest that Q675H mutation occurred by a homoplasy event, leading us to assume that it could be aimed to enhance viral fitness to the human host.",

In particular, Q675H mutation forms an H-bonds network in the polar region delimiting the conformational space of the three arginines side-chain of the recognition motif and improves their proximity to the corresponding binding pockets of the furin. This implies an optimization of the directionality of the arginine residues involved in the interaction with the furin binding pocket. Interestingly, this conformational restrain forces the peptide chain to change direction and separate the cleavage site from the other structural elements, thus resulting in a better exposure of cleavage site to the protease [50] . Our models show for the first time that P1-S1/P3-S4 substrate conformation puts the guanidine side chain of the R683 in position P3 in pocket S4, suggesting the P3 arginine as an important residue for furin binding. It is worth noting that the P3 arginine is already known to be crucial for furin-dependent in vitro cleavage of a substrate construct carrying the sequence of the S1/S2 site [11] . This new substrate conformation has been taken into consideration because the canonical furin recognition motif R-X-K/R-R*X (P4P3P2P1*P1') does not contain an arginine residue in position P3, whereas in the SARS-CoV-2 spike the furin recognition motif is RRAR*S (P4P3P2P1*P1') and displays arginine in position P3, which is close to P4 position in the three-dimensional space and can compete in the occupation of pocket S4. On the other hand, the Q675H mutant is the only one to have also a P1-S1/P4-S4 conformation [51] . Importantly, this conformation of Q675H has a higher binding affinity than the Q675 ones, since it presents a y-conformation with the three arginine residues alternatively arranged. This decreases the steric hindrance between them and consequently the arginine residues involved in the interaction can fit better in the binding pocket. On the whole, our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 Q675H spike mutation could enhance its availability to the furin proteolytic cleavage. As a result, Q675H mutation is likely to better promote spike S1 unit release and its interaction with human receptor ACE2. In this study we predicted the effect of the Q675H mutation on the furin enzymatic activity. Other studies are necessary to evaluate how the Q675H influences the activity of the other proprotein convertases involved in spike activation.",

This variant carries a series of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome, among which the spike substitution Q677H [52, 53] , highlighting the crucial role of histidine in the release of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 units operated by furin.
