Here, we integrate national site-level O&G production data and previously reported site-level CH 4 measurement data (n = 240) and find that low production well sites are a disproportionately large source of US O&G well site CH 4 emissions, emitting more than 4 (95% confidence interval: 3-6) teragrams, 50% more than the total CH 4 emissions from the Permian Basin, one of the world's largest O&G producing regions. We estimate low production well sites represent roughly half (37-75%) of all O&G well site CH 4 emissions, and a production-normalized CH 4 loss rate of more than 10%-a factor of 6-12 times higher than the mean CH 4 loss rate of 1.5% for all O&G well sites in the US. Our work suggests that achieving significant reductions in O&G CH 4 emissions will require mitigation of emissions from low production well sites.",

In the United States, official estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicate nearly one-third (30%) of anthropogenic CH 4 emissions arise from oil and natural gas (O&G) operations 5 . However, a large body of measurement-based studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] have consistently found higher O&G CH 4 emissions than is estimated in EPA inventories. Alvarez et al. 16 synthesized research on US O&G CH 4 emissions in 2015 and found 13 teragrams (1 Tg = 1 million metric tons), 60% higher than the Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI) estimates for 2015 as estimated in 2017; in Reporting Year 2021, EPA lowered estimated 2015 emissions making the difference 70% 5 . Much of this discrepancy has been attributed to the O&G production sector, where measurement-based estimates are~2\u00d7 higher than the GHGI [16] [17] [18] , with recent research suggesting substantial underestimation in the GHGI attributed to fugitive emissions from well site equipment and unintentional emissions from liquids storage tanks 18 .",

Methane emissions at O&G production well sites-which may have one or multiple wellheads-arise from sources that are common throughout O&G operations (e.g., fugitive emissions from leaking valves and connections and vented emissions from storage tanks and pneumatic devices), in addition to nonroutine sources characterized by excessive, unintentional emissions. Measurement-based studies have generally found weak correlations of CH 4 emissions with site-specific parameters, including O&G production rates, water production, or site age 12, [20] [21] [22] . However, O&G production declines substantially over the first few years in the life of the well, such that the number of new, high-productivity wells represents a small percentage of the total number of operating wells, where older, low-productivity wells dominate. As a result, production characteristics of US O&G wells are highly skewed: >90% of the nation's O&G production comes from~20% of wells 19 .",

We refer to this subset of low production sites as ultralow production sites and discuss their significance in the following sections. There is regional diversity in the production characteristics of low production well sites (Fig. 1) , with the predominantly gasproducing Appalachian region (Region 1 in Fig. 1 ) being notable for its large abundance (i.e., 90%, n = 160,000) of ultralow production well sites (Fig. 1d ). Among all low production well sites, these Appalachian ultralow production sites represent 29% of US low production well sites and 5.4% of total O&G production from low production sites (Fig. 1c) .",

We assessed the production history of over 44,000 single-well low production well sites that were actively producing in 2019 and had their first reported production date in the years between 2012 and 2019. We find that, on average, the initial site-level production for single-well O&G production sites that are vertically drilled is~20 boed/site, ramping up to~25 boed/site within the first three months of production, before exponentially declining to below the low production well site productivity threshold of 15 boed within generally 1 to 2 years. For horizontally-drilled wells, we estimate an average initial production of 100 boed/site, with a ramp-up to~150 boed/site within the first three months and declining to below 15 boed within~3 to 5 years (Supplementary Note 3). This average boed decline profile for single-well sites suggests continued and rapid growth in the number of future low production well sites, tempered by the rate of growth in the number of newly completed O&G wells and the rate at which operators plug and/or abandon these wells.",

(Supplementary Fig. 21 ). At low production well sites, field observations report a common theme revolving around the issue of well site equipment negligence and disrepair 10, 22 as the primary driver of CH 4 emissions. Most proximately, recent work by Deighton et al. 22 documents several of these maintenance-related issues, including, for example, (i) leaks at fittings and joints, (ii) leaks and vents from rusted pump jacks, tanks, and other onsite gathering infrastructure, and (iii) evidence of well site neglect or poor maintenance, such as wellheads or casings covered in weeds or fallen trees. In several instances, emissions at low production well sites were reported as \"audible\", \"visible\" or with an \"oily smell\", characteristic of emissions sources likely to be effectively resolved via standard leak detection and repair (LDAR) practices, including Audio, Visual, and Olfactory (AVO) inspections.",

The average gas-to-oil ratio (GOR, Mcf/barrel) is shown on the top x-axis.

While limited in size relative to the total population of low production sites, these data are drawn from a diversity of O&G production basins and have broadly representative site-level production rates (range: 0.01-15 boed) and CH 4 distribution that support statistically robust estimation of national-scale CH 4 emissions (Methods).",

As site-level production declines over time, there is a substantial increase in the relative contribution of production-independent emission sources, resulting in higher CH 4 loss rates. Assuming the empirical distribution of CH 4 loss rates characterized among the 240 measured sites is representative of national patterns, the data suggest a small fraction of low production well sites (5% or n = 28,000) are not just highemitting (on a mass basis), but \"functionally super-emitting\" 26 with extremely high CH 4 loss rates indicative of the existence of avoidable abnormal process operating conditions (e.g., malfunctioning processing equipment).",

We spatially linked, and visually confirmed in satellite imagery, the location of their detected CH 4 plumes to 62 unique low production well site sources within the Permian Basin (Supplementary Note 7). Measured CH 4 emissions at these predominantly oil-production sites ranged from~50-800 kg CH 4 /h, with their cumulative CH 4 emissions far exceeding their reported total CH 4 production by a factor of 30\u00d7 (see discussion in Supplementary Note 7). While we estimate a very low prevalence rate (~0.05% in the Permian Basin; Supplementary Note 7) for such abnormally high CH 4 emissions among the Permian low production well sites, their existence nevertheless underscores the significant CH 4 waste potential as well as the CH 4 mitigation opportunities at low production well sites.",

For the high-emitting sites, we develop frequency and emissions distributions based on random nonparametric bootstrap resampling. For the bottom 95% of sites with detectable emissions, we develop site-level emission factors based on a nonparametric Bayesian regression model (solid-dark red line in Fig. 3b) of the site-level CH 4 emissions as functions of site-level O&G production. This approach accounts for the empirically observed relative independence of site-level CH 4 emissions with O&G production for sites producing~>2-4 boed/ site and an apparent declining trend in absolute site-level CH 4 emissions for the ultralow production sites ( Supplementary  Fig. 15 ). Finally, we develop a frequency distribution for the below-detection-limit sites and use this distribution to decrement the modeled site-level CH 4 emissions for the bottom 95% of sites (Methods).",

Even as their production declines over time, CH 4 emissions at low production well sites continue from both routine and nonroutine, but avoidable, sources. Low production well sites are abundant and their cumulative CH 4 emissions are significant: they account for about one-half (95% CI: 37-75%) of US O&G production site CH 4 emissions. The sitelevel CH 4 distribution among these sites is highly skewed, with a small fraction (5%) responsible for a large proportion (~50%) of their total emissions and, on average, CH 4 losses occur at high 16 assessment of total national CH 4 emissions from all O&G production sites (Low prodn. = low production sites). Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals (Methods). The blue bubbles represent the production-normalized CH 4 loss rates for low production well sites (this study) and for all O&G sites 16 . b Regional estimates of low production well site CH 4 emissions (see Fig. 1 ), with error bars representing the 95% confidence intervals on the mean (Methods). \"Other\" means total estimates for sites in other locations outside of regions 1-5 in Fig. 1 .

The commonly observed sources of CH 4 emissions at these sites, coupled with the stochastic character of high-emission events, suggest routine emissions monitoring and repair has the potential to yield large emission reduction benefits. Ravikumar et al. 34 report that a single LDAR survey reduced site-level emissions by 44% at O&G sites generally, concluding that effective leak mitigation will require frequent surveys utilizing low-cost, rapidly deployable leak detection technologies, such as cheap fixed sensors and fence-line truck-based monitoring. Assuming applicability to low production well sites here, a 44% LDAR effectiveness implies reductions of almost 2 Tg in CH 4 emissions after one survey, equivalent to a 24% reduction in total O&G CH 4 emissions from all US O&G well sites.",

Thus, the role of low production well sites needs to be reassessed in light of their outsized importance relative to CH 4 emissions from the O&G sector and related mitigation opportunities.

In the latter, CH 4 plume concentrations emitted from the O&G well site are taken at an appropriate downwind location using near-real-time concentration measurement instruments; emission rates are then estimated by accounting for the dynamics of plume transport from the source to the measurement point.

The average gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) for low production sites in these basins ranges from 4 Mcf/barrel to 88 Mcf/barrel, well within the national average of 20 Mcf/barrel.

            "text": "For the bottom 95% of sites with detected emissions above the detection limit, we apply a nonparametric Bayesian regression model to estimate the mean CH 4 emission rates as functions of site-level O&G production. This approach accounts for the potential bias due to oversampling of the higher end of the site-level production distribution (Supplementary Fig. 20) as well as the empirically observed emission trends that are weakly dependent on site-level production (Fig. 3b) . We apply a log-transformation to the site-level emissions data and model the distribution assuming a univariate normal likelihood with mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3. We model \u03bc as a linear model with a y-intercept \u03b1 and a spline basis \u03c9, based on a design matrix incorporating a cubic B-spline with n = 3 knots (set at 2 boed-beyond which most high-emitters are observed-and at a minimum and maximum boed of 3 10 \u00c03 and 14.97 boed, respectively). We apply relatively weak priors for \u03b1 $ N \u00f00:1; 0:5\u00de; \u03c9 $ N \u00f0\u00c01; 1\u00de and \u03c3 $ Exp\u00f01\u00de. For Bayesian inference, we draw 5000 posterior samples from the posterior distribution using the PyMC3 41 implementation of the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) 42 algorithm, resulting in \u03b1 = 0.38 (94% highest posterior density interval: \u22120.25, 1) and \u03c3 \u00bc 1:3 (94% HPD interval: 1.2, 1.5). We use these posterior results to generate predictions of the mean site-level CH 4 emissions as functions of O&G production for the bottom 95% of sites, which are shown as a solid-dark red line in Fig. 3b . Additional results and discussion for the nonparametric Bayesian modeling procedure are found in Supplementary Note 5.",

We use f high to compute the total number of sites \u00f0n 1 \u00de that are high-emitting at any one time, restricting our selection to sites with site-level O&G production >2 boed/site beyond which most high-emitters are observed (Fig. 3b) .

The remaining sites \u00f0n 2 \u00bc m \u00c0 n 1 \u00de are the bottom 95% of sites, for which we apply a mean CH 4 emission rate to each site based on the binning of the posterior predictions from the Bayesian nonparametric regression into 192 discrete production (boed) cohorts. The predictions for the mean CH 4 emission rate for each site in the bottom 95% of sites are randomly drawn 500 times from the results of the posterior distributions.

The overall results are higher but within 95% confidence intervals of our primary model estimates, which more comprehensively assesses the distribution of emissions relative to the emitter characteristics of the high-emitting sites (top 5% of sites), the bottom 95% of sites with detectable emissions and the below-detection-limit sites.",

While available site-level CH 4 emissions data are sufficient to derive statistically robust national estimates, we acknowledge the limited sample size (n = 240) likely increases uncertainty in our assessment. This uncertainty is driven by variability in measured site-level CH 4 emissions, which in turn determines the observed distribution of emissions given the sample size and distribution of site-level production rates. Variability in site-level CH 4 emissions distributions might be reasonably expected if more samples were available. Our emissions models for the top 5% of high-emitting sites, the bottom 95% of sites and the BDL sites are based on probabilistic models from which we assess the full range of likely frequency and emissions distributions conditional on the observations (Fig. 5) . As described, the mean CH 4 emission rate from each of the 565,000 low production site is estimated 500 times in an iterative emissions modeling scheme where both the inputs and outputs are probability distributions reflecting inherent uncertainty in the empirical data. We compute the 95% confidence intervals on our estimates based on the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles of the modeled probability distributions for the estimated mean total CH 4 emissions. We estimate the mean and 95% confidence intervals on the mean as 2 (1.6-3) Tg and 2 (0.8-3.3) Tg for the bottom 95% and top 5% of sites, respectively. For all low production sites, the combined CH 4 distribution has a mean and 95% confidence interval of 4 (3-6) Tg (1 s.f.) as shown in Fig. 4a (see Supplementary Fig. 23 and Supplementary Tables 5-7 for additional details).",
