On the other hand, for others, working from home [10] could afford greater flexibility in scheduling, save time from commuting, and reduce office-related stress, which could facilitate sleep health. Social jetlag (SJL) measures, which quantify the discrepancy between biological and social clocks [11] that often contribute to sleep loss, could in fact be reduced through greater flexibility in work hours. Recent survey-based studies [12, 13] appear to support improved sleep health but also point to instances where sleep quality may be adversely affected by greater sensitivity to stress [14] .",

Participants were given devices (Fitbit Ionic, Fitbit Inc, San Francisco, CA) to track their activity/sleep and installed a mobile application to complete surveys over a period of 2 years. Participants were rewarded with points convertible to vouchers if they wore the tracker daily, logged sleep, meals, and completed surveys and were allowed to keep the device conditional upon meeting study requirements. Demographic, health, and lifestyle questionnaires were administered at study commencement. A second survey conducted in February 2020 was used to update any changes to family status, while a third survey was conducted in June 2020 to probe symptoms of depression using the revised Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-R) [26] . To assess perceived sleep health during the lockdown, we extracted items from the CESD-R sleep subscale, which consisted of three questions. These questions asked about the number of days in the past 1-2 weeks an individual (1) perceived his sleep to be restless, (2) had trouble getting to sleep, and (3) slept much more than usual. The National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board approved the study protocol. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to study participation.",

Fitbit defines MVPA as activity of > 3METS (metabolic equivalents), and utilizes heart rate data to calculate active minutes for non-step-based activities such as weightlifting, yoga, and rowing [27] .

Sleep efficiency, an objective marker of sleep quality was only minimally affected during the lockdown (86.5% vs 86.7% in baseline). Furthermore, although bedtimes were delayed, wake times were delayed even more, leading to total TIB increasing on both weekdays and weekends. The proportion of individuals who received at least 7 h of sleep on weekdays increased from 45% to 64%; on weekends this increased from 68% to 73%. The greater delays in bedtime and extension of sleep on weekdays compared to weekends also led to overall decreased SJL and weekend-weekday TIB difference during the lockdown. Time savings from commuting (mean total daily commute time ~110 min) could have freed up 0 4 J a n 0 8 J a n 1 2 J a n 1 6 J a n 2 0 J a n 2 4 J a n 2 8 J a n significantly more time to sleep. Travel time was second only to work time in having a reciprocal relationship to sleep in a major time-use study [31] . The overall pattern of results seems to reflect that the changes under mobility restrictions and lockdown might have actually benefited sleep. Apart from the increase in sleep duration, SJL measures are also reduced as individuals shift their daily schedules toward their biologically preferred sleep timings. As greater SJL/circadian misalignment has been associated with higher risk of depression [32] , heart disease [33, 34] , and adverse metabolic changes (e.g. type 2 diabetes and obesity) [35] [36] [37] , these changes could in fact reflect better sleep habits during the lockdown. Although later sleep timings has also been shown to be associated with poorer health outcomes [34, 38] those observations may have been contributed by sleep curtailment from having waking up earlier than intended as a result of fixed morning work start times.",

It is also concerning that these individuals comprised 51% of the sample which should merit targeted interventions if lockdowns continue. Further inspection of sociodemographic variables in these individuals revealed that they were predominantly single. Perhaps this group of individuals-with fewer childcare responsibilities and alternative social activity at home, work even longer hours resulting in less time for PA and a profound loss of differentiation between weekends and weekdays. Attenuation in weekday/weekend PA differences seen here could also reflect social isolation [42] that has long-term consequences on mental well-being.

The overall later timings of bedtime and waketime, even for earlier sleepers and risers relative to results published elsewhere [47] , could also be indicative of Singapore's \"westerly\" position relative to its assigned time zone. Later bedtimes and shorter nocturnal sleep co-occur with chronic, longitude-related exposure to later evening light [48, 49] .

In the context of understanding COVID-19 related changes, this approach has several clear strengths and limitations. First of all, having access to wearable-based sleep and PA records for over 1,800 participants provides a particular opportunity to assess the time courses of change due to the COVID-related restrictions and lockdown. This complements existing survey studies [9, [12] [13] [14] 30] with objectively measured data and can aid to further generalize findings. A clear advantage is that the data was collected over the full period spanning from a pre-pandemic baseline, to increasing mobility restrictions, to lockdown, which allowed for clear comparisons across these distinct time periods. Moreover, data for an equivalent period in 2019 were available, providing an additional reference against which the 2020 pandemic situation could be contrasted against. Importantly, the data reported were collected from the same participants whose data was available over the 2 years. This is an important distinction from \"trend data\" gathered from public convenience-sample sites like Google Trends, or reports from wearable manufacturers, which do not provide such direct within-individual comparison. As Singapore lies next to the equator, our sleep timing data is not confounded by seasonal variations [41] . Another advantage of the wearable-based methodology was that activity profiles could be tracked with a high level of granularity. This allowed us to examine sleep/activity profiles in much finer detail than just the daily averages, and to identify significant heterogeneity in RAR profiles and their changes due to lockdown.",

We have also previously shown the overall fidelity of multiday sleep tracking in parallel with PSG [54] . The Fitbit is not configured to capture short daytime naps, which could increase in frequency when individuals work from home.

However, heterogenous changes between groups of individuals could be observed upon inspection of RAR profiles pre-and during the lockdown. Widescale adoption of the methods described here may help identify persons or groups at-risk should the pandemic be protracted.",
