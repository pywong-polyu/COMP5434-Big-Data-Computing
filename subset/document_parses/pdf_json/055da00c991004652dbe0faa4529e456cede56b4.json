            "text": "Recent interest in variable ventilation stems from the need to reduce cyclic alveolar reopening during mechanical ventilation, especially in injured lungs, to avoid development or propagation of lung inflammation, atelectasis and subsequent hypoxemia [19] . Whereas some studies demonstrated the beneficial effect of introducing variability into lung recruitment [20, 21] , and others reported improvement in global respiratory mechanical and functional parameters [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , there is still a lack of detailed knowledge about the pathophysiological background related to the functional and regional behavior of the lung during variable ventilation. Moreover, the potential of PVV in the context of pediatric ARDS has not been characterized. To investigate the effect of PVV, lung functional and structural changes were compared to those obtained with conventional monotonous ventilation in normal lungs and ARDS, in a pediatric model. Global respiratory parameters were measured to characterize the overall lung condition. Regional lung aeration, pulmonary perfusion and inflammation were assessed by functional imaging using positron-emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) combined with X-ray computed tomography (CT).",

Under baseline (BL) conditions, pressure-controlled ventilation was applied, using a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6 cmH 2 O, a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) of 0.4, a VT of 8 ml/kg and a respiratory rate to achieve normocapnia (end-tidal CO 2 of 5.5-6%). Arterial and central venous blood gas analyses and respiratory mechanical measurements were performed at BL. Subsequently, animals were randomized for the absence (CTRL) or presence (ARDS) of lung injury. Mild ARDS, according to the Berlin definition [23] , was induced by combination of intravenous lipopolysaccharide (20 \u00b5g/ kg) and injurious ventilation (VT = 40 ml/kg, 0 cmH 2 O PEEP, FiO 2 = 1.0) with a target range of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 )/FiO 2 ratio of 250-300 mmHg. When the target range of PaO 2 /FiO 2 was reached, animals were further randomized for the ventilation mode: five-hour mechanical ventilation (VT = 8 ml/ kg, PEEP = 6 cmH 2 O) was applied using either pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) or PVV. FiO 2 was adjusted according to PaO 2 /FiO 2 : using FiO 2 = 0.4 above 250 mmHg; FiO 2 = 0.6 between 200-250 mmHg; FiO 2 = 0.8 between 100-200 mmHg, and FiO 2 = 0.9 in the case that PaO 2 decreased below 100 mmHg. Arterial blood gas and respiratory mechanics were measured hourly (T1-T5). After 5 h (T5), in vivo lung imaging was performed under continuous application of the ventilation mode. Subsequently, animals were euthanized with iv sodium thiopental (100 mg/kg). Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed ex vivo in the right lung, and the left lung was extracted for histological analysis.",

Studies using models of mild-to-moderate lung injury have found similar beneficial effects on respiratory mechanics for variable ventilation [15, 31] , and this protective effect was not observed in the presence of more severe ARDS [14] . Global and regional lung metabolic activity were measured by 18 F-FDG uptake, a reliable biomarker of inflammation in the lung [32] . This marker is indicative of neutrophil activation in acute lung injury and ARDS [33] [34] [35] . Previous studies have shown that voxelwise ratio of lung parenchyma and air content influences 18 F-FDG Fig. 5 Left panels depict pulmonary inflammation characterized by PET imaging normalized to the tissue fraction. Right panels show pulmonary circulation characterized by SPECT imaging, normalized to tissue fraction. Upper panels represent mean PET and SPECT intensities averaged for the entire lung. Middle panels demonstrate the regional distribution based on aeration zones. Bottom panels represent the regional distribution based on the dependent (dorsal) and non-dependent (ventral) zones. SUV: standardized uptake value; PCV: pressure-controlled ventilation; PVV: physiological variable ventilation; ARDS: presence of lung injury; CTRL: absence of lung injury. *p < 0.05 vs. well-aerated or vs. dorsal, \u2020 p < 0.05 vs. PCV uptake quantification, requiring normalization for the tissue fraction [26, 36] , which was performed in the current study. After 5 h of ventilation, we observed significantly lower indices of global and regional lung inflammation in the animals ventilated with PVV. Specifically, a significantly higher inflammatory activity characterized the well aerated and non-dependent lung zones, both in control and injured groups. This finding is consistent with results from previous experiments studying injured lungs, in which lung inflammation assessed by 18 F-FDG uptake was correlated with regional strain [37, 38] . The significantly lower inflammation associated with PVV may be explained by the fact that the variability of the delivered VT contributes to tidal recruitment [12, 15] , therefore reducing strain in the open, aerated zones. It is worth noting that PVV exerts the most beneficial effect in the well and poorly aerated zones under both control and ARDS conditions (Fig. 5) . Conversely, the collapsed non-aerated zones were obviously unaffected by ventilation modes since these units were not subjected to strain. These findings further confirm the importance of focusing on regional ventilation when assessing the benefit of ventilation strategies. SPECT imaging confirms differences in regional distribution of lung perfusion when it is related to aeration zones. However, the lower blood perfusion in the ventral lung regions as compared to the dorsal zones can be attributed to the gravity effect and/or to the blood shift to the dorsal zones as a consequence of positive pressure and lung overdistension.",

The lack of improvement in oxygenation may be related in part to the more severe hypoxemia in this group, which required a higher FiO 2 (65% vs 55% in groups PVV-ARDS and PCV-ARDS, respectively). Moreover, the increase in lactate levels suggest the development of metabolic acidosis in both groups of ARDS animals, which may be the consequence of inadequate tissue oxygen delivery. Moreover, the timespan of the experiment (5 h) may be too short to detect effects on gas exchange. We may hypothesize that the more prominent inflammation observed in the PCV groups would build up and potentially cause gas exchange problems over the course of days.",

In agreement with previous studies, lung injury score did not differ between the ventilation modes [14, 39] . The discrepancy between the functional and structural findings may be explained by the faster onset of functional changes, compared to the relatively longer time needed for morphological changes to become apparent. Lung inflammation quantified using BALF cell counts and pro-inflammatory cytokines, unlike in vivo imaging, did not reveal differences between the ventilation modes. In vivo imaging gives a more comprehensive measure of pulmonary inflammation at the early phase of ARDS, as it demonstrates the alveolar as well as the interstitial compartments of the lung. Additionally, 18 F-FDG uptake reflects the acute metabolic activation of neutrophils and captures lung inflammation without barrier disruption, opposite to BALF neutrophils and cytokines, providing a more rapid assessment of inflammatory processes. In this context, it is worth noting that the control groups also showed increased inflammation and lung injury indices (BALF cytokines and histological injury score). These findings suggest that, despite the use of protective ventilation in the control groups, prolonged mechanical ventilation triggered the development of lung inflammation. This could potentially explain the lack of significant difference in normalized 18 F-FDG uptake between control and ARDS lungs.",

Injurious ventilation using high VT combined with no PEEP contributes to development of volume-and barotrauma due to the supraphysiologic tidal volumes and respiratory pressures, whereas the absence of PEEP promotes tidal closures and exerts shear stress on the lung tissues [47] . The use of an FiO 2 of 1.0 during this injurious ventilation period facilitates lung volume loss and development of ventilation heterogeneities [48] .
