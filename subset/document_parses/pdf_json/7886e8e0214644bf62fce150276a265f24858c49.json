The main research content of GDM is making effective decisions when multiple decision-makers (DMs) make decisions simultaneously. The ultimate goal of GDM is to hope that eventually a consensus will be reached among the participants that reflects expert's opinion on the subject. However, there is often a difference of opinions in determining unified opinion, which is caused by DMs thinking about issues from different positions. In general, disagreements are resolved by discussion or consultation with other DMs. In addition, most decisions involve elements of risk and uncertainty.

One major topic that has dominated the field for many years concerns cost consensus models. Consensus modeling of adjustment cost and adjustment deviations is valued in particular (see Dong et al. (2010) ; Ben-Arieh and Easton (2007); Ben-Arieh et al. (2009); Zhang et al. (2011) ). Most studies on the cost of reaching a consensus have been mainly focused on unit cost without direction constraint. Such approaches, nevertheless, have failed to address modeling of cost consensus with asymmetric cost. As a result, the cost consensus models proposed by Cheng et al Cheng et al. (2018) then take into account not only adjustment direction but also limited compromises and tolerant behaviors. Further, Zhang et al systematically summarized the origin of feedback mechanism with minimum adjustment or cost. More than that, a number of studies of consensus in deterministic environment in recent years have been invested (see ; Labella et al. (2020) ; Wu et al. (2020) ).",

            "text": "The knowledge reserves, historical data collection, and research environment for experts and moderator who take part in decision-making are always diverse. This illustrates that it is very necessary to provide theoretical support for solving uncertainty. To deal with the uncertainty, different methods and theories have been put forward for processing the consensus over the past few years. Related research on consensus issue is mainly divided into five categories, including interval analysis (see Li et al. (2017) ; Gong et al. (2018) ), fuzzy sets (see Xu and Wu (2013) ; ), probability theory (see Xie et al. (2018) ; Tan et al. (2018) ; Wang et al. (2021) ), uncertainty theory (see Gong et al. (2020 Gong et al. ( , 2018 ), and robust optimization method (see Lu et al. (2020) ; Han et al. (2019) ; Qu et al. (2020) ). In particular, researchers may have trouble obtaining a precise probability for a specific decision problem. To handle these complex decision steps, uncertainty theory Liu (2007 Liu ( , 2009 which is proposed by Liu is a common treatment. Except for the above ways for solving the uncertainty, the two-stage stochastic programming is also essential technology. The importance of the rationality of establishing two-stage stochastic programming is emphasized by Shapiro et al. (2014) ; Birge and Louveaux (2011) . In order to cope with the uncertainty in the GDM, stochastic programming theory is introduced into the MCCMs of asymmetric adjustment . The stochastic programming modeling method is different from the previous methods to deal with the uncertain consensus problem. This method applies two-stage stochastic programming for modeling on the premise of knowing the probabilities of the scenarios, which can be used to deal with different scenarios. This paper will also draw on this method to deal with multiple scenarios in stochastic events. However, to reach a decision on specific research problems, this modeling method cannot meet practical needs. In addition to dealing with the uncertain factors in the decision-making problem, how to effectively prevent the risk caused by the uncertain factors in the process of group decision-making on the total consensus cost is also great important for the DMs. However, recent literature fails to take into account the risks involved in the consensus-building process.",

Thus, with the exception of stochastic programming, potential risks posed by uncertain parameters should also be paid attention to. The past ten years have seen increasingly rapid advances in the field of risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming Noya (2012) ; Tajeddini et al. (2014) ; M\u00ednguez et al. (2021) . However, there is no relevant research on the risk of compensation cost loss caused by uncertainty in the process of consensus building in the existing optimization modeling of uncertain decision-making problems. In order to make up for the lack of loss risk in the consensus decision-making process, it is necessary to give a stochastic programming models of risk averse to dealing with such problems. Through this way of modeling, we can effectively reduce the risk brought by the uncertainty of DMs in decision-making.",

Novel coronavirus pneumonia has been known to impact on the income and cash flow turnover of some small and micro business, and has a short-term influence on the banking business. The weakening of business ability, cash flow and repayment ability may lead to the shortage of capital flow. At the same time, affected by the epidemic situation, banks are required to adjust the loan provision accordingly, which leads to the increase of bank loan interest rate. Therefore, online financial business has attracted a lot of approval, and online lending platform has become the focus of enterprises. Not only that, since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, regulators stressed the strengthening of online business services, to guiding enterprises through the Internet, mobile phone APPs and other online means to handle lending business. Peer-to-peer lending (P2P) Zhang et al. (2019) , often referred to as \"private lending\", is a very promising alternative to bank lending for many small companies. P2P platform directly connects investors and borrowers through the Internet Guo et al. (2016) . In the mature market economy, P2P platform plays the role of financial services, ensures the normal transaction, and plays the role of supervision and coordination in the whole transaction. P2P lending platform is established on the basis of the social circle, which allows entrepreneurs or enterprises with certain qualifications to provide potential individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises with the required amount of borrowing and charge interest. From the perspective of borrowers, they apply for loans from the platform and provide the corresponding expected interest rate. In Niu et al. (2020) , Niu et al gave a performance of lenders in the market in terms of credit risk management and portfolio building. However, the interest rate offered by the borrower may not be a definite value. Therefore, a perfect risk aversion model is needed to deal with P2P platform transactions under uncertain environment. Based on this background, three two-stage stochastic MCCMs with risk aversion from the perspective of the borrowers have been developed to deal with the uncertain consensus optimization problem and the risk brought by uncertainty, and demonstrated to be very helpful in addressing complex decision-making tasks.",

By dividing the uncertain parameters into several situations, we propose a risk aversion optimization method-a two-stage mean-risk consensus system model, which can generate robust optimization solutions.

In this study, the concepts of the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the value of the stochastic solution (VSS) are redefined. The CVaR measure is used to evaluate the complete information value and random solution value of the proposed models. This shows that the proposed models are of great significance.

However, these two points are also essential for this consensus application. This paper describes this issue from the perspective of borrowers. Similarly, the borrower is regarded as the expert who gives the expected interest rate, while the P2P platform is regarded as the moderator. His existence is to offer certain compensation for the experts to adjust the interest rate, so as to ensure the consensus. Although the interest rates given by several borrowers may not be the same, in order to obtain loans, and under the compensation of the platform, they can achieve a consensus, that is, to give a mutually satisfactory interest rate.",

Other parameters and probability settings are same as in the previous example. Based on Model (11), we modeled this example as a -MRMCCM-DC, which is denoted as: This model is addressed numerically with Algorithm 1 and CPLEX solver. Four borrowers reached uniform interest rate o \ufffd = 17.6 % and the compensation paid by the platform is 346.12 RMB. The experimental results between Algorithm 1 and solver are compared, as showed in Table 5 . Since the calculation time required by the Algorithm 1 is significantly lower than required by the optimization solver CPLEX, then the results indicate that the algorithm can solve this problem faster. We contrasted these results with the results from the last example, it could be found that results for the Example 5.1 and Example 5.2 are identical. The most likely causes of this phenomenon are that the borrowers are well-tolerated for their adjustment of opinions. Therefore, attempts are made to reduce the tolerance range of each borrower. Subsequently, the second group of data is given below, which the corresponding limited compromise take as i = (10, 6, 8, 16)(%) . Table 5 presents the experimental results. The results in Table 3 are the optimal values under the three scenarios, which were calculated separately. Here, calculations are carried out for the three sets of data. The mean total consensus cost is 321.86 RMB, which means the total consensus cost that experts expect to pay. The results of MREVP 2 and MRVSS 2 are shown in Table 6 , which indicated the significance of model building. Because it considered the value of information from the perspective of the borrowers and the platform. After calculation, the optimal solution of the above problem is o \ufffd = 13.59% , and the optimal value is = 182 RMB. Similar to the previous two problems, the Algorithm 1 for solving this problem is compared with the solver, the results in Table 5 showed that the given method is faster and effective. Taking each scenario as a deterministic problem to solve, the optimal solution under three random scenarios can be obtained, and the results are presented in Table 4 . Two important values ( MREVP 3 and MRVSS 3 ) are provided in Table 6 , which can be obtained to evaluate whether the TB-MCCM-DC is meaningful or not. Through these results, it can be found that it is of constructive significance to use the established model to solve this problem.",

On the other hand, for a fixed value , we can observe that a larger value leads to higher cost value. Figure 3 shows that the total consensus cost increases when the established risk parameter moves up from 0.1 to 0.9. It proves that increasing leads to more risk aversion. This means that the risk measure defined by CVaR has an important impact on the minimum cost consensus.

This is a common situation, because when the risk of uncertainty parameters is taken into account in the consensus optimization model of stochastic programming, the total cost must be increased. The two-stage mean-risk stochastic minimum cost consensus models take CVaR into account, which is more comprehensive than the stochastic consensus programming without risk function, so the result is a little worse.

Reducing the risks of decisionmaking and reducing the mistakes of decision-making are the issues that people pay attention to and discuss. DMs usually design a large number of subjective factors such as personal feelings and value judgment, which makes their decisions often subjective. However, most experts have a tendency to avoid risks and give a relatively conserved decision. In order to avoid risk, the consensus models of robustness are also proposed in Qu et al. (2020) to help DMs make decisions. Therefore, we will compare our proposed risk-averse two-stage stochastic MCCMs with robust MCCMs.",

(ii) The total consensus cost of solving the MCCMs of risk aversion is 47.38, 47.38/47.48 and 19.76 respectively.

(iii) The results show that robust models are too optimistic compared with the proposed models. This is mainly because the proposed models not only consider a variety of uncertain scenarios, but also include risk factors, which improve the anti-risk ability of the models. Although the result of total consensus cost is too large, it considers the influence of risk factors. If the result is too optimistic, it will usually cause the DMs to spend more cost to resist the risk in the process of implementation. Despite the fact that the cost of risk aversion models increases, it can help DMs effectively reduce the risk in the process of decision-making.",
