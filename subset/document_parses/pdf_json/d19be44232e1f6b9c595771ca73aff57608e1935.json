This requires amplification of truly minute quantities of mRNA, resulting in a phenomenon called \"dropout\" in which an expressed transcript is not detected and hence assigned a zero expression value. As a result, we define two types of zeros in the observed matrix: biological zeros (genes that were not expressed at the time of sequencing) and technical zeros (genes that were expressed at the time of sequencing but not measured). We note that our definition of \"technical zeros\" includes \"sampling zeros,\" which are the result of undersampling the transcripts in each cell 1, 2 . Roughly 15-40% of genes in bulk RNAseq of different tissues are not expressed 3 , suggesting that at least that percentage of genes are not expressed in individual cells and are thus biological zeros. However, due to technical zeros and cell-to-cell heterogeneity, the fraction of zeros in a typical scRNA-seq expression matrix is much higher, even exceeding 90% with recently developed droplet-based techniques.",

We illustrate this point below using a dataset from 4 , whereby detecting which matrix entries are true biological zeros, has crucial importance for a biological understanding of the particular system of interest.

            "text": "To address these challenges, we present Adaptively thresholded Low-Rank Approximation (ALRA), a method for imputation of scRNA-seq data. ALRA takes advantage of the non-negativity and low-rank structure of an expression matrix to selectively impute technical zeros (Fig. 1 ). Due to widespread correlations between genes across different cells, we assume that the true expression matrix is non-negative, low-rank, and contains many zeros (biological zeros). The matrix measured in a scRNA-seq experiment is a corrupted version of this expression matrix where many technical zeros are introduced by measurement error or insufficient total read counts. The first step of ALRA is to compute a low-rank approximation of the observed matrix using the singular vector decomposition (SVD). The rank k of the approximation is automatically determined by a simple procedure described in the Online Methods. The matrix resulting from this low-rank approximation, in general, has no zeros. Hence, the last step of ALRA is to restore the biological zeros in the matrix by thresholding its entries. As we prove mathematically in the supplement, under certain assumptions, the entries of this matrix that correspond to the true biological zeros are symmetrically distributed around zero. Due to this symmetry, the negative values provide an estimate for the error distribution of the elements corresponding to true biological zeros. As such, we set to zero all the entries of each row (or gene) that are smaller than the magnitude of the most negative value (see Methods for details). This ensures that with high probability all of the entries which correspond to biological zeros are set to zero. Our analysis may be of independent interest to other low-rank matrix completion or denoising problems.",

            "text": "Results and discussion ALRA preserves biological zeros. Using a variety of datasets where ground truth is known, we empirically illustrate ALRA's ability to preserve biological zeros. We first considered scRNAseq of purified populations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) generated by Zheng et al. (2017) 9 . We merged the purified populations into a single matrix and ran ALRA, DCA, MAGIC, SAVER, and scImpute on the merged matrix. We then focused our attention on B cells, natural killer cells, cytotoxic T cells, and helper T cells. These four cell types are well characterized and there are known marker genes specific to each. For example, PAX5 (BSAP), NCAM1 (CD56), CD8A, and CD4 are marker genes for peripheral B cells, NK cells, cytotoxic T cells, and helper T cells, respectively [10] [11] [12] . The expression values of a marker gene in a population that is known to not express that marker gene (e.g., NCAM1 in B cells) are biological zeros. Note that there may be further biological zeros in the marker genes due to cell-to-cell heterogeneity (e.g., some CD8+ T cells may not Fig. 1 Overview of the ALRA imputation scheme. A Measured expression matrix contains technical zeros (in each block) and biological zeros (outside each block). B Low-rank approximation via SVD results in a matrix where every zero is completed with a non-zero value (i.e., biological zeros are not preserved). C The elements corresponding to biological zeros for each gene are symmetrically distributed around 0, so the magnitude of the most negative elements in each row is also approximately the magnitude of the most positive values assigned to biological zeros. Therefore, thresholding the values in each row, restores almost all of the biological zeros in the imputed matrix (D).",

            "text": "The importance of preserving biological zeros. A cell type or cellular process is often characterized by both positive marker genes (genes expressed by the cells) and negative marker genes (genes not expressed by the cells). Imputation methods that do not preserve biological zeros result in a matrix where every gene is expressed by every cell, requiring the practitioner to manually threshold the expression values to determine which cells express or do not express the markers. This thresholding can be arbitrary and lead to erroneous results. In contrast, ALRA does not require this thresholding step, as cells not expressing the gene will not be falsely imputed to non-zero values. We demonstrate the importance of preserving biological zeros using three real-life examples. Gupta et al. 4 recently found that Wnt signalling is necessary for hair follicle dermal condensate (DC) differentiation, an essential step for hair follicle development. This was established in mouse embryonic skin by conditionally knocking out beta-catenin, the key transducer of the Wnt pathway, and comparing the expression of DC marker genes with control using scRNA-seq. We imputed these expression values using ALRA and compared the ratio of cells expressing Sox2 (a marker for differentiated DC cells) and the ratio of cells expressing Axin2/Lef1 (markers for Wnt signaling) between the knockout and control to show that only dermal cells that retained Wnt activity were able to acquire DC cell fate. ALRA's ability to preserve the biological zeros allows us to quantitatively compare the number of cells expressing the marker genes (Supplementary Table 1 ). The ratio of the proportions of cells expressing Sox2 and Axin2/Lef1 between the knockout and control is similar to the ratio computed from the pre-imputed data. In particular, ALRA preserves the conclusion that Wnt signalling was conditionally knocked out in a proportion of cells within the mutants, and that there was a corresponding impairment in DC differentiation caused by the absence of Wnt signalling. In contrast, MAGIC and DCA both output a matrix with no zeros, and hence, this proportion cannot be evaluated (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, based on their density plots and t-SNEs, it is not clear how to threshold the imputed values to restore the zeros (Supplementary Figure 3 ). SAVER's results falsely suggest that the Wnt activity in the knockout and control is identical, whereas scImpute falsely suggests that DC differentiation is similar between knockout and control (Supplementary Table 1 ). In settings where lack of expression of a marker gene is used to characterize a population or has other biological importance, existing methods that do not preserve biological zeros are unsuitable.",

This is not possible using the raw data, as very few (if any) cells would express all the positive markers. But existing imputation methods that do not preserve biological zeros would require an arbitrary thresholding step to determine if a cell is \"positive\" or \"negative\" for the given gene.

These authors sought to identify cells that expressed three SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins, ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN. Their analysis was hampered by dropout, as only three cells were triple-positive. Using ALRA, we can identify 1309 of these triple-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). When imputing with methods that do not preserve biological zeros, cells that are not actually triple-positive are imputed to express all three genes, hence requiring a thresholding step to set these incorrect values to zero.

Having shown that ALRA successfully preserves biological zeros and improves the separation of cell types, we further validated ALRA performance with several additional analyses. First, we used the CITE-seq cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) dataset of Stoeckius et al. to show that after imputation, the RNA measurements of each gene are more consistent with the corresponding protein measurements (measured as antibody-derived tag (ADT)). We computed the k nearest neighbors of each cell (for k = 50, 100, 1000) in the ADT space and also in the RNA space before and after imputation. ALRA nearly doubled the number of nearest neighbors that are consistent between the RNA and protein measurements (Supplementary Table 3 ). We also computed the pairwise distances between cells on the gene expression and on the protein expression data. We plotted the normalized distances between cells in gene expression data before and after imputation against the distances between cells in the protein expression data to show that ALRA improved their Spearman's correlation (Supplementary We computed the correlation of each gene/cell in the original dataset with the same gene/cell in the downsampled dataset before and after imputation by ALRA. We found that despite improving the clustering (see above), ALRA does not increase this correlation ( Supplementary Fig. 15B ). We attribute this to the presence of strong noise in the raw data which is not present after denoising using ALRA. To check if ALRA is preserving the signal, we computed the top k PCs (where k was chosen using the jackstraw method, see methods) of the original dataset with the top k PCs of the downsampled dataset before and after imputation. We found that ALRA decreases the subspace angle between these signal PCs, from 0. Fig. 15B) is not a useful metric as it has a strong dependence on the noise of the original data. We next focused on ALRA's ability to preserve subtle differences in expression values. A recent study uncovered the existence of two major lineages of fibroblasts in the intestine characterized by differential Pdgfra gene expression levels: Pdgfra High and Pdgfra Low fibroblasts 28 . We tested whether ALRA would preserve this expression pattern by performing an independent scRNA-seq experiment and sequencing fewer cells, thus generating a scarcer dataset to be completed by ALRA and other methods. We isolated mesenchymal/lamina propria cells from the colon of Pdgfra EGFP/+ knock-in mice and used flow cytometry to confirm the presence of two major populations with non-zero Pdgfra-EGFP expression: Pdgfra Low cells and Pdgfra High cells (Supplementary Fig. 16 ). After imputation by ALRA, a Pdgfra expression pattern very similar to that observed by flow cytometry can be clearly seen. In contrast, other methods do not show two distinct levels of Pdgfra expression ( Supplementary Fig. 17) .",

The resulting matrices ranged from 1000 to 50,000 cells, each with 19,155 genes, and all methods were restricted to using only a single core. ALRA and MAGIC are significantly faster than the other methods, taking~40 min on 50,000 cells.

Finally, we rescale the resulting values such that the mean and standard deviation of the non-zero values of each gene in the resulting matrix match those of the normalized matrix (prior to low-rank approximation).

For improved consistency with the observed matrix, we restore these entries to their original normalized values. We note that this process not only imputes technical zeros, but also denoises the originally non-zero values. An intuitive measure of how much the non-zero values were adjusted is the Pearson's correlation between these values before and after ALRA (e.g., for the purified PBMCs and Hrvatin et al. datasets, the correlations were 0.56 and 0.23, respectively).",

            "text": "Motivated by this work, here we also propose a similar approach. Noise typically manifests as a long tail of singular values whose singular vectors point to random directions in space with no scientific significance. The goal is to choose k such that the singular values \u03c3 1 , . . . , \u03c3 k correspond to biological variability of interest or signal, whereas the remaining values are noise. We assume an upper bound k < 100, and thus first use rsvd to compute the top 100 singular values. For this computation to be fast, we apply rsvd with the default setting of only q = 2 additional power iterations. Next, we compute the spacings between consecutive singular values, denoted as s i = \u03c3 i \u2212 \u03c3 i\u22121 for i = 2, . . . , 100. As can be seen in the plots of s i for two different datasets (Fig. 5) , for large values of i, the gap between consecutive eigenvalues becomes very small, whereas the first few gaps are significantly larger. This is consistent with studies in random matrix theory considering spiked matrices containing signal+noise. Our aim is thus to choose the largest k for which s k is significantly different from typical spacings between noise eigenvalues. To this end, we compute the mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3 of the \"noise\" spacings s 80 , . . . , s 100 . Next, our estimated value for the rank k is the largest index for which the gap s k > \u03bc + 6\u03c3. A detailed theoretical justification for this procedure is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Yet, empirically, this method appears to be quite effective. Finally and importantly, we note that ALRA is not sensitive to the specific choice of a rank k: the number of biological zeros preserved does not significantly change with k (Supplementary Table 4) . Similarly, ALRA's improved separation of cell types is also robust to the exact value of the rank (Supplementary Fig. 13 ).",

            "text": "At first sight, imputing an scRNA-seq data matrix containing many zeros and assumed to be of low rank, may look like a particular instance of a low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) problem. This may seem a promising venue as over the past 10 years, a rich theory and several methods have been developed to complete missing values in low-rank matrices (e.g., refs. [43] [44] [45] . However, as we now explain, imputing scRNA-seq data are a different problem. Specifically, in the low-rank matrix completion literature, the assumption is that the set of indices of the observed entries are perfectly known, and have been sampled either uniformly at random, or as in ref. 46 , with probability proportional to the leverage scores of the matrix. Under this sampling model, and some additional delocalization and incoherence assumptions, LRMC methods can exactly recover the true low-rank matrix with high probability. In scRNA-seq, in contrast, the precise indices where the values of the matrix were sampled are not perfectly known, since some of the observed zeros are true zeros of the underlying data matrix. Namely, the missing entries are some unknown subset of the observed zeros. Direct application of an LRMC method to scRNA-seq data (e.g., as in refs. 47, 48 ) while treating all the zeros as missing implies a highly biased sampling, which consequently may lead to incorrect imputation of the matrix. Moreover, the theoretical guarantees found in the LRMC literature do not apply to this biased sampling scheme.",

In the supplement, we present the rigorous theoretical foundation for this empirical observation, relying on a perturbation analysis together with results from random matrix theory. Specifically, we prove that under certain assumptions, the distribution of these entries is indeed Gaussian with mean zero. Therefore, for each gene, any element larger in magnitude than the p = 0.001 quantile is unlikely to be a biological zero. Conversely, values smaller in magnitude than this threshold may be biological zeros, so we set them to zero. The result is a completed matrix where the biological zeros are preserved, with high probability, and where every imputed value is unlikely to be a biological zero. We note that ALRA is not as sensitive to the magnitude of p (Supplementary Fig. 14) .",

In our context, in scRNA-seq experiments involving several types of cells, we expect the top eigenvectors to capture the differences between different cell types, and thus leading to large singular values, relative to the noise. In contrast, in scRNA-seq data containing only a single type of cell, the often smaller cell-to-cell heterogeneity between cells of the same type may lead to weak signals that due to a large number of technical zeros, cannot be discovered by SVD.

As in Huang et al., we further evaluated our approach by comparing ALRA's completion of Drop-seq data to RNA florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the same population of cells. In Torre et al. (2018), 8498 cells from a melanoma cell line were sequenced by Drop-seq 27 . RNA FISH was also used to measure the expression of 26 markers in cells of the same cell line. Although the gene expression profiles of individual cells cannot be compared across these two datasets, the distribution of gene expression should be consistent, because the cells were sampled from the same cell line. Huang et al. (2018) applied SAVER to the Drop-seq data and demonstrated that, as compared to the raw data, the estimated distribution of expression values is more consistent with the FISH distributions 7 . Their analysis computes the Gini coefficient of each gene, a measure of gene expression variability, which should be consistent across the Drop-seq and FISH technologies. Specifically, they showed that the Gini coefficients of a subset of marker genes in the FISH dataset were more consistent (correlation 0.6) with the SAVER estimates than either the raw Drop-seq data (correlation 0.3) or other completion methods (Supplementary Fig. 12). Our approach outperforms all other methods on this metric, obtaining a correlation of 0.8. Next, we further evaluated ALRA using the downsampled datasets from before (Baron et al., Chen et al., La Manno et al., and Zeisel et al.).",
