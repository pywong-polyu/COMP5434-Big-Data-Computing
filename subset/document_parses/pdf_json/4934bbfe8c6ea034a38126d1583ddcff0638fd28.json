The implementation of NobBS requires the specification of 1) a sliding window for the timevarying reporting delay, 2) a maximum delay allowed for the window, and 3) a prior distribution on the expected mean as a function of the \"true\" epidemiological signal (here, the number of new cases with onset of symptoms) and the probability of delay . We used a moving window that represented 75% of the total period of analysis and a uniform prior distribution for the parameters and .

The precision of Rt increased over time when more information became available, as seen in the third row of Figure 1 for both regions. Estimates using nowcasted curves show an earlier reduction of Rt than those obtained from raw case counts by DOR (Supplementary material, Figure S5 ) which mirrors the difference between the nowcasted curve, and the observed curve of case counts by report date. Though the WT and C approaches had similar trajectories, WT reached lower values earlier, with a delay between them approximating the generation interval (5 +/-1.9 days), the rationale being described previously [17] . This led to a consistent 4-6 days difference in the median estimated time for R t becoming <1, which can be seen in Figure 1 lower row for both regions. The validity of Rt estimates, especially using the WT method, appeared to decrease towards the latest dates.",

First, its validity relies on the assumption that the date of symptoms onset is missing at random and that the available historical data were sufficient to parameterize the unknown reporting delay. However, our sensitivity analyses indicate that the overall trajectory of the epidemic curve was relatively robust to small departures from these assumptions. Second, our approach underperforms well when little information is available for training the nowcasting algorithm, including good estimates of the reporting delay distribution. Our estimates were sensitive to the choice of imputation and nowcasting procedures when the date of symptoms onset was unknown for a high percentage of confirmed cases. Third, our approach requires that underdetection/underreporting of cases does not change significantly over time; otherwise would adversely affect the estimates [23] . Finally, our estimates could be improved by reconstructing the epidemic curve by the date of infection rather than that of symptoms onset, though this would require more complex methods given that the temporal delay from infection to symptom onset is much harder to characterize [17, [24] [25] [26] [27] .",
