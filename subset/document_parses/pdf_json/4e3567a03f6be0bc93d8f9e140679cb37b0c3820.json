            "text": "We examine patterns of reported crime in Santa Monica, California before and after the passage of Proposition 47, a 2014 initiative that reclassified some non-violent felonies as misdemeanors. We also investigate impacts of the opening of four new light rail stations in 2016 and of increased community-based policing starting in late 2018. Our statistical analyses of reclassified crimes-larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property-and non-reclassified ones are based on publicly available reported crime data from 2006 to 2019. These analyses examine reported crime at various levels: citywide, within eight neighborhoods, and within a 450-meter radius of the new transit stations. Monthly reported reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. Reported non-reclassified crimes fell overall by approximately 9%. Areas surrounding two new train stations, including Downtown, saw significant increases in reported crime after train service began. While reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, non-reclassified crimes, for the most part, decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 may have impacted reported crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new community-based policing measures. Follow-up studies needed to confirm long-term trends may be challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic that drastically changed societal conditions. While our research detects changes in reported crime, it does not provide causative explanations. Our work, along with other considerations relevant to public utility, respect for human rights, and existence of socioeconomic disparities, may be useful to law enforcement and policymakers to assess the overall effect of Proposition 47.",

Aside from the disputed effects of Prop. 47 on crime rates, it has also been claimed that the new law brought unintended consequences such as the elimination of DNA collection for the reclassified crimes, restrictions in arresting repeat offenders, declines in the reporting of crimes as victims learned that police would not be able to apprehend and punish perpetrators, and lessened likelihood of habitual drug users seeking treatment [18] . A preliminary analysis conducted state-wide by the California Police Chiefs Association found that the consequences of Prop. 47 are not homogeneous among cities of comparable size and that county specific factors, such as efficacy of monitoring and treatment programs, and how probation and/or incarceration are handled locally, may affect crime rates [10] . Judging the outcomes of Prop. 47 has led to a contentious debate within academic, political, and community settings, culminating in a growing movement to reverse some of its reforms through a 2020 ballot initiative that was eventually rejected at the ballot box. Public safety agencies, caught between opposite viewpoints on the overall positive or negative societal effects of Prop. 47, have often expressed the need to better understand its consequences to optimize operations and budgets, to improve procedures, and to share impartial findings with stakeholder groups [19] .",

Located in Los Angeles County, the city is bordered by Los Angeles proper and the Pacific Ocean. Its downtown core has recently undergone intense revitalization fueled by high-tech start-ups, increased tourism, and the 2016 opening of the Metro Expo Line light rail extension. The latter now connects the beach with nearby Culver City and inner Los Angeles neighborhoods through seven new stations, of which four are located within municipal borders. The city has also experienced rising housing costs, the displacement of long-term tenants, and increasing levels of homelessness [20, 21] . In recent years both the Santa Monica Police Department (SMPD) and the local press have reported increases in crime, including robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, and homicide, with large numbers of repeat offenders [22] [23] [24] [25] . Dedicated social media accounts and resident neighborhood groups [26] [27] [28] [29] have been awash with images, anecdotal evidence, and speculation on the root cause of these trends. Passage of Prop. 47 is among the theories offered to explain the rise in crime; another is the opening of the Expo Line allowing for easier transportation to and from the city [30] [31] [32] .",

The SMPD also increased its engagement with people experiencing homelessness and former inmates, helping them connect to services. Among the newly established programs are the Neighborhood Resource Officers to facilitate community-oriented policing, the Homeless Liaison Program, to assist the unhoused, and the Downtown Business Services Unit to improve communication with business owners.

Our data analysis is meant as a first step in quantifying long-term crime trends in Santa Monica, and as a way to go beyond casual information and/or personal opinion. Throughout our work, in every instance where we discuss changes to crime trends, it is important to note that any increase or decrease we present applies only to the reported crimes listed by the SMPD. This qualifier is crucial, as the SMPD data may not be an unbiased representative sample of the actual crimes committed. For example, the data may be affected by biases in collection methods, changes to police routines, changes in the public's habits, and more.

This decrease persists through 2019 and is concurrent with the new police initiatives mentioned previously. Overall, the average monthly number of non-reclassified crimes fell by 9.2%. Longer term studies would be needed to determine whether this decrease will stabilize in the future. A geographical analysis reveals that reported reclassified crimes after passage of Prop. 47 increased or stayed constant in all but one of the eight Santa Monica neighborhoods, with significant monthly rises in the Downtown, North of Montana, and Ocean Park neighborhoods (+37.2%, +13.2%, and +12.0%, respectively).

            "text": "We use data from an open source file managed and updated by the Santa Monica Police Department (SMPD) from January 2006 to the present day [36] . The raw data includes records of crimes known to the city (as reported by the public and/or known through officer-initiated activity), the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) classification code as determined by the FBI [37] , a description of the type of crime, the date on which it occurred, and the latitude and longitude of its location. To better manage the information and perform statistical analyses on categories with a sufficient amount of data, we collapse some original crime categories into coarser ones. For instance, we group \"aggravated assault with a firearm,\" \"general aggravated assault,\" \"aggravated assault with hands,\" \"aggravated assault with knife,\" and \"aggravated assault with other weapon,\" under the new general category \"assault.\" We also set a threshold of 950 counts per category (close to the crime count for disorderly conduct) for the non-reclassified crimes, so that if this minimum number is not met over the 2006-2019 period, the category is excluded from our analysis due to insufficient data. The first excluded (that is, next most populated) category is the unlawful carrying and/or possession of a weapon, for which a total of 474 crimes are tallied, just over half the imposed threshold. Other crimes that do not meet the threshold are arson, embezzlement, blackmail and homicide. Misappropriation of property appears in the database only from 2010 onwards so we also discard this category from our analysis. Finally, we discard all incomplete or corrupted entries. The total crime count for crimes not included in our analysis represents 2% of all crimes in the database. Table 1 lists the broad crime categories that were reclassified from felonies to misdemeanors under Prop. 47 and their respective 2006-2019 city-wide counts. These categories are larceny, fraud, narcotics possession, forgery, and receiving/possessing stolen property. We refer to these collectively as \"Prop. 47 crimes\" or \"reclassified crimes.\" Crimes not affected by Prop. 47 are also listed in Table 1 as \"non-Prop. 47 crimes.\" We will also refer to them as \"non- Prop. 47 imposed a maximum monetary value of 950 USD for crimes to be reclassified as misdemeanors; however, no dollar amount information is specified in the data set we examined. We used ancillary information to determine which categories should fall under the Prop. 47 header, depending on their typical economic value. For example, a closer inspection of the database reveals that larceny in Santa Monica is mostly the unlawful taking of objects or parts from motor vehicles, of objects from buildings, of used bicycles or shoplifting, the value of which we estimate to be below the 950 USD threshold. Less frequent larceny crimes are shoplifting, pickpocketing, purse snatching and tampering with coin machines, which we also assume to be below the 950 USD threshold. Since the average street value of cocaine, heroin or methamphetamine doses for personal use is well below the 950 USD threshold, we also include possession of narcotics in the Prop. 47 reclassified list. The Federal Reserve estimates that for the year 2015, fraud from bad checks, general-purpose transactions, and credit card accounts resulted in 62 million single payments for a total of 8.3 billion USD, averaging 135 USD per transaction [38] . We thus include fraud and forgery in the Prop. 47 crime list. Finally, we do Table 1 is usually under the 950 USD threshold imposed for reclassification purposes. We do not adjust crime counts for population change since the number of Santa Monica inhabitants has remained fairly stable in the thirteen year period under investigation. The city tallied approximately 87,000 residents in 2006, and after peaking at 93,000 in 2015, the population is currently estimated to be 91,411 [39] .",

Segmented regression is typically used when abrupt changes are expected in the relationship between an explanatory and a response variable. This relationship is assumed to be piece-wise linear, with segments separated by so-called breakpoints. Under the assumption of a single breakpoint, an initial guess of its location is made and the response variable is fit to two lines, one before and one after the putative breakpoint with the constraint that the overall fit is continuous at the breakpoint itself. The resulting curve is the first estimate on which nonlinear regression models are iterated through least squares (or related) methods until convergence, thereby identifying a breakpoint t \ufffd .

We use Davies' test within the 'segmented' package to determine that the best model contains two statistically significant break points [54] . Results appear in Finally, we perform a segmented regression analysis on the non-Prop. 47 crimes by similarly allowing for two breakpoints. As shown in Fig 7, when using the raw time series Y(t), breakpoints occur in July 2006 and December 2010 with 95% confidence intervals that do not contain November, 2014. Performing a segmented regression on T(t) obtained by setting w trend = 19 months yields one breakpoint at November, 2006 and one at October, 2010 with 95% confidence intervals that do not include November, 2014 in either case. For the non-Prop. 47 crimes, breakpoints for both Y(t) and T(t) are highly unstable and highly sensitive to the choice of w trend . Furthermore, regardless of the value of w trend or the number of breakpoints specified, we found no 95% confidence interval that contains November, 2014, or even a proximal time frame, as a likely breakpoint for non-Prop. 47 crimes. Hence, the abrupt change in the reclassified time series observed in November, 2014 should be associated not with an overall increase in crime, but rather with an event that specifically affected this category of crimes. As discussed above, we identify this event with the implementation of Prop. 47 in November, 2014. Similarly, the second breakpoint evaluated on the Prop. 47 time series and occurring in September 2018 may be associated with the new SMPD policing strategies [33] [34] [35] which may have had a stronger impact on Prop. 47 crimes than on non-Prop. 47 ones, for which no corresponding breakpoint was observed. This is because reclassified crimes are generally low-level and quality of life offenses, more easily impacted by the community-based initiatives and the increased patrolling efforts undertaken by the SMPD, such as engagement with vulnerable populations, increased illumination, and physical presence.",

Overall, the largest changes occur Downtown, where the average monthly incidence of reclassified crimes increased by 37.2% after implementation of the new law. This results seems consistent with the fact that reclassified crimes are crimes of opportunity. That is to say, Downtown Santa Monica is rich in crime generators such as shopping, entertainment, and dining venues that attract large numbers of residents and tourists, and may correspondingly draw potential offenders [55] . In any case, our analysis reveals that while reported reclassified crimes increased in most neighborhoods, the strongest effects were felt in areas that were already primed for a criminal surge. In S1 Appendix, to analyze time dependent trends at the local level, we perform an STL decomposition in each of the eight Santa Monica neighborhoods, similar to the analysis in Results: City-wide.

However, the impact of mass transit on crime is found to also depend on the overall demographic, socioeconomic, and land use contexts surrounding transit stops [62, 65, 66] .

As a result of this stratification, we find at most one crime per month at the Expo/Bundy location. Given the paucity of data, we do not perform any further statistical analysis on this station. Results appear in Fig 12 and in Table 4 . We find no significant increase in reported monthly crime near any of the remaining transit stops immediately after passage of Prop. 47 and prior to opening of the Expo Line (2014-2016). Reported crime instead increases dramatically after opening of the Expo Line at the Downtown and 17 th Street/Santa Monica College stations, by 32.2% and 28.6% respectively. Upon restricting our analysis to the reclassified crimes, as shown in Fig 13 and in Table 5 , we find that reported Prop. 47 crimes increased significantly not only at the Downtown and 17 th Street/Santa Monica College stations, but also at 26 th Street/Bergamot station, by 30.6%, 38.6%, and 30.0% respectively.

            "text": "Using a publicly available database compiled and maintained by the Santa Monica Police Department, we investigated whether passage of Proposition 47 in the state of California was associated with any change in reported crime. We specifically focused on crimes that were directly affected by legislative change and were reclassified from felonies to misdemeanors. Our analysis shows that overall the monthly reports of these crimes (larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property) increased by about 15% after implementation of Prop. 47 in November, 2014. By contrast, reported non-reclassified crime decreased by approximately 9% after the new legislation became effective. We used a Welch's t-test to verify that the reclassified crime distribution shift from less crime before November, 2014 to more crime afterwards was statistically significant. Additionally, we used a signal decomposition to isolate the main reported crime trends from seasonal effects. Using changepoint analysis, we identified a discontinuity in reported crime trend at the end of 2014. A Table 3 .",

We also identified a secondary discontinuity in the crime trend and a secondary break-point in the monthly time series, both occurring towards the end of 2018, indicating a decrease in reported crime concurrent with new policing efforts. While these changes to policing are too recent to reverse the overall crime surge observed after the 2014 implementation of Prop. 47, and while it is unclear what the longer term implications of the new initiatives will be, our results perhaps suggest that community partnerships, a responsive and outward facing police force, and targeted measures may be associated with a reduction in reported crime. We also considered the impact of Prop. 47 on the eight neighborhoods that comprise the city and verified that the largest monthly change in crime, at +37.2%, occurred Downtown, an area with many opportunistic crime attractors including nightlife, tourists, dining venues, and shopping centers. Finally, we examined the effects of the opening of the Expo Line on monthly crime rates within 450 meters of the locations of four new transit stations. We found that reported crime increased significantly at the Downtown Santa Monica station, the 17 th Street/ Santa Monica College station, and the Expo/Bundy station. Prop. 47 and non-Prop. 47 percent increases were comparable at the Downtown Santa Monica stop, at +30.6% and +33.5% respectively. In contrast, at the 17 th Street/Santa Monica College stop, the increase for reported Prop. 47 crimes was +38.6%, much higher than for non-Prop. 47 ones, at +23.1%. Table 6 Several observations are in order. The city of Santa Monica does not report the monetary value of relevant crimes. Partitioning of the data into reclassified vs. non-reclassified offenses is thus based on our best estimate of which crimes would, on average, fall under the 950 USD threshold, one of the conditions specified by Prop. 47 for reclassification. For example, the initiative applies to grand theft auto but only for vehicles worth less than 950 USD. Since the typical value of stolen cars in Santa Monica surpasses this threshold, we do not include grand theft auto in the list of Prop. 47 crimes. It is clear that exceptions may exist and that our partitioning may have introduced errors; however, due to the large data sample, we expect these not to be systematic and not to have significantly affected our results. Other biases could arise from unreported victimizations differentially affecting the reclassified vs. non-reclassified crime categories. For instance, the US Department of Justice estimates that the average annual incidence of unreported larceny was 41% nationwide over the 2006-2010 period; for motor vehicle theft the same figure was 17% [69] . Similarly, reporting rates could change over time in response to changing perceptions of the effectiveness of reporting crimes. Finally, the period between passage of Prop. 47 in November, 2014 and the opening of the Expo Line in May 2016 is only 18 months. Compounding effects of the two events may have led to the observed increases in crime; disentangling their overlap may require more discriminants than the data analyzed here.",

            "text": "Possible extensions of this work could involve analyzing reported crime in neighboring cities that share similar socio-economic backgrounds with Santa Monica, such as Culver City (population 39,000), Pasadena (population 138,000) and Glendale (population 203,000). These cities are all within Los Angeles County, although they are less touristic, and are not directly adjacent to the Pacific Ocean. Similarly, it could be elucidating to study reported crime near the other three new Expo Line stations operating in Culver City (Palms, Westwood/Rancho Park, Expo/Sepulveda) to compare and contrast results between the two municipalities. A longer term monitoring of crime in Santa Monica is also desirable. This would allow us to determine whether the decrease in the number of reported monthly crimes observed in late 2018 persists or stabilizes over time. It would also allow us to better discern the effects of the Expo Line, since reported crime may temporarily increase around newly opened stations and settle back to original levels once novelty effects subside [59] . Unfortunately, such studies may not be possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic that severely impacted the global economy. Suspension of all non-essential activities and stay-at-home orders within the city of Santa Monica, as well as reduction to service and ridership of the Expo Line, do not allow for a meaningful, continuous, long-term analysis. Although conducted over short time frames, both after passage of Prop. 47 and the inauguration of the Expo Line, our results do suggest that neighborhood characteristics may influence reported crime, since areas with more opportunities for crime appear are associated with the light rail extension and the new law. Similarly, our results hint that community-based policing and targeted interventions may help reduce (reported) crime.",

While it is possible that the new law directly motivated offenders to commit more reclassified crimes, there may also be other relevant explanations. Among them are the increased attention of police, heightened public awareness, and more reporting, all of which may have been influenced by media coverage. The observed rise may also be a loose manifestation of the well known Hawthorne effect, whereby individuals modify their behavior as a result of being part of an experiment or study [70, 71] . In this case, crime reporting behavior could have been affected by awareness of the changes brought by Prop. 47. Similarly, the decrease in the number of reported reclassified crimes observed in late 2018 may be due to shifts in policing, but also due to fading of Prop. 47 awareness, or habituation. We hope that these and other considerations relevant to public utility, respect for human rights, and existence of socioeconomic disparities, will be used in combination with our results to assess the overall effect of Prop. 47.",

Other choices of {w trend , G, \u03b7, \ufffd} yield different change-point estimates. Most notably reducing w trend will shift the changepoint towards later dates. For example w trend = 5 months, G = 10 months, \u03b7 = 10, \ufffd = 0.5 yields a change point of August 2014 with a 95% margin of error which also includes November, 2014. We performed change-point analysis for a large set of {w trend , G, \u03b7, \ufffd} combinations. For all of them, changes in the rate of Prop. 47 crimes emerge towards the second half of 2014, between June 2014 and August 2014. The choice of w trend = 1, which corresponds to building the slope M(t) from the full time series Y(t) without any smoothing procedure, typically yields no change-points due to the irregularity of the data, as mentioned above. Some parameter choices allow us to identify additional change-points at the end of 2018. For example, w trend = 19 months, G = 5 months, \u03b7 = 5, \ufffd = 0.5 yield October 2018 as a new change-point in addition to June 2014. This is true for other {w trend , G, \u03b7, \ufffd} combinations that allow for a smaller window size and a smaller distance between change-points. Thus, while the main change-point remains between June 2014 and August 2014, a minor one also arises towards the end of 2018 for Prop. 47 crimes. The change-point loci for the non-Prop. 47 crimes are more heavily dependent on the chosen {w trend , G, \u03b7, \ufffd} parameters, and typically do not extend into 2014.

Left panels are for Prop. 47 crimes and right panels are for non-Prop. 47 crimes. Breakpoints appear as dots and the respective 95% confidence intervals are marked by bars. For Prop. 47 crimes, the first breakpoint (red) is November, 2014 for Y(t) and October, 2014 for T(t). Values of 1 < w trend < 19 months preserve the T(t) breakpoint. The second breakpoint (black) is September, 2018 for Y(t), and October, 2018 for T(t). The first breakpoint signals a transition to higher crime for both Y(t) and T(t), the second one a decrease. For the non-Prop. 47 crimes, breakpoint dates are highly unstable and sensitive to changes in w trend . https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251199.g007",
