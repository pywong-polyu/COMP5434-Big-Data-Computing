For this system, we obtain the steadystate workload distribution and its moments of any order.

As a result, many servers are idle in off-peak periods -but they may still consume about 60% of their peak energy consumption [9, 15] . Autoscaling techniques are proposed to solve the trade-off between energy consumption and delay performance. In particular, an autoscaling algorithm adjusts the processing speed according to its workload. At the data center level, an autoscaling algorithm controls the number of active servers in the system in response to the workload [9, 15, 18, 21] . Furthermore, at the individual computer level, a CPU is also able to adjust the processing speed by either dynamic frequency scaling or dynamic voltage scaling techniques [28] [29] [30] . The processing speed is scaled up when the workload is high and scaled down under a low workload. As a result, less energy is consumed under off-peak periods while acceptable delay can be achieved in a heavy-load situation [7] .",

All these studies first reduce the models to fluid models for which matrix analytic methods, spectral methods, and Schur decomposition methods are applied to derive numerical solutions for the distribution of the workload processes (see da Silva Soares and Latouche [4] , Mandjes et al. [16] and Kankaya and Akar [13] for the methodologies). In addition to those studies, Bean and O'Reilly [1] consider a similar fluid model with a set of control levels, study the LST of various passage and sojourn times, and present algorithms for their evaluation. In contrast to the above, motivated by power-saving in modern computer and communication systems, we consider a model with Poisson input, phase-type service-time distribution, and vacation. For this model, using the level-crossing method and renewal theory, we obtain a direct solution for the workload distribution and its moments of any order. By virtue of the Poisson input and phase-type distribution, our solution is more direct in the sense that the workload distribution is expressed in terms of matrix exponentials whose components are explicitly written in terms of given parameters. These results are then used for an optimization problem balancing performance and energy-consumption tradeoff.",

There we propose and analyze an M/G/1-type queueing model that also features two powersaving mechanisms. The speed of the server is scaled according to the workload in the system. Moreover, the server is turned off when the system is empty and is activated again once the workload reaches a certain threshold. In the case of arbitrarily distributed service time and general service speed function, the stationary workload is expressed in terms of a series whose terms are recursively obtained by an integral formula. While the distribution of the workload can in principle be evaluated for this general case, the computation is highly complex. Simpler expressions are obtained for the case of exponential service requirement and the case where the service speed is a linear function of the workload.",

We assume that L = d 1 to keep the model for the moment as simple as possible while retaining its essential elements. In Sect. 3, we shall consider the more general case of piecewise constant service speed with K 0 different speed values, and in which L does not necessarily coincides with one of the thresholds at which the service speed in an active period changes.

To this end, we fix the arrival rate and the job size distribution. In particular, \u03bb = 1 and the job sizes follow a two-stage Erlang distribution with mean 2. The coefficients in the cost function are set as follows: c h = 0.1, c s = 30, c p = 1, c p,0 = 0.6 \u00d7 c p . We consider a service rate function of the form r (x) = r 1 x \u03b1 + r 0 , where we restrict the parameters as follows: r 0 = 1 and r 1 = 0.1, 1, 10, 100. The service rate function is approximated by the step function with step size 0.1 and d K 0 \u22121 = 20, and for x \u2265 20 the service rate is approximated by r (20) . We first consider the cost function against d K for some special service rate functions: r (x) = r 1 x + r 0 , r (x) = r 1 \u221a x + r 0 and r (x) = r 1 x 2 + r 0 , where we fix r 0 = 1 and consider r 1 = 0.1, 1, 10, 100. Figure 3 shows the cost function against the threshold d K for r (x) = r 1 \u221a x + r 0 . In the case r 1 = 0.1, the stability condition is violated. We observe that the curves for r 1 = 1 and 10 are convex, implying the existence of a threshold that minimizes the cost function. In the third curve with r 1 = 100, the cost function monotonically increases, implying that d K = 0 is the optimal threshold. These results suggest that when the service rate is large enough, it is optimal to switch the server on as soon as a job is available. Figure 4 shows the cost function against the threshold d K for r (x) = r 1 x + r 0 . This figure shows that the cost function is minimized at positive values of d K for r 1 = 0.1, 1 and 10 while it is minimized at d K = 0 for r 1 = 100. Figure 5 shows the cost function against the threshold d K for r (x) = r 1 x 2 + r 0 . We observe that the cost function is minimized at a positive value of d K for r 1 = 0.1 and 1 while it is minimized at d K = 0 for r 1 = 10 and 100.",

Sometimes the cost function is minimized at d K = 0, and in some other cases it is minimized at a non-trivial d K > 0. The common trend is that for a fast service rate (larger r 1 and/or \u03b1), the cost function is likely minimized at d K = 0, whereas if the service rate is relatively small, the cost function is likely minimized at This motivates us to have a closer look at the minimal cost for each fixed \u03b1 \u2208 [0.1, 3], where the service curve is given by r (x) = r 1 x \u03b1 + r 0 . Figures 6, 7, and 8 show the optimal threshold d K (on the right y-axis) and the corresponding cost (on the left y-axis) against \u03b1. We also find that the optimized cost function is minimized at some positive \u03b1 for r 1 = 0.1, while it monotonically increases with \u03b1 for r 1 = 1, 10. This implies that, for relatively large r 1 , the value of \u03b1 should be small so that the service rate is not too large to balance the power consumption.",

The mean power consumption cost (energy consumption cost per time unit) is given bywhere m 0 = \u03bb \u22121 (1 + m(d K )) (see Lemma 3.1) and m 1 is given by (2.57). From Theorem 3.1, m 1,k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 K 0 ) is given as follows:We note that each of m 0 , m 1 , and m 1,k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 K 0 ) is given by a matrix exponential form (see Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 3.1), therefore it is easy to implement (5.1) in a numerical calculation.In the cost function above, the cost c p,k will be set to c p,k = c p r 2 k . There is evidence that power consumption is a convex function of the processing speed and it is reasonable to set it as a quadratic function of the speed [17] .Also taking into account the performance, we consider the following cost function for our system:In (5.3), the first term is related to the performance, i.e., the smaller the mean workload, the smaller the response time for jobs is. The second term (the summation) is related to the power consumption of the server in the active period. The smaller the processing speed r k , the smaller the power consumption is; but it leads to a bigger E[Z ]. The third term is the holding cost (power consumption when the server is inactive). It should be noted that it is reasonable to set c p,0 = 0.6c p as the server in inactive mode can consume about 60% power, compared to when it is busy processing a job. The last term is related to the switching cost. It should be noted that a CPU instantaneously consumes a large amount of energy once it is switched on.",
