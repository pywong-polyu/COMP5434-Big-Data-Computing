T-cell epitope prediction is also known as a well establish method in vaccine discovery. Here we identified more than 100 T-cell epitopes with different percentile rank for the whole protein length. Basically, peptides with least percentile rank indicate their higher binding affinity against T-cell. therefore only five peptides within 0.01 to 0.03 percentile rank were found suitable for CD8+. Among them, four peptides with amino acid position 39-47, 45-53, 39-47 and 27-35 were suitable for HLA-B27 molecule where as the only peptide (24-32) suitability attached with HLA-B35 molecules. Further, the 9-mer peptide (Pep-9) LPFNDGVYF (84-92 amino acid) was represented for both B-cell and CD8+ T-cell therefore, selected for this study. Similarly, in case of CD4+ T-cell epitope prediction, out of five top ranked peptides (0.01 percentile) none of them were represented by B-cell thus discarded.

The attached synthetic peptides were removed from their respective crystal structures in order to free the peptide binding sites. Molecular docking was performed between representative structures of MHC molecules and suitable peptide candidates in order to inspect their molecular interaction. Independent dock run was performed i n b oth of the system which produced ten binding complex for each of docking. Five top ranked docked complexes were reported with atomic contact energy (ACE) scores (Table 1). The ACE plays an important role in peptide binding efficacy which is known to be negative in strong interaction.

In this study, both of the peptide Pep-9 (antigenic score: 0.5593) and Pep-15 (antigenic score: 0.8618) was showed above threshold value (0.4) thus established as suitable antigenic peptides. In addition, both of the peptides were predicted as non-allergen by AllerTOP v. 2.0 and AllergenFP v.1.0 tools. Further, molecular weight of Pep-9 and Pep-15 were calculated as 1071.18 g/mol and 1598.91 g/mol respectively.
