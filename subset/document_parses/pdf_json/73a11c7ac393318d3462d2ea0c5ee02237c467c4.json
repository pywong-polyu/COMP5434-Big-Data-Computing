We describe a nonparametric statistical method -originally applied to the reporting of AIDS cases in the 1980s -to estimate the distribution of reporting delays of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City. During June 21 -August 1, 2020, the estimated mean delay in reporting was 5 days, with 15 percent of cases reported after 10 or more days. Relying upon the estimated reporting-delay distribution, we project COVID-19 incidence during the most recent three weeks as if each case had instead been reported on the same day that the underlying diagnostic test had been performed. The statistical method described here overcomes the problem of reporting delays only at the population level. The method does not eliminate reporting delays at the individual level. That will require improvements in diagnostic technology, test availability, and specimen processing.",

When new infections are detected primarily through voluntary testing of symptomatic individuals, as is the case in the United States, there will be two main sources of delay in monitoring trends. First, there will be a testing delay between the actual date when an individual becomes infected and the date when that individual is ultimately tested. Second, unless test samples are very rapidly processed, there will be a further reporting delay between the date of testing and the date the test results are communicated by the reporting entity. The present research addresses the latter source of delay.",

In the system of voluntary, symptom-motivated testing in the United States, testing delay has two components. The first is the incubation period between initial infection and first symptoms of illness, estimated to be about 5.1 days (Lauer et al. 2020 ). The second is the additional delay between the onset of symptoms and date the test is performed. In a voluntary system, testing delays can be reduced by patient education, enhanced availability of walk-in and drive-through testing. Alternative testing technologies that would permit rapid, selftesting would go far to reduce these critical bottlenecks (Larremore et al. 2020 ).",
