            "text": "Cannabis sativa L. (C. sativa) is an annual dioecious herb belonging to the Cannabinaceae family, which is cultivated worldwide, and was one of the original crops in China [1] . C. sativa can be simply divided into industrial hemp and marijuana-generally distinguished by the content of \u2206 9 -Tetrahydrocannabinol (\u2206 9 -THC) in the plant; it is considered to be industrial hemp when the content of \u2206 9 -THC is lower than 0.3% (w/w), and otherwise is referred to as marijuana. Based on the existing legal requirements in China, the cultivation of marijuana is banned; all varieties of C. sativa planted in China belong to the industrial hemp category [2] . In recent years, the medicinal usage of cannabidiol (CBD) has received unprecedented attention in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. Accordingly, as the natural extraction source of CBD, C. sativa has ushered in a new round of development [3] . As an isomeride of \u2206 9 -THC, CBD is non-psychoactive and exhibits good pharmacological effects in treating chronic pain, anxiety, inflammation, depression, and many other symptoms [4, 5] . Today, the quantitative analysis methods of cannabinoids-including CBD-are mainly chromatographic methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and mass spectrometry [6] [7] [8] .",

As shown in Figure 4a , the electrochemical response of CBD on bare GCE was only 0.728 \u03bcA (black line). After the respective modifications with Fe3O4 nanoparticles and GN to the GCE, small oxidation peaks at around 0.5 V could be observed on the Fe3O4/GCE (blue line) and the GN/GCE (red line), which might be due to the electron transfer properties and the good conductivity of Fe3O4 nanomaterials and GN [33] . When Fe3O4-GN suspensions were used to modify the GCE, resulting in the Fe3O4-GN/GCE, an apparent increase in peak current could be observed (5.659 \u03bcA, green line). The advantages of GN and Fe3O4 nanoparticles were combined and enhanced. Moreover, when the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were functionalized by amino groups, the resulting modified electrode (Fe3O4-NH2-GN/GCE) showed the highest response among these electrodes (8.978 \u03bcA, Pink line). In order to confirm the effect of amino groups on Fe3O4 nanoparticles, Fe3O4-nanoparticle-and Fe3O4-NH2-nanoparticle-modified electrodes (Fe3O4/GCE and Fe3O4-NH2/GCE) were compared. As a result, the peak current of Fe3O4-NH2/GCE was slightly higher than that of Fe3O4/GCE (1.366 to 1.08, not shown). A possible reason for this increase might be that the amino groups on the surface could attract more target molecules. As far as we know, there has been no previous report regarding the electrochemical oxidation mechanism of CBD. By referring to reported works on the oxidation of \u0394 9 -THC, the oxidation process of CBD could be assumed to be a phenol-type oxidation mechanism [34, 35] .",

Through the comparison of GN/Fe3O4-NH2/GCE, Fe3O4-NH2/GN/GCE, and Fe3O4-NH2-GN/GCE, the peak currents of each sensor were obtained, as shown in Table 1 . Apparently, the Fe3O4-NH2-GN/GCE showed the best response among these sensors, meaning that the modifiers should first be mixed, and then dropped directly on the surface of the electrode. Based on this finding, different preparation methods of Fe3O4-NH2-GN suspensions were tried (see the ESM). Three kinds of Fe3O4-NH2-GN nanocomposites were compared, and their corresponding peak currents are also shown in Table 1 . Although the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were directly prepared in the presence of GN via ultrasonication and solvothermal methods, the electrochemical properties obtained were not as good as via the physical mix method. Hence, the Fe3O4-NH2-GN suspension was confirmed as the optimal material in this research. which were designated as D band and G band; they represented the disordered sp3 carbon structure (D band) and the sp2 ordered crystalline structure (G band) of GN [32] . After the combination of the two nanomaterials, the intensities of the peaks reduced significantly, which might be a result of the introduction of Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 nanoparticles. However, the intensity ratio of the D to G peaks was maintained, showing that the structure of GN was not affected.",

            "text": "The electrochemical behavior of various modified electrodes in 100 \u00b5mol L \u22121 of CBD were compared via the CV method. As shown in Figure 4a , the electrochemical response of CBD on bare GCE was only 0.728 \u00b5A (black line). After the respective modifications with Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles and GN to the GCE, small oxidation peaks at around 0.5 V could be observed on the Fe 3 O 4 /GCE (blue line) and the GN/GCE (red line), which might be due to the electron transfer properties and the good conductivity of Fe 3 O 4 nanomaterials and GN [33] . When Fe 3 O 4 -GN suspensions were used to modify the GCE, resulting in the Fe 3 O 4 -GN/GCE, an apparent increase in peak current could be observed (5.659 \u00b5A, green line). The advantages of GN and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were combined and enhanced. Moreover, when the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were functionalized by amino groups, the resulting modified electrode (Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 -GN/GCE) showed the highest response among these electrodes (8.978 \u00b5A, Pink line). In order to confirm the effect of amino groups on Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, Fe 3 O 4 -nanoparticle-and Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 -nanoparticle-modified electrodes (Fe 3 O 4 /GCE and Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 /GCE) were compared. As a result, the peak current of Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 /GCE was slightly higher than that of Fe 3 O 4 /GCE (1.366 to 1.08, not shown). A possible reason for this increase might be that the amino groups on the surface could attract more target molecules. As far as we know, there has been no previous report regarding the electrochemical oxidation mechanism of CBD. By referring to reported works on the oxidation of \u2206 9 -THC, the oxidation process of CBD could be assumed to be a phenol-type oxidation mechanism [34, 35] .",

These illustrated results suggested that the electrochemical signals of CBD were the highest when the ratio was 1:1.

Therefore, the material ratio of GN and Fe3O4-NH2 nanoparticles was set to 1:1 as the optimal composition for the fabrication of the electrode. Table 1 . Apparently, the Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 -GN/GCE showed the best response among these sensors, meaning that the modifiers should first be mixed, and then dropped directly on the surface of the electrode. Based on this finding, different preparation methods of Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 -GN suspensions were tried (see the ESM). Three kinds of Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 -GN nanocomposites were compared, and their corresponding peak currents are also shown in Table 1 .

The inset of Figure 4b shows a general equivalent circuit containing the solution resistance (R s ), the electron transfer resistance (R et ), the Warburg element (W), and the charge of the constant phase element (C d ) [36] . The value of R et was calculated by fitting the experimental data to the model circuit. As shown in Figure 4b , the Nyquist plot of bare GCE showed a semicircle, with an R et of 1287 \u2126.

The results illustrated that the peak current increased with increasing CBD concentrations, and three sections of linear dependences could be found between the peak current and the CBD concentration during this range, with a detection limit of 0.04 \u00b5mol L \u22121 (S/N = 3), which is consistent with Liu's work [43] . The plot of peak current versus CBD concentration is shown in Figure 7d . The three regression equations could be respectively expressed as: I p1 = 1.284 C 1 + 0.528 (0.1-0.974 \u00b5mol L \u22121 , r 2 = 0.984), I p2 = 0.176 C 2 + 1.607 (0.974-19.494 \u00b5mol L \u22121 , r 2 = 0.984), and I p3 = 0.0617 C 3 + 3.836 (19.494-100 \u00b5mol L \u22121 , r 2 = 0.988). It could be found in three regression equations that the slope of the peak current at low concentration was higher than at high concentration. At a lower analyte concentration, the number of active sites on the electrode was relatively higher. However, because of the occupancy of-and decrease in the number of-active sites at higher analyte concentrations, the sensitivity and the slope became lower [44] . This demonstrates that the quantitative analysis of CBD using the Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 -GN/GCE was interesting and acceptable [45] . The detection abilities of the reported electrochemical sensors for CBD are listed and compared with the Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 -GN/GCE in Table 2 . Through the comparison, the proposed Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 -GN/GCE exhibited a competitive detection capability and sensitivity for CBD. ",
