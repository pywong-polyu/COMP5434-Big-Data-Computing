As an alternative, we integrated sleep measurements from a consumer sleep-tracker, smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment, and user-phone interactions in 198 participants for 2 months. User retention averaged >80% for all three modalities. Agreement in bed and wake time estimates across modalities was high (rho = 0.81-0.92) and were adrift of one another for an average of 4 min, providing redundant sleep measurement. On the~23% of nights where discrepancies between modalities exceeded 1 h, k-means clustering revealed three patterns, each consistently expressed within a given individual. The three corresponding groups that emerged differed systematically in age, sleep timing, time in bed, and peri-sleep phone usage. Hence, contrary to being problematic, discrepant data across measurement modalities facilitated the identification of stable interindividual differences in sleep behavior, underscoring its utility to characterizing population sleep and peri-sleep behavior.",

In the short term, poor sleep is associated with impaired cognitive performance, mood, and motivation [1] [2] [3] [4] , while over extended periods, sleep loss increases the risk of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, earlier cognitive decline, Alzheimer's Disease, and depression 5, 6 . Many epidemiological associations have been derived using self-report questionnaires which are subject to recall errors and are inconvenient for the collection of longitudinal data. Objective measurement of sleep is thus desirable for longitudinal or long-term assessment of sleep duration, timing, regularity, and continuity.",

Accordingly, an increasing number of studies have turned to such methods for long-term ambulatory tracking of sleep [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

These inexpensive devices hold promise for collecting large-scale longitudinal sleep data that could dramatically improve the characterization of longitudinal sleep patterns compared to cross-sectional estimates of sleep duration or quality obtained from questionnaire data. While less accurate than PSG, collecting data from such devices is far more economical, technically simple, ecologically valid, and can be obtained for multiple nights of sleep in the participants' home [12] [13] [14] .

As such, a different approach for assessing sleep behavior is to collect data on the same individual using multiple sensing techniques. The fusion of information thus obtained can provide redundant information whose concordance as well as discordance might inform about sleep behavior. In the current study, we tested the utility of this approach in two related ways. First, we assessed the level of agreement between sleep estimated from different modalities. Second, we examined patterns of discrepancies where different modalities provide diverging information. Concordant information is useful when one source of information is missing (e.g., when the participant did not wear the device, or the device ran out of battery). Discordant information as demonstrated here proved to be informative as well, as it carries information on specific sleep-related behaviors. We combined data from three sleep tracking systems: (1) wearable sleep tracker (Oura ring), (2) background logging of human-smartphone interactions (Tappigraphy), and (3) self-report via phone-based daily questionnaires (EMA) to characterize sleep and perisleep behavior 28 . A sample of young to middle-aged adults was tracked over a period of 2 months.",

We included four features for each of the three modalities (bedtime, wake time, midsleep time, and time in bed (TIB)), as well as one feature that was only available from Oura (wake after sleep onset [WASO]).

Cluster 1 (n = 467) consisted of nights with delayed sleep timings across all modalities and later Oura wake times relative to the other clusters.

Normally, such discrepancies relate to undesirable, modalityspecific deficits in sleep or wake detection. However, in our data this turned out to be informative in that clustering of highdiscrepancy nights revealed three distinct patterns of sleep and peri-sleep behavior. Moreover, each of these patterns consistently mapped onto individual participants, resulting in three corresponding groups.",

Morning phone use, as detected through tappigraphy, preceded wearable-detected wake time on high discrepant nights. It therefore may potentially reflect in-bed phone usage with low levels of body movement (below a threshold level of physical activity) 18 . The very late bedtimes observed here are likely related to data being collected during the lockdown period of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Robust shifts to later sleep timing have been reported during such lockdowns 14, 32, 33 . In addition, the pattern of later sleep and morning phone use (presumably in-bed), could be related to online study activities (e.g., attending online lectures) as learning was completely shifted online, and commuting to campus was not allowed 34 . A previous study that concurrently measured sleep and phone use 7 , has suggested that a pattern of e-device use in bed might be related to higher sleep inertia due to sleep restriction 35, 36 . Interestingly, this group reported the worst morning mood, and highest sleepiness, making this a potential target group for sleep improvement intervention.",

In addition, these individuals showed lower phone use before bedtime (17 min in the hour before bedtime), and a lower proportion of these individuals reported bringing their phones to bed, compared to the other two groups. This pattern is interesting because restricting peri-sleep electronic device screen time is often seen as a means to improve sleep 37, 38 . Heavy phone use before bedtime is associated with poorer sleep quality and quantity and with increased risk of mental health issues (e.g., depression) 37,39-41 . Although we tracked only smartphone usage and cannot exclude the usage of other e-devices in bed, the observation that this group had the longest TIB suggests that not using one's phone before bed can lengthen nocturnal sleep duration 42, 43 .

Each touchscreen interaction was recorded as a timestamped event along with the active app. TapCounter operates in the background and requires minimal user intervention to function once relevant permissions were granted. From the resulting data, estimates of total daily phone use, screen-interaction count (tap count), and sleep timing were extracted following an algorithm outlined in Borger 18 . Touchscreen interaction time series were converted to 1-min epochs of binary active and inactive states based on the presence or absence of detected taps. Subsequently, a cosinor analysis 55 was performed to capture users' daily smartphone usage rhythm for the identification of potential rest periods; 6 h of lowest estimated tap activity in a 24 h window. Next, potential sleep episodes were identified based on gaps in actual tap activity; defined as more than two hours of near absent tap activity (less than 2 min of taps detected in a 60 min period centered around individual epochs). Lastly, periods of tap inactivity which overlapped (by more than 25%) with the identified rest periods were classified as a sleep episode. Inactivity that lies outside of the potential rest periods were filtered out. Sleep periods exceeding 13 h were excluded to avoid misclassification of sleep from app disconnection which would have resulted in long periods of inactivity exceeding half a day. Sleep episodes recorded within the same day were concatenated to form a single sleep period if the total duration does not exceed 13 h. Otherwise, only the longest sleep episode was retained.",

To ensure that the features were weighted equally in the clustering process, all features were rescaled to vary from 0 to 1 using min-max normalization. Clustering was conducted using the k-means ++ algorithm on Matlab version R2017b (Mathworks, Natick, MA) for cluster center initialization paired with the squared Euclidean distance metric. To identify the optimal number of clusters appropriate for our dataset, we varied the number of clusters (k = 2-10) and assessed their associated within-cluster sums of squared distance.
