Second, to improve inference efficiency, predictive accuracy, and generalizability, we propose a Bayesian multilevel modeling framework that closely characterizes the data hierarchies across spatial units and experimental trials. Rather than analyzing the data in a way that first creates multiplicity and then resorts to a post hoc solution to address them, we suggest directly incorporating the cross-space information into one single model under the Bayesian framework (so there is no multiplicity issue). Third, regardless of the modeling framework one adopts, we make four actionable suggestions to alleviate information waste and to improve reproducibility: 1) abandon strict dichotomization, 2) report full results, 3) quantify effects, and 4) model data hierarchies. We provide examples for all of these points using both demo and real studies, including the recent NARPS investigation.",

Statistical testing begins by accepting the null hypothesis but then rejecting it in favor of the alternative hypothesis if the current data for the effect of interest (e.g., task A vs. task B) or potentially more extreme observations are unlikely to occur under the effect is zero. Because the basic data unit is the voxel, one faces the problem of performing tens of thousands of inferences across space simultaneously. As the spatial units are not independent of one another, adopting an adjustment such as Bonferroni's is unreasonably conservative. Instead, the field has gradually settled into employing a cluster-based approach: what is the size of a spatial cluster that would be unlikely to be observed under the null scenario?",

Both typically present only the statistic (e.g., t) values. However, this change of focus is inconsistent with cluster-based inference: after multiple testing adjustment the proper unit of inference is the cluster, not the voxel. Once \"significant\" clusters are determined, one should only speak of clusters and the voxels inside each cluster should no longer be considered meaningful inferentially. In other words, the statistical evidence for each surviving cluster is deemed at the \"significance\" level of 0.05 and the voxelwise statistic values lose direct interpretability. Therefore, voxel-level statistic values in brain maps and tables in the literature should not be taken at face value. Furthermore, as a cluster is purely defined through statistical evidence, it is usually not aligned with any anatomical region, presenting a spatial specificity problem. To resolve the issue, the investigator typically reduces the cluster to a \"peak\" voxel with the highest statistical value and uses its location as the evidence for the underlying region. A conceptual inconsistency results from these two transitional steps: one from a cluster to its peak voxel, and then another from the voxel to an anatomical region. Furthermore, when a cluster spans over more than one anatomical region, no definite solutions are available to resolve the inferential difficulty. Although this issue of conceptual inconsistency and spatial specificity has been discussed in the past 7, 8 , it remains underappreciated, and researchers commonly do not adjust their presentations to match the cluster-level effective resolution.",

With the statistical threshold at the spatial unit level traded off with cluster extent, larger regions might be able to survive with relatively weaker statistical strength while smaller regions would have to require much stronger statistical strength. Therefore, multiple testing adjustments always penalize small clusters. Regardless of the specific adjustment method, anatomically small regions (e.g., those in the subcortex) are intrinsically disadvantaged even if they have the same amount of statistical evidence. In other words, ideally the evidence for a brain region should be assessed solely in light of its effect strength, not dependent of its anatomical size; thus, the conventional multiple testing adjustment approaches are unfair to small regions because of its heavy reliance on spatial relatedness among contiguous neighborhood.",

As the final results are inferred at the cluster level, there is no clear uncertainty that can be attached to the effect magnitude at the cluster level. On the one hand, a cluster either survives or not under a dichotomous decision. On the other hand, due to the interpretation difficulty of voxel-level statistical evidence, it remains challenging to have, for example, a standard error (\"error bar\") associated with the average effect at the cluster level. Massively univariate analysis (MUA) produces a point estimate and its uncertainty (standard error) at every spatial unit. These are reduced to a single statistic map, which is then dichotomized using thresholding through multiple testing adjustment (MTA); finally, the analyst summarizes the regions based solely on their peak values, ignoring spatial extent. (B) The inherent trade-off between \"information\" and \"digestibility\" (y-axis has arbitrary units). While summarizing peak locations of dichotomized regions is a highly digestible form of output, this also entails a severe information loss.

Fig. 2A illustrates these key aspects of the process of information extraction in standard FMRI analysis. The input data of time series across the brain for multiple participants are rich in information, but of course not easily interpretable or \"digestible.\" After multiple preprocessing steps followed by massively univariate analysis, the original data are condensed into two pieces of information at each spatial unit: the point estimate and the standard error.

Following common practice, many investigators discard effect magnitude information to focus on summary statistics, which are then used to make binarized inferences by taking into account multiple testing. These steps certainly aid in reporting results and summarizing potentially some notable aspects of the data. However, below, we argue that the overall procedure leads to information waste, and that the gained digestibility is relatively small (in addition to generating problems when results are compared across studies).

Accordingly, the effect at each spatial unit can assume any value within (\u2212\u221e, + \u221e) with equal likelihood.

In addition to potentially excessive penalties due to information waste, the principle of indifference has another important ramification: overfitting. As spatial units are treated as parallel entities -not part of the data hierarchy -in the model, global information shared across space is not leveraged and calibrated, leading to the loss of modeling efficiency.

We agree that the adoption of a Gaussian prior is a sensible approach: it assumes that the results track an average population effect, while exhibiting variability across teams.

Clearly, there is considerable information loss in the processes of binarization and multiple testing adjustment. As an alternative, consider having access only to a summary statistic (e.g., Student's t) for each study. A statistic is in essence the ratio of the estimated effect relative to its variability and reduces the two independent pieces of information into one. Whereas including statistic values is a step in the right direction, it is an insufficient one. Displaying both the effect estimate and its variability would provide richer information than a statistic value alone.

As FMRI signals do not follow a ratio scale with a true zero, we recommend reporting percent signal change or another index of magnitude, whenever possible. As seen in this section, not providing this information amounts to considerable data over-reduction that leads to many subsequent issues 22 . Reporting effect estimates also helps safeguard against potentially spurious results. Signal changes in FMRI are relatively small and do not surpass 1-2%, except when simple sensory or motor conditions are contrasted with low-level baselines. In contrast, statistical values are dimensionless and do not directly provide information regarding effect magnitude. Indeed, the same statistic value may correspond, for example, to infinitely many possible pairs of mean and standard error (Fig. 4, right) . A small t-statistic value could represent a small effect with a small standard error or a large effect with a large standard error -two scenarios with very different meanings. In addition, if, for example, a seemingly reasonable statistical value (e.g., t-value of 4.3) corresponds to an unphysiological 10% signal change, the conventional \"statistic-only\" reporting mechanism does not offer an easy avenue to identify and filter out such a spurious result. We note that another common practice of reporting a standardized \"effect size\" (e.g., Cohen's d) shares the same problem of information loss due to (a) the unavailability of the physical scale and (b) the over-reduction from two values (effect estimate and uncertainty) to one. On the other hand, such a standardized metric, if desirable, could be easily derived from the effect estimate and its uncertainty.",

Returning to the NARPS investigation, they performed a second meta-analysis solely based on statistic values. Under this approach without dichotomization, the findings across teams were substantially more consistent with one another, reaching a conclusion that was different from their first meta-analysis based on individual teams' dichotomized reporting. These results are not only encouraging for the field of neuroimaging, but they also highlight the perils of the dichotomous approach. We conjecture that the meta-analysis results would have been further improved if both effect magnitude and uncertainty information had been incorporated in their meta-analyses.

The information loss due to these requirements, which mirror many conventional practices, can best be seen in the NARPS report by the contrasting conclusions these steps produce in a meta-analysis compared to a separate comparison done by looking at unthresholded statistics: the former \"resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests\", while the latter \"analyses of the underlying statistical parametric maps on which the hypothesis tests were based revealed greater consistency than would be expected from those inferences, and significant consensus in activated regions across teams was observed using meta-analysis.\" That is, the consistency of results was noticeably greater just by loosening one of sources of information waste (dichotomizing). Similar to the demo example above in Fig. 5 , it is likely that the finding of more consistency across teams represents reality more closely than the dichotomized version (which had undergone much greater information reduction before assessment). Much of the focus on the NARPS results has been on the \"sizeable variation\" of the dichotomized results; this has overshadowed the \"significant consensus\" that was present when the results were shown with less information loss. Due to the common practice of dichotomization and incomplete result reporting, meta-analysis in neuroimaging is largely limited to anatomical locations without regard to effect magnitude and is vulnerable to publication bias.

Due to the impact of partial pooling across hierarchical levels, the Bayesian model tends to generate estimates that are more conservative and closer to the average effect within a given hierarchy than if each specific effect were estimated individually. Because of this conservative nature, the multilevel model aims to control for errors of incorrect magnitude and sign. Furthermore, adjustment for multiplicity is not needed 24 , especially since all the inferences are drawn from a single, overall posterior distribution of an integrative model. In the past years, we have investigated how the framework can be effectively employed to analyze FMRI data at the region level 8, 25, 27 , as well as for matrix-based analysis including time series correlations among regions or white-matter properties 28 . The approach has also been applied effectively to other scenarios in neuroimaging 26, [29] [30] [31] . Although at present the framework is computationally prohibitive at the whole-brain voxel level, we have also employed the technique at the voxel level within brain sectors, such as the insula. First, we present a region-level example that illustrates a recent application 25 at the region level. The outcome in Fig. 6A shows the posterior distributions that characterize the probability of observing the region-level effects in a range given the data. For each region, the full posterior distribution conveys both the effect magnitude and its uncertainty, and the latter can be captured by the area under the curve to the right/left of zero. This posterior can be reported in full without dichotomization, as shown here. For example, the posterior probability that the effect was greater than zero in the left superior frontal gyrus (L SFG) was 0.92, which may be noteworthy in the research context in question. In particular, model fits can be qualitatively assessed by plotting predicted values against the raw data through posterior predictive checks (Fig. 6B) and quantitatively compared to alternative models using information criteria through leave-one-out cross-validation. By comparison, the model fit using the massively univariate approach was considerably poorer (Fig. 6B) .",

In the standard approach, one would proceed with voxelwise inferential tests (say, a t-test comparing the two groups) followed by a threshold adjustment based on spatial extent to control for multiple testing. In contrast, the Bayesian multilevel approach specifies a single model, which combines all data according to natural hierarchical levels of the data. In this particular study, one natural hierarchy was that of participant pairs given the yoking of the experimental design. In addition, we focused on voxels within the insula, a cortical sector important for threatrelated processing. However, the insula is a large and heterogeneous territory, with notable subdivisions that previously had been described functionally and anatomically. Accordingly, we subdivided the insula in each hemisphere into around 10 subregions, each of which with approximately 100 voxels. Thus, the subregions comprised another hierarchy. At the most basic level of the hierarchical structure, the unit was the voxel itself.",

Under the single integrative framework, the information is shared in a \"melting pot\" and calibrated. In other words, partial pooling plays a self-adaptive role of regularization, similar to the situation with the conventional methods such as ridge regression and LASSO. Thus, the impact on the same spatial unit is relatively negligible even when the total amount of data changes (e.g., increasing the number of voxels or regions); as a result, a region would be assessed by its own \"merits\" of effect magnitude, but not its anatomical size. However, the modeling process should not be simply executed as an automatic pipeline without quality control. For example, a posterior predictive check allows one to examine the model adequacy or discrepancies through visually comparing the predictive distribution to the observed data. Cross-validation is another important technique under the Bayesian framework to gauge how closely a model, relative to potential candidates, predicts future data from the same data generating processes that produced the current data at hand. In general, the Bayesian approach welcomes an integrated view of the modeling workflow with an iterative process of model development and refinement 34 . for the same reasons that subjects in neuroimaging are routinely treated as random samples from a hypothetical pool of a Gaussian distribution, we can effectively model the effect distribution across space as a Gaussian, rather than adopting the stance of \"full ignorance\". However, exceptions do occur when the data do not follow a bellshaped distribution due to outliers or skewness. A conventional approach is to set hard bounds (e.g., the rule of three standard deviations), constraining the data to a predetermined interval in order to exclude outliers. Such a brute force approach is arbitrary and unprincipled to some extent. In contrast, outliers or skewed data can be accommodated in a principled manner with the utilization of non-Gaussian distributions (e.g., Student t-distribution",

For example, based on the available data, should a certain vaccine be administered to prevent Covid-19? In such cases, a binary decision must be adopted, and decision theory, which incorporates the costs of both false positives and false negatives, can be used.

It could be argued that this would lead to an explosion of unsubstantiated findings that would flood the literature. We believe this is unlikely to occur. Scientists are interested in finding the probability of seeing the effect conditioned on the data at hand (\"what happened\"), rather than the p-value (\"what might have happened\" or the probability of seeing the data or more extreme scenarios conditioned on the null effect).

The fit does a reasonable job at capturing the mean response; however, it is clearly poor in explaining the fluctuations at the trial level (Fig. 8c) . Whereas traditional models in neuroimaging ignore this variability across trials, we propose to explicitly account for it in the underlying statistical model 57, 58 .",

It is also this hierarchical consideration that motivates us to propose the incorporation of spatial units as part of the modeling process as opposed to a post hoc compensation for multiple testing under the conventional massively univariate framework. Some of the hierarchical schemata are conceptually equivalent to various regularization methods (e.g., ridge, LASSO); they can be also formulated under the conventional mixed-effects paradigm with, for example, the spatial units playing the role of \"random effects\". Although computationally affordable, a linear mixed-effects model could only allow one to make inferences at the population level, but not for spatial units as individual random effects. In contrast, Monte Carlo simulations, despite the relatively high numerical cost, enable the Bayesian framework to accommodate a wide range of modeling capability and inferential power.

There is inherent smoothness in the acquired data and more is added by blurring during preprocessing; this blurring decreases spatial resolution by spreading information across anatomical structures, which makes final interpretation more difficult and less spatially specific.

However, future methodological developments and computational breakthroughs will surely continue to reduce, if not dissolve, this computational barrier 63, 64 . Nevertheless, we believe that the hierarchical perspective helps reveal the information loss associated with two aspects of the conventional modeling approach: the implicit assumption of uniform distribution and the artificial dichotomization required in handling multiplicity. In fact, these two aspects are two sides of the same coin: the conventional modeling methodology focuses only on local relatedness among neighboring spatial units, but ignores the global information shared across the whole brain. Consequently, the various approaches of adjustment for multiple testing adopted in the field may lead to excessive penalties and overconservative inferences. For these considerations, when voxelwise analysis is performed under the conventional massively univariate framework, we believe that the Bayesian multilevel framework lends an important perspective: a threshold or a set of spatial blobs purely based on statistical evidence is only suggestive but not rigid. To avoid further information waste, any statistical evidence should be viewed -regardless of the adopted framework -as intrinsically embedded with some underlying and implicit assumptions; it should be considered as a continuum both in result reporting as well as during the research reviewing process.",

We have shown the many ways that Fig. 2 ). (A) The two approaches run parallel, but in the \"proposed\" first step BML puts data into a single model (removing the need for multiple testing adjustment later), and the information is partially pooled and shared across space. (B) The proposed multilevel framework produces an intermediate output of posterior distributions (lacking in the conventional approach); these carry rich information about parameter and model fitting. The information pooling also produces effect estimates that retain more information and avoid potential overfitting. This information advantage over the conventional method carries on to later stages. Thus, while the \"digestibility\" of results increases similarly at each stage, the drop-off in information content is slower in the proposed approach. The dotted part of the proposed steps reflects that we strongly suggest not including the steps that many traditional approaches at present perform, due to the wasteful information loss incurred. this can be considered an \"overdigestible\" result: a lot of useful information has been sacrificed (results at subthreshold locations that might still be informative, and separate effect estimates with uncertainty measures) for not much gain.",

With various preprocessing and modeling approaches available in the community, some extent of result variation is expected and unavoidable. All these factors contribute to an expected variability in reported results, and it need not be considered inherently problematic. To accurately combine multiple studies and determine the levels of variability present, one would need to make a model using their unthresholded results, and preferable both their effect estimates and uncertainty information. Otherwise, small outcome differences can appear to be much larger, when passed through the dichotomization sieve. Thus, it is the result presentation (e.g. highlight but not hide, show effect magnitude instead of statistical evidence only, revealing model details, etc.) that would conduce to the convergence of a specific research hypothesis across teams. We believe that the abandoning of result dichotomization is one small step toward reducing variability due to artificial thresholding. We agree with NARPS's suggestion of encouraging original statistical results being submitted to a public site. However, more improvements would be needed. For example, such public results at present are still restricted to statistical evidence without the availability of effect magnitude information.",

The posterior probability indicates the strength of the evidence associated with each effect estimate, conditioned on the data, model and priors. In the conventional null hypothesis framework, uncertainty is expressed in terms of standard error or confidence interval. Unfortunately, while mathematically precise, this information is very difficult to interpret in practice and easily misunderstood35 . Notably, a confidence interval is \"flat\" in the sense that it does not carry distributional information; parameter values in the middle of a confidence interval are not necessarily more or less likely than those close to the end points of the interval, for example (e.g.,Fig. 5A,C). In contrast, the posterior distribution provides quantitative information about the probability of ranges of values, such as the parameter being positive, negative, or within a particular interval. Unlike the conventional notion of \"confidence interval\", parameter values surrounding the peak of the posterior distribution are more likely than those at the extremes(Fig. 5B). 6) Error controllability. Instead of the false positive and false negative errors associated with the conventional null hypothesis framework, Bayesian multilevel modeling can be used to control two different errors: type M (over-or under-estimation of effect magnitude) and type S (incorrect sign)36 . For example, effect estimates under the massive univariate modeling framework tend to be exaggerated (Jensen's inequality), leading to type M error. In contrast, shrinking the effect estimates under the Bayesian multilevel framework provides an effective way to regularize and counteract the exaggeration 14 .7)Extended modeling capabilities. The Bayesian framework is advantageous and flexible in handling complex data structures that can be challenging for the conventional framework. Consistent with the central limit theorem, many types of data, including the effect estimates in neuroimaging, tend to have a density of roughly Gaussian characteristics with a bell-shaped distribution exhibiting a single peak and near symmetry. Based on the maximum entropy principle, the most conservative distribution is the Gaussian if the data have a finite variance 37 . Thus,",
