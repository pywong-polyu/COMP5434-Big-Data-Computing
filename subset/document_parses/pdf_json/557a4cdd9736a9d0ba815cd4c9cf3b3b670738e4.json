For how to build a better elderly care service model, under the current situation of shortage of elderly care resources, community elderly care may become a solution. By analyzing the status quo, existing problems and development trends of home-based care services in Hangzhou's community, and learning from foreign experience, it explores the establishment of a \"integrated physical, medical, and nursing care\" community health management model for the elderly and provides a perfect solution for the development of Hangzhou's community elderly care services countermeasures and suggestions for mode operation. Based on the evaluation, problem analysis, and empirical research on the current situation of home care services in Hangzhou communities, this paper draws on relatively mature community care practices, proposes to build a community elderly health management model that combines medical care and care, and improves and innovates the overall design and medical care of the elderly service model measures for the health management of the elderly in the integrated community. e experimental results of this study show that, according to the demand for elderly care services, elderly people in need of care account for 86.6%, 79.5%, and 68.4% of the elderly population, especially in the areas of medical care, life care, and housekeeping services.",

In terms of needs, the old-age care model that can meet the national conditions of our country is expected to provide some reference and reference for practitioners in the planning, architectural design, investment, and operation of future retirement communities.

Ahn et al.'s research uses grounded theory and content analysis to conduct in-depth, semistructured interviews with 10 nationally recognized experts on the use of lean management in healthcare organizations. e purpose is to understand if and how lean management can be used to achieve breakthrough improvements in performance. e results of his experiments reveal some differences in how experts define breakthrough improvement and illustrate the value of human-centered design thinking, alone or as a complement to lean management, in achieving breakthrough improvements in healthcare organizations. However, there is a lot of redundant data in his research [1] . Bethea A is based on preexisting conditions and declining physiological reserves in older adults that often complicate healthcare delivery in this population; the design model enables the NP to initiate admissions and coordinate hypoacuity patients under the supervision of a trauma attending physician daily care. His study sought to compare outcomes in older patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontraumatic NP (NTNP) services. ese clinical and economic results have proven helpful in substantiating the care provided by TNP at research facilities. However, his experiments lack a certain amount of objective factual basis [2] . Chen et al., based on social support theory and differential order pattern, explored the underlying mechanism and boundary conditions of the relationship between social interaction and life satisfaction among the rural elderly. On the one hand, it explores the mediating role of psychological well-being in the relationship between social interaction and life satisfaction, and on the other hand it examines whether emotional support moderates the effects of social communication on mental health. Using structural equation modeling, they analyzed data from 658 rural older adults in China and concluded that the relationship between social communication and mental health was negatively moderated by emotional support. Finally, the implications for management theory and practice are discussed. However, they did not propose specific countermeasures [3] .",
