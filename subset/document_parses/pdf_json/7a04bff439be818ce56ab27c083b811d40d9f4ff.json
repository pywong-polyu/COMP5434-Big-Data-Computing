            "text": "Climate change has affected the economies and societies of all countries, and this trend of global effects is expected to continue for some decades, despite the increase in activities to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere. Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other GHGs decreased by around 6% in 2020 due to travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this improvement was only temporary, as recovery in the global economy led to emissions returning to, or surpassing, their previous levels, and the exacerbation of air pollution [1] . To address the climate emergency, countries' post-pandemic recovery plans to rebuild their economies must trigger long-term systemic changes that will change the trajectory of CO 2 and other GHGs in the atmosphere. These must shape economies to be more environmentally friendly, healthy, safe, and resilient. Thus, the current crisis could be an opportunity for a deep and systemic shift towards a more sustainable economy that is The energy requirement for cooling a room is generally affected by both the external level of solar irradiation and the internal heat radiation from construction materials, humans, equipment, and lighting. The need for electric lighting is also affected by the availability of daylight, and the existence and type of windows and shading devices. It is difficult to quantitatively assess the thermal and aesthetic comfort of transparent fa\u00e7ades, which are current fashionable. Previous research [10] presented a method for determining the optimum fa\u00e7ade criteria for considerably enhancing building performance, addressing basic issues of energy balance (i.e., energy yield versus demand, measured in kWh m \u22122 year \u22121 ), user comfort, and the impact of the chosen criteria on the formal quality of the building. The simulation results show that the energy balance of the building per square meter clearly decreases exponentially as the number of floors increases. Therefore, this model shows that it will be difficult for high-rise buildings, with several floors, to be autonomous in terms of energy.",

In airtight buildings, the interior air quality may quickly degrade with high occupation levels, and mechanical ventilation systems are relied on to condition the air, usually with considerable thermal losses. Given the challenge of jointly improving energy efficiency and maintaining indoor air quality, the search for new technologies for local air purification is even more desirable. This paper aims to explore the possible nature-based solutions, using microalgae systems in buildings, as a means to improve air quality, capture indoor carbon dioxide, produce oxygen, biomass, and bioenergy, and improve buildings' global performance. The potential benefits and drawbacks of these new types of systems are analyzed in this work.",

            "text": "Humans require air to breath and live, mainly via the supply of oxygen, O 2 , for cellular respiration. This provides the energy to operate the cellular metabolism in order to move, think, and perform other activities. Considering an adult respiratory rate of 12 to 18 breaths/minute, which equates to inhaling about half a liter of air, a person breathes approximately 17 m 3 air/day [11] . Air quality and human health are intertwined, and air quality is widely recognized as being one of the most important causes of disease in the 21st century [12] [13] [14] . Although indoor air quality has received less attention than outdoor air pollution, in the presence of indoor sources, indoor contaminant concentrations are higher, and sometimes 10-fold higher than the respective outdoor air levels (e.g., formaldehyde, whose sources vary from furniture to cleaning agents). Furthermore, in contemporary European lifestyles, citizens spend, on average, over 90% of their time inside. The combination of the generally higher indoor concentration of certain pollutants, and the fraction of time spent inside, results in the overall domination of indoor air pollution exposure. In addition, each year, more than 5 million people die prematurely from diseases attributable to poor indoor air quality, which also contributes to high economic losses due to reduced worker productivity, increased health care costs, and other material losses [12] . Indoor air pollutants are diverse, ranging from particulate materials (PMs), biological pollutants, and over 400 different organic and inorganic chemical compounds, whose concentrations depend on both internal and external factors [15] . Any contaminants, either chemical and biological, can result in significant health problems, which may lead to temporary or even permanent incapacitation, and, in extreme cases, to death, especially of those more vulnerable, i.e., children and the elderly. For example, although only CO 2 concentrations above 5% are considered to pose irreversible risks to health [16] , a person is unable to breathe air in an atmosphere with a 4% CO 2 concentration for more than several minutes without feeling sick. Recent data [17] suggests that chronic exposure to CO 2 values of 1000 ppm may affect cognitive performance and contribute to increased symptoms of respiratory diseases. Air is also the media by which a person can be contaminated with several diseases (the airborne route of infection), including, for example, flu, tuberculosis, Terpenes, compounds with a natural origin such as limonene, \u03b1-pinene, and \u03b2-pinene, are chemicals that may play an important role as indoor air pollutants. This is because they can be involved in oxidation reactions with ozone or nitrogen oxides that contribute to the formation of formaldehyde and ultrafine particles formed by condensation/nucleation processes as products of the reaction. The main sources of terpenes are cleaning products and disinfectants with terpene-based fragrances. Inhalation of terpenes is generally not considered to be a health concern but their reaction products may pose a concern [19] .",

            "text": "Many sources of air contamination exist, both natural and anthropogenic. This work focuses on the later, and mainly on the consequences to the quality of indoor air in urban environments. In these environments, the outdoor air quality is usually degraded by higher population density, traffic, services, commerce, industry, and the other activities that comprise the urban setting [20, 21] . If the outdoor air quality is poor, it is relatively difficult to refresh the indoor air to meet quality standards using traditional ventilation systems. Therefore, buildings' systems to improve indoor air quality rely on several ventilation systems, with or without purification (filtration devices). Traditionally, this involves the use of an AHU (Air Handling Unit) or simply an AVAC (Air Ventilation and Air Conditioning System), whose most important function is to provide thermal comfort for buildings' residents and users. Due to the COVID-19 threat of airborne disease transmission, at a scale not previously experienced by humanity, this solely thermal comfort perspective has been required to change for safety reasons. Increasing human development and standards of living have led to individuals spending an increasing amount of time inside, either at home (cooking, energy generation) or other indoor facilities, such as theaters/cinemas, work (e.g., offices, industrial units), schools, and hospitals. Each poses its own specific set of challenges, because different contaminants are generated, thus requiring different mitigation and/or air treatment approaches. A relevant example is the intensive use of indoor spaces, particularly in public buildings such as higher education institutions, which often have crowded classrooms, laboratories, libraries, or cafeterias. Presently, the safety of air, which relates to the microbiological and chemical compliance with international standards [20, 22, 23] , has greater importance than the thermal comfort for which the NZEB and the energy efficiency EU Directives were designed. In an urban context, all of these complex problems have interrelated dimensions. The trend of increasing global average atmospheric temperatures is expected to continue in the coming decades, causing extreme heat events that are likely to become more frequent and severe in many cities, especially in the south of Europe and in the Mediterranean region. Additionally, this climate change impact is expected to worsen the urban heat island effect, which is characteristic of cities due to land use change, and the resulting increase in imperviousness and decrease in surface albedo, which increases radiation heat from the built environment [24, 25] .",

This study proposes that systems should be installed in new and already existing buildings to regenerate the building air in an energy-conserving manner and provide autonomy to the building.

The literature has described assessments of the indoor air quality in schools in Portugal [27] [28] [29] and abroad [30, 31] because it is a matter of public health. Results confirmed that schools need to improve the quality of their indoor air, particularly in buildings in which mechanical ventilation systems are not used [27, 31] . Other studies evaluated the indoor air quality of higher education buildings, showing that CO 2 levels may reach peak concentrations [32] . For example, measurements taken during teaching hours showed a mean CO 2 concentration value of 1530 ppm, varying in a range from \u221224% to +31% [30] . This study also showed that in high-density traffic areas or near industrial activities, outdoor air pollutants affect indoor air quality, particularly by increasing the levels of PM 10 , PM 2.5 , total volatile organic compounds, benzene, and toluene.",

Because cities are expected to absorb most of the forecasted population growth in the next several decades, mitigation and adaptation measures for extreme weather events and catastrophes are particularly critical in the urban landscape due to the complexity of urban metabolism [33, 34] . In the European Union, the construction sector is responsible for about 40% of energy consumption and 36% of GHG emissions [4] , and is one of the main sources of environmental pollution, mainly due to the excessive emissions associated with the processes of heating and cooling systems in buildings.

The existing legislation, regulations, and/or guidelines are based on this assumption. Minimal air renewal rates, based on the overall room/building volume, for different activity sectors and occupancy rates, can be found in the applicable regulations [39, 40] . However, indoor air quality is constrained not only by the renovation rate of fresh air from outdoors, but also by the quality of atmospheric air that is brought inside [41] . In densely populated cities or industrial regions, where atmospheric air quality is often very poor, these criteria and/or recommendations are not adequate. This situation also applies to other pollutants. It should also be considered that pollution is often a regional problem with local constraints and characteristics. Air renovation from poor quality outdoor air may raise other concerns, particularly due to the presence of pollutants such as particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) or nitrogen oxides (NO x ), which are recognized to be harmful and associated with certain diseases [42] . Although cities and metropolitan areas are sources of economic growth, contributing to around 60% of global GDP, they are also responsible for around 70% of global carbon emissions and use over 60% of the resources [3] . Road traffic is the biggest source of urban ambient air pollution, accounting for 25% of the global levels of particulate matter, followed by unspecified sources of human origin (22%), domestic fuel burning (20%), natural dust and sea salt (18%), and industrial activities including power generation (15%) [43] .",

There are three strategies to promote good indoor air quality: source control, ventilation, and air cleaning or purification. Source control is the smartest strategy because it avoids the problem at the source. However, in some cases, it is not able to be applied due to constraints related to construction materials or ongoing activities. Ventilation requires energy and implies emissions to the ambient air, at both the local and global scales. One of the emergent areas of indoor air quality is related to cleaning technologies. Various air treatment technologies can be used for control of contaminants. Conventional processes, such as sorption onto solid sorbents (for VOCs), filtration (for particulate matter, PM), and disinfection (for bioaerosols and microorganisms), are combined with advanced treatment processes, such as photocatalytic oxidation of VOCs, bipolar air ionization to agglomerate PM, and ultraviolet disinfection to inactivate bioaerosols [44] . Despite their high applicability, these processes have several disadvantages. For instance, for PM reduction, in the case of filtration, frequent replacement of filters is required and, in the case of electrostatic precipitation, a high risk of ozone generation exists. UV-photocatalytic oxidation appears to be a promising air cleaning technology. However, issues remain to be addressed before it can be used safely in buildings, such as generation of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde from partial oxidation of ubiquitous VOCs such as alcohols [45] . In addition, the high cost of these technologies and their accessibility by consumers need to be considered.",

This is similar to carbon capture from flue gas, in which the CO2 and other contaminants are used as nutrients for microalgae growth [63, 64] . In addition, when the outside air is particularly polluted, or cooling or heating is needed due to the variation in indoor or outdoor air temperatures, another efficient approach is to recirculate the air in a closed loop between the microalgae cultures and the living spaces, in which the microalgae system purifies the indoor air.

This can be achieved via the production of oxygen and fresh air for room ventilation, in a manner that is almost independent from the quality of the atmospheric air.

Official data provided by the Portuguese Environmental Agency for 2017 (the latest data available), recorded over 600 million kg of total CO 2 emissions in the municipality of Porto, which is equivalent to a spatial concentration of 14.5 kg of CO 2 /m 2 [67] . Due to this scenario, which appears unlikely to improve without intervention, there is a need to find alternative means to provide air in cities that is cleaner, and hence safer, than the surrounding atmospheric air. Therefore, in polluted environments, such as the case of certain cities, compliance with this legislation may increase the need for high air flows for renovation, with a corresponding sharp increase in the energy consumption parcel for ventilation (VC); however, there is no guarantee that safe indoor air would be provided. Furthermore, in highly polluted areas it can be difficult to achieve the clean air quality needed by people with respiratory problems, particularly in the most vulnerable groups, i.e., the elderly and children. Thus, the solution of integrating microalgae production systems in buildings potentially enables the quality of the indoor air to be better than that of the outdoor air.",

Official data provided by the Portuguese Environmental Agency for 2017 (the latest data available), recorded over 600 million kg of total CO2 emissions in the municipality of Porto, which is equivalent to a spatial concentration of 14.5 kg of CO2/m 2 [67] . Due to this scenario, which appears unlikely to improve without intervention, there is a need to find alternative means to provide air in cities that is cleaner, and hence safer, than the surrounding atmospheric air. Therefore, in polluted environments, such as the case of certain cities, compliance with this legislation may increase the need for high air flows for renovation, with a corresponding sharp increase in the energy consumption parcel for ventilation (VC); however, there is no guarantee that safe indoor air would be provided. Furthermore, in highly polluted areas it can be difficult to achieve the clean air quality needed by people with respiratory problems, particularly in the most vulnerable groups, i.e., the elderly and children. Thus, the solution of integrating microalgae production systems in buildings potentially enables the quality of the indoor air to be better than that of the outdoor air.

This is unfavorable for fermentation, and requires additional pretreatment and co-fermentation strategies for the process to be sufficient. However, intensive recent research in this area revealed that it is possible to obtain microalgae biomass with low protein content by cultivating microalgae in a nitrogen-deprived medium. A previous study [80] showed that the anaerobic digestion of microalgae biomass with low protein content resulted in a stable process with low levels of inhibitory substances, a high biogas yield, and high methane productivity, corresponding to a biomass-to-methane energy conversion efficiency of up to 84%. This made it possible to generate biofuel in a sustainable and low-cost manner, while avoiding the need for biomass pre-treatments and the intensive use of energy. Thus, the process was found to be feasible and enabled positive net energy to be obtained.",

Branco-Vieira et al.

Fertilizers contribute less than 1% to the biomass production cost. These authors also showed that the annual operating costs for microalgae biomass production (including water, electricity, labor, fertilizer, and wastewater treatment) represent about 55% of the initial capital investment in closed PBR systems (including PBR construction, circulation pump, heating and cooling equipment, centrifuge, process control, and infrastructure).",

In 2013, the BIQ House (building with Bio-Intelligent Quotient) was constructed in Hamburg, Germany, as a lowenergy residential building [85] . The building includes 120 flat panel glass photobioreactors mounted on the fa\u00e7ade (the so-called \"SolarLeaf\" fa\u00e7ade), covering an area of 200 m 2 . The flat PBRs used on this building were claimed to be highly efficient for microalgal growth and to require minimal maintenance. The implemented system provides about one-third of the building' total heat demand for the 15 residential units, and has the capacity to generate biomass and heat as sources of renewable energy. Additionally, the PBR system provides a thermally controlled microclimate around the building, providing noise reduction and dynamic shading. This PBR system has the capacity to remove up to six tons of carbon dioxide per year, using the flue gas from the gas burner as the CO 2 source to produce microalgae biomass. Using an external production unit, up to 80% of the harvested biomass is converted into methane, which is then returned to the building to generate electricity and heat [86] .",

[88] also considered two microalgae species-Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella vulgaris-to analyze the potential energy benefits (energy consumption, window U-value, visible transmittance, and solar heat gains) of incorporating PBR systems into the window fa\u00e7ades of an office building in Tel-Aviv, Israel. Compared with single glazing, the energy savings of the PBR window solution varied widely with the fa\u00e7ade orientation and the microalgae biomass concentration inside the PBR system. With the maximum microalgae concentration, the saved energy varied from 20 kWh m \u22122 year \u22121 on the south fa\u00e7ade to 8 kWh m \u22122 year \u22121 on the east fa\u00e7ade, whereas energy consumption increased on the north fa\u00e7ade by 18 kWh m \u22122 year \u22121 . This study noted that a simple incorporation of a microalgae PBR into the windows was able to improve building thermal performance under specific conditions. The conditions in this study were examined using thermal simulation, based on adequate window sizing and orientation in a Mediterranean climate context. Results showed the building's HVAC loads were reduced. As with other technologies, to take maximum advantage of microalgae technology, and to improve a building's energy efficiency, an appropriate building design is necessary [89] . In addition, because of the use of roof tops or fa\u00e7ades, PBR solutions for growing microalgae avoid the impact of land use change, and the microalgae biomass can be used for other applications (e.g., biofuel production or biomaterials). Biloria and Thakkar [61] analyzed the economic and environmental performance of two alternative renewable energy sources-microalgae building technology and photovoltaic (PV) panels-used to retrofit the front fa\u00e7ade of a multistory building in Sydney. The microalgae closed PBR system comprised a set of 0.1 m diameter tubes, separated from each other by 0.05 m, and located 0.5 m from the fa\u00e7ade. The tubes were connected to an anaerobic digester, which was placed in the basement, to produce biogas from the microalgae biomass. Wastewater from the building was also pumped to this digester for purification by the removal of pathogens. For a PBR area of 1500 m 2 , the system was expected to produce 28.5 kg/day of microalgae biomass, with an energy demand of 2.4 kWh m \u22123 day \u22121 . Thus, this microalgal PBR system could be integrated with the other functions in the building. During their growth, the microalgae biofixed carbon, and the produced biomass was able to be used to generate bioenergy (e.g., cogeneration of electricity and heat from biogas obtained by microalgae biomass via anaerobic digestion) or as fertilizer for agriculture. Microalgae were also able to be used to treat the wastewater generated in the building, using the chemical and biological content of the wastewater as nutrients for their growth. Thus, this water was recycled (e.g., for flushing toilets or for irrigation of the surrounding gardens), reducing the building annual water consumption by 25% (13,704 m 3 ) . In this study, the PV panels were identified as being more feasible (with a shorter payback time) than the PBR system, which would only become economically preferable to the PV system after a useful lifetime of over 36 years. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that the microalgae technology (closed tubular photobioreactors) had more environmental benefits than the solar PVs, given the local challenge of addressing water scarcity, and reducing air pollution and carbon emissions.",

Examples of biotechnological strategies for indoor air purification that can be engineered in multiple configurations, with their principal operational characteristics, are presented in Figure 4 [15] . As suggested by Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00edn et al. [15] , the active biotechnological systems shown in Figure 4 , such as bioscrubbers, biotrickling, biofilters, membrane bioreactors, and microalgae photobioreactors, can more effectively remove VOCs and PM from indoor environments than passive systems, such as indoor plant pots. Because passive systems depend on the diffusion of polluting gases, they usually operate slowly and at lower concentrations. In contrast, active systems increase the availability of polluting gases by incorporating mechanical ventilation devices; thus, air-cleaning rates may be significantly higher [52] . In addition to air purification, these botanical systems also have other benefits, due to plants' evapotranspiration, including reduction of the temperature around the plants. Plants can help to cool the air and control humidity (an air moisture content in the range of 30-70% is generally recommended for comfort). Additionally, they can act as an acoustic insulator [52] . In plant-based biotrickling filters, the polluted air is forced to flow through the aerial parts and roots of hydroponic plants, which are fixed on an inert material (e.g., ceramics or plastic resins). A nutrient solution is continuously trickled down over the packing, thus maximizing the removal of pollutants. In bioscrubbers, the air is forced through an aqueous phase, to which the air pollutants are transferred, thus cleaning the air. Then, the aqueous phase is transferred to a bioreactor in which the pollutants are biodegraded. In biofilters, polluted air passes through a porous, moist material that supports microbial growth; this is commonly an organic material such as compost. The growth medium is generally a natural material that is biodegradable and provides the nutrients necessary for the microorganisms' growth. Membrane bioreactors can also be used to remove VOCs at high concentrations in the air [15, 52] . Most of these biofiltration technologies are well established and have proven themselves in industrial applications for air pollution control. These systems have demonstrated good performance and reliability, and low operating costs; for example, removal efficiencies greater than 95% in residences in times of less than 95 s were achieved for a wide range of pollutants [15] .",

In airborne diseases, such as COVID-19, the air is the medium by which viruses are transported and transmitted between people, in the form of aerosols and fine particles. As a result, it is well known that indoor spaces must be ventilated, and that indoor air must be treated, to prevent infection. The ventilation of indoor spaces is a common procedure used in buildings to provide thermal comfort and high-quality indoor air. This is traditionally undertaken by recycling most of the indoor air to prevent an additional energy load in the heating or cooling of the atmospheric air from outdoors. By comparison, new strategies involve the elimination of recirculation and the intensification of filtration. Both of these processes entail a higher energy demand and, consequently, higher costs, at the financial and environmental levels. Thus, it is important to consider new alternatives to ensure healthy indoor air at a reduced cost and a high energy efficiency. This article aims to highlight the potential of using microalgae systems to clean indoor air in buildings, based on the circular economy concept of reducing the use of resources and maximizing their benefits. The presented literature review discusses the related previous research, and the advantages and limitations of these microalgae systems are identified. It can be hypothesized that buildings equipped with microalgae systems may improve positive social, environmental, and economic impacts. Microalgae \"living labs\" are expected to provide important knowledge regarding the responses of cities and the specific solutions to address the challenges of climate change. More studies are necessary to refine these systems and overcome the existing problems.",

A microalgae PBR system is a promising alternative for improving the quality of indoor air. However, for practical and economic reasons, the design of the PBR system must be economically viable, particularly when compared with existing indoor air purifications systems. Such a comparison must consider the ease of maintenance, cleaning, and operation. In addition, the PBR system must be built with lightweight and durable materials to enable it to withstand the external environment. Furthermore, the optimal microalgae species or consortia still need to be specified, according to the local climatic and application-specific conditions. These aspects should be addressed in future R&D programs and projects, to further highlight the potential of microalgae-based systems for indoor air purification. ",
