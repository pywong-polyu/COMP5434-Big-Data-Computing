We report the case of an 18-year-old medically free female with progressive bruising of the upper and lower extremities for 1 week, beginning 3 days after the first dose of AstraZeneca. Laboratory results showed severe thrombocytopenia of 4.3 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L with a normal white blood cell count, renal profile, and hemolytic markers. She was treated conservatively with high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, which resulted in a full recovery of her platelet count.

            "text": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (COVID- 19) pandemic has prompted world scientists to develop and produce vaccines at the fastest pace, as vaccination is considered the most meaningful method to counter the ongoing pandemic. [1] [2] [3] As a result, four vaccines the mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer (BTN162b2/Comirnaty; EMA: 21. 12.20) and Moderna (mRNA-1273/Spikevax; EMA: 6.1.21), as well as the adenoviral vector-based vaccines from AstraZeneca (AZD1222/ChAdOx1S/Vaxzevria; EMA: 29.1.21) and Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S; EMA: 11.3.21) have received conditional market authorizations by the regulatory bodies. 3 All four vaccines encode different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which mediates virus binding to the host cell membrane and entry through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), respectively. 3, 4 AstraZeneca was recommended to be administered in two doses with an interval of 4-12 weeks between both doses. 5 However, as with any vaccine or drug, side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine such as AstraZeneca were also reported. [1] [2] [3] Thus, starting in March 2021, 5-20 days after AstraZeneca vaccination, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), internal vein thrombosis, and other unusual severe thrombotic events associated with thrombocytopenia have been reported in healthy individuals. [6] [7] [8] As of 4 April 2021, 169 cases of CVST have been reported, and 53 cases of internal vein thrombosis among approximately 34 million people vaccinated in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom. 9,10 After the first CVST cases, immediately suspended the AZD1222/Vaxzevria vaccination campaign in Denmark, Thailand, Ireland, Germany, Italy, France, and Spain. [6] [7] [8] In most of these cases, thrombocytopenia was associated with rare thromboembolism of the cerebral venous sinuses, which resulted in the death of onethird of the affected vaccinated persons in Germany. In addition, cases of CVST and some cases of internal vein thrombosis (superficial vein thrombosis (SVT)) have been reported in the EU drug safety database and the United Kingdom. However, the EMA considered the AstraZeneca vaccine to be effective as a preventive measure when the overall benefits of the vaccine outweigh the disadvantages. In addition, the German STIKO has suggested that the AstraZeneca vaccine should only be administered to people over 60 years of age since most cases in Germany affect women between the ages of 20 and 60 years. [6] [7] [8] Although there are numerous hypotheses and investigations on the mechanism of side effects caused by the AstraZeneca vaccine, including thrombocytopenia, this issue has become the subject of ongoing research due to controversial arguments such as errors in the concept and design of the spike protein antigen. This report from Saudi Arabia presents the case of a young female who developed severe thrombocytopenia after the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.",

Acute secondary immune thrombocytopenia is defined as a drop in platelet count below normal levels within 3 months of exposure to a trigger such as a viral infection, vaccination, or certain medications. 11, 12 Vaccines-induced thrombocytopenia could be explained by antigen-mediated response or due to the effects of the vaccine's formers like adjuvants, yeast proteins, and preservatives diluents. 2, 3, 13 In the case of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, an autoantibody against glycoproteins expressed on the platelet surface causes either opsonization, activation of the complements, or apoptotic effects. However, in the absence of the positive antiplatelet antibody, immune thrombocytopenia cannot be excluded as there was a hypothesis of T-cell immune-mediated mechanism that typically induces thrombocytopenia by increased production of cytokines chemokines. 2,3,13 The influence of age, gender, previous autoimmunity, and vaccine type on the development of vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia was also examined. Reports suggest a predominance of women under 60 years of age and a 12% overlap with other autoimmune diseases. 13, 14 Data available in the literature have shown that most vaccines can cause immune thrombocytopenia, such as influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, polio vaccine, hepatitis B virus vaccine, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), and varicella vaccine. 13, 14 In general, vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare but clinically serious and potentially life-threatening adverse event that has been observed with Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as well as Oxford-AstraZeneca adenoviral (ChAdOx1) vector-based COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222). 7,10 However, the severity and frequency of thrombocytopenia were higher among those vaccinated with AstraZeneca than other types. Recent studies have demonstrated high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) in affected individuals without prior exposure to heparin. As a result, immunoglobulin G (IgG) PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has become central to the diagnostic algorithms of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). [15] [16] [17] It has been suggested that after vaccination, the immune system will stimulate the formation of antibodies against platelet antigens, which will cause immune-mediated destruction of platelets due to massive platelet activation against PF4 or due to a cross-reaction between the vaccine and platelets or PF4. However, the pathophysiology of VITT remains a subject of ongoing research. 10, 18, 19 Thus, this hypothesis contradicts the current case as there was no thrombosis on admission. Instead, there was bleeding and severe thrombocytopenia. In this case, the patient developed new immune thrombocytopenia after receiving her first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In addition, her age at presentation was lower than in other studies. Therefore, a girl might benefit from other vaccines for the second dose, compared to no second dose at all. However, it was considered that in this case, other COVID-19 vaccines could also cause severe thrombocytopenia without a specific indicator of such a complication.",

However, mixing of COVID-19 vaccines has been allowed for people over the age of 18 years who will receive a third (booster) dose. 20 There are many studies on the effects of vaccines, including side effects; there is a lack of research on the benefits of switching the type of COVID-19 vaccine for specific complications such as severe thrombocytopenia. Although, in general, vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) or thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been widely reported as a serious side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine, severe immune response thrombocytopenia is also critical and possibly occurs at the stage preceding thrombosis.",
