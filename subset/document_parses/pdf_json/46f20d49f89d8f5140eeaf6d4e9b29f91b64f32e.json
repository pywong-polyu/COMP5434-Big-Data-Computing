Internet of Things (IoT) has a vital role in the smart city for vaccine manufacturing with wearable sensors. According to the advanced services in intelligent manufacturing, the fourth resolution is also changing in Industry 5.0 and utilizes high-definition connectivity sensors. Traditional manufacturing companies rely on trusted third parties, which may act as a single point of failure. Access control, big data, and scalability are also challenging issues in existing systems because of the demand response data (DRD) in advanced manufacturing. To mitigate these challenges, CoVAC: A P2P Smart Contract-based Intelligent Smart City Architecture for Vaccine Manufacturing is proposed with three layers, including connection, conversion, and intelligent cloud layer. Smart contract-based blockchain is utilized at the conversion layer for resolving access control, security, and privacy issues. Deep learning is adopted in the intelligent cloud layer for big data analysis and increasing production for vaccine manufacturing in smart city environments. A case study is carried out wherein access data are collected from the various smart plants for vaccines using smart manufacturing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Simulation of the proposed architecture is performed on the collected advanced sensor IoT plants data to address the challenges above, offering scalable production in the vaccine manufacturing for the smart city.",

It provides the best solutions, including preserving resources, more production, high connectivity in smart manufacturing with advanced sensors, actuators, and IoT devices (You, Hwang, Kim, & Cho, 2021) . CPS and Artificial Intelligence work with various vaccine manufacturing companies to deliver high-level connectivity in designing techniques, analysis, and modeling with cyberspace in advanced industrial environments (Baig & Zeadally, 2019) . Still, there are many challenges in the IoT environment, particularly in smart city applications such as smart healthcare and Smart Manufacturing, such as big data, centralization, scalability, communication latency, access control, security, and privacy. The growing number of IoT wearable sensors in Industry 5.0 enhanced vulnerability such as Cyber-attacks and Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) in Smart healthcare for the In traditional IoT applications, the Role-based access control model (RBAC), Attribute and Capacity-based access control model (ACBAC) is validated by a third-party centralized entity that has centralization issues. Blockchain (Smart Contract) is an emerging and significant technology for providing security and privacy in Smart Healthcare because it has various immutable, authentic, tamper-proof, and transparent features (Chou, Liao, Chen, Chang, & Lin, 2019) . In addition, smart Controlbased Access Control is used in the proposed architecture for vaccine manufacturing and addresses the single point of failure challenge. On the other hand, Deep learning technology focuses on data science to enhance performance and big data analysis and produce many scalable vaccines in COVID-19 manufacturing companies with hidden layers . It gives the automatic environment, including selfverification, self-executing the vaccine in the COVID-19 healthcare system for Smart City. Deep Learning is the latest and fruitful technology, which offers scalable production in vaccine manufacturing for the smart city with the help of hidden layer functionalities and max-pooling LSTM (Long-short term memory) (Selvaraj & Sundaravaradhan, 2020) . With the help of Max Pooling LSTM in the proposed architecture for smart vaccine manufacturing, the computational cost is reduced by the number of parameters to learn, and LSTM feature vector sets of each production are evaluated with intervention codes and time variance. Max Pool Matrix is created, and the Max Pooling function is defined.",

These studies have some merits and demerits. Recently, Chamola et al.

Nonetheless, they did not offer any architectural scheme for vaccine manufacturing in IoT. Saini et al. (Saini et al., 2020) proposed a smart contract-enabled access control scheme for cloud smart healthcare systems to secure communication of electronic medical records with the distributed ledger. However, this research did not entirely resolve the latency and scalability problem in processing and fetching the EMR for the smart healthcare system. The machine learning-based scheme proposed by Kumar et al. (Kumar, Solanki, & Tanwar, 2021) for in Human Bodies provides a list of datasets and solutions for predicting the stage of infection with COVID-19. However, this research did not deal with the vaccine manufacturing details for use in the proposed scheme. Peng et al. (Peng et al., 2020) provided a supervision method for vaccine production which is dependent on double-level blockchain. The first level offers the security for private vaccine-related production data with production and corresponding hash value. The second level also offers a secured environment for public vaccine-related production data with production records hash and vaccine information.

CAC also has the authority to add, delete, and update access control protocol rules. \u2022 Data Decentralization: Based on the traditional manufacturing companies, all are dependent on the third parties, then a single point of failure or centralization issue is faced by the manufacturing companies. However, blockchain technology is used for the proposed architecture, and no need for a third party to address this issue. After the validation, all vaccine-related data is stored at the intelligent cloud layer, and decision making, data analysis, and scalable vaccine production is completed. \u2022 Big Data Analysis: Smart manufacturing use IoT and sensor devices, and every IoT device generates some data. So, a massive amount of data is generated for smart manufacturing in smart city infrastructure. For Big data analysis and decision making at the intelligent cloud layer, we apply deep learning technology in which hidden layers analyze the data for vaccine manufacturing and predict more outputs. \u2022 Production Scalability: Scalable production is also an essential need for every manufacturing company. For the scalability of the COVID- 19 vaccine manufacturing, Max Pooling LSTM-based Deep learning is used at the intelligent cloud layer in the proposed architecture and offers the scalable production of COVID-19 vaccines with the help of hidden layers analysis functionality. \u2022 Security and Privacy: One of the fundamental vital considerations is security and privacy. Therefore, it is the primary requirement for smart city applications, including smart factories, smart parking, intelligent automotive industry, and many more.

These plants automatically collect the raw IoT data for vaccine manufacturing, including temperature, electricity, pressure, vibration, light, rotational speed, torque, force, and others from various IoT devices and sensors. The blockchain concept (Smart Contract) is adopted at the conversion layer wherein contract registration (CR), contract manager (CM), and contract access control (CAC) are acquired for secure communication in a distributed network. Each CAC provides the access control procedure for plant-device combination, which implements static and dynamic validation protocols by checking the plants' behavior. CAC also has the authority to add, delete, and update access control rules and policies. CM provides a hacking behavior method for facilitating dynamic validation. CM receives hacking reports from CAC and punishes the perpetrator after checking the hacking release report.

            "text": "Widely used in access control with secure communication dependent on the role of IoT data in various applications such as smart healthcare, smart hospital, and others, access control is one of the most popular processes for retrieving IoT data such as RBAC-SC (Role-based Access Control-Smart Contract) (Cruz, Kaji, & Yanai, 2018) , which has been proposed. As a smart contract-based method presented for the trans- organizational utilization of roles with users in IoT applications, it declares the user role and checks the information, user challenges, and response by users. For increasing the Smart factory vaccine production, LSTM DAAS (Long Short-Term Memory Deep learning as a Service) (Singh, Jeong, & Park, 2020) is an elementary method. It has been utilized in disease prediction in healthcare. Thus, we use the RBAC-SC and LSTM DAAS methods as an estimation algorithm in our proposed intelligent smart city architecture. We present a case study for validating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. This case study is related to the vaccine factory for smart production. It has three plants for Water, Electricity, and Gas. All plants access the data from IoT and advanced wearable sensor devices such as temperature, light, proximity, humidity, passive infrared, actuators, and quality meter. Every plant has a smart pipe for valuable data value. This case study's main objective is to find the amount of generated data with better communication and computational cost and energy consumption value from every plant. We can connect LSTM DAAS in the application layer for increasing production in a Smart vaccine company. With the help of deep learning, the company can deploy the system to perform visualization and generate a computerized report for the entire production of a vaccine production facility in the Smart City Environment.",
