We found green spaces at the county level have a significant negative association with infection rates. Among all types of green spaces, forest yields the most consistent and strongest negative association. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the negative association of forest across five urbanicity levels, and the strength of the association increases as disease incidence increases across five time periods. Although forest located in moderately urbanized counties yields the strongest association, the negative pattern of significant associations holds across all five urbanicity levels. A population-weighted analysis revealed that proximity to forest within a moderate walking distance (\u2264 1.0-1.4 km) may provide the greatest protection against the risk of infection. : medRxiv preprint 8 investigate the temporal association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and green spaces.

A variety of studies have investigated the risk of infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, from medical, social, economic, demographic, and architectural perspectives (Badr et al., 2020; Carteni et al., 2020; Mena et al., 2021; Muller et al., 2021) . There is growing evidence that we have overlooked the salutary impact that nearby green spaces may have for lowering the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. The cost of this oversight is that we continue to create and manage built landscapes that increase the risk of infection to SARS-CoV-2 today, and that we fail to learn the extent to which land use patterns might alleviate the spread of this and other airborne infectious diseases.",

            "text": "The relationship between green spaces and public health is a rapidly growing field of research. In recent decades, several studies have reported on the multiple health benefits of green space exposure. The relationship between green space exposure and health outcomes has been measured at national (e.g., Lu, Chen, et al., 2021; Mitchell & Popham, 2008; Nowak et al., 2014) , city (e.g., Donovan et al., 2011; Melis et al., 2015) , and community/site (e.g., Chang et al., 2021; scales. Green spaces, especially those in close proximity, can affect three main categories of health outcomes: mental (Jiang et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2018) , physical Lu, 2018; Mitchell & Popham, 2008) , and social (Helbich et al., 2020; Holtan et al., 2014) . The effects of green spaces on such health outcomes are complex and interdependent (Jiang, Zhang, et al., 2015; Sullivan & Bartlett, 2005) . For example, green spaces can significantly reduce mental stress and fatigue, which positively influences immune function and promotes physical health (Kuo, 2015; Li et al., 2010; Parsons et al., 1998) . Exposure to green spaces can also promote social cohesion and can improve physical activity levels and perceived safety. Green spaces, especially forest, can decrease air pollutants, provide pleasant visual and acoustic experiences, and create a comfortable microclimate. These critical ecological functions encourage outdoor physical activities, further enhancing mental and social health (Nowak et al., 2014; Ouyang et al., 2020; Power et al., 2015) . Overall, it is widely recognized that green spaces, whether in urban or rural areas, have a significant positive effect on human health.",

Two studies have attempted to investigate this relationship, however the findings were inconclusive. One study examined the 135 most urbanized counties in the contiguous United States, and found that a higher ratio of green spaces was significantly associated with a lower racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates at the county level (Lu, Chen, et al., 2021) . However, this study did not determine the association between the supply of green spaces and the general population's infection rate across all counties in U.S., which have varying levels of urbanicity and population densities. Additionally, the infection data used in the study spanned a relatively short time period (from January to June, 2020), and excluded the moderate and peak periods of infection (from August to December, 2020).",

The ratio of each type of land cover was calculated as the area of the land cover within the county divided by the total county land area. We also calculated population-weighted forest exposure for varying buffer distances in each county to identify an optimal distance from forest, a factor that may be critical for determining the infection rate.

The growth of \u03b2 and incremental R 2 remained small and stable as the buffer distance increases ( Fig. 10 and Table S7 ). The curves for both \u03b2 and incremental R 2 plateau with a slight positive slope. Nevertheless, compared to forest falling within the 5-km walking range, we found that forest further afield is also related to infection rates, although the association is relatively minor. Using 50-km and 1.0-km distances for comparison, \u03b2 values are \u22120.290 and \u22120.273, respectively, suggesting a 6.2% increase in the effect. Similarly, the adjusted R 2 values are 0.036 and 0.033, respectively, suggesting a 9.1% increase in the effect. The proportion of the changes in \u03b2 and adjusted R 2 values accounted for by forest within 50 km relative to all forest in the county were 95.1% and 87.8%, respectively. All rights reserved.

Green spaces, especially those with sufficient recreational opportunities and supporting facilities, can be regarded as a \"socio-pedal\", in that they encourage people to leave indoor environments and participate in outdoor activities (Lu, Chen, et al., 2021; Lu, Zhao, et al., 2021; Schipperijn et al., 2013) . One study reported that public spaces with more green landscapes can attract 90% more users than architecturally similar but barren public spaces (Sullivan et al., 2004) . Similar findings have been reported by other studies (Chen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016) .

Green spaces not only invite people visit the outdoors more frequently (Coley, et al., 1997) , but also seem to encourage them stay outdoors longer, reducing their time spent indoors (Braubach et al., 2017; Coley et al., 1997; Grahn & Stigsdotter, 2003) .

This is achieved through increased deposition rates of particulate matter on plant surfaces and/or the absorption of gaseous pollutants through leaf stomata (Janh\u00e4ll, 2015; Kumar et al., 2019; Nowak et al., 2006; Nowak et al., 2014; Nowak et al., 2013; Nowak et al., 2018) . These effects are not limited to forest found in urban areas, as forest in rural areas has been reported to also contribute to human health (Nowak et al., 2014) . By inhibiting two major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., particles and aerosols, green spaces can reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection risk (Bourouiba, 2020) . Another reason for this effect may be related to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) in the respiratory tract, a known receptor for coronaviruses. ACE-2 is overexpressed in individuals who are exposed ambient pollutants on a daily basis, especially nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and 2.5-\u00b5m-and 10-\u00b5m-diameter particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) (Fattorini & Regoli, 2020; Paital & Agrawal, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) .",

Second, SARS-CoV-2 testing was highly inconsistent among counties and cases of infection were substantially underestimated in some areas during the early stage (Angulo et al., 2021) , thus the numbers of confirmed cases of infection in the early periods are less reliable than those in the later periods.",

The significant health benefits of nearby forest and other green spaces have been consistently reported (e.g., Corraliza & Collado, 2011; Cox et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Oh et al., 2017) . The construction and conservation of nearby forest is particularly valuable when a county has limited financial and human resources, due to the potential alleviation of burdens of healthcare systems. Additionally, forest beyond walking distance also appears to alleviate infection risks, potentially by reducing ambient pollutants at a regional scale (Escobedo & Nowak, 2009; Nowak et al., 2018) .",
