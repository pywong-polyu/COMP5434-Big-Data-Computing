In contrast, anti-spike-specific IgG antibody levels averaged 2,190 U/ml in 14 healthy SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve individuals (avg. 58 yrs.) ten weeks after the second dose of BNT162b. RNA-seq conducted on PBMCs demonstrated the activation of interferon-activated genetic programs in both cohorts within one day. Unlike their transient induction in the younger na\u00efve population, persistent activity and the initiation of additional cell cycle regulated programs were obtained in the older COVID-19 recovered population. Here we show that the elderly, a high-risk population, can mount a strong antibody and a persistent molecular immune response upon receiving a single dose of mRNA vaccine 15 months after recovery from COVID-19.",

While optimal increases in antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2 antigen-na\u00efve individuals requires two mRNA vaccine doses, individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection have naturally acquired immunity and a single dose of vaccine is likely sufficient to boost antibody responses [10] [11] [12] . Yet, these studies have been conducted on younger cohorts, mainly health care workers, and the immune response of elderly COVID-19 recovered individuals (> 70 years) to a single dose of mRNA vaccines remains to be understood.",

All elderly COVID-19 recovered individuals had levels of anti-spike IgG ranging from 34 U/ml to >2,500 U/ml (average 706 U/ml) at 10 months after developing COVID-19 ( Table 5 ) and 652 genes were activated between day 1 and day 7 (Supplementary Table   6 ). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that the genes activated within Table 9 ). As expected, the genes activated at day 1 were part of interferon and cytokine pathways ( Supplementary Fig. 2d ). We also investigated the immune transcriptomes prior to and after the primary vaccination of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-na\u00efve group and very few induced genes related to chemokine and cytokine signaling were identified (Supplementary Table 10 ; Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

This demonstrates an approximately 20-fold elevated response in the elderly, previously infected cohort. Transcriptome response of COVID-19 recovered and SARS-CoV-2 antigen-na\u00efve individuals The exceptional response of the COVID-19 recovered individuals to the booster vaccination promoted us to investigate the molecular innate immune response. We directly compared immune transcriptomes induced by BNT162b vaccination in the COVID-19 recovered cohort and the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-na\u00efve population (SupplementaryTables 4-13). We performed bulk mRNA-seq of PBMCs isolated from the COVID-19 recovered individuals prior to the primary (booster) vaccination and after one and seven days(Fig. 1a).

In contrast, out of the 173 genes induced in the na\u00efve population at day 1, only five genes (IFI44, IFI44L, RSAD2, IFIT1 and GBP1P1) were expressed at elevated levels at day 7 (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Table 12). These findings indicate a prolonged vaccine-induced transcriptomic response in COVID-19 recovered individuals. A direct comparison of genes induced in both groups at day 1 post vaccination identified 58 immune relevant genes shared between the COVID-19 recovered and SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve population (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Table 13; Supplementary Fig. 4).

            "text": "BNT162b elicits a strong immune response in an elderly population vaccinated 15 months after recovering from COVID-19. Aging is associated with a decline of the immune system, commonly referred to as immunosenescence, and increased chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, also referred to as inflammaging17 , both coupled with a poor vaccine response 8 . However, our data demonstrate that the immune response to BNT162b in an elderly population (avg. 81 yrs.) previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 exceeds that of a younger SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve cohort (avg. 59 yrs.) receiving the twodose regimen.The optimal window for providing the booster vaccine to individuals recovered from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been defined and might be agedependent. Recent studies have investigated the immune response in younger populations recovered from COVID-1910,11,[18][19][20] . In general, the immune responses, including spike-specific IgG antibody levels, in individuals younger than 50 years having received booster doses within one to six months after the original SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar to those seen after two doses of vaccine in individuals of similar age without prior infection10,11,18,21 . A large scale clinical study provided evidence that natural immune protection that develops after a SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by a singlebooster vaccination provides considerably more protection against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant than two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals 20 . It is still not clear if one or two boosters are indicated for previously infected individuals and different countries are advocating different approaches with some dictating one booster and others two. Although one booster vaccination appears to result in a solid immune response in COVID-19 recovered individuals, studies with two boosters are emerging 21 . Third booster vaccinations are now available for SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/boostershot.html) and its effectiveness in reducing transmission and severe disease was demonstrated in individuals 60 years and older who had been fully vaccinated the twodose regimen at least five months previously 17 . Longitudinal antibody measurements in our elderly cohort will provide a better understanding on the need and timing of a second booster dose in this vulnerable population. Our study shows a strong, prolonged immune response in the COVID-19 recovered elderly that have received one booster vaccination, greatly exceeding that seen after the booster vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals. This is seen both in generation of antibody and in transcriptomes. Exploring the genomic immune responses after vaccination through RNA-seq approaches can identify transcriptional signatures associated with effective antibody production but published data is limited to younger age individuals (avg 39 yr.) 13,16 Sequencing depth is a consideration for interpretation of such studies. Both ours and the study conducted in younger individuals 16 focused on the response to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The younger age study 16 , using an average sequencing depth of approximately 38 million reads per sample, was sufficient for identifying antiviral and interferon signatures, but could not identify significant differences in gene signatures. In contrast, our study, utilizing a minimum of 240 million reads for each sample, was able to identify the specific gene signatures that underlie viral and interferon response. This enabled us to characterize a temporally extended and expanded genetic responses induced by a single BNT162b vaccine in the elderly with prior COVID 19 infection and extend knowledge on the response of SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals after the second vaccination.",
