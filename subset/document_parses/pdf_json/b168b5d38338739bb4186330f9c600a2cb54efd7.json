Sustained demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing has accelerated the development and deployment of multiple competing testing technologies, sample types, and approaches. (2, 3) Rapid diagnostic tests that use a lateral flow assay (LFA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen offer scale, convenience, and potential for home use but suffer from reduced sensitivity compared to nucleic acid tests (NAT). (4) In early symptomatic disease -within 5 days of symptom onset -infected persons are likely to have high viral loads such that both antigen and molecular tests are likely to perform well. For individuals who are close contacts,(5) the viral burden of the index case has been associated with risk of transmission. (6) However, in the pre-symptomatic phase when viral burdens are still low,(7) false negative antigen tests can occur. A recent study from the Netherlands in close contacts showed that only 64% of SARS-CoV-2 molecular test positive close contacts were identified by antigen testing; antigen test sensitivity was as low as 58.7% and 84.2% in symptomatic individuals. (8) We sought to evaluate the performance of molecular and antigen testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed individuals. We also sought to assess the sensitivity of both molecular and antigen tests in nasal swabs and molecular tests in saliva to diagnose close contacts with infectious virus in NP swab viral transport media (VTM) using the VeroE6TMPRS2 cell model.",

Another source of missed positives were samples that tested positive in saliva but not NP samples. Similar to prior work, saliva was not more or less sensitive than NP, but it did identify a population of SARS-CoV-2 cases that was only partially overlapping with those found using NP samples. (21) (22) (23) If testing resources were not scarce, a strategy of performing high sensitivity NAT on both saliva and NP specimens may be considered to exclude infection in patients with the highest pretest probability for infection.",

            "text": "Although antigen testing identified the majority of culture-positive contacts, a few patients with culture-positive SARS-CoV-2 were missed. It is expected that antigen testing will miss a proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cases, particularly those with lower viral burden (identified by higher Ct values) particularly among asymptomatic individuals; a recent meta-analysis reported a sensitivity of 58.1% (95% CI 40.2% to 74.1%), (24) and more focused studies including asymptomatic close contacts reported a sensitivity of 59-82% compared to NAT. (25, 26) However, the hope has been that persons with potential to transmit SARS-CoV-2 may be excluded, at least in the moment, by a negative antigen test. (27) (28) (29) Used as intended, in the first 5 days of symptom onset, only one patient with culture-positive SARS-CoV-2 tested negative by antigen testing, but two asymptomatic patients who tested negative by antigen tests had positive cultures. Recent data from our group and others has shown that serial testing may be a strategy to overcome the lack of sensitivity in pre-symptomatic patients. (23, 30) Daily antigen testing is now being used by some school systems to forego quarantine after exposure. (31, 32) False negative SARS-CoV-2 test results for asymptomatic close contacts may provide false reassurance, leading to relaxation of isolation measures and greater onward transmission. Our findings suggest that for asymptomatic close contacts with a high pretest probability for infection, testing at a single time point with a standard reference NAT misses some cases and negative antigen testing does not exclude transmissibility. SARS-CoV-2 exposures that are to household members, indoors, and prolonged pose a higher risk of transmission(33) which may warrant additional vigilance including repeat testing for close contacts with high pretest probability for infection. Newer SARS-CoV-2 variants including delta and omicron have higher capacity for transmission than earlier circulating genotypes. (34, 35) Therefore, the consequences for each false negative test on community transmission may be greater now that currently circulating variants are more transmissible than earlier circulating SARS-CoV-2.",

(25, 36) Similarly, differences in the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 test platforms may impact the results if this study were to be replicated using alternative SARS-CoV-2 NAT. Performance of the antigen tests was not performed as intended at the point of collection, which could reduce their sensitivity. Most of the positive cases were from unvaccinated persons prior to circulation of delta and omicron variants -as more vaccinated persons test positive for COVID, new data regarding the relationship between pretest probability of infection, test performance characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 variant, and culture positivity may be required. Data regarding timing of participant exposure to an individual with COVID was not available, which limits the ability to identify subgroups of close contacts with better or worse test performance.

Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission with increasingly contagious variants highlights the continued importance of widespread and accurate testing even as the pandemic approaches its third year. Our findings in a large cohort of close contacts demonstrate the limitations of crosssectional antigen testing to exclude transmissibility, and standard NAT to diagnose COVID-19. Close contacts of individuals with COVID-19 should isolate and may need to test more than once, especially those with the highest risk exposures such as household contacts. Future work is necessary to improve test performance characteristics or implement serial testing to identify patients with SARS-CoV-2 when they are most likely to have transmissible disease.",

Remnant frozen NP swab VTM for 158 of the 182 SARS-CoV-2 close contacts who tested negative by the reference test was retested by PerkinElmer RT-PCR and positive for 13 (8%) samples with a median cycle threshold (Ct) of 36.8 (IQR 36.0-38.6). Saliva testing using PerkinElmer RT-PCR was performed for 186 (79%) close contacts, including 143 of 182 (79%) reference test negative participants. Saliva was positive for 37 of 43 (86%) reference positive participants and 17 of 143 (12%) reference negative participants. Combined, PerkinElmer RT-PCR of NP and saliva samples identified SARS-CoV-2 in an additional 21 asymptomatic close contacts and 7 symptomatic close contacts not identified by the NP reference test. The median Ct value of symptomatic close contacts was lower than asymptomatic close contacts for both NP (22.0, IQR 17.7-28.5 vs 34.8, IQR 31.4-36.9) and saliva (25.8, IQR 22.5-31.5 vs 33.4, IQR 26.5-36.7) samples.
