Here we describe a human embryo model (blastoid) generated by self-organization. Brief induction of trophectoderm leads to formation of blastocyst-like structures within 3 days. Blastoids are composed of three tissue layers displaying exclusive lineage markers, mimicking the natural blastocyst. Single-cell transcriptome analyses confirm segregation of trophectoderm, hypoblast, and epiblast with high fidelity to the human embryo. This versatile and scalable system provides a robust experimental model for human embryo research. (2018). Single cell transcriptome analysis of human, marmoset and mouse embryos reveals common and divergent features of preimplantation development.",

Scientists have therefore relied heavily on observations and experiments in other mammals, in particular mice. However, although embryology unfolds according to a similar overall program in all mammals, there are many distinctions between species. Even the first morphogenetic process-formation of the blastocyst-is regulated differently in human and mouse (Guo et al., 2021; Roode et al., 2012; Rossant, 2018) . The blastocyst is a landmark of eutherian development that is essential for uterine implantation. Blastocyst formation initiates with delamination of epithelial trophectoderm cells on the surface of the unspecified morula. The trophectoderm forms a fluid-filled cavity and the internal inner cell mass (ICM) cells differentiate into two further lineages, epiblast and hypoblast (also known as primitive endoderm). The mature blastocyst formed by embryonic day 6 (E6) in human is a simple cavitated structure comprising three topologically and molecularly segregated lineages, each of which is critical for further development.",

Trophectoderm differentiation is initiated by inhibition of ERK and NODAL signaling using small molecules PD0325901 and A83-01 (PD+A83). We also observed that treatment with PD+A83 in suspension resulted in appearance of epithelial cysts expressing the trophectoderm reporter GATA3:mKO2. We noticed that cysts often contained inner cells that were initially mKO2 negative but became positive upon continued exposure to PD+A83. These findings suggested the possibility of generating blastocyst-like structures from naive stem cells by modulating PD+A83 treatment.",

GATA3 protein was readily detected from day 2 and localized in the outer layer together with the epithelial protein keratin 18 (CK18). On day 3, GATA3 was prominent in nuclei of all outer cells and absent from inside cells. In contrast, epiblast markers KLF17, NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 that are ubiquitous in naive pluripotent cells (Bredenkamp et al., 2019b) were confined to inner cells by day 3. Expression of trophectoderm and epiblast markers was generally exclusive, as observed in the human mature blastocyst. Notably the core pluripotency factor OCT4 was restricted to inner cells that were all GATA3 negative. OCT4 can be detected in trophectoderm in the early human blastocyst (E5), but it is confined to the ICM by the fully expanded E6 blastocyst (Deglincerti et al., 2016; Niakan and Eggan, 2013; Shahbazi et al., 2016) . TFAP2C (AP2g) is known as a trophoblast marker in mouse but in human is also expressed in naive epiblast and naive stem cells (Pastor et al., 2018) . We detected moderate expression of TFAP2C in inner cells with upregulation in the outer epithelium. Presence of KLF17 in inner cells indicated that they remain in the pre-implantation stage of naive pluripotency (Blakeley et al., 2015; Boroviak et al., 2015; Rostovskaya et al., 2019) . Finally, barely detectable keratin 7 (CK7) is consistent with pre-implantation trophectoderm in contrast to post-implantation cytotrophoblast (Deglincerti et al., 2016) .",

When transferred to Geltrex-coated dishes, blastoids attached and proliferated to produce large outgrowths of GA-TA3:mKO2-positive cells ( Figure 1H ). Outgrowing cells displayed cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and included regions expressing the syncytiotrophoblast marker human b chorionic gonadotrophin (hCGB) ( Figure 1I ), similar to human blastocyst outgrowths (Deglincerti et al., 2016) . In a portion of the cultures, a compact area of small cells was apparent that expressed the epiblast marker NANOG with adjacent cells expressing GATA4 ( Figures  1I and 1J ). In these regions we detected podocalyxin (PODXL) stained lumen structures (Bedzhov and Zernicka-Goetz, 2014; Shahbazi et al., 2016) , suggestive of emergent yolk sac cavities and amniotic cavities ( Figure 1J ; Video S1). The cavities were bounded by NANOG-positive cells and embedded within extensive trophoblast outgrowths. Conventional hPSCs can self-organize to form lumens and amnion-like cavities (Taniguchi et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2019) . Integration with differentiating trophoblast is therefore necessary to assert progression from the blastoid ICM. Nonetheless, more comprehensive analyses are required to make definitive statements regarding the emergence of these structures and their relationship to development of the bilaminar embryonic disc.",

Mouse embryonic stem cells are developmentally restricted from forming trophectoderm and blastoids are therefore created by combining cells of different lineages (Posfai et al., 2021; Rivron et al., 2018) . In contrast, human naive stem cells can readily be induced into trophectoderm. In cell clusters, the trophectoderm cells form an outer epithelial monolayer that encloses persisting undifferentiated naive cells and initiates polarized ion transport. The resulting fluid uptake leads to formation of an expanded cavity. Induction of trophectoderm with PD+A83 should be limited in duration to preserve a naive inner cell population and allow hypoblast differentiation. Other epithelia can form cystic structures and cavitation alone is not sufficient to assert trophectoderm identity. The GATA3:mKO2 reporter, which is highly expressed in all trophectoderm cells, provides reassurance.",

Nonetheless, a three-dimensional structure of appropriate size and shape is formed in which the three lineages are correctly specified and segregated.

A future prospect is to use the blastoid model to develop improved culture conditions that reliably mimic peri-and early post-implantation embryogenesis.

Only protein coding genes were considered in the analyses. tSNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) plots were computed using variable genes across the dataset under analysis with Rtsne v0.15 (M. Krijthe, 2015) and visualized using ggplot2 in R v4.0.3. The AddModuleScore function from Seurat v4.0 (Stuart et al., 2019) was used to score and color cells according to the expression of signature gene lists for different cell lineages derived from (Petropoulos et al., 2016; Stirparo et al., 2018) . To obtain the signature gene list, FPKM values were used to compute Pearson's correlation coefficients with a binary feature vector for each cell population consisting of values of 1 for the considered cell type and 0 for other cell types. Genes with a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.4 were used as lineage classifiers (Table S1 ). Harmony v1.0 (Korsunsky et al., 2019) was used for batch correction between the embryo and blastoid datasets using the first 50 principle components produced via principal component analysis. ",
