In another study in The Netherlands of children admitted with acute lower respiratory infection, 98 children had IS done. A total 89/98 (91%) had good quality sputum, and bacterial pathogens were isolated from 22/89 (25%) (12) . In India, IS was done in 120 children diagnosed with pneumonia. There was good quality sputum in 64 children (53.3%). Among these, 45/64 (70%) had isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (38.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.8%) and other bacteria (9) . IS procedure in young children hospitalized with diarrheal disease was safe and well tolerated in our study.
