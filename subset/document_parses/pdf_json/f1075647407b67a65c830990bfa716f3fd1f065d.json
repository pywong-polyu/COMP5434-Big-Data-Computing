Studying the impact of COVID-19 on food stockpiling behavior is timely and imperative. It provides additional market information and helps to understand whether the impact is just a short shock or whether it permanently affects consumer behavior. The study aimed to analyze Chinese consumers' food stockpiling behavior during the pandemic and investigate the impact of motivation and risk perception on such behavior. Specific objectives included (1) determining the difference in COVID-19's impact on food stockpiling behavior in eightmonth periods; (2) investigating how motivation and risk perception affect consumer food stockpiling behavior over time; (3) identifying factors that have an impact on consumer stockpiling behavior.",

On the one hand, from China to the US, many people have decreased their consumption, increased their family savings, and delayed investments and major purchases (e.g., automobiles, appliances, and travel) [2] . On the other hand, stockpiling behaviors have been reported in many countries [3] . Food and other household essentials are on the top of consumers' shopping lists in such situations [4] . Consumers' demand for some food items has spiked, because consumers panic about buying essential items for home consumption [5] . Some panic buying was caused by warnings of supply shocks such as meat processing facilities shutting down [6] .",

Consumer expenditure on groceries during the COVID-19 pandemic increased because of the temporary closure of supermarkets and other groceries providers [13] . The change from eating out to eating at home has resulted in shortages and declining inventories of some food products at supermarkets, grocery stores, and convenience stores [14] .

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, stockpiling behavior was observed through excess demand for toilet paper, shelf-stable food items (frozen, canned, and dried foods; snacks; beverages), and cleaning products, which translated into out of stock items at the grocery store [18] . Previous studies show that partisanship, gender, and family all affect these behaviors. Barrios and Hochberg found that partisanship played a significant role in shaping perceptions of the risk of the new pandemic [19] . This study showed several significant differences in categorical responses with Republicans spending more at restaurants and in retail shops, which is consistent with their lower levels of concern about the virus or differential risk exposure. Households with children stockpiled more, and men stockpiled less in the early days as the virus was spreading [20] .",

This resulted in a surge in demand for basic food products such as flour [23] .

The social psychology literature suggests reactance theory as a prominent theory in explaining consumer decision making under conditions of scarcity [28, 29] , which focuses on an individual's reaction to the loss of perceived freedom. Hence, a product's limited availability or perceived scarcity can mean a threat to or loss of personal freedom and, therefore, may trigger psychological reactance that leads to increased attention to the unavailable good. This ultimately increases consumer motivation to obtain the alternative that soon may be inaccessible [30, 31] . Perceived scarcity will lead to a new urgency to purchase among consumers.",

The dependent variable was the change in the food reserves scale, computed as the current food reserves scale minus that before the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering that some respondents may have returned to their old habits, the change in the food reserves scale should be zero, and positive values indicate a lower probability that respondents would return to their pre-pandemic habits. The zero-inflated Poisson regression model is among the preferred estimation techniques applied by researchers to count data with an excess of zeros [37, 38] . Two sets of coefficients are estimated in the ZIP regression: the first is the output from a logistic regression to study the probability of an individual belonging to a zero-group (returning to the old habit), while the second corresponds to the additional days of food stockpiling now compared to that before the COVID-19 pandemic. We tested for over-dispersion using a statistical technique recommended by Cameron and Trivedi [39] and found the data were over-dispersed, so a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model was used to estimate the factors affecting consumers' behavior of returning to their old habits of food stockpiling.",

            "text": "A professional data collection company (www.wjx.cn (accessed on 20 July 2021)) in China was hired to collect data and control the quality. The data collection company has a database of 2.6 million panel members in China. It implements several quality control measures. Firstly, all respondents needed to answer several questions about their basic personal information before entering the sample database. Secondly, at the beginning of the survey, all respondents must correctly answer some basic questions that they have responded to before. Thirdly, the IP address was validated to ensure that only one survey could be taken on one device. Finally, the questionnaire was separated into three parts, and the time spent on each part should not be less than a pre-defined minimum, because \"speeding\" through a survey may affect the quality and reliability of the data. Table 3 gives the demographic statistics. We collected approximately 300-400 responses each time, with a total number of 2099 responses collected from 20 December 2020 to 20 July 2021 (Table 2) . Overall, approximately 53.6% of the survey respondents were female, which is consistent with females being the primary food shoppers in China [41] . Approximately 81.90% of the respondents had a college degree, and 9.81% of the respondents had postgraduate degrees. The median monthly household income was between 12,001 and 16,000, representing the segment with the most purchasing power in China. In addition, more than 61% of the samples had children at home. Our samples can be a good representative of China's growing middle class, which is generally defined by the National Bureau of Statistics as a family of three earning between 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan annually. Figure 2 reports the statistics of respondents' motivations for food stockpiling. Motivations fueled the consumer panic buying and stocking phenomenon [21] . Identifying the changes in the motivations for food stockpiling behavior over time can help governments and food firms to understand and predict the trends in the food stockpiling phenomenon. The results in Figure 2 show that the motivations of \"Fighting against rising food prices\" and \"Avoiding shortage\" kept falling after January 2021. However, the motivation of \"Pursuing ease\" was still great because of the herd effect [1] . Furthermore, the motivation of \"Going out less\" became slightly more important as time went by because vaccinated people could also be infected if they were exposed to the Delta variant. \"Going out less\" became a popular and generally accepted epidemic prevention principle for Chinese consumers. Figure 3 shows that consumers' perceived severity of the pandemic was slightly higher than their perceived risk of infection, fluctuating with waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. The new wave of COVID-19 cases in China's Hebei Province in January 2021 raised consumers' risk perception of COVID-19, which then dropped to a low level. In addition, 70.03% of the respondents believed COVID-19 was highly infectious, but only 0.93% of respondents thought they were at a very high risk of the COVID-19 infection. Although most individuals overestimated the risk of a COVID-19 infection [42] , this figure implies that there is a psychological pitfall of \"the illusion of control\" among Chinese consumers regarding COVID-19. A previous study showed that at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the perceived duration of COVID-19 was just 2.15 months [1] . Figure 4 reports that citizens kept adjusting their expectations, up to approximately 14 months, then jumping to around 20 months. This may be because the Delta variant, which caused more infections and spread faster than the early variants, was dominant across the world1. Figure 5 shows that the scale of food reserves extended from 3.03 to 10.01 days after the outbreak of COVID-19, then dropped to a \"new normal\" plateau which was a bit higher than before. However, it kept fluctuating with the tide of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the outbreak of COVID-19, food hoarding was prevalent during the pandemic [4] . If respondents return to their old habits of food stockpiling, the changes in the food reserves scale will be zero. Figure 6 shows that up until the time of the survey time, 57.42% of respondents had returned to their old habits, according to the food reserves scale, before the COVID-19 pandemic. This implies that although the lockdown and social distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted consumer buying habits in the short run [42] , these habits may still have power, and many consumers may return to their old routine in the long run.

Those who stockpile food for \"Avoiding shortage\" and \"Pursuing ease\" are going to stockpile food on a larger scale. As the COVID-19 pandemic let the world retreat into \"survival mode\" [2] , \"Avoiding shortage\" and \"Pursuing ease\" were the main motivations for rational food stockpiling behavior. Panic shopping was essentially triggered by people imitating what others were doing in anticipation of shortages (i.e., herd mentality) and perceived scarcity [3, 25] . Purchasing excess household food as a stock can serve as a self-insurance mechanism to guarantee future consumption during a period of uncertainty [22] . This indicates that a supply shock may affect consumers' motivation and spill over into the demand side [43] . The results showed that the respondents who perceived a higher level of severity of the pandemic were more likely to stockpile food on a larger scale. This is consistent with a previous study that showed the impact of internal influences (e.g., fear of contagion or scarcity) on consumer shopping behavior [44] . Considering the unpredictable new wave of occasional outbreaks of COVID-19 cases, consumers' risk perception of COVID-19 would keep changing. We are bound to see some ups and downs of food stockpiling behavior along the road to recovery.",

The results also show that the perceived severity of the pandemic was negatively correlated with membership in certain zero groups. This indicates that the recovery of consumer behavior from the global pandemic will be prolonged and erratic [46] . Furthermore, we took time as a continuous variable and added time square variables to explore the impact of time. These variables had no significant effect on the change in the stockpiling food scale, but their effect on membership in certain zero groups was significant. The time variable was negatively correlated with membership in the zero group, while the square of time was positively correlated with membership in the zero group.

It showed that the COVID-19 pandemic changed Chinese families' food stockpiling behavior, with the scale of food reserves expanding from 3.03 days to 10.01 days in the short run and then back to 4.35 days, which is a \"new normal\" plateau, and kept fluctuating with the tide of the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering most Chinese consumers did not like to stockpile fresh food before COVID-19, the change in consumer food stockpiling behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic poses a demand shock on the food market. Family food reserves, which can be a valuable tool for food security, also demand packaging and distribution technologies to reduce food loss and keep food fresh longer.",
