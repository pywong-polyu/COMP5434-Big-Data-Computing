It can be affected by hematological malignancies, infections and other systemic diseases, leading to changes in volume, morphology, and metabolic activity [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Computed Tomography (CT) has been shown to be the most reliable noninvasive method for the volume measurement and assessment of splenic involvement in various diseases [7, 8] . A precise segmentation of the spleen can deliver valuable information about morphological changes, but manual segmentation of the spleen is time-consuming and not feasible in clinical routine. Several automatic and semi-automatic methods based on image processing have been proposed for abdominal organ segmentation [7, 9, 10] . However, the accuracy of these methods is often limited, and manual correction is required [11] .",

After curation, the CT studies were extracted from the PACS (Picture Achieving and Communication System) and de-identified by anonymization of the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) tags. The spleen was subsequently semiautomatically segmented using a 3D Slicer (Version 4.11.20210226, http://www.slicer.org (accessed on 29 October 2021)) [24] . Contours were manually adjusted by the two radiologists. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) Estimate between the two radiologists was greater than 0.9 (95% CI: 0.914-0.998) and was indicative of excellent reliability [25] . The segmentations of R2 were considered as the ground truth (GT) for the training and testing of the U-Net model (as described below). Patient and disease characteristics are outlined in Table 1 . Unless otherwise indicated, data are expressed as number of participants. * Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation; ** other pathologies include lung, pancreas, liver, prostate, and colorectal cancers, without direct splenic involvement, but in whom splenomegaly or ascites could be present.",

This was intended to match the medical segmentation decathlon dataset (n = 61) and thus to receive comparable results. Yura Ahn et al. and Gabriel et al. trained their algorithms with 250 and 450 manually segmented CT-Scans, respectively [34, 35] . In addition, no cross-validation was performed for training. This could have improved the segmentation performance on the validation dataset, but it often leads to model overfitting. Furthermore, our 3D U-Net was trained and validated using only portal venous phase CT images. To achieve accurate results on different acquisition techniques, our algorithm may need additional training data and updated model weights using Transfer Learning [41] . Moreover, complex intrasplenic distortions, such as splenic infarctions or focal lesions, were excluded from this study due to their relatively low incidence and high heterogeneity, creating the risk of a preselection bias. To overcome the scarcity of such distortions, data augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could be investigated in future research [42] .",
