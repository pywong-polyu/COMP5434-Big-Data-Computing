While Ireland has well-established legislative bans on smoking in public places, these do not apply in prisons. This study evaluates a multi-component tobacco control intervention in a medium security prison for adult males in Ireland. A stop-smoking intervention, targeting staff and prisoners, was designed, implemented, and evaluated with a before-and-after study. Analysis was conducted using McNemar's test for paired binary data, Wilcoxon signed rank test for ordinal data, and paired T-tests for continuous normal data. Pre-intervention, 44.3% (n = 58) of the study population were current smokers, consisting of 60.7% of prisoners (n = 51) and 15.9% of staff (n = 7). Post-intervention, 45.1% of prisoners (n = 23/51) and 100% of staff (n = 7/7) who identified as current smokers pre-intervention reported abstinence from smoking. Among non-smokers, the proportion reporting being exposed to someone else's cigarette smoke while being a resident or working in the unit decreased from 69.4% (n = 50/72) pre-intervention to 27.8% (n = 20/72) postintervention (p < 0.001). This multicomponent intervention resulted in high abstinence rates, had high acceptability among both staff and prisoners, and was associated with wider health benefits across the prison setting.",

In Ireland, the prevalence of smoking among prisoners has been estimated at 86.0%, approximately 3.7 times the population prevalence [2] . The disproportionately high prevalence of smoking among the prisoner population is multifactorial and likely reflects the higher prevalence of smoking among deprived and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations [3] . It may also reflect the fact that smoking is a part of prison culture [4] , and it may be a mechanism of coping with stress, anxiety, or boredom [5] or even a currency that can be exchanged for goods or services within the prison environment [5] . However, the high prevalence of smoking may also reflect under-met health needs in a vulnerable population and the absence of targeted prevention and cessation initiatives within the prison setting to support quitting [6] . The long-term effects of incarceration on physical and mental health are well-documented and include psychological and social effects, as well as effects on cognitive function [7] .",

Exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) increases the risk of lung cancer, respiratory illness, and cardiovascular disease and therefore threatens a safe and healthy working environment [12, 13] . For the prisoner population, the setting is a home. For those prisoners who do not smoke, exposure to SHS also threatens to impede upon civil rights [4] , while for prisoners who smoke, introducing a complete ban may further strip away the few remaining individual rights and privileges. Interventions to tackle tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure can be challenging to implement, with concerns voiced that limiting access to tobacco products can lead to increased violence in prison setting, albeit evidence to validate this concern is mixed, and there are reports of reductions in violence following implementation [14] [15] [16] .",

However, this study demonstrates that it is feasible to effectively meet the tobacco use-related health needs in this vulnerable population group through well-led implementation of a carefully designed multi-component tobacco control intervention. An abstinence rate of 51.7% at four months follow-up was achieved among the longitudinal cohort of prisoners and staff who were present throughout the intervention, with 45.1% among prisoners and 100% among staff. Furthermore, wider benefits included a reduction in self-reported exposure to SHS among both quitters and non-smokers and a reduction in sensory irritation symptoms among non-smokers.",

Few published studies of smoking cessation interventions in a prison setting have sought to address the needs of both staff and prisoners. Adopting a whole-unit approach was an important facet of this intervention which enabled a system-wide change and helped to create a supportive environment for those making quit attempts. This aligns with the World Health Organisation's recommendation that a settings-based approach is taken to promote health in prisons [28] .",

Pharmacological therapy alone or combined with behavioural intervention increases quit rates among the general population; however, multicomponent interventions are increasingly being used for improving lifestyle behaviours, such as smoking, and have been shown to increase long-term abstinence more than usual care or counselling alone [29] . The intervention performed in this study aligns with existing evidence for effective multicomponent interventions which should include raising awareness of the problem, education, motivation, behavioural change, and medications [29] . A pilot study conducted in a maximum-security prison in Australia examined the feasibility and effectiveness of a multi-component smoking cessation intervention involving brief cognitive behavioural therapy, NRT, bupropion, and self-help resources. Eligible participants included those who smoked more than 30 g of tobacco/week, who expressed intention/motivation to quit, and who were in prison for at least a further three months. Prisoners with cardiovascular disease; certain psychiatric disorders; and those receiving psychotropics, antidepressants, or detoxifcation were excluded. At six-months follow up, 26% of prisoners remained continuously abstinent from smoking, and 37% reported abstinence in the previous seven days [30] . The influence of other variables such as age, education, number of prison terms, and illicit drug use on abstinence were also examined, and those who were continuously absent were more likely to be younger and to have used an illicit drug, but this analysis was limited by the small sample size. The findings of this study in an Irish prison setting with a larger study population add to this evidence on the feasibility and effectiveness of multi-component interventions in the prison setting.",

Some countries have gone further than Ireland and introduced complete smoking bans in prisons [21, 31] . A complete ban on smoking offers better protection from SHS exposure for non-smokers than partial bans, even when these are augmented as in this study. However, the attitudinal findings in this study suggest that barriers remain within the Irish prison setting to the introduction of complete bans. While, post-intervention, more than 95% of both prisoners and staff agreed that there should be a smoke free landing within the unit, the majority of both prisoners and staff, pre-and post-intervention, disagreed with the statement that smoking should not be allowed in prison cells. Monitoring of staff and prisoner views in Scotland points to a different experience: during implementation of a comprehensive smoking ban, reported concerns about a complete ban reduced and support increased, albeit views among staff were generally more positive at all time-points than views among prisoners [32] . Regular and open dialogue about implementation of a full smoking ban and provision of stop smoking care were key enablers to building support for change in Scotland [3] . Stop smoking care provided to prisoners in Scotland is similar to that provided in this study. One difference is the availability of e-cigarettes, which are available to prisoners in Scotland [33] but are not recommended or available in prisons in Ireland.",

Prisoners selected for this unit must meet defined criteria, which include being drug-free and free of behavioural sanctions and a high security risk, and they must engage actively in programmes within the unit. Therefore, this cohort is likely to represent a highly motivated group within the prison. Their motivation for participating in the intervention, evidenced by the exceptionally high participation rates, may extend beyond that of wishing to abstain from smoking. It may be influenced by the need to engage in programmes within the unit or by impending release from prison. These motivations may not apply to the general prison population.",

Self-reported quit rates were however validated by the large and significant decrease in exhaled CO in this cohort. Due to challenges around changing staff patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic it is difficult to accurately calculate response rates among staff. The response rate among prisoners, however, was exceptionally high at both pre-and post-intervention surveys, and of the n = 87 prisoners present at pre-and post-intervention surveys, 96.5% were included in this study.",

There is a careful balance to be struck in upholding dignity of prisoners and in protecting public health for both staff and prisoners who may be exposed to SHS. Countries and even courts have differed in their approach and opinion on this issue. This present study demonstrates that in the absence of mandatory measures, smoking prevalence in prison settings can be successfully reduced in a voluntary capacity using multicomponent interventions with strong peer support. Should a mandatory complete ban be introduced in prisons in future in Ireland, optimising smoking cessation through building on lessons learned from this intervention will provide a necessary platform for implementation. Engagement with prisoners and prison staff will also be required to enable change. Regardless of further policy, the potential to improve smoking cessation care identified in this study must be seized to better meet the complex health needs of this vulnerable population.",
