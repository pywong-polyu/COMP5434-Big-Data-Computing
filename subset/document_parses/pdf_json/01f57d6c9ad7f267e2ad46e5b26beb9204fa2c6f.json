The study sample, determined using the criterion sampling method, consisted of nine nurses who work in a COVID-19 clinic of a pandemic hospital. The data were collected through interviews. The data were analyzed using content analysis. COREQ reporting guidelines were used in the study. From the content analysis, five main themes emerged in the study: \"nurses' perceptions of the pandemic process\", \"nurses' feelings about the pandemic process\", \"difficulties nurses experienced in caring for patients with COVID-19\", \"professional achievements nurses gained while working in the COVID-19 clinic\" and \"nursing care practices and changes during the COVID-19 pandemic\". The results of the study showed that during the pandemic, nurses experienced both positive and negative feelings/thoughts, faced various difficulties as well as several professional gains while providing care, and witnessed the changing face of self-care and patient care.",

January 14, 2021, has helped to reduce the risk of the general population as well as healthcare professionals from being infected.

            "text": "Healthcare workers are at greater risk of being infected with COVID-19 (Hartmann et al., 2021) . According to the WHO, in a systematic review it was reported that the incidence of SARS-COV-2 has risen from 0.4% to 49.6% in health workers (WHO, 2021c) . Studies have reported the rate of healthcare workers infected by COVID-19 to be 20% in Italy (The Lancet, 2020) 38% in Madrid/Spain (Folgueira et al., 2020) , 12.9% in Massachusetts/USA (Wang, Ferro, et al., 2020) and 28.9% in Wuhan/China (Wang, Hu, et al., 2020) . Furthermore, the WHO reported that the number of healthcare workers who died between January 2020 and May 2021 was recorded as 6633 but warned that this number does not reflect the truth, as it is estimated to be over 115 thousand (WHO, 2021d) . In a study conducted in Turkey, it was noted that the number of healthcare workers who lost their lives due to COVID-19 was 403, of which 24 were midwives and nurses (Turkish Medical Association, 2021) . Given these figures, the widespread transmission and risk of death from COVID-19 causes fear in healthcare workers. Studies have highlighted the various fears experienced by nurses during the pandemic, such as fear of infecting their family members, stigmatization, restriction of personal freedom, long and busy working hours, lack of quality protective equipment, lack of standard medical treatments, fear of facing serious health emergencies and fear of witnessing the grief of individuals and families for their beloved ones, all of which negatively affect routine nursing care practices (Fernandez et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020) .",

The year 2020 has truly been the year of nurses, as they have stood out with their knowledge, skills, patience and dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic, have demonstrably shown their value, and have exemplified how effective they are in improving global health. Governments and healthcare systems around the world should therefore recognize the true potential of nurses and acknowledge the central role they play in the universal healthcare system (Kiyat et al., 2020) . It is also important to know that nurses are key figures, not only for the group they provide care during the pandemic but also for controlling the pandemic (Chang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) . In this context, it is of paramount value to examine the pandemic experiences of nurses, who undertake the largest burden of the pandemic within the healthcare system. As there are no qualitative studies on this issue in Turkey, this study is unique in the country.",

Diagnosis and treatment processes are carried out in the clinic after patients are evaluated for COVID-19 risk in the emergency room.

The interviews were conducted with each nurse by appointment at a determined hour in a private, quiet room of the clinic where they would not be interrupted by others. The principles of the interview were explained to the nurses, and a number was assigned to each nurse to avoid using their names (N1, N2, N3,\u2026, N9). Each interview lasted approximately 25-30 min. Audio recordings of the interviews were made to enable accurate analysis of their responses and to relisten to their responses if necessary, without having to call them back and jeopardizing their work time. Before the interviews, the nurses were informed that only the researchers would listen to the audio recordings, and that they would not be shared with other people. They were also informed that they could request the audio recordings to be turned off at any time during the course of the interview. This was done to ensure that the nurses felt comfortable during the interview and to deter them from feeling reluctant to share their thoughts due to the voice recording. All the nurses, except one, allowed the researcher to make audio recordings during the interview. In the case of the nurse who did not accept audio recording, the researcher took notes of the statements made by the nurse during the interview.",

The unknown course of the virus and the care-oriented nature of the treatment process place pressure and coercion on the nurses. Nurses are expected to monitor patients' clinical progress and respond quickly (Liu et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020) . The inexperience with and uncertainty over the process that frontline clinical nurses are faced with increases their negative perception. Although nurses have difficulty seeing the end of the road, lack knowledge about the pandemic process and have anxiety about the pandemic management, they are recognized as being the main component to maintaining the healthcare system (Celik et al., 2020) . Knowing all this, it is important to plan appropriately about where and how the nursing workforce will be used to ensure that nurses can effectively perform their roles in the healthcare services, to reduce their anxiety and to manage the pandemic successfully (Catania et al., 2021; Duygulu et al., 2020; Wang, Feng, et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "The present study found that the nurses mainly had feelings of fear and anxiety when they first learned that they were assigned to the COVID-19 clinic, but over time, as they gained experience working in the clinic, these feelings were replaced by happiness, but they felt a greater sense of stigma. At the beginning of the pandemic, there were many negativities, including uncertainties about the process, a high number of COVID-19 cases and mortality rates, demanding quarantine practices, the absence of a proven treatment for the disease, a high risk of transmission of the virus, lack of quality equipment, and the unpreparedness of healthcare systems and professionals to deal with the pandemic process. The fear and anxiety experienced by the nurses could be attributed to the feeling of isolation they have in bearing the brunt of responsibilities imposed on healthcare professionals, the self-awareness they have of being at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic, and the health risks that the pandemic poses to them and their families (Ayd\u0131n & Hursit, 2021; Catania et al., 2021; Celik et al., 2020) . Similar to the present study, other studies have reported that nurses may feel stress, anxiety, anger and disappointment due to lack of known treatments for the virus, their high risk of contamination, insufficient PPE and other required materials, and uncertainty about the future (Lau & Chan, 2005) . One study found that providing care to COVID-19 patients was extremely stressful for healthcare professionals (Vinkers et al., 2020) . According to the nurses' comments to the Turkish Nurses Association (TNA), forced assignments to special units, such as pandemic clinics and intensive care units, on short notice and without sufficient training opportunities to work effectively in these units, have caused fear and panic among nurses (Celik et al., 2020) . According to the nurses' comments to the Turkish Nurses Association (TNA), forced assignments to special units, such as pandemic clinics and intensive care units, on short notice and without sufficient training opportunities to work effectively in these units, have caused fear and panic among nurses (Celik et al., 2020) . (Celik et al., 2020) . Furthermore, it has been shown that when nurses apply bio-psycho-social-spiritual holistic care to patients, feel a sense of pride in performing their duties and in their self-sacrifice, and make an effort to help patients feel hopeful during their trauma their emotions become more positive (Carey, 2021) . This is important insofar as being on the frontline of the pandemic exposes nurses to the dangers, hardships and risks associated with the COVID-19 disease, including contracting COVID-19, working long hours, psychological distress, fatigue, occupational burnout, physical and psychological violence and stigmatization (WHO, 2020c). Although nurses are appreciated by society for the courage they have shown in the struggle against the pandemic, they are nonetheless perceived as potential virus carriers due to their work at \"ground zero\" of the pandemic and are therefore stigmatized by the society and even by their colleagues who are not responsible for care of COVID-19 patients. Healthcare professionals around the world suffer this stigmatization and struggle with many difficulties. For example, in some countries, healthcare professionals are not allowed get on public transport vehicles and are not provided services in restaurants and hotels, which exposes them to social discrimination and stigmatization (Aacharya & Shah, 2020; Bagcchi, 2020) . Appropriate training programs would be effective in preventing these negativities (Bagcchi, 2020) . In this sense, applying effective process management and training healthcare professionals, who have no experience in providing care to COVID-19 patients, on the precautions to be taken against the disease, mode of transmission, and protective measures could help to diminish the stigmatization of nurses.",

            "text": "This study found that nurses experienced difficulties related to PPE use, such as sweating, inability to breathe, inability to move, deterioration in skin integrity, inability to establish vascular access, inability to communicate effectively with patients, and the amount of time it took to put on and take off the equipment. Considering that COVID-19 is transmitted by droplets and contact, nurses are under a high risk of exposure to COVID-19, as the care they provide requires their close contact with these patients (Carter & Notter, 2020; Tsay et al., 2020) . The use of PPE and the control measures applied in healthcare facilities help to prevent the spread of this disease and protect nurses from being infected. Regulations state that barrier measures must be applied at the maximum level for people who work closer than one meter to COVID-19 patients (Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health, 2021b). However, this seriously affects the nurses' radius of action in the fight against the pandemic. Referring to their experiences from past pandemics, like Ebola and MERS, and from today's COVID-19, many healthcare professionals have reported difficulties with PPE use (Bambi et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020; Lucchini, et al., 2020a; Sun et al., 2020) . In addition to these difficulties related to PPE use, there have also been problems procuring enough quality PPEs to meet the growing demand in the fight against COVID-19 in both Turkey and across the world (Catton, 2020; Celik et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Jackson et al., 2020) . This is a major issue, considering that nurses must have the proper quality PPE to protect themselves when they are in physical contact with their patients and are responsible for providing them with effective care and helping them recover their health in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has proven to be a difficult crisis to control and manage. Improving working conditions and hours, increasing the number of nurses, giving them a more reasonable amount of time to put on and take off their PPEs and setting limits on the number of times they need to use PPEs can mitigate the difficulties nurses have experienced during the pandemic.",

            "text": "The present study found that administrative difficulties were another issue faced by nurses. The nurses expressed that long working hours, not scheduling in-service trainings on time, not being able to reach managers, and working with newly appointed nurses posed difficulties for them. As found in this study, the TNA reported that difficult working conditions, including 24-h shifts, insufficient rest periods, inadequate and insufficient rest areas, and inadequate and imbalanced nutrition, are among the most significant problems nurses have in Turkey (Celik et al., 2020) . Clearly, the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed unprecedented challenges to nurses, professionally, socially and psychologically. Its rapidly changing nature has caused several significant difficulties in healthcare service delivery and management, including having to develop new infection management policies overnight and having to perform unfamiliar care practices (Catania et al., 2021) . In addition, considering the high risk of disease transmission that healthcare workers face, the necessity of taking occupational health and safety measures to protect all healthcare employees during service and care provision also comes to the fore. In this context, nurse managers have important responsibilities in managing the nursing services provided in the hospital during the pandemic and in creating a healthy working environment for their employees (Duygulu et al., 2020) . It is necessary for nurse managers to supply a suitable and sufficient amount of equipment, provide basic training for nurses on the correct use of PPE, and participate and show leadership in guiding nurses in emergencies. In addition, establishing relevant strategies, such as the development of basic COVID-19 competencies in the nursing workforce, which includes the skills necessary to manage a pandemic, and the provision of adequate and sustainable human resources is a key responsibility for nurse managers in dealing with this emergency (Bambi et al., 2020; Catania et al., 2021; Duygulu et al., 2020) . The Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health has appointed healthcare personnel to public hospitals in order to provide adequate care to the increased number of patients and to meet the healthcare workforce need in new pandemic clinics and intensive care units. However, as revealed in this study, this has created some serious difficulties as newly appointed nurses, who tend to be new graduates or have no professional experience and whose first clinics were COVID-19 clinics, have not undergone orientation or have no experience. Process management should be planned together with managers and active employees to reduce managerial difficulties. In this process, nurses, who are the main health personnel involved in one-toone contact with patients, should have the required educational training, and their personnel competencies should be monitored, and an accessible management policy should be implemented.",

            "text": "In the present study, most of the nurses stated that they learned how to provide care to an isolated patient in the COVID-19 clinic and apply isolation precautions and understood the importance of communication and engagement. Although the pandemic continues to leave deep marks on the professional life of nurses, many nurses have reacted positively to the new reality, as was proven to be the case in this study. Nurses have reinforced their knowledge base and designed new solutions for the current situation (Catania et al., 2021) . Throughout the pandemic process, the experience and competencies of nurses have increased, and they have been provided opportunities to improve their skills by participating in a multidisciplinary team (Bambi et al., 2020) . In this study, the initial negative feelings of nurses when they were assigned to the COVID-19 clinic were replaced by feelings of professional and humanitarian achievements over time. Similar to this study, several other studies have found that nurses perform multiple roles, such as caregivers, educators and patient advocates and they develop a positive attitude over time Zhang et al., 2020) . Nursing is believed to be a link in the professional health chain, where in the case of dealing with COVID-19, the focus is on preserving human life and securing employee health and patient safety. This pandemic is regarded as a moment of reinvention and re-learning in the face of a challenging scenario for employees and organizations (Miranda et al., 2020) . Therefore, despite all the difficulties encountered, the holistic approach that has been adopted in providing patient care, where there is communication between patients and other healthcare professionals, and where the healthcare team members, including nurses, who serve as a bridge between patients and their families, are actively involved in the fight against the pandemic, can be considered as a positive development in terms of its reflection on the quality of patient care.",

            "text": "This study found that in providing care to patients with COVID-19, nurses have mostly performed routine nursing practices and close follow-up. In the study interviews, the nurses were asked to describe the changes in both themselves and their patients during the pandemic. Accordingly, most of them reported that there were changes made in patient admission, delivery and intervention, specifically stating that patients were not allowed to leave their rooms, could communicate by What-sApp, signed consent forms on discharge, were not allowed to have visitors/hospital attendants, and were required to wear a mask at all times, even in the room. Although life in many parts of the world has come to a standstill due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been extraordinarily rapid developments in the methods and practices used to adapt to this new world order (Kurnaz & Ser\u00e7emeli, 2020) . These changes have also affected the healthcare sector, having serious impacts on individuals who provide and receive health services. In providing care to patients with COVID-19, nurses have to use PPE, which requires them to administer care practices while wearing multiple layers of clothing, are not able to enter patient rooms and communicate with or touch patients without risk to their safety, and have to create separate areas for putting on and taking off protective equipment, which is a time-consuming activity; these all have a physical, mental and psychological toll on the nurses over time and lead to a significant increase in nurses' workload and fatigue (Catania et al., 2021; Catton, 2020; Celik et al., 2020; Lucchini, et al., 2020a, b) . In addition, admitting patients to the service using an isolation stretcher/chair, transferring patients at the nurse station instead of at bedside, and using tablets for communication with patients are a reflection of the changing face of nursing care during the pandemic. Changes in healthcare practices not only affect patient care but also offer an environment for the use of new methods. Similar to this study, other studies have reported that patients are not allowed to have visitors or hospital attendants during the pandemic, should communicate with their families in a virtual environment, and are encouraged to use masks and comply with other protective measures (Lucchini, et al., 2020b; Luttik et al., 2020) . In one study (Luttik et al., 2020) , an intensive care nurse stated that \"many people die without seeing their families\". This draws attention to how desperate this traumatic process can be for healthcare professionals, patients and their families. However, despite all the negativities, all healthcare professionals, especially nurses, who are the backbone of healthcare systems throughout the world and whose importance has never been realized so clearly (Jackson et al., 2020) , strive to provide quality care in a self-sacrificing and principled manner, risking their lives when they are without sufficient equipment, working long hours, sometimes without sleeping at all, compromising their own needs and neglecting their families.",
