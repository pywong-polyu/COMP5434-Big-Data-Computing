            "text": "in the city of Wuhan, China, continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of the global population. Currently, approximately 8.8 million people have already been infected and more than 465,740 people have died worldwide. An important step in combating COVID-19 is the screening of infected patients using chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, this task is extremely time-consuming and prone to variability among specialists owing to its heterogeneity. Therefore, the present study aims to assist specialists in identifying COVID-19 patients from their chest radiographs, using automated computational techniques. The proposed method has four main steps: (1) the acquisition of the dataset, from two public databases; (2) the standardization of images through preprocessing; (3) the extraction of features using a deep features-based approach implemented through the networks VGG19, Inception-v3, and ResNet50; (4) the classifying of images into COVID-19 groups, using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). In the best-case scenario, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 98.71%, a precision of 98.89%, a recall of 99.63%, and an F1-score of 99.25%. In our study, we demonstrated that the problem of classifying CXR images of patients under COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 conditions can be solved efficiently by combining a deep features-based approach with a robust classifier (XGBoost) optimized by an evolutionary algorithm (PSO). The proposed method offers considerable advantages for clinicians seeking to tackle the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

An individual who exhibits COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate at home for 14 days. This mechanism is very much in line with the fact that the transmission of this pathology is very sensitive to any contact with the infected person (Boccia, Ricciardi, & Ioannidis, 2020) . The main symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and fatigue; other symptoms can include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, diarrhea, dyspnoea, and lymphopenia (Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020) . The global community is currently seeking answers and solutions to eradicate this pandemic; thus, several case studies have been developed to investigate the particular characteristics of the disease. One of the main mechanisms considered to assist specialists is the evaluation of chest Xray (CXR) images (El-Din Hemdan, Shouman, & Karar, 2020) .",

In the recent work of Narin, Kaya, and Pamuk (2020) , models based on convolutional neural networks (ResNet50, Inception-v3, and Inception-ResNetV2) were applied to detect patients infected with COVID-19; a maximum accuracy of 98% was obtained. Apostolopoulos and Mpesiana (2020) also used different pre-trained deep learning models; they achieved a 98.75% accuracy and a 92.85% recall using two classes (COVID-19 vs. normal conditions).",

In both studies, several models of convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to verify the COVID-19 detection performance. In El-Din Hemdan et al. (2020) , a 90% accuracy was obtained for the normal and COVID-19 classes. In the , achieved a recall of 96% for cases of COVID-19 and 70.65% for normal cases. Pereira, Bertolini, Teixeira, Silla, and Costa (2020) used CXR images to distinguish pneumonia cases caused by COVID-19 from those caused by other types of diseases, as well as from healthy lungs. To this end, the authors used known texture descriptors to extract features and a pretrained CNN model. They achieved an F1-score of 65% using a multiclass approach and an F1-score of 89% for the identification of COVID-19. In a study by Ozturk et al. (2020) , a model (DarkCovidNet) for binary and multiclass classification was also developed. DarkCovidNet was inspired by the object detection system referred to as \"You Only Look Once.\" The model achieved an accuracy of 98.08% for binary class and 87.02% for multiclass classification. Sethy and Behera (2020) classified features obtained from the ResNet50 model, using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier; they obtained an accuracy of 95.38% and an F1-score of 91.41% in the detection of COVID-19. In Rahimzadeh and Attar (2020) , a neural network was proposed; it used a combination of Xception and ResNet50V2 networks to detect COVID-19 cases, achieving an accuracy of 99.50%, a precision of 35.27%, and a recall of 80.53% in the detection of COVID-19. Whilst all of these approaches have achieved strong results, significant amount of work remains to be done; for instance, a broad range of rigorous tests and improvements are required before these techniques can be used in clinical practice. Therefore, the present work proposes a method capable of classifying the CXR images of patients with COVID-19, implementing extraction via deep features and using an optimized XGBoost for classification. In this way, we hope to assist specialists in the task of diagnosing patients, by providing a robust mechanism for CXR analysis.We chose XGBoost as the classifier of the Deep Features extracted, because of its performance, compared to other existing solutions. According to Chen, He, Benesty, Khotilovich, and Tang (2015) , XGBoost has performed better in terms of speed, scalability, memory consumption, and hardware resources. Besides, it has achieved state-of-the-art results in several tasks.",

Each parameter requires a search space, which is simply denoted by the limits of the maximum and minimum values that can be assumed. For the max depth, a discrete threshold was defined between three and ten. The min child weights were set as integer values between one and seven. Finally, for the other parameters, continuous thresholds were defined between zero and one. Furthermore, to allow the PSO algorithm to evolve, a fitness function was required. The fitness of each particle was evaluated using the results obtained by the XGBoost model, which operated on the validation subset according to the selected parameters.
