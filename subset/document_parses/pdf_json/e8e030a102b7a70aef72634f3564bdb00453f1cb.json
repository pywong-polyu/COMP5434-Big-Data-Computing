Indeed, a shift from Lactobacillus dominance to non-Lactobacillus dominance increases the colonization and/or overgrowth of pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria such as Gardnerella spp., Prevotella, and Clostridium, which are often found during bacterial vaginosis Oakley et al., 2008; Srinivasan and Fredricks, 2008; Ravel et al., 2013) . Like bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis is featured by a marked rearrangement in the microbial community. In this case, the decrease in abundance of lactobacilli is associated with the overgrowth of aerobic bacteria mainly belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Escherichia, and Enterococcus (Donders, 2007) . Nevertheless, in small amounts, these opportunistic/pathogenic bacteria can be present in healthy vaginal microbiota (Ravel et al., 2011) .",

The complexity of EVs reflects their multifunctionality, since EVs can shuttle numerous bioactive molecules that are involved during bacterial-bacterial interactions such as antibiotic resistance, stress resistance, horizontal gene transfer, and competition with other microorganisms; bacterial EVs are also involved during bacterial-host interactions, such as immune modulation and delivery of virulence factor, among others (Mashburn and Whiteley, 2005; Oakley et al., 2008; Manning and Kuehn, 2011; Kim et al., 2015; Stubbendieck and Straight, 2016; Domingues et al., 2017; \u00d1ahui Palomino et al., 2021) . Despite several functions described for bacterial EVs in the last decade, little is known about their possible interactions with viruses. In our previous work, we reported on the HIV-1 inhibition by Lactobacillus-derived EVs (L. crispatus BC3 and L. gasseri BC12) in both human cell lines and ex-vivo tissues (\u00d1ahui Palomino et al., 2019) . This inhibition was associated with the binding of Lactobacillus-derived EVs to HIV-1 Env protein, resulting in a reduction of HIV-1 entry and binding to target cells (\u00d1ahui Palomino et al., 2019) .",

All bacterial strains were cultured at 37\u00b0C in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) broth (Difco, Detroit, MI) pre-filtered with 0.1mm filters to decrease the number of particles that are present in the medium. G. vaginalis was cultured in anaerobic conditions in jars containing Gaspak EZ (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), while the remaining strains (S. aureus, E. faecium, and E. faecalis) were cultured in aerobic conditions. The optical density (OD) of overnight cultures were measured using the spectrophotometer (Biophotometer, Eppendorf, Germany) and the bacterial concentration was calculated using an OD 600 nm conversion factor of 0.4, corresponding to a concentration of 10 8 colonyforming units (CFU)/mL. Bacterial EVs were isolated from the supernatants of bacterial cultures by ultracentrifugation (The\u0155y et al., 2006; \u00d1ahui Palomino et al., 2019) .

Then, virions were captured using antibodies conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). We used PG9-MNPs, which recognize preferentially the HIV-1 trimeric envelope proteins gp120. VRC01-MNPs recognize the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the gp120 subunit. 4B3-MNPs recognize the viral gp41 subunit. Our results show that the incubation of HIV-1 LAI.04 with bacterial EVs led to a significant reduction in the number of HIV-1 virions captured with PG9-MNP antibodies in comparison with the control (free of bacterial EVs) ( Figure 7A ). The numbers of virions captured decreased by 52.56 \u00b1 9.23% (p < 0.0001, n = 5) when incubated with S. aureus-derived EVs, by 54.83 \u00b1 14.78% (p < 0.0001, n = 5) when incubated with E. faecium-derived EVs, by 54.01 \u00b1 15.33% (p < 0.0001, n = 5) when incubated with E. faecalis-derived EVs, and by 42.64 \u00b1 9.32% (p < 0.0001, n = 6) when incubated with G. vaginalis-derived EVs ( Figure 7A ).

Similar results were observed when VRC01 antibodies, which recognize the CD4bs on the gp120, were used. These observations indicate that bacterial EVs interact specifically with the gp120 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope, as the virus treated with bacterial EVs and its subsequently capture with 4B3 antibodies, which recognize gp41, did not alter the amount of virus captured. Altogether, our results obtained in the present study are comparable with those previously reported for Lactobacillus-derived EVs (\u00d1ahui Palomino et al., 2019) , suggesting that HIV-1 inhibition by steric hindrance of gp120 or gp120 modification is a common mechanism of Gram-positive bacteria.",

Among the proteins detected in all the bacterial EVs, 30 orthogroup proteins (clusters of orthologue proteins) were common to the EVproteome of all four strains. Similar EV-associated proteins were found in EVs released by S. aureus, E. faecalis, and G. vaginalis, as reported by others (Wagner et al., 2018b; Shishpal et al., 2020; Tartaglia et al., 2020) . None of these bacterial 30 orthogroup proteins were previously reported to interact with HIV-1 or other viruses. However, human homologues of these proteins, such as chaperone protein DnaK (Hsp70), enolase (ENO), elongation factor TU (EFTU), and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), are involved during HIV-1 infection (Cimarelli and Luban, 1999; Kumar et al., 2011; Kishimoto et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015; Kishimoto et al., 2020) . In particular, Hsp70 decreases HIV-1 replication by inhibiting viral gene expression (Kumar et al., 2011) . Likewise, Mycobacterium Hsp70 has been shown to interact with CCR5, abrogating HIV-1 infection of human CD4 + T cells (Babaahmady et al., 2007) . Overexpression of ENO in HIV-1 target cells decreases HIV-1 infection by inhibiting viral integration and replication (Kishimoto et al., 2020) . EF1a (eukaryotic homologue of EFTU) and GAPDH oppositely impact the reverse transcription of viral RNA: EF1a positively influences the reverse transcription by interacting with 5'UTR of HIV-1, while GAPDH negatively regulates the reverse transcription of viral RNA (Kishimoto et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015) . Also, EF1a interacts with HIV-1 gag proteins and can be incorporated in the HIV-1 virion (Cimarelli and Luban, 1999) . Furthermore, in EVs with anti-HIV-1 activity, such as EVs derived from L. gasseri, ENO-2, EFTU, ATP synthase gamma chain, and 60 kDa chaperonin (\u00d1ahui Palomino et al., 2019; Costantini et al., 2021) have also been found. Whether HIV-1 inhibition by bacterial EVs is directly or indirectly exerted by one or more of these proteins remain to be elucidated.",

However, the exact mechanisms of this phenomenon still need to be fully elucidated. The ability of each bacterium to increase or decrease the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection will depend on the bacteria itself, release of virulence factors, capabilities to disrupt the host epithelial barrier, their capacities to induce pro-inflammatory environment that attract HIV-1 target cells, etc (Petrova et al., 2013) . The final effect of vaginal microbiota on HIV-1 infection may be a balance of all the effects. Here, we focused on the study of EVs produced by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. faecalis, and G. vaginalis. If our results are extrapolated to in vivo HIV-1 transmission, it would be important to determine the amount of EVs produced by bacteria in vivo. A limiting factor for the comprehension of the real impact exerted by EVs is a lack of specific tools for the isolation of bacterial EVs released in vivo. Identification of antiviral molecules present in EVs, as well as their mechanism of action, will be fundamental for understanding HIV-1 protection mediated by bacterial EVs in vivo.",

Also, E. faecium, induced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL8) and nitric oxide on epithelial swine testicle cells, with a consequent reduction of viral infectivity. Moreover, E. faecium was able to trap TGEV virions, as observed with electron microscopy, decreasing viral infectivity (Kreuzer et al., 2012; Chai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) . Now, it should be investigated whether EVs generated by these bacteria mediate these activities.",

This protection is not due to a cytotoxic effect of bacterial EVs but rather to steric hindrance of gp120 or gp120 modifications. EVs carry numerous bacterial proteins which may be associated with the anti-HIV-1 effect. Identification of the bacterial EV molecules responsible for this anti-HIV-1 effect may help to the development of new therapeutic agents that prevent HIV-1 vaginal transmission.",
