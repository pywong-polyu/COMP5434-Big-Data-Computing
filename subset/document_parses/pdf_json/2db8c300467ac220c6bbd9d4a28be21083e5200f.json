We hypothesized that type III interferons might be important for the immune response to other pathogens as well. In a cohort of 914 Malian children, we genotyped functional variants IFNL4-rs368234815, IFNL4-rs117648444, and IFNL3-rs4803217 and analyzed episodes of malaria, gastrointestinal, and respiratory infections recorded at 30,626 clinic visits from birth up to 5 years of age. Compared to children with the rs368234815-TT/TT genotype (IFN-\u03bb4-Null), rs368234815-dG allele was most strongly associated with an earlier time-tofirst episode of gastrointestinal infections (p = 0.003). The risk of experiencing an infection episode during the follow-up was also significantly increased with rs368234815-dG allele, with OR = 1.53, 95%CI (1.13-2.07), p = 0.005 for gastrointestinal infections and OR = 1.30, 95%CI (1.02-1.65), p = 0.033 for malaria. All the associations for the moderately linked rs4803217 (r 2 = 0.78 in this set) were weaker and lost significance after adjusting for rs368234815. We also analyzed all outcomes in relation to IFN-\u03bb4-P70S groups. Our results implicate IFN-\u03bb4 and not IFN-\u03bb3 as the primary functional cause of genetic associations with increased overall risk and younger age at first clinical episodes but not with recurrence or intensity of several common pediatric infections.",

The ability to produce IFN-\u03bb4 is an ancestral trait, which appears to be under negative selection in humans [10] . The reasons for this selection are unclear but could be related to poor clearance of some deadly infections in the past.

Beyond HCV, the IFNL4 genetic polymorphisms (rs12979860 and rs368234815) have been associated with the clearance of respiratory RNA viruses in children in Rwanda [14] . To further explore the hypothesis that type III IFNs might impact the immune response to diverse pathogens, we analyzed detailed health records of 914 Malian children and genotyped their DNA for the functional polymorphisms IFNL4-rs368234815, IFNL4-rs117648444, and IFNL3-rs4803217. We analyzed clinical data collected during 30,626 routine and walk-in clinic visits from birth to up to 5 years of age. Specifically, we analyzed episodes of infections classified as malaria (overall, severe and non-severe), gastrointestinal, and respiratory infections and evaluated their occurrence during follow-up time (ever/never), timeto-first episode, and the count of independent episodes. Our results provide new clues on the role of type III IFNs, and IFN-\u03bb4, specifically, in genetic control of the immune response to several common infections in African children.",

The presence of severe malaria symptoms but with negative tests for malaria antigens or parasites was attributed to other diseases. All other parasitemia episodes, including those that were asymptomatic, were classified as non-severe malaria. For ever/never analyses, the non-severe malaria group included children with malaria history who never had a severe malaria episode, while the severe malaria group included children with at least one severe malaria episode, regardless of the number of non-severe malaria episodes.",

Because the missense variant rs117648444-A (P70S) within exon 2 of IFNL4 exists only as a part of haplotype with rs368234815-dG allele ( Supplementary Fig.  S3 ), rs117648444 should only be analyzed together with rs368234815 (reviewed in [9] ). In individuals of African ancestry, rs368234815-dG is a major allele (in contrast with Europeans and Asians), allowing further separation of the last group into individuals producing one versus two copies of the strong IFN-\u03bb4-P70 protein; thus, we stratified all children in four groups instead of classification into three groups used in Europeans [11, 12] . Table 5 shows that compared to the IFN-\u03bb4-Null group, the risks of gastrointestinal infection and malaria but not respiratory infection were increased in the following order: weak IFN-\u03bb4-S70 < one copy of strong IFN-\u03bb4-P70 < two copies of strong IFN-\u03bb4-P70 protein. Similarly, IFN-\u03bb4-P70S group classification was significantly associated with an earlier occurrence of the first GII episode (p = 0.009, Table 5 and Fig. 2 ). The numbers of infection episodes were not significantly associated with IFN-\u03bb4-P70S groups (Supplementary Table S8 ).",

In Rwanda, rotavirus was detected in rectal swabs of 36.9% of children under five seeking clinical help for acute gastroenteritis [21] . In 2016 alone, RoV was estimated to have caused >128,500 deaths of children under five [22] . Of all cases of acute gastroenteritis, NoV and AstV are estimated to account for 20% and 4-10%, respectively [19, 23] . Although these infections are ubiquitous and in healthy individuals spontaneously clear within days, viral clearance may take longer in younger children, especially in those affected by malnutrition and other infections.

Respiratory infections cause an estimated 1.9 million deaths annually in children under five, with 70% of these deaths occurring in Africa and Southeast Asia [32] . Some of these deaths are caused by infections with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza, also linked with the immune response mediated by type III in the human and murine nasal epithelium [33] [34] [35] [36] . These studies suggested that type III IFNs represent the first line of defense from respiratory RNA viruses, and treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03bbs can protect from respiratory infections and stop the viral spread from upper to lower respiratory tract [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

In our study, we observed a borderline significant association (p = 0.045) with an earlier occurrence of respiratory infections in children with IFNL4-rs368234815-dG allele, but not reaching statistical significance. This could be because respiratory symptoms recorded during clinic visits in our study were defined very broadly, were very common (experienced by 97.7% of children during follow-up), and occurred very early in life, with the median timing of the first respiratory episode being at 16 weeks of age.",

Our findings on potential association with increased risk of malaria infection, which is caused by plasmodium, an intracellular parasite, supports the emerging role of type III IFNs beyond viral infections. Malaria plasmodium first invades hepatocytes and then propagates in the liver where type III IFNs can be expressed after induction by different stimuli. The results of earlier occurrence of clinical malaria episodes in children with the rs368234815-dG allele were recently corroborated by an independent study of children in Kenya [38] .",

The significant linear trends for associations between the inferred biological activity of IFN-\u03bb4 (as Null-weak-strong IFN-\u03bb4 protein) and infection episodes provide additional support to our hypothesis that IFN-\u03bb4 activity increases the risk of acute clinical GII infections and malaria. We did not observe significant differences in the counts of infection episodes in children with various IFNL4 genotype or IFN-\u03bb4-P70S groups. Thus, the biological activity of IFN-\u03bb4 is likely to be associated with increased overall risk and younger age at first clinical episodes but not with recurrence or intensity of infections.",

The limitations of our study include using a syndromic approach of utilizing proxies for infections, such as diarrhea for gastrointestinal infections and cough/respiratory distress for respiratory infections, even though these infections could be caused by multiple factors [39] . Due to the regular medical assistance provided to the children at the time of routine and walk-in visits, the negative health impacts of these infections were likely to be diminished, potentially decreasing our statistical power to detect genetic associations with these infections. Our exploratory study tested associations between multiple infections and models, which might result in some of these results being false-positive due to multiple testing and unadjusted confounding factors.",
