Interventions such as handwashing, masks, social distancing, and \"social bubbles\" are used to limit community transmission, but it is challenging to choose the best interventions for a given activity. Here, we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions are likely to have the most impact in which settings. We introduce the concept of \"event R,\" the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single infectious individual at an event. We obtain a fundamental relationship between event R and four parameters: transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity of individuals, and the degree of mixing. We use reports of small outbreaks to establish event R and transmission intensity in a range of settings. We identify principles that guide whether physical distancing, masks and other barriers to transmission, or social bubbles will be most effective. We outline how this information can be obtained and used to reopen economies with principled measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.",

(The constant rate assumption is a simplification that omits many factors [SI Appendix has a discussion].) If the infectious person is in contact with k others, instead of just one, then the expected number of new infections as a result of that contact is k (1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03b2\u03c4 ). Now, suppose that instead of being in contact with the same group of k others, the event involves interacting with many groups of attendees. We model a simplified version of this type of mixing by imagining that for a time \u03c4 , the infectious attendee is in contact with k others, then joins a new distinct group of k attendees for time \u03c4 , and so on. Over the course of the event, the infectious individual meets T /\u03c4 groups of k individuals, therefore contacting a total of kT /\u03c4 others, and the expected number of new infections that arises is",

            "text": "Interventions for Reducing Event R In Fig. 1 , we illustrate three fundamentally different types of intervention that can be put in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Eq. 1 gives us a way to examine when each will be most effective. Our model makes the simplifying assumption that susceptible individuals are either in contact with the infectious individual (i.e., are one of the k ) and thus, transmission occurs with constant rate \u03b2 or they are sufficiently distanced that the probability of transmission is negligible. (The necessary distance is expected to vary with the ventilation, airflow, relevant droplet size, and other factors.) In the first type of intervention, face masks, barriers, hand hygiene, and similar measures aim to reduce the transmission rate \u03b2, reducing the probability of transmission among the k contacts. In the second type of intervention, distancing measures that keep people apart reduce k itself, limiting the number of people exposed at a given time. Distancing can mean literally spacing people farther out, preventing close-range droplet transmission, or reducing the number of attendees altogether. (For example, in some high-density and/or low-ventilation settings, aerosol transmission may mean that this is the best option to reduce k .) In either case, our model assumes zero transmission probability except among the k attendees within \"transmission reach\" of the index case at a given time. Finally and less well recognized, structuring the attendees into strict \"social bubbles\" or cohorts and ensuring that people keep contact to within their bubble reduces mixing (increasing \u03c4 ). Fig. 2 shows how Revent changes with respect to an event's duration for some different settings and interventions. Fig. 2 , Top shows the impact on Revent for events without mixing. When the event's duration is short, reducing transmission (for example, with masks and barriers) and ensuring distancing have similar impacts, but when the duration is long, reducing transmission has much less impact than distancing. As Fig. 2 , Middle shows, at events where individuals mix, strict bubbles can be much more effective than either distancing or reducing the transmission rate, and distancing outperforms reducing transmission. However, when the baseline transmission rate is very low (Fig. 2 , Bottom), distancing and reducing transmission are better than strict bubbles. Here, contacting three different groups of 10 people for 1 h and contacting a single group of 10 people for 3 h will each result in the same (low) average number of new infections. We refer to events like these as \"linear\" events: the expected number of new infections depends linearly on the number of contacts and the duration. In contrast, if the transmission rate is high enough that exposure of length \u03c4 can lead to a substantial fraction of the first group of k people becoming infected, then it is far preferable not to move to a new group of k people when that hour ends. We refer to such events as \"saturating.\" Naturally, these interventions can and should be used in combination. Distancing (reducing k ) has an effect that is independent of whether other interventions are used: if k is halved, Revent is halved, whatever the values of other parameters. Transmission reduction (reducing \u03b2) and bubbling (increasing \u03c4 ) interact, in that they have the effect of reducing each other's relative effectiveness. As \u03b2 is decreased, we are taken closer to a linear regime where bubbling is ineffective. On the other hand, increasing \u03c4 means that we are closer to reaching saturation, and so, transmission reduction is less effective. In SI Appendix, we further explore the effect of combinations of interventions in our model.",

Our strategy is to estimate \u03b2 for many different outbreaks that have already occurred in different settings and use this to inform what values of \u03b2 are reasonable for novel but similar settings with a similarly infectious individual. One important point to address is that Revent is an expectation of a number of new infections and so, cannot be directly observed either.

From the more than 100 outbreaks described there, we selected a small number of incidents where there were enough details reported for us to estimate our parameters. We obtained reports of outbreaks at a range of events including parties, meals, nightclubs, and restaurants. For example, 52 of 60 singers became infected after a choir rehearsal in Washington (5); 5 of 39 passengers were infected in China when a man took a 2-h bus ride without a mask, whereas none of 14 passengers on his next 50-min bus journey were infected when he wore a mask (6) . Nineteen people were infected by a single individual in a nightclub outbreak (7) . SI Appendix has the complete list. For each outbreak, there was sufficient information to estimate n inf , the contact group size k , the mixing time \u03c4 , and the duration T . Most reported outbreaks list the total number of infected individuals, including two or three generations of infection, and individuals who were not at the event in question. Since our n inf is defined to be the number of new infections directly caused by one infected individual at the event in question, we selected outbreaks 1) where there was likely only one infected individual initially at the event and 2) where there was an estimate of how many people were directly infected by this individual at the event or there was information about the timing of the appearance of symptoms in all infected cases. This meant that we could estimate n inf , using information about the time interval between infection and the expression of symptoms.

To illustrate this point, we consider the choir practice event E2 where we have estimated \u03b2 to be in the range 0.25 to 1.3 transmissions per contact per hour. Suppose we want to use this range of \u03b2 to predict how many people will become infected on average at another similar choir practice if an infectious individual attends. The first problem comes from the fact that it is unlikely that \u03b2 is the same for all infectious individuals at all choir practices. It will vary based on the individual, the ventilation, the size of the room, the seating arrangement, and any protective measures taken. We can imagine that among all of the choir practices that occurred in the relevant time period, there was a distribution of \u03b2 values. Since larger \u03b2 will more probably lead to a larger outbreak, the \u03b2 for this event is unusually large for similar events of its kind. It might be possible to adjust for this effect using carefully collected datasets (9), but fundamentally, this would require knowledge of exposures that led to very few or no further infections, and this is seldom collected systematically. However, our results show that \u03b2 can be this high for events of this type, and that is still an important piece of information for planners. Heterogeneity in transmission and \"superspreading events\" is increasingly recognized in infectious disease and in COVID-19 (10, 11) , and \"chopping off the tail\" has recently been proposed as a way to reduce transmission considerably (12) . Substantially reducing the upper tail of large and rapid clusters requires planning for precisely the infectious index cases that lead to large reported outbreaks (such as those described here).",

Suppose that over the first few months of 2020, there was a number of choir practices in the United States where one or more of the attendees were infectious. We model this number as a Poisson random variable with rate \u03bb. In each such choir practice, we assume transmission occurs according to our model. (For simplicity, we assume T = \u03c4 = 2.5 h and k = 60.) We assume that an outbreak is reported with a probability depending on the number of new infections n inf : the probability of being reported is 1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03b1n inf , \u03b1 = 0.1. This choice of \u03b1 leads to an outbreak of the size 52 of 60 being reported with probability 99.5% and an outbreak of only 10 being reported with probability 63%. Now, we can ask, given a particular \u03bb and \u03b2, what the probability is that we observe a single choir outbreak with between 30 and 52 new infections over the period of interest? Fig. 4 shows this probability for a range of \u03bb and \u03b2. The likelihood is concentrated around \u03bb = 1 and a range for \u03b2 that is similar to our estimates shown in Fig. 2 . Assuming a constant \u03b2 over all choir practices with an infectious individual, from this model we estimate that there was only one such choir practice and that \u03b2 lay in a range from 0.3 to 0.7. The reason for this estimate is that the only way for 30 or more people to be infected at a single choir practice is for \u03b2 to be so large that, if there were any other such choir practices at all, with very high probability the resulting outbreak would be detected. These conclusions remain for other values of the parameter \u03b1 and for other models of when outbreaks are reported. However, if there was a number of other choirs in which \u03b2 was much smaller, then exposures in those rehearsals might not have caused outbreaks that were reported.",

Spacing people so that k is halved reduces Revent from 14 to 7; halving \u03b2 reduces Revent to 8, and strict bubbles of 15 reduce Revent to 10. Reducing both transmission and density reduces Revent to four. Therefore, if the organizers can feasibly only take one of these actions, distancing is the most effective. However, assuming that masks and ventilation can achieve a 50% reduction in transmission, these permit more attendees (and higher revenues) than distancing if venue capacity is an issue.",

One proposed model for social distancing in the school setting is that bubbles are formed of only two classes, so that students spend most of their contact time with the students in their class, but for 2 h a week, the two classes in a bubble meet for some activity. We suppose that an infected individual (who may be asymptomatic and so, remain undetected) is in the class for 5 d of 6 h/d (T = 30 h) before either the infected individual stops coming to class or the class is shut down for other reasons. We suppose that \u03b2 = 0.05 when masks are not used and \u03b2 is halved to 0.025 when masks are used. Under these assumptions, without masks, Revent for the student's own class is 19.4, and for the other class, Revent is 2.4, for a total expected number of primary infections of 21.8. Wearing masks reduces Revent to 13.2 in the student's own class and to 1.2 in the other class. In terms of infections saved per hour of mask wearing, masks during the bridging time are much more worthwhile (0.2 fewer infections per hour wearing a mask within class vs. 0.6 in the case of the activity with both classes.)",

In events that are already static, the relative importance of reducing transmission (reducing \u03b2) is much greater in the linear setting. For events where there is mixing, bubbling (reducing \u03c4 ) is an extremely powerful intervention in the saturating case but is less significant in the linear case. If there is substantial heterogeneity in transmission, many potential index cases will have a low transmission rate, but the rate is high enough often enough to have driven a global pandemic.

This effect may help to explain the variable evidence for the benefits of masks in reducing transmission, with some studies showing no benefit (13) , while the overall picture shows significant benefit in some cases (14) . In contrast, the evidence that transmission is impacted by physical distance is quite strong. Distancing of 1 m or more significantly reduces transmission, and greater distances reduce it further (14) . Strict bubbling can be effective and has the added advantage that contact tracing is made easier when individuals have fewer contacts and can identify them, but strict bubbles are hard to maintain over time due to social, family, and workplace activities.

With both benefits and expected transmissions depending on the number of people engaged in an activity or event, societies must decide which events and activities have an acceptable COVID-19 cost-benefit balance.

In this case, mask use and physical barriers to transmission may be ineffective; physical distancing is likely to be more effective, and strict bubbling is the best. In addition to the risks posed by asymptomatic individuals [who may after all not be as infectious as others (25) ], even for those who eventually develop symptoms it has been estimated that over 40% of transmission occurs before symptom onset (26) , over a period of a few days (although this was in contexts where symptomatic transmission was likely to be low due to control measures in place). In our framework, with the transmission rates we have acquired from reported short outbreaks, a time period of several days places some activities firmly in the saturating mode.",

This information, along with data about the ventilation and built environment, could help us to formulate \"precision\" COVID-19 measures aimed specifically at each event or workplace. Centers for disease control that maintain contact tracing programs, together with workplace, venue, and facility staff, could collate these data. If digital contact tracing apps are introduced (27) , these could provide extremely rich data on the parameters in our framework, on Revent itself, and on the settings in which exposure occurred but infection did not. Our framework, together with these data, can then inform what the most effective, feasible measures are for particular settings.",
