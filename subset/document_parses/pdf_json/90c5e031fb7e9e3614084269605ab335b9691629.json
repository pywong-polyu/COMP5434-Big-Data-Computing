We estimated age-sex adjusted hypertension prevalence and rates of ATC by consumption quintile, education, age, sex, urban-rural, caste, religion, marital status, living arrangement, employment status, health insurance, and state. We used concentration indices to measure socioeconomic inequalities and multivariable logistic regression to estimate fully adjusted differences in these outcomes. Study limitations included reliance on BP measurement on a single occasion, missing measurements of BP for some participants, and lack of data on nonadherence to medication.",

Monitoring the success of such programs, and targeting them effectively, requires evidence on rates of diagnosis, treatment, and blood pressure (BP) control among those with hypertension. However, to our knowledge, there were no estimates of hypertension awareness, treatment, and control (ATC) obtained from a nationally representative sample of the middle-aged and older population throughout the whole of India. Estimates from a nationally representative sample of the population aged 18 to 49 [13] and from samples that included older adults but did not have nationwide coverage [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] did not permit, without imposing strong assumptions, evaluation of hypertension management across the country in the age group most prone to the condition and its related risks. Lack of evidence on variation in hypertension ATC among middle-aged and older (hereafter, \"older\") adults across states and sociodemographic groups limited assessment of equity and effectiveness of hypertension care and constrained ability to target interventions on the subpopulations of older adults that have the greatest potential to gain.",

Estimates of statespecific averaged marginal effects presented in S12 We found substantial geographic and socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of hypertension and in its diagnosis, treatment, and control. The states with the highest prevalence included those most advanced in the demographic transition, such as Kerala, and the high-income states, such as Goa and the capital Delhi. While prevalence tended to be lower in the low-or middle-income states and it was relatively low in all 4 states with the highest rates of poverty (Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh) [21] -these states also achieved lower rates of ATC. Consequently, we would expect cross-state variation in CVDs arising from uncontrolled hypertension to have been less strongly associated with economic development than was hypertension itself. Those living in poorer states were at lower risk of hypertension. If they were hypertensive, however, they were also more vulnerable to diseases associated with the risk factor because they were less likely to have been diagnosed, treated, and controlled. However, the examples of Jammu and Kashmir and West Bengal demonstrated that higher rates of ATC could be achieved even if lower incomes constrained available resources. The reasons why some states performed better than others at similar levels of economic development deserve further attention. Previous estimates of ATC rates in the older Indian population that used data on these outcomes for older people in only 6 states [17] relied on the strong assumption that the patterns observed in those states would hold in other states. We showed substantial variation across states in rates of ATC and in the socioeconomic gradient of each outcome.",

The differences likely stem from our identification of hypertension using reported diagnosis and medication/ diet restriction to control BP in addition to measured BP (S13 Table) . The higher prevalence we found among older adults located in high-income states and belonging to socioeconomically advantaged groups are consistent with the patterns previously observed in a very large sample of Indian adults aged 18+ [8] . That study could not estimate hypertension ATC, and the only previous nationally representative study of these outcomes was restricted to the 15 to 49 age range [13] . Compared with that study, we estimated a higher rate of hypertension awareness, and we estimated rates of treatment and control that are substantially higher. The differences are partly explained by the facts that we examined a much older age range and found, like other studies [17, 18] , that awareness and treatment, but not control, increased with age. Like many small, local studies of ATC in India [14] [15] [16] [17] , we found higher rates in urban areas than in rural areas. We estimated considerably higher rates of ATC than were obtained from a meta-analysis of small-scale Indian studies up to 2013 [15] . The differences may be partly attributable to the fact that we examined an older age group, as well as any improvements in the management of hypertension that have arisen from the NCD initiatives taken by the Indian government since 2013 [12] . Our findings of lower rates of ATC among men and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are consistent with other Indian studies [18, 19] .",

An observational study found that BP control achieved by public health facility patients increased from 26% at registration in the IHCI to 60% at follow-up [26] . Our findings can help identify states and sociodemographic groups to be targeted as this program is rolled out over the country.

The national NCD action plan [12] stipulates opportunistic screening for hypertension at public health facilities, which needs to be implemented effectively and extended to the more frequently used private clinics. Low rates of treatment and control of hypertension, particularly among poorer individuals and in rural areas, suggest difficulties in accessing and affording primary healthcare. Although low cost generic antihypertensives are widely available, they may not be affordable for poorest people. Nonpharmacological interventions, on the other hand, may be hard to adhere to in the long run. The large interstate variation we found in hypertension ATC presumably arises, in part, from the fact that health is a state responsibility in India. While the central government can issue guidelines and provide financial assistance for certain health services, state governments are largely responsible for the financing and management of facilities, manpower, and drug supply. Greater investment by both national and state governments in hypertension management is infeasible in the short term as the health system is straining to cope with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. But the fact that older adults with chronic conditions, such as hypertension, are most likely to succumb to this illness and need high-cost medical care emphasizes that investment in hypertension screening and management can potentially pay off in the long term through reduced demands on the health system.",

Some of the participants with a high BP reading will have been false positives. This is likely to have pushed the estimates toward overestimation of hypertension prevalence and underestimation of rates of awareness and treatment among those who had hypertension. We could think of no reason for this measurement error to have varied systematically across sociodemographic groups or states, and so it may not have biased estimates of socioeconomic and geographic inequalities in awareness and treatment. BP could not be measured for almost 9% of LASI participants. While this percentage is not especially high for a general purpose population survey of older adults, the fact that BP measurements were slightly less likely to be obtained from some sociodemographic groups (S1 Table) that had higher hypertension prevalence and rates of ATC may have pushed the estimates of population averages toward some underestimation of both prevalence and ATC. Taken together, these two data limitations arising from measurement of BP on a single occasion and systematic differences in non-measurement of BP are likely to have had offsetting effects on the estimate of hypertension prevalence but potentially compounding, downward effects on estimates of ATC. We may have underestimated the extent to which hypertension is diagnosed, treated, and controlled in the older Indian population, on average. However, this potential bias in the estimates of the averages does not call into question the findings that rates of ATC are substantially lower in less privileged socioeconomic groups and differ substantially across states.",

While the main contribution of this study was to add nationally representative evidence on hypertension ATC in the older population of India in which the condition is more prevalent, a limitation is that the sample did not include adults aged below 45, except for spouses. Given India's large and young population, there is a large absolute number of younger adults with hypertension in the country [8] . Our analysis did not extend to this population, although the age differences we observed would suggest that awareness and treatment, and, possibly, also BP control, may well have been even lower at younger ages. Prenissl and colleagues [13] provided evidence on hypertension ATC at aged 15 to 49, and this study should be viewed as complementary to that one.",

            "text": "A final limitation, which is also common to other care cascade studies, is the presumption of a \"treat-to-target\" approach to hypertension management with the target set to controlling BP <140/90 mm Hg. Recent guidelines have defined hypertension at lower thresholds [29] , aimed for BP control at lower levels [29, 30] , and advocated a \"benefit-based\" approach that involves offering hypertension therapy to patients at high CVD risk even if their BP is below the hypertension threshold [29, 31, 32] . This new approach is based on evidence that even someone with \"normal\" BP according to the thresholds used in this study could benefit from BP therapy that substantially reduces their elevated CVD risk. It suggests that the evidence we presented may understate gaps that existed in the treatment and control of BP in India [33] .",

The figure shows concentration curves, which depict relative inequality in an outcome in relation to a measure of socioeconomic status (O'Donnell and colleagues 2008). For example, the curve in the top-left panel traces the cumulative proportion of hypertension cases (y-axis) against the cumulative proportion of participants ranked from the poorest (left) to the richest (right) (x-axis) based on MPCE. The other curves trace the cumulative proportion of participants with hypertension who are aware, treated, and controlled (y-axis) against the cumulative proportion ranked from poorest to richest. Shading around the curves indicates 95% CIs. Each curve lies below the respective 45-degree line, which indicates that there is a disproportionate concentration of hypertension cases among richer participants and that among those with hypertension, ATC are also disproportionately concentrated among the richer participants.

While these rates indicated substantial gaps in hypertension management among the older population of India, they were higher than estimates previously obtained from samples restricted to, or including, younger people.",
