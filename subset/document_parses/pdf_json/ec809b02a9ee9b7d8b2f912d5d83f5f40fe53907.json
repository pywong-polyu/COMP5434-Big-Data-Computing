            "text": "3 SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic to older adults and persons with high risk factors and can develop into severe, life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the genus Betacoronavirus. 3 SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells by binding its spike glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and releases its viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm after uncoating. After entry, the viral RNA genome subjects the cell to translation of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed into individual non-structural proteins. Nsp5, also known as 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) or the main protease, is a cysteine protease responsible for cleaving 11 distinct sites of the polyproteins to transform into mature functional proteins. 3CL pro plays a critical role in viral replication, and its inhibition prevents formation of replication-essential enzymes, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thus inhibiting viral replication. 4 Viral proteases are well-validated drug targets for treating human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus and have been used in various approved oral drugs. 5 Additionally, the antiviral efficacy of the 3CL pro inhibitor would likely be unaffected by and not induce mutations of the spike protein, which often occur in SARS-CoV-2 variants, because the 3CL pro and spike protein are distinct proteins encoded in different regions of the viral genome. Thus, 3CL pro is an attractive target for small-molecule oral therapeutics for treating COVID-19. Recent reports have revealed that peptide-like 3CL pro inhibitors with reactive \"warheads\" show potent antiviral activities in vitro, and some of these drugs reduced viral loads in vivo in SARS-CoV-2-infected human ACE2 transgenic mouse models. 6, 7 Recently, Pfizer reported good results from a clinical study of the peptidic, covalent oral 3CL pro inhibitor, PF-07321332, which is dosed with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic (PK) 4 booster. 8 However, challenges remain for improving the target selectivity and PK profiles of peptide-like covalent inhibitors owing to the intrinsic nature of the reactivity, low membrane permeability and low metabolic stability. 9-11 Hence, non-peptidic, non-covalent smallmolecule inhibitors have attracted much attention; however, their potency and PK profiles must be further optimized. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Here, we describe the discovery of S-217622, the first non-peptidic, non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro inhibitor clinical candidate for treating COVID-19, and its preclinical characterization. S-217622 displayed antiviral activity in vitro towards a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants and coronavirus families, favorable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) profiles for the oral agents, and dose-dependent antiviral efficacy in vivo, indicating its potential for once-daily oral treatment of COVID-19.",

First, we investigated pharmacophores in the binding site of 3CL pro based on the interactions of known inhibitors because applying the pharmacophore filter to the docking screening helps enrich the virtual-screening hit rate. 17 3CL pro is a cysteine protease with a Cys145-His41 catalytic dyad in its active site, which strongly recognizes P1 Gln and P2 Leu/Met/Phe/Val as its substrates. 6 These substrate-like substructures are shared with the potent peptide-like inhibitors, GC-376 7 and N3 18 , a Gln-mimic lactam moiety in the",

Non-covalent small-molecule inhibitors, such as ML188, 12 ML300, 13, 14 and the 3-aminopyridine-like compound of the Postera COVID moonshot project, 15 ,16 exhibit similar pharmacophores, which form a hydrogen bond with the side-chain NH donor of His163 in the S1 pocket and have fitted lipophilic moieties in the S2 pocket (Figure 2b, c) . Additionally, the hydrogen bond with the Glu166 main-chain NH recognizes the P2 main-chain carbonyl of the substrate and is conserved in the known inhibitors. Given these interactions, we hypothesized that these three pharmacophores, i.e., the acceptor site with the side-chain NH donor of His163 in the S1 pocket, the lipophilic site in the S2 pocket, and the acceptor site with the Glu166 mainchain NH, play critical roles in small-molecule binding (Figure 2d ). 7 We performed docking-based virtual screening using the crystal structures of the 3CL pro and ML188-like non-covalent small molecules (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code: 6w63). 19 Compounds from the in-house library were docked, then the pharmacophore filter described above was applied to each docking pose, and the 300 top-scoring compounds were evaluated via enzymatic assays using mass spectrometry to avoid the false positives that frequently occur in fluorescence-based assays, giving some hit compounds with IC50 < 10 \u03bcM.",

First, for a better fit with the S1' pocket, we optimized the P1' ligand while keeping the hydrogen bond with Thr26. As a result, compound 2, having 6-chloro-2-methyl-2H-indazole as a P1' ligand, displayed a 90-fold improvement in enzymatic inhibitory activity while maintaining the favorable DMPK profile. Next, the P1 methyl-amide moiety was replaced with a range of heterocyclic compounds, thus yielding compound 3, which eventually became the clinical 11 candidate, S-217622. S-217622 showed a biochemical activity of IC50 = 0.013 \u03bcM, an antiviral activity of EC50 = 0.37 \u03bcM, and preferable DMPK profiles for oral dosing, such as high metabolic stability (96% and 88% in human and rat liver microsomes, respectively), high oral absorption (97%) and low clearance (1.70 mL/min/mg) in rats ( Figure 3 , Tables S1-S3). Furthermore, S-217622 showed even better DMPK profiles in monkeys and dogs than in rats, with low clearance, long half-lives (t1/2) of approximately 10 and 30 hours in monkeys and dogs, respectively, and high oral bioavailability for all animals tested, suggesting its potential use for once-daily treatment of COVID-19 without requiring a PK booster such as ritonavir. Figure 5 shows the X-ray co-crystal structure of 3CL pro complexed with S-217622. In the S1 site, the 1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole unit fit to the S1 pocket, forming a hydrogen bond with the side-chain NH of His163. The distinctive His41 flip observed in 1 was maintained in the S-217622 complex, and the 2,4,5-trifluorobenzylic moiety occupied the hydrophobic S2 pocket and stacked with the side chain of His41. The P1' ligand, 6-chloro-2-methyl-2Hindazole moiety held hydrogen bonding with the Thr26 main-chain NH and hydrophobic contact with Met49 as seen in the co-crystal structure of 1.",

When we started this discovery program, most of the known inhibitors were peptide substrate mimetics with covalent warheads that bound covalently to Cys145 in the active site of 3CL pro . We assumed that these peptidic and reactive structural features would cause problems in the DMPK profile, such as low oral bioavailability due to low cell permeability, low metabolic stability, and low stability in the blood serum. Thus, we began the de novo search for non-peptidic 3CL pro inhibitors using the SBDD strategy to combat the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Virtual screening followed by biological screening yielded several hit compounds with IC50 values <10 \u00b5M, 20 and one of these hit compounds, compound 1, showed a favorable DMPK profile for an oral agent. Using the X-ray co-structure, SBDD-based structural optimization enabled >600-fold activity improvement while maintaining a good DMPK profile; this ultimately yielded the drug candidate, S-217622 (3). S-217622 (3) exhibited a favorable preclinical profile as a once-daily oral therapeutic agent for COVID-19 with promising antiviral activities to known variants of concern, a long half-life in vivo, especially in monkeys and dogs, excellent oral bioavailability, and steep efficacy in an in vivo mouse model infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

K417T, E484K, and N501Y mutations at the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 Gamma strain promote interactions with mouse ACE2. 20 Five-week-old BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 Gamma strain (hCoV-19/Japan/TY7-501/2021), and S-217622 (3) was administered orally as a 0.5% methylcellulose suspension immediately and twelve hours after infection (Figure 15 7a). Twenty-four hours after viral infection, the mice were euthanized, and the viral titers in their lung homogenates were measured. S-217622 (3) treatment reduced the intrapulmonary viral titers dose-dependently (Figure 7b). The mean viral titer was significantly lower in the S-217622 (3) treatment groups than in the vehicle treatment group (2 mg/kg vs vehicle, p = 0.0289; 8, 16 and 32 mg/kg vs vehicle, p < 0.0001). Viral titers reached near the lower limit of quantification (1.80-log10 50% tissue culture infectious dose [TCID50]/mL) at 16 and 32 mg/kg in the S-217622 (3) treatment group. The plasma concentration increased dosedependently between 2 and 32 mg/kg in the infected mice (Figure. 7c), and at doses of \u226516 mg/kg, the plasma concentration was estimated to be above the protein-adjusted-EC50 (PA-EC50) value (extrapolated to 100% mouse serum, 3.93 \u00b5mol/L = 2,090 ng/mL) over time, indicating the importance of the free plasma concentration for in vivo efficacy (Figure 7d). Although we applied twice-daily treatment in this mouse model, a once-daily treatment model could be applicable in clinical treatment because S-217622 showed a much lower clearance and longer half-lives in non-rodents than in rodents (Figure 3).
