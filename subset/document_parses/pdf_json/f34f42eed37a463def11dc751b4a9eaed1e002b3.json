            "text": "Due to the emergence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales and MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., colistin is again a part of the therapeutic arsenal for the treatment of severe bacterial infections. However, its role is under debate due to ambiguities regarding its effectiveness. 1 Furthermore, the appearance of alterations in chromosomal and/ or transferable genes conferring colistin resistance has made rapid and reliable antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for colistin challenging. 2 Disc diffusion tests are widely recognized as inadequate, while gradient strips have been shown to be unreliable to identify low-level resistance. 3 Both EUCAST and CLSI consider broth microdilution (BMD) as the reference method, while CLSI also accepts two alternative methods (disc broth elution and colistin agar test). 4 Despite this recommendation, the reliability of BMD for colistin testing has been questioned. Due to the amphipathic nature of colistin, the drug is positively charged at physiological pH, which enables the primary interaction with negatively charged lipid A in the LPS of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. 5 However, the cationic molecule also adsorbs to commonly used laboratory plastics, thus affecting the concentration of available colistin in the broth, 6, 7 resulting in a risk of overestimating the true MIC. Upon binding to target bacteria, colistin causes membrane disruption and subsequent cell death. 5 The action of colistin is considered rapid; however, substantial regrowth over time has been noted in time-kill experiments. 8, 9 Due to colistin's prompt action, assays with a short exposure time could potentially be plausible alternatives for susceptibility testing. Several methods producing either qualitative AST results or MICs have been proposed, [10] [11] [12] and recently promising results for MIC determination using a flow cytometry method (FCM) have been reported, although as a patented assay with few technical details revealed. 13 Phenotypic AST of bacteria is, by tradition, based on log 2 dilutions of antimicrobial agents. When validating new AST methods, BMD MICs are considered as a reference by both EUCAST and CLSI. According to published criteria, novel methods should achieve at least 90% MIC agreement within \u00b11 dilution step against BMD (essential agreement, EA). 14 However, by nature, BMD MICs are discrete data, meaning that the actual concentration needed to inhibit growth of a bacterial isolate could be somewhere between the measured MIC and the preceding log 2 concentration. A different way of measuring potencies of drugs is through regression analysis, using response as a function of drug concentration. This approach utilizes the effective dose to reach half-maximum response (EC 50 ) and is widely used in general pharmacology but has only occasionally been described for AST. 15, 16 In contrast to BMD MICs, EC 50 values represent continuous data from which statistical analysis can be performed, including determination of CIs. If the EC 50 approach was proven feasible for AST, these CIs could be used to define WTs, ECOFFs and for setting clinical FCM breakpoints for different drug/bug combinations.",

Even though our FCM assay appears insufficient as colistin AST for P. aeruginosa in clinical practice, in our hands it was far more specific than the Rapid Polymyxin NP TM Pseudomonas, which erroneously classified 17 of 20 susceptible strains as resistant, using BMD results as the reference. Our experience of the Rapid Polymyxin NP TM Pseudomonas test stands in stark contrast to previously published data, which suggested a specificity of 95%. However, in that paper all 40 susceptible strains had MICs of <0.5 mg/L. 12 In the current evaluation, 8 of 9 susceptible P. aeruginosa had MIC 1 mg/L, corresponding to the mode WT MIC, and several challenging isolates were included. FCM exhibited a low sensitivity for the detection of colistin resistance in High-resolution flow cytometry for colistin AST JAC Acinetobacter spp. The reason for this is not clear, but initial response to low concentrations of colistin followed by regrowth at 24 h has previously been reported in colistin-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii. 22 The clinical relevance of this phenomenon remains to be explored. Several new methods for detection of mcr-mediated resistance have been suggested. However, since these are usually based on detecting the gene or the gene product, they can at best predict resistance but never guarantee susceptibility. 23, 24 Even though the FCM assay is not exclusively specific for plasmid-mediated colistin resistance, it exhibited excellent ability to identify low-grade resistant isolates carrying mcr. All resistant mcr-positive E. coli had MICs of 4 mg/L, while their corresponding EC 50 s ranged from 3.3 to 5.7 mg/L. For the only K. pneumoniae with confirmed mcr-1, the EC 50 was 10.9 mg/L and its corresponding MIC 8 mg/L. In K. pneumoniae, resistance to colistin is commonly mediated through chromosomal changes in mgrB, eventually leading to lipid A modifications. The FCM assay was able to identify all resistant isolates with confirmed mgrB truncations, as well as two isolates classified as susceptible by BMD. One additional BMD susceptible isolate was identified as resistant by FCM. WGS of these discrepant isolates showed genetic changes fully compatible with colistin resistance in all three strains. Their BMD MICs were all at the high end of the WT range (1 mg/L), two of the three isolates were also detected as resistant using the Rapid Polymyxin NP TM test and all three grew after 48 h of incubation on Superpolymyxin TM agar, a commercially available agar plate for the screening of colistin resistance in Gram-negatives (ELITech MICROBIO) (data not shown). 25 Although preliminary, these data indicate that in certain circumstances, FCM may be superior to BMD in identifying chromosomal resistance to colistin. Ekelund et al. Table 3 . High-resolution flow cytometry for colistin AST JAC One K. pneumoniae isolate (COL-72) with an mgrB truncation due to an ISKpn26-like element was classified as susceptible by both BMD and FCM. While the IS and insertion site in this isolate are identical to what previously has been described in colistin-resistant strains, this isolate also had an SNV leading to an N253T amino acid substitution in phoQ, which has been hypothesized to render mgrB-disrupted strains susceptible to colistin. 26, 27 FCM-based AST methods have been described previously, most recently by Fonseca and colleagues, who presented a patented method for colistin AST. 13, 28 In contrast to that assay, our method utilizes standard laboratory equipment and widely available reagents. Even though this evaluation was performed using an acoustic flow cytometer, the assay could theoretically be run on other flow cytometers with sufficient resolution for small particle detection. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] However, the performance of the assay needs to be evaluated on each platform before considering it for use on clinical samples. Although the previously described method seems to produce a higher degree of essential MIC agreement, a direct comparison is difficult due to the absence of strain-specific data in the published papers (e.g. species-specific MIC data and genotypic data other than mcr). Moreover, in a recent publication by Castanheira et al., 35 BMD retesting of 200 K. pneumoniae isolates resulted in EA of only 60%, indicating reproducibility issues also with the refence method.",

However, we believe that the last limitation has had only a minor impact, if any, on the results and that such an impact would rather have led to an underestimation of the performance of FCM-based MIC prediction than the opposite.",

The assay revealed possible resistance in three K. pneumoniae isolates genetically compatible with acquired colistin resistance that were not detected by the BMD method, indicating that BMD in its current form is not optimal for colistin resistance detection and that there may be room for other, faster and equally or more accurate methods such as FCM.
