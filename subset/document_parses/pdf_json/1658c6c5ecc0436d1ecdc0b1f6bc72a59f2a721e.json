            "text": "Following the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was first described in Western Europe in April 2020 [1] . This syndrome temporally follows SARS-CoV-2 infection by 2-6 weeks and is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, multiorgan involvement, and severe disease requiring hospitalization [2] . Although the majority of patients recover without long-term sequelae [3] , some develop myocardial dysfunction, shock, and respiratory failure requiring intensive care [2, [4] [5] [6] . A variety of treatment approaches have been adopted for MIS-C, which include intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, immunomodulating agents, aspirin, and anticoagulants [2, 4, 5] , all of which have potential risks and uncertain benefits. Distinguishing MIS-C from alternative etiologies and identifying biomarkers of severity at the time of presentation could better inform patient management.",

Evidence of immune cell activation, mucosal inflammation, auto-antibody formation, and cytokine storm has also been reported [8, 11] . While previous studies have described the generalized hypercytokinemia observed in MIS-C [10, 12] , the clinical correlates, predictive value, and time course of individual and collective cytokines are incompletely understood. In this study, we aimed to describe the distinguishing serologic and cytokine signatures associated with MIS-C diagnosis and clinical outcomes. The detailed clinical data from the cohort are the subject of a future manuscript (in review).

Compared to patients with acute COVID-19, patients with MIS-C had significantly higher peak C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, brain natriuretic protein (BNP), proBNP, and troponin levels, and significantly lower nadirs of platelet count and absolute lymphocyte count, which are consistent with our previous data [7] . Among our cohort, patients with MIS-C were also significantly more likely to require vasopressors and to have an adverse cardiac outcome (defined as decreased cardiac function, myocarditis, pericardial effusion, mitral regurgitation, or coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm) compared to patients with COVID-19. The median duration of hospitalization was 5 (IQR, 4-7) days for patients with MIS-C, 63.6% required intensive care, and all survived.",

Interestingly, children with acute MIS-C aged 0-5 and 6-12 years had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG titers than adolescent patients 13-20 years of age. One possible explanation of this finding is that older children with MIS-C may be more likely to present concurrently with acute COVID-19, prior to their development of high-titer SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [2] . In contrast to patients with acute COVID-19, patients with MIS-C had significant declines in SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG titers during early convalescence. This may be primarily attributed to the timing of acute MIS-C following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which typically follows peak COVID-19 transmission in the community by 2-6 weeks [4, 21, 22] . Nevertheless, this natural waning of RBD immune response may inform the optimal timing of vaccination post-MIS-C, as susceptibility to reinfection likely increases with time following the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition to having high titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, patients with MIS-C had significant elevations of multiple proinflammatory and Th1-type cytokines, consistent with a cytokine storm. Although the term cytokine storm lacks a strict definition, it has been described as the dysregulated release of interleukins, interferons, tumor necrosis factors, and other small-molecule mediators that results in broad immune cell activation and an end-organ damage [23] . Hypercytokinemia, and specifically elevations in IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1, has been associated with severe outcomes and death among adult patients with COVID-19 [24, 25] . However, less is known about the cytokine signatures of pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C. In this study, we found that IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, and IFN-\u03b3 were strongly associated with the diagnosis of MIS-C. These results overlap with the findings of previously published reports of cytokine analyses in smaller cohorts of patients with MIS-C. For example, Consiglio et al found that IL-6 and CXCL10 contributed to the cytokine storm observed in patients with MIS-C [11] . Diorio et al found that the most discriminatory cytokines among a small cohort of patients with MIS-C and severe COVID-19 were IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 [26] . Moreover, Gruber et al found IL-6 and IL-17A to be elevated in MIS-C, in addition to other cytokines involved in inflammation, lymphocytic and myeloid cell chemotaxis and activation, and mucosal immune dysregulation [8] .",

The unique serologic and cytokine signatures we identified could add diagnostic and prognostic value for patients presenting with signs and symptoms compatible with MIS-C. The diagnosis of MIS-C in the United States is currently based upon meeting the CDC case definition, which requires the presence of fever, multiorgan involvement, systemic inflammation, lack of an alternative explanatory diagnosis, and epidemiologic link or positive test for SARS-CoV-2. However, clinical features overlap with other inflammatory syndromes and there is concern that the increasing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, both due to natural infection and vaccination, may confound the interpretation of spike or RBD SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in cases of suspected MIS-C. In our cohort, we found that almost all patients with MIS-C had high titers of RBD IgG antibodies, and that RBD titers correlated with nucleocapsid IgG titers with the log-titer levels having a strong linear association. Thus, quantitative nucleocapsid serology is likely to retain applicability as a biomarker of MIS-C in the setting of widespread pediatric immunization with spike protein-based vaccines. Nevertheless, few prognostic indicators have been identified for either short-or long-term MIS-C outcomes. In our study, we found that IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly associated with prolonged duration of hospitalization, but not other categorical outcomes. Elevations in at least 3 of the 4 cytokines was also associated with elevated peak D-dimer and decreased platelet nadir, both of which are thought to contribute to MIS-C pathophysiology. All cytokine levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months, suggesting that MIS-C represents a transient state of immune activation and hyperinflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Current treatment strategies commonly include intravenous immunoglobulin, systemic corticosteroids, or immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies, such as the IL-1\u03b2 inhibitor anakinra. All of these interventions target broad or specific components of the inflammatory cascade, to reduce the risk that the transient state of immune activation leads to end-organ damage. However, the underlying trigger for the systemic hyperinflammatory response remains elusive. A recent study demonstrated that persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tracts of patients with MIS-C was associated with a breakdown of mucosal integrity and subsequent spike protein antigenemia and hyperinflammation [27] . While this explanation could correspond with the prominent gastrointestinal symptoms observed in MIS-C, the finding of SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia has not been universal [28] . The reasons why antigenemia may trigger delayed but not acute systemic hyperinflammation are similarly unclear. Interestingly, Kumar et al found significantly elevated markers of microbial translocation in children with MIS-C, which could contribute to systemic inflammatory responses [29] . Future studies are needed to elucidate MIS-C pathogenesis and to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of various treatment modalities upon MIS-C outcomes.",

Limitations include the small numbers of convalescent samples available and the lack of long-term follow-up. The inclusion criteria of our study may have limited enrollment of clinically ambiguous cases that did not meet the prespecified case definitions. We did not assess serologic and cytokine profiles of other pediatric hyperinflammatory conditions, such as Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome. From a diagnostic standpoint, the comparison of immune profiles with acute COVID-19 may have greatest applicability to adolescents and/ or adults with MIS-A, who have a more heterogeneous clinical presentation that often overlaps with acute COVID-19 [30, 31] . We were unable to evaluate treatment effects on serologic and cytokine profiles and clinical outcomes, although there were no pediatric deaths due to MIS-C and available convalescent samples showed cytokine normalization. We did not measure neutralizing antibody responses, although we and others have previously shown that these correlate with SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG binding antibodies [7, 32] . Similarly, we were unable to evaluate associations between serologic and cytokine profiles with nasopharyngeal viral load by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Although the vaccination status of the children was not prospectively collected, all enrollments preceded the US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization of COVID-19 vaccination for children <16 years of age. Enrollments also preceded the surges of SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants in the United States. The effects of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern on MIS-C disease pathogenesis and clinical responses remain areas of active research.",
