However, COVID-19 is similar to SARS and MERS with regard to clinical manifestations and imaging features. Considering the experiences with SARS and MERS treatments, CT is more sensitive and specific than X-rays and can identify the abnormalities in the lungs earlier [21, 22] . In addition, 5 patients underwent chest radiography along with chest CT examinations in a recent study. Of these, 2 patients had normal chest radiography findings, despite also having CT examinations performed on the same day that showed ground-glass opacity (GGO). Moreover, the chest radiography findings of the other 3 patients did not show the peripheral predominance that was visible on their respective CT scans [23] . The reason for the negative chest radiography findings in patients with COVID-19 might be twofold. First, chest radiography is not sensitive for the detection of GGO which may not have been of sufficient density to be seen on radiographs. Moreover, these faint opacities initially within the basal and retrocardiac location of the lungs may have been difficult to see as they may have been obscured by the overlying diaphragm in the frontal view and by mediastinal structures in the lateral view. Therefore, chest radiography is not recommended as the first-line imaging modality for COVID-19. However, chest radiography is valuable in the treatment of COVID-19. The systematic quantitative evaluation of sequential chest radiographs in severely ill patients can be used to dynamically monitor the illness state of patients when CT is not available or when severely ill patients cannot be moved. In summary, chest radiography could be normal in a patient with COVID-19 even after the onset and progression of typical clinical symptoms. CT has a higher sensitivity than chest radiography with abnormalities in the lungs being identified earlier. Thus, CT may be used as an initial investigative tool in patients with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 206, "end": 210, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 481, "end": 485, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 486, "end": 489, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 910, "end": 914, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Typical imaging features of COVID-19"}, {"text": "So far, only seven case series [18, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] and some case reports [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] have investigated the chest CT imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia. According to these reports, patients with COVID-19 can show typical imaging features at the early stages of the disease. Chest CT plays an important role in the screening and preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Among the first 41 COVID-19 patients that were laboratory-confirmed in Wuhan before January 2, a limited analysis of chest imaging showed all patients had abnormalities in chest CT, and 40 (98%) of them had bilateral lung involvement. In this study, it was found that patients with severe cases who were on admission were more likely to have bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation, while admitted patients with mild cases were more likely to have bilateral GGO and subsegmental areas of consolidation [18] . Similar characteristics were found in another 51-person study cohort: most pulmonary lesions involved bilateral lungs with multiple lung lobes, and were mainly distributed in the posterior and peripheral part of the lungs. Moreover, 39(77%) patients had pure GGO on CT, 38(75%) had GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening on CT, 30 (59%) had GGO with consolidation on CT scans, while 28(55%) had pure consolidation on CT scans. Notably, consolidation is considered a sign of disease progression. Younger patients tended to have more GGO, while older patients tended to show more pulmonary consolidation. This is also consistent with the phenomenon where the prognosis of young patients is better than that of elderly patients [24] . Chung et al. found that the crazy-paving pattern often appeared in patients with COVID-19 in addition to the above-mentioned characteristics, while lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent [25] . One study reviewed the recent literature to synthesize the findings of 233 patients infected with COVID-19, and all studies showed consistent findings, with GGO and consolidation being the most common findings on CT [23] . In other reports, CT images of these patients showed the same typical imaging feature [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . It is not difficult to see that the CT of patients with COVID-19 has special characteristics, with the predominant features outlined as follows: (1) single or multiple GGO, which is mainly a subpleural distribution; (2) crazy paving; (3) patchy GGO with segmental pulmonary consolidation; (4) pulmonary consolidation [38, 39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 31, "end": 35, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 36, "end": 40, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 41, "end": 45, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 46, "end": 50, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 51, "end": 55, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 56, "end": 60, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 61, "end": 65, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 88, "end": 92, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 93, "end": 97, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 98, "end": 102, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 103, "end": 107, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 108, "end": 112, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 113, "end": 117, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 118, "end": 122, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 123, "end": 127, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 128, "end": 132, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 953, "end": 957, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1703, "end": 1707, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1958, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2177, "end": 2181, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2270, "end": 2274, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2275, "end": 2279, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2280, "end": 2284, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2285, "end": 2289, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2290, "end": 2294, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2295, "end": 2299, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2304, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2305, "end": 2309, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2310, "end": 2314, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2634, "end": 2638, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2639, "end": 2642, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Typical imaging features of COVID-19"}, {"text": "COVID-19 pneumonia has nonspecific and diverse chest CT imaging features, which are closely related to pathology. By investigating the pathological characteristics of patients who died from COVID-19, bilateral diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with cellular fibromyxoid exudates were noted, indicating the acute respiratory distress syndrome [40] . The pathological features of COVID-19 are extremely similar to those of SARS and MERS [41, 42] . The main lung pathology in SARS and MERS is DAD in various stages, which is basically the histological prototype of acute lung injury [43, 44] . According to the previous pathological mechanism of SARS, the emergence of GGO suggests that SARS-CoV-2 causes airspace exudates, and pauci-inflammatory alveolar and interstitial oedema [45] . Crazy paving appearance consists of GGO with superimposed interlobular and intralobular septal thickening, reflecting interstitial lesions [46] . Bilateral extensive consolidation of the lungs results from a combination of the large number of desquamated and exudate cells and protein exudates that congest the lung tissues, and the extensive formation of hyaline membranes in the alveoli. Pulmonary nodules are not the typical imaging features of COVID-19. However, Li et al. reported an interesting case where a young woman with COVID-19 had a single right upper lobe nodule with the halo sign [47] .

In a retrospective study, the analysis of the CT images of 21 patients showed that most patients had single or multiple GGOs in the early stages of the disease, and the scope of GGOs continued to expand with disease progression. In the later stages of COVID-19, GGO is often combined with other imaging features, such as pulmonary consolidation, crazy paving appearance, etc. [27] .

Although angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a potential receptor of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, different affinities of spike protein and ACE2 receptors may be one of the reasons for the difference [64] . Regarding MERS, there is a tendency for a basilar and subpleural distribution. Moreover, the presence of pleural effusion and pneumothorax can be considered an important predictor of a poor outcome; these features are rare in SARS and COVID-19. Moreover, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure than SARS and COVID-19 [65] . In addition to SARS and MERS, other viral pneumonia, non-viral pneumonia, and other non-infectious diseases, such as influenza pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia, mycoplasmal pneumonia, etc., are differential diagnoses that should be considered [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] .

Although positive nucleic acid testing is still the gold standard diagnosis, with regard to the typical clinical diagnosis, Wuhan exposure or close contact history, CT features can be used for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 infection despite negative nucleic acid test results.
