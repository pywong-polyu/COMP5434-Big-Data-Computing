The control is done by means of the reproduction number, i.e., the number of secondary infections produced by a primary infection, which represents an external intervention that we assume time-dependent. Moreover, the control function can only be applied over a finite time interval, and the duration of the most strict quarantine (smallest possible reproduction number) is also bounded. We consider a maximization problem where the cost functional has two terms: one is the number of susceptible individuals in the long-term and the other depends on the cost of interventions. When the intervention term is linear with respect to the control, we obtain that the optimal solution is bang-bang, and we characterize the times to begin and end the strict quarantine. In the general case, when the cost functional includes the term that measures the intervention cost, we analyze the optimality of controls through numerical computations.",

Although these kinds of measures are helpful in reducing the virus transmission and giving time to health systems to adapt, they could be extremely stressful in terms of economic and social costs, and, in longer periods, tend to have less compliance with the population.",

We consider that infection and recovery rates are allowed to change over time, and that are homogeneous among the population, instead of heterogeneous rates as in [4, 7] .

On its part, control problems with non-pharmaceutical interventions were less studied. Non-pharmaceutical interventions can range from a mild mitigation policy to a strong suppression policy. As discussed by Ferguson et al. in [6] , a suppression policy \"aims to reverse epidemic growth, reducing case numbers to low levels and maintaining that situation indefinitely\". Suppression can be achieved by restricting travels, closing schools and nonessential businesses, banning social gatherings, and asking citizens to shelter in place. These measures, often referred to as a lock-down, are highly restrictive on social rights and damaging to the economy. In contrast, a mitigation policy \"focuses on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread\". Mitigation measures may involve discouraging air travel while encouraging remote working, requiring companies to provide physical separation between workers, banning large gatherings, isolating the vulnerable, and identifying and quarantining contagious individuals and their recent contacts.",

At the beginning of the epidemic, when no one in the population is immune, infected individuals will infect R 0 other people on average. Let us observe that, for R 0 < 1, the number of new cases decline, and when R 0 > 1, the number of new cases grows. However, at any time t > 0, the effective reproduction number R t replaces R 0 , since the number of contacts between infected and susceptible agents is reduced due to the interactions with recovered individuals that are immune. Hence, the epidemic grows until a sufficient fraction of the population becomes infected, and after reaching a peak starts to gradually decline. Following [6] , the suppression phase can achieve R 0 < 1, while the mitigation measures are unlikely to bring R 0 below 1. Therefore, the number of new cases are expected to decline during the suppression phase and to start rising again during the mitigation phase, although at a slower rate than in a non-intervention scenario.",

To account for quarantine measures, we consider a time-dependent contact rate. Using an optimal control approach we derive the necessary optimality conditions, and we show that the optimal strategy is of bang-bang type. Moreover, we characterize the time to start and finish the lock-down during the intervention phase.

Moreover, it is assumed that the strict lock-down can last during the whole intervention, which seems to be impracticable. As we will see below, suppression measures can be applied at different points of the interval [0, T ] depending on the initial proportion of infected individuals.

Our main result, theorem 2, characterizes the optimal control in a fixed time interval [0, T ] as a bang-bang control, with suppression measures in some interval of maximal length \u03c4 , and mitigation measures applied at the start or at the end (or both) of the pandemic. Hence, it makes sense to apply mild mitigation measures, followed by a strong lockdown, and then mild mitigation measures again when the hypothesis of item 2 of the theorem are satisfied. In particular, this hypothesis is satisfied when the lockdown is very strict and the initial fraction of susceptible individuals is larger than 1/R 0 . There are different ways to justify this policy given in item 2 from theorem 3 using theorem 2: the first one is to consider a mitigation policy close to no intervention, and the continuity of solutions with respect to coefficients of the system of differential equations implies that the solutions obtained from theorem 2 are also close, hence if we are under hypothesis given by condition 2, the time to start the strong lockdown could not be the initial time. Another one is to consider a New Normal, where mild mitigation measures will remain forever: in this case we can apply directly theorem 2 and again we get solutions where the strong lockdown starts after some interval of time. Finally, numerical simulations in Section 6 support all these results.",

All curves start at (x 0 , y 0 ) = (0.999999, 0.000001) and follow the top curve with soft quarantine (\u03c3 = \u03c3 0 ) until the hard quarantine starts at t (\u03c3 = \u03c3 1 = 0), vertically falling down up to a lower level curve when the soft quarantine starts, and finally following this curve until the fixed point (x \u221e , 0) is asymptotically reached. The vertical trajectory describes the evolution within the hard quarantine where x(t) remains constant, given that \u03c3(t) = \u03c3 1 = 0 in that period. The optimum time t * that leads to the maximum of x \u221e corresponds to the time for which y(t) drops to the lowest level curve in the interval [t, t + \u03b7] (pink curve). For \u03c4 = 60 < 72.9 = \u03c4 (Fig. 7 top panels) we see that the maximum of x \u221e is reached starting the hard quarantine at t * = t = 2527.1, where the effective reproduction number is R \u03c30 t = R \u03c30 t+\u03b7 = 1, and thus there is no new outbreak when the hard quarantine is released ( dy dt | t+\u03b7 = 0). In this case the entire quarantine period \u03b7 = \u03c4 is used. For \u03c4 < \u03c4 = 120 <\u03c4 = 212.2 ( Fig. 7 middle panels) the optimum initial time is t * = T \u2212 \u03c4 = 2480 < t, obtained by still using the entire hard quarantine period but starting earlier than t. Finally, for \u03c4 = 260 >\u03c4 (Fig. 7 bottom panels) the optimum is t * =t = 2387.8 > T \u2212 \u03c4 = 2340, where it turns more effective to use the hard quarantine for a shorter time T \u2212 t * < \u03c4 . Notice that implementing a shorter but later hard quarantine is more efficient than using a longer and earlier hard quarantine, as we can see by comparing \u03c3(t) for \u03b7 = 260 and \u03b7 = 212.2 in the bottom panels for the \u03c4 = 260 case.",

We also point out that we have employed a novel proof to establish our analytical results. Moreover, some numerical examples have been provided to show the validity of our theoretical results. Given a fixed time of intervention T where control strategies can be applied, and a strict quarantine period \u03c4 < T that represents the maximum time lapse for the stronger intervention, we proved that the optimal strategy is bang-bang when the second term of the cost functional is linear with respect to the control.

However, for an initial condition that corresponds to a real-life case scenario in which the percentage of the population that is infected is small when non-pharmaceutical interventions start, we obtained that the optimal strategy consists on delaying the beginning of the lock-down (items 2-4 from theorem 2).
