Although such endorsements could be economical and easily accessible in various low per-capita countries, the experimental evidence on the effectiveness of such recommendations is still lacking. In this regard, we carried out a detailed experimental investigation to study the fate of a large-sized surrogate cough droplet impingement at different velocities (corresponding to mild to severe coughs) on various locally procured cloth fabrics. Observation shows that larger ejected droplets (droplets that would normally settle as fomites in general) during a coughing event have enough momentum to penetrate singlelayer cloth masks; the penetrated volume atomize into smaller daughter droplets that fall within aerosol range, thereby increasing infection potential. Theoretically, two essential criteria based on the balances of viscous dissipation-kinetic energy and surface tension-kinetic energy effects have been suggested for the droplet penetration through mask layers. Furthermore, a new parameter called g (the number density of pores for a fabric) is developed to characterize the volume penetration potential and subsequent daughter droplet size. Finally, the effect of mask washing frequency is analyzed. The outcomes from the current study can be used as a guide in selecting cloth fabrics for stitching multi-layered.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is spread through pathogen-loaded respiratory droplets. 1, 2 The transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 through the virus-loaded respiratory droplets ejected during coughing is drastically higher 3, 4 compared to other respiratory infections. Environmental droplet contamination is caused when these virus-loaded respiratory droplets are ejected into the atmosphere through breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, or sneezing by an infected person. Larger droplets tend to settle as fomites; 5, 6 however, the primary concern lies with the smaller aerosolized droplets that remain suspended in air and can be inhaled by healthy individuals. The infection probability depends on the initial viral load and other factors like viral endurance in different ambient conditions like temperature and relative humidity. A statistical meta-analysis done by various research groups worldwide has recommended wearing face masks as a control measure against both symptomatic and asymptomatic spreads. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Approximately 100 nm in diameter, COVID-19 is a positive-strand RNA virus and makes its way from the nose to lungs. The virus spike protein attaches to the ACE2 receptor, following which the virus particle is endocytosed into the cells, and the infection cycle starts. The first line of defense that remains for us is using a facemask.",

            "text": "The masks act as a physical barrier to respiratory droplets, but the effectiveness of cloth-mask depends on the design, texture, and textile material used. 12 Human simulators are used to check how far the droplets travel with and without different types of masks while speaking and coughing. All types of masks have been effective in reducing the environmental droplet contamination range around a source. 13, 14 Another experimental investigation has been carried out by Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 15 with a horizontal spray of bacterialaden droplets where they studied the deposition concentration at different distances from the spray with and without a textile barrier. Different research groups have investigated the filtration efficiency of a surgical mask, procedure mask, and different types of cloth masks. Based on observations, the double layer mask when used with a better fit has a comparatively higher filtration efficiency. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Mask studies can be ideally incorporated in the available multiscale physics-based disease spread model to estimate the probability of infection. 21 Fluid dynamically droplet impact on a facemask is similar to impingement on porous networks like metallic wire meshes, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] fibers, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] and textiles. 31 Sharma et al. 32 focused on the effect of the number of layers present in a surgical mask and showed that the number of cough droplets penetrating through the mask is significantly reduced with each additional mask layer. The experiments were performed for droplet sizes of $300-600 lm and velocity range of 2-10 m/s (Ref. 32 ) mimicking real cough events. The penetration of the impacting droplet depends on the surface wettability conditions, 20, 23, 33, 34 mesh sizes, 23, 24 fluid properties, 28 and impact velocities 23, 27 of the droplets. At higher impingement velocities above a critical impact limit, the impinging droplet will always penetrate through the fiber pores irrespective of the wettability conditions of the fabric. 28 The fragmentation of a water droplet impinging on mesh results in polydisperse droplets, 23 and a critical Reynolds number exists for the penetration of droplets to occur. 35 The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is at its worst globally, especially in the low-and mid-income countries. Almost 800 000 positive cases are reported daily throughout the world, out of which about 360 000 cases correspond to India alone, making it the worst-hit country (WHO, 29th, April 2021). The WHO recommended N95 masks cost around`95-`165 even after the government of India subsidy. 36 Despite this, the cost of the N95 mask is not affordable for the lower-income population of the country with an average daily income of`355. 37 Also even though the surgical masks are less expensive (`10/piece), they need to be bought recurrently (disposable), making them unaffordable for underprivileged groups. As a feasible solution, the usage of homemade facemask (cotton mask) or face covering (handkerchief, towel) is generally recommended by policymakers; 38 however, the quantification of the most suitable fabric is still lacking. These substitutes are popular among such populations due to breathability and convenience (as they are washable and reusable) but are not tested for penetration/aerosolization characteristics, which is done in the present study.",

These materials are not designed for masking purposes, and the aerosol-blocking/generation efficiency is not well understood, leading to a false sense of protection. This warrants a detailed study on the effectiveness of such material against aerosol dispersion. A singlelayered mask efficacy is lower than a multi-layer mask and has been investigated in the existing literature. 32 However, this remains a secondary focus of our work. We primarily focus on identifying the most suitable and easily accessible fabric for making a homemade face mask, giving a framework for manufacturer/user to select a suitable material. Since this is a fundamental study, it was preferable to investigate the effectiveness of a single layer mask and get insight into droplet penetration/atomization for different types of fabrics. The most suitable fabric can then be used as a multi-layer mask.",

            "text": "The existing experimental studies that were conducted on the efficacy of cloth masks were primarily observation based. Even though recommendations were advocated, no parameter was proposed to determine the effectiveness of the fabric in blocking the droplets. In the current study, we present evidence-based recommendations on the usage of such ordinarily available fabric materials. Furthermore, we provide insight into the physical mechanism of filtration by a mask, showing that how the fabric properties like porosity and pore size influence the extrusion of impinging model cough-droplets through the fabric. The subsequent daughter droplet size distribution, after passing through the mask, is essential to determine the lifetime of these aerosolized droplets and the extent of infection. The number count of large-sized cough droplets (!550 mm) is small. However, a significantly large percentage of the total volume is carried by these droplets as given by Duguid (1946) 39 (also replotted in the supplementary material, see Fig. S1 ) where this volume was 72.22% for droplet sizes !600 mm and 94.21% for droplet sizes !250 mm. Duguid (1946) 39 have shown a direct correlation between pathogens amount with droplet volume; therefore, the atomization of such large size droplets is relevant for disease transmission. Furthermore, such large droplets (!550 mm) will deposit on the ground when ejected in the absence of a facemask and will have a very short airborne lifetime. 40, 41 However, if the mask is worn by an infected person, though it blocks a significant fraction of the droplet volume, it causes secondary atomization through the small pores of the mask fabric. 32 The daughter droplets, thus, formed (typically of size 100 lm) fall within the aerosol range. Therefore, it may not be accurate to conjecture that any face mask is beneficial to curb the viral spread. The type of mask fabric, its properties, and the number of layers also play a vital role in deciding the efficacy. It should also be noted that the smaller droplets might bypass a single layer mask where pore size is $100 lm. Mask filtration efficiencies to such smaller sized (<100 mm) droplets have been extensively studied in the existing literature. 20, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] However, in this work, we essentially demonstrate an additional route in which a large-sized droplet impingement with a single-or multi-layer mask can atomize into smaller droplets/aerosols. This suggests an additional mechanism of aerosol transportation that could be higher than what is predicted by considering mask filtration efficiencies alone.",

A micrometersized DI water droplet (d $ 550 lm diameter) was generated at 2 to 10 m/s impinging velocities using a pressurized liquid and piezoelectric actuation-based droplet dispenser (Nordson pico-pulse). In this dispenser, the velocity and size of the ejected droplet can be varied by changing the liquid fluid pressure and valve opening time, respectively. Still, some variation in droplet sizes is observed at different velocities, which are shown in Table I . It must be noted that the droplet velocity and size vary depending on the specific event, namely, normal breathing, coughing, sneezing. However, this variation is only addressed in the present study by changing the droplet impact velocity ($2-10 m/s) and keeping a fixed droplet diameter (approximately). This choice is made as droplet penetration through a mask layer primarily depends on impact velocity, pore size and is independent of initial droplet diameter (will be shown later), which has been verified in the previous literature. 28, 32, 48 Furthermore, the focus was kept on identifying the effectiveness of different mask fabrics (resulting in different pore sizes); therefore, parametric analysis based on different droplet sizes is not analyzed.",

Veritas (Constellation 120E, 120W) light source was used to study penetration dynamics over fabric surface. The camera acquisition rate was kept at 20 000 frames per second for low-speed droplet impingement (V $ 2-6 m/s) and for high-speed (V $ 8 and 10 m/s), and 30 000 frames per second were used as shown in Fig. 2 . The penetrated droplet sizes are determined from shadowgraphy images. The captured images are binarized using intensity thresholding. From this area, the equivalent diameter is calculated to estimate the volume of each droplet. The volume summation of all such daughter droplets after impingement is done to determine the % volume penetration. The measurements were only done for droplets emerging from penetrated ligaments (after ligaments breakup into discrete daughter droplets). The obtained daughter droplet diameter of at least 20 experimental runs is then used to make the probability distribution of atomized droplets. Furthermore, for the penetrated volume quantification, the out of focus droplets (from out of focus ligaments) are assumed to contribute the same amount of volume as contributed by droplets emerging from the in-focus ligament. We have, however, minimized this error by averaging over large number of experimental visualizations from multiple azimuthal angles. The visualizations exhibit that the ligaments emerging from the pores are all of similar thickness for a given mask sample. This further ensures lower error count in volume estimation. The volume of aerosol generated is calculated based on the number of droplets below 100 lm. A scale bar has been added to all the images for displaying the spatial resolution. Image processing on the raw data was performed for edge detection to estimate the droplet size and velocity using MATLAB 2020b and ImageJ software. We used python3.7 using Anaconda environment for plotting. The movies were made using Kdenlive software. Experimental methodology is similar to Sharma et al. 32 ",

However, the We criterion indicates that except for three samples C-15_a, C-15_b, and SM-3000 at 2 m/s, penetration is possible in all other samples. Hence, by using two-part penetration criteria, it can be predicted that the droplet should not penetrate the fabric in the three samples C-15_a, C-15_b, and SM-3000 at 2 m/s (see Table IV ). Experiments are performed with different droplet diameters ranging from 250 to 650 lm for various cloth fabrics. It was found \u00f0 \u00de ; the viscous dissipation-based criterion is not effective in giving an accurate penetration prediction. However, there can be an intermediate-range of Re where both the viscous dissipation and the capillary effects can significantly contribute toward penetration criteria. It is also to be noted that affects both surface tension and viscous dissipation while t m only influences viscous dissipation. The effect of ; t m on viscous dissipation can be understood in a better fashion by their relative contributions to viscous dissipation. Lower is the value of , higher is the velocity gradient in the pore leading to higher viscous dissipation. Similarly, for a higher value of t m , more work needs to be done by the liquid to pass through the long length of the pore. Hence, the ratio tm can be used to ascertain the relative importance of viscous dissipation and capillary force, as shown in Table II . The ratio tm is found to be of the order O(1) or less when the surface tension effects are dominant; however, the value of tm is found to be of the order O\u00f010 2 \u00de or more when viscous dissipation is dominant. It is clear from Table III that  the value of tm for SM-3000 is 12.23, which is clearly an order higher than all the other samples. Also for SM-3000 at 2 m/s, the value of Re $ 55, which is at least an order less than all the other samples at all velocities. Both these arguments are sufficient to infer that at 2 m/s, the viscous dissipation criterion is effective only in the case of SM-3000 or similar masks with low pore size.",

It is the effective pore number density, g $ (available liquid flow area/total area)/(area of each pore), i.e., the number of pores available per unit area for the liquid droplet to pass through in a given fabric. Intuitively, more space available results in more penetration/chance of penetration. The local effect of pore size and pore density is normalized using this parameter that effectively reduces the multifaceted effects into one single parameter that is physically intuitive. It is clear from Fig. 6 (a) that the %volume penetrated increases with an increase in velocity. However, extreme values of g will lead to a lower % of volume penetration. For very low g (porosity is very low and pore size is very high), the effective area available for penetration is significantly less and, hence, leads to lower % volume penetration. Moreover, for the large value of g, there are high numbers of smaller pores available for penetration. These small pores provide larger resistance for droplets to penetrate due to the larger capillary forces and viscous dissipation, restricting the amount of penetrated volume percentage. The optimum values for porosity and pore size are needed to achieve a higher % of volume penetration near the intermediate values of g as shown in Fig. 6(a) .

It follows a bell-shaped trend where the maximum peak value increase and shifts toward smaller diameter sizes (left) as the impingement velocity (cough intensity) are increased, as shown in Figs. 6(c)-6(e); this implies that the probability of breakup of ligament into smaller droplets increases with higher impingement velocities. However, at lower velocities, the probability of forming larger-sized droplets is higher (see Fig. 4 ). This suggests that, at higher impingement velocities, more secondary atomization and aerosolization are observed (see Fig. 5 ). With the increase in impingement velocity, the ligaments stretch and become longer and thinner (see the supplementary material, Fig. S2 ), resulting in the formation of larger number of smaller daughter droplets. For 6 m/s, the total penetrated volume is contributed by the lesser number of larger daughter droplets. However, in the case of higher velocity i.e., 8 m/s, the total penetrated volume constitutes the summation of volume contributed by larger number of small daughter droplets. The probability density function (PDF) of droplet size is plotted for three samples having the lowest, medium, and highest g values in Figs. 6(c)-6(e), respectively. It is to be noted that very few droplets (<8) are formed at impingement velocities of 2 and 4 m/s. Hence, PDFs have been plotted for only 6, 8, 10 m/s. From Figs. 6(c)-6(e), it can be observed that for a given velocity, the maximum peak is observed to initially shift toward the right and then to the left, as g is increased (for samples C-15_b, C-55, and SM-3000, respectively). The increasing and decreasing trend in the most probable daughter droplet diameter can be explained by the increase in the pore size \u00f0) from C-15_b ($100 lm) to C-55 ($200 lm) and a decrease in the pore size from C-55 ($200 lm) to SM-3000 ($20 lm). Larger pore size leads to the increased thickness of ligaments, resulting in the formation of larger-sized droplets, i.e., away from the aerosol range (see Fig. 5 (Multimedia view) and supplementary material). However, if we compare the PDF of the two samples [see Figs. 6(c) and 6(e)], the droplet size corresponding to the maximum probability is higher in the case of SM-3000 than C-15_b despite the smaller pore size of SM-3000. This can be attributed to the fiber mesh pattern of SM-3000 [see Fig. 3 (a)], where the distance between the pores is very less due to the reduced fiber thickness (single layer), which might cause the coalescence of the ligaments emerging from adjacent pores. Coalescence can result in relatively larger droplets than expected for the corresponding pore size (see Fig. 5 ",

However, Fig. 6(a) shows that any single-layer fabric will not be beneficial to curb the spread of COVID19 as it leads to varying levels of aerosolization. The %volume penetration trend shown in Fig. 6 (a) matches with the pdf of droplet size distribution in Figs. 6(c)-6(e), where the droplet size corresponding to the maximum probability is highest in the case of C-55 [see Fig. 6(d) ]. It is to be noted that minimizing the percentage volume penetration is the primary concern of any mask to mitigate the extent of disease spreading. In Figs. 6(c)-6(e), the droplet size distribution for 6and 8 m/s differs significantly due to higher stretching of ligaments at higher velocity resulting in smaller droplet sizes compared to 6 m/s, while that the data nearly overlap for 8 and 10 m/s, which is discussed above in this section. Similar results were also reported by Sharma et al. 32 and Vontas et al., 48 where at high impact velocity (i.e., high Weber number and Reynolds number), droplet shows similar penetration volume/distribution/characteristics and variation was only observed at lower impact velocities.",

The droplet size distribution is plotted in Fig. 7 as a probability distribution function, and a bell-curve-like trend is also observed for washed samples, which peaks at a droplet size of around $80 lm.",

Thus, both the viscous dissipation and We criteria are necessary for an effective prediction of penetration for any given sample at any given impingement velocity. These criteria suggest that except for the three samples C-15_a, C-15_b, and SM-3000 at 2 m/s, penetration is possible for all other samples for single-layer, which is in good agreement with experiments. With an increase in the number of layers, effective pore size (\u00de decreases, which suggests that penetration tendency will decrease with each additional layer according to the criterion. The current study is directed toward those people who cannot use the recommended N95 mask due to lack of convenience, availability, or economic and demographic reasons. This study recommends the safer option among commonly available fabrics that the said population generally uses for homemade masks without compromising on actual safety against COVID-19. Experiments were primarily performed with single-layer fabric, which showed significant %volume penetration (>25%) in all other fabrics except for C-15 samples, at higher impingement velocities (>4 m/s) (well correlated with cough intensity). We checked for the penetration with the least-safe C-55 sample in its three-layered configuration, which showed minimal penetration. Hence, through this study, based on the low %volume penetration (<20% even at large impingement velocity $10 m/s), we recommend either the usage of coarse cotton towel or cotton towel (with at least three layers) as a face-covering if the person is unable to use N95 or surgical-mask. Three or more layered mask is recommended since it can significantly suppress aerosolization. However, for the unavailability of any such substitutes, one should always wear whatever makeshift mask is available.",

The droplet size distribution Figs. 6(b)-6(d) (which is essential for estimating the infection transmission) shows the presence of aerosol range droplets that are produced because of the atomization of larger droplets. In this paper, we have also shown the importance of multiple layers to minimize this aerosolization effect. Additionally, the effect of washing the mask has been investigated, which showed very little change in the fabric properties like pore size and porosity because penetration characteristics also remain similar. However, the effect of a higher number of wash cycles has not been investigated as part of the study.",

The ligament length is the smallest for cotton towel followed by surgical mask and summer stole. With an increase in porosity, the %volume penetration increases as the more open area is available to pass through the mask. (a) The ligament length measured for cotton cloth is shown for 10 m/s impingement; the length depends on the velocity and pore size. Compared to summer stole (see c), cotton towel has smaller pores, which result in smaller size ligaments. The ligaments break into very tiny daughter droplets, which may potentially result in aerosols. (b) Despite the smallest pore size, the ligament size is larger for the surgical mask compared to cotton towel. This is because of the coalescence of the ligaments.
