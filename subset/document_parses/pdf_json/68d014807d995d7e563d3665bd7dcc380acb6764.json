The authors identify a niche to measure Triple Helix-based efficiency of innovation systems scrutinizing different methodologies for measuring Triple Helix performance and indicating different perspectives on policy implications. The paper presents a new Triple Helix-based index that engages a comprehensive dataset and helps provide useful feedback to policymakers. It is based on a set of 19 indicators collected from the official reports of 34 OECD countries and applied in a two-phase DEA model: the indicators are aggregated into pillars according to the Assurance Region Global and DEA superefficiency model; pillar scores are aggregated according to the Benefit-of-the-Doubt based DEA model. The results provide a rank of 34 countries outlining strengths and weaknesses of each observed innovation system. The research implies a variable set of weights to be a major advantage of DEA allowing less developed countries to excel in evaluating innovation systems efficiency. The results of Triple Helix efficiency index measurement presented in this paper help better account for the European Innovation Paradox.",

Effective collaboration between government, industry and academia is crucial for economic survival, where a crisis may be overcome using innovative solutions (Layos & Pe\u00f1a, 2020; Niankara et al., 2020) . It is argued that in regular circumstances, collaboration and cross-sectoral joint efforts are equally effective and substantially contribute to the prosperity and sustainability of an innovative society (Lerman et al., 2021) . The Triple Helix model, originated by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995) , is widely acknowledged as a conceptual tool that promotes innovation and entrepreneurship through better understanding, cooperation and interaction between university, industry, and government institutions, and supports economic growth and innovation policy design in turn (Cai & Liu, 2020; Galvao et al., 2019) . The Triple Helix is effective at both the national and regional levels (Leydesdorff & Deakin, 2011; Rodrigues & Melo, 2012) , while its cross-sectoral interactions are recognized as a key force of circular economy and sustainability (Anttonen et al., 2018; Scalia et al., 2018; Ye, & Wang, 2019) . In addition to social benefits, the usefulness of Triple Helix interactions has also been demonstrated organizationally. Hern\u00e1ndez-Trasobares and Murillo-Luna (2020) have confirmed that the cooperation of industry, academia, and government in R&D contributes to success in business innovation.",

Some recent studies have attempted to find methods and tools for overcoming this Paradox, focusing on the assessment innovation systems indicators. Their conclusions highlighted the changes that needed to be made accordingly, based on the approaches and methodology used for innovation systems evaluation (Argyropoulou et al., 2019) . Argyropoulou et al. recognize that the Triple Helix model is a tool to be adapted for wider application in overcoming the effects of the European Innovation Paradox, aimed at reaching a \"harmony for knowledge-based economy\" (Argyropoulou, Soderquist, & Ioannou, 2019) .",

            "text": "While the development of the Triple Helix model needs to be pre-structured and coordinated (Cai & Etzkowitz, 2020) , the interplay of the Triple Helix actors is difficult to manage as it requires activities of multiple, disparate sectors within complex subsystems (Jovanovi\u0107 et al., 2020; Ranga & Etzkowitz, 2013) . New approaches to the theory and practice of the Triple Helix concept are constantly arising (see e.g., Todeva et al., 2019) , but challenges remain on how to best manage Triple Helix interactions in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the innovation ecosystem. Successful Triple Helix dynamics requires us to measure and evaluate the performance of Triple Helix actors (Dankbaar, 2019; S\u00e1 et al., 2019) . For this purpose, a range of measurements have been developed (e.g., Jovanovi\u0107 et al., 2020; Leydesdorff, 2003; Leydesdorff & Ivanova, 2016; M\u00eagnigb\u00eato, 2018; Priego, 2003; Xu & Liu, 2017) . Measuring Triple Helix performance helps identify both good practices and possible deficiencies in interactions, enables comparison between countries and regions, solicits solutions to challenges, and points to strategies taking advantage of opportunities. Cirilloa et al. (2018) emphasize that the origins of the European Paradox may be better examined when using a proper set of measurements and scientific indicators. Extensive literature review has helped identify three major research gaps. Firstly, although literature on quantitative measurement of Triple Helix abounds, there are still very few studies which compare Triple Helix performance measurement tools. Secondly, the existing approaches are highly focused and lack the capacity and specific design to detect strengths and weaknesses of systems based on the measurements, consequently failing to contribute to innovation strategy and policy development. Finally, the European Innovation Paradox has been insufficiently examined from the Triple Helix perspective, which is recognized as having the strength to shed more light on causal relationships within this phenomenon.",

The first research question is tackled by analyzing different research studies on measuring Triple Helix. This helped evaluate the observed aspects of Triple Helix interactions and identify a niche for further research. As for the second research question, we have developed a novel application of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to measuring Triple Helix-based efficiency scores of innovation systems. Empirically, 34 OECD countries are compared according to their efficiency in transforming inputs of an innovation system into innovative outputs fostered by Triple Helix actors. The results of this measurement should provide useful feedback on innovation action for policymakers, particularly as a potential solution for the European Innovation Paradox.",

Since then, it has become prominent in scholarly research and policy discourse. An area of Triple Helix studies has focused on measuring Triple Helix performance. Literature review in this paper is mostly based on studies related to Triple Helix measurement found in prominent scientific databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) under the key words 'Triple Helix indicators', 'Triple Helix measures', 'Triple Helix measuring', 'Triple Helix performance' and 'Triple Helix evaluation'. This section aims to clarify the state-of-the-art of research in the field and to identify existing research gaps, rather than provide a systematic literature review report.",

The Triple Helix model is aimed at better understanding of complex interactions among multiple university, industry and government actors which may foster innovation and entrepreneurship (Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 2000) . Recognizing the usefulness of this model, governments and decision-making bodies have strived to not only design policies which would improve their innovation systems, but also allocate resources to promote Triple Helix interactions (Cai & Etzkowitz, 2020) . However, such policies may only be effective when informed by a purely evidence-based Triple Helix model, e.g., through measuring Triple Helix synergies (Leydesdorff & Smith, 2021) .

While current measurements are mainly based on a single indicator or multiple measure reports, some available comprehensive datasets have not been fully utilized for measuring Triple Helix performance due to methodological challenges. For instance, the OECD Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Outlook provides a comprehensive overview of major trends in STI development of OCED countries and may assist policymakers in detecting global patterns and help define and update their STI strategies accordingly (OECD, 2020a) . With a set of almost 130 indicators, it chiefly evaluates R&D and patent activity performance, providing separate values for university, government and business sectors, thereby offering an insight into of all three Triple Helix actors' performance. However, the indicators are neither aggregated nor do Although there are multivariate approaches to Triple Helix measurement, the existing approaches neglect some important aspects. Meyer et al. (2014) highlight that \"\u2026more enriched indicators that are multi-layered and multidimensional are required to unpick the situation from different angles, thus allowing for the heterogeneity of the different actors to be voiced and heard\". Triple Helix performance measures focus more on R&D activities observed through patent and publishing activity (Leydesdorff & Meyer, 2006; Meyer et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2015) . Patent activity is one of the main determinants of Triple Helix measures, since it is one of the major results of R&D activities within the innovation ecosystem (see e.g., Meyer et al., 2003; Ivanova et al., 2019) . However, Baldini (2009) and Alves and Daniel (2019) stress that institutions and individuals (especially in academia) face numerous hurdles in the patenting process. Thus, this aspect should not be observed as a unique and ultimate result of Triple Helix activities. The number of spin-off companies is another R&D mechanism that may support the entrepreneurial ecosystem which is also an important indicator of the entrepreneurial level of a university (Ferri et al., 2019; Fini et al., 2017; Lawton Smith & Ho, 2006) .",

As a further example, Egorov and Pospelova (2019) evaluated innovative activities of the Russian Arctic based on three factors: (1) the number of Russian patents granted for inventions per workforce, (2) the share of innovative goods, works and services in the total volume, and (3) the share of budget expenditures on scientific research.

            "text": "Current approaches measure Triple Helix performance in the form of Triple Helix synergies and outcomes. However, there is no ready-made method to measure Triple Helix efficiency (e.g., how resources allocated to innovation can generate expected outputs). Literature review justifies focusing on the comprehensive efficiency measurement approach to improve policy. Ivanova and Leydesdorff (2015) have posed a related question: \"What innovation systems are most efficient and why?\" Some attempts to respond to the question have also informed our study. For instance, M\u00eagnigb\u00eato (2018) used game theory to structure a model of Triple Helix relations and examine synergy indicators based on the number of papers. Tarnawska and Mavroeidis (2015) used DEA to evaluate the efficiency of 25 EU-member states based on six indicators of national innovation system performance. Another multivariate approach proposed by Jovanovi\u0107 et al. (2020) examines the measure of the Triple Helix synergy of 34 OECD countries through a two-step Composite I-distance method to create multivariate composite measures based on a set selected from OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators. The result was a categorization of indicators into pillars (Triple Helix actors). Jovanovi\u0107 et al. analyzed the performance of every pillar and the overall Triple Helix performance and rank but did not analyze the efficiency of the countries selected. Building upon the previous experience (Jovanovi\u0107 et al., 2020; Tarnawska & Mavroeidis, 2015) , we address these issues and use DEA on a set of OECD indicators, extending the analysis using additional official data. To do so, we propose a multi-criteria efficiency approach by applying the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to a dataset from 34 countries.",

Current approaches to measuring Triple Helix performance mainly focus on activities and outcomes, and do not fully consider the level of efficiency, in particular how input resources are efficiently used to deliver outcomes through Triple Helix interactions. Literature highlights three concepts concerning the Triple Helix interactions: spheres, spaces, and functions. Spheres refer to university, industry and government (Etzkowitz, 2008; Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 1995) . While Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff jointly developed the Triple Helix model with a shared understanding of synergy building among the three spheres/helices, they have further elaborated on the mechanisms of Triple Helix interactions by using the concepts of spaces and functions, respectively (Leydesdorff, 2012) . From a neo-institutional perspective, Etzkowitz draws attention to Triple Helix interactions of knowledge, consensus and innovation spaces, taking place in parallel with the interactions of the spheres (Etzkowitz, 2008; Etzkowitz & Zhou, 2017) . From a neo-evolutionary perspective, Leydesdorff considers that the three helices also operate \"as selection mechanisms asymmetrically on one another, but mutual selections may shape a trajectory as in a coevolution\" (Leydesdorff, 2012, p. 28 ). In such a lens, the Triple Helix is perceived as three functions-namely, wealth creation, knowledge production, and normative control (Leydesdorff, 2012) . In our measurement of Triple Helix efficiency, we focus on the performance of these functions.",

The model uses the efficiency approach measured by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The approach examines the success of an entity (an observed unit, e.g., a country, department, sector, region, etc.) in using the provided inputs and transforming them into desired outputs (\u0106uji\u0107 et al., 2015) .

An initial set consisted of 38 measures, but due to redundancy and high correlations, the final set was limited to the 19 indicators presented. Indicator values were collected for the year 2015, the last year when all data was available. Owing to reliable data and comprehensive databases, imputation was not necessary.

The efficiency analysis, including normalization, weighting and aggregation were all performed through a two-phase DEA approach.",

This feature is especially important for smaller and less-privileged countries with restricted funds, but still able to exploit their full potential. The efficiency approach is also needed to estimate if the employed inputs result in the expected outcomes, especially in innovative activities, since practice indicates this is not usually the case (e.g., the Swedish, European and Serbian paradox) (Levi . An additional feature of the DEA method is that it allows every entity to determine the most suitable weights. As such, each DMU (for this study, country) can choose its own set of weights to maximize its efficiency. The feature is significant for this type of evaluation, as some countries may have superior publishing activity, but an insufficient number of patents. A unique set of weights allows units to compensate outcomes when underperforming in some of the aspects. DEA also evaluates strengths and weaknesses for every unit, provides a benchmark country and possible project improvements for more efficiency (\u0106uji\u0107 et al., 2015) . Thus, the implications could be useful for policymakers as important input needed to create and propose national strategies.",

Table 3 provides the results of descriptive statistics for all three pillars: the number of efficient countries, the maximum, minimum and average efficiency as well as the standard deviation of the efficiency scores. A total of 10 countries are efficient in terms of normative control performance (efficiency score > 1). The results of the first phase indicate the most efficient countries to be South Korea, Iceland and Latvia. South Korea's high score is based on its respectively high level of patent activity (0.9554). Latvia also shows strong publishing activity (0.7803) in addition to somewhat significant trade exports (0.1123) and patents (0.1024). Iceland is marked as efficient due to its exceptional intellectual property receipts (0.9850) in comparison to invested resources. Conversely, Mexico, Germany, and Turkey all have low efficiency scores (0.278, 0.362, and 0.368, respectively). Turkey has high government investments in GERD but does not sufficiently commercialize intellectual property (0-weight) as well as trade exports (0.005).

            "text": "1. The most competitive advantage of DEA is its variable set of weights, allowing for every unit to compensate for indicators which may be used to rank the results. As for the efficiency of legislative function, the top three countries have their high scores rooted in separate aspects: Ireland's high trade exports, Latvia's outstanding level of published articles and trade exports, and South Korea's superior number of patents. Estonia emerged as the 3rd ranked country by wealth generation efficiency due to its high intensity of newly established businesses, which is another example of DEA's advantage of taking into consideration the competitiveness of an innovative ecosystem. Japan, for example, focuses its efforts on patents, Iceland is excellent in charging for the use of its intellectual property, while Estonia creates new business ventures. South Korea's superiority in innovative performance has already been confirmed by Bloomberg's Innovation Index methodology -ranked 1st (Bloomberg, 2020 (Bloomberg, , 2016 , and Global Innovation Index (Cornell University, INSEAD, and WIPO, 2016) -ranked 11 th . 2. The approach presented in this paper evaluates if a country is efficient -exploiting its invested resources possibly resulting in an appropriate output. Despite its remarkable innovative output, Germany is surprisingly not highly ranked. These results imply that Germany might achieve higher scores considering its resources and investments. Likewise, France's high GOVERD financed by the business sector has not resulted in high outputs within the normative control function. Table 3 indicates the greatest deviations in the normative control sector, which has also been shown as the least efficient. As expected, the main role of this sector is to provide sufficient funds and legislative support; the main role of creator of innovative outputs, on the other hand, is dedicated to wealth generation and novelty production functions. 4. In comparison to the Global Innovation Index aggregation method, the presented approach considers the size of a country and its available resources. Figure 3 highlights these differences, comparing the normalized GII (in comparison to the countries studied) and the Triple Helix super-efficiency rank. Beneath the red line are those countries that have a higher GII score than their Triple Helix super-efficiency score, while above the red line are those countries that have a higher Triple Helix super-efficiency score in comparison to the GII. The first (bottom left) quadrant represents those countries successful by both criteria, while the second (bottom right) lists countries that are successful innovators, but not efficient from a Triple Helix functions perspective. The top left quadrant shows Triple Helix efficient countries that maximize the utilization of their resources but are not listed in the top national innovative systems according to GII methodology. The top right quadrant shows the countries with a lower rank in both scores. The closer the countries are to the top right corner of the quadrant, the less innovative they are according to both criteria. This matrix might prove to be a valuable visual tool for policymakers. According to Fig. 3 , the United States is the best among all the countries examined, while Switzerland also achieved significant results. Were Switzerland to improve their novelty production efficiency (scoring the lowest weight in the Triple Helix index -0.050) they could upgrade their position in this innovation matrix. Moreover, some countries, such as Estonia, are successful in the utilization of their resources but do not follow the same trend in GII, which might imply higher potential should additional resources be invested. This result is especially important for highly efficient countries, such as Iceland, Luxembourg, Japan, and South Korea, all of which have a high potential to grow even more innovative with added resources. On the other hand, countries such as Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada must create higher outputs to justify their resources, such as with Estonia. For example, Germany's novelty production and legislative function efficiency is surprisingly low, as well as the Netherlands' wealth generation and Canada's normative control. 5. Aparticular quality of the DEA method is that it provides feedback on improvements that should be made within an entity in order for it to achieve a higher level of efficiency (Paradi et al., 2018) . The results help identify weak links within each innovation system, providing the exact measure of the improvement that an entity should make to become efficient. For policymakers, this advantage could be a crucial contribution, applicable when determining the need to improve measures and policies within the system examined.",

The DEA Triple Helix score presented in Fig. 3 clearly points to lower innovation systems' efficiency for European countries within the innovation efficiency rankings. The new proposed Triple Helix-based efficiency measurement tool has indicated the domains of inefficiency specifically related to the Triple Helix functions: normative control, novelty production, wealth generation. It clearly lays out the need to develop and implement policy measures towards the interconnectivity and harmonization of the said factors. Listed below are five factors that help account for the innovation paradox as indicated by the results of the Triple Helix efficiency measurements: 1. The \"Valley of Death\" phenomena within the innovation cycle (Beard et al., 2009) , with losses of innovation potential in phases of innovation transition from 'discoveries to ideas to implementation and diffusion' due to the limited efficiency of the Triple Helix actors involved in innovation creation (Research), innovation implementation and diffusion (Development). 2. A comprehensive approach not sufficiently established and implemented that may incorporate the corresponding complements to investments necessary to achieve complex sustainable development returns. 3. Weak managerial and organization practices, as key firm capabilities, to bring innovation successfully to the market especially for new emerging technology and innovation entrepreneurial ventures. 4.

Weak government capabilities in developing and implementing effective innovation policies.",

In DEA, the number of indicators is determined by the total number of units (for the purpose of our research, countries). In general, the multiplied score of both the inputs and outputs should be the minimum of the countries examined (e.g., four input and five output indicators require at least 20 countries). As this paper uses a two-phase approach and aggregates indicators into pillars, this limitation is mitigated. 2. The set of indicators presented may be expanded, as data important as markers of innovation activity were unavailable. The data in this research was manly collected from the OECD's Main Science and Technology indicators, providing official, functional and available data. However, numerous important aspects may not be covered by these indicators. For instance, a crucial factor of a university's innovative performance is its number of spin-off companies. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available national data. This indicator would enhance a holistic approach and improve the reliability of the results provided. This limitation could be resolved by adapting methodologies and instructions for measuring innovative performance at a national level.",

If data or a country is excluded from the ranking, the values and efficiency scores might change. 4. The boundaries provided for the weight values are subject to debate and might be changed in a what-if analysis to provide more reliable information. In this research, no zero-weights were permitted for any indicator, but the limitations were not strict, following the theoretical approach of the Triple Helix concept, in which actors may take one another's roles within the ecosystem (Cai & Etzkowitz, 2020) . 5. For those indicators that affect two or three helices, indicator values were arbitrarily assigned (equally distributed).",

Future research will assess an updated set of indicators, by which we will attempt to identify novel metrics necessary to shed light onto all important perspectives of Triple Helix-based innovative activity. In order to compare the results with the most renowned approach in this field, mutual information Triple Helix indicator, it would be useful to calculate the mutual information indicator for examined OECD countries. This indicator provides valuable conclusions for policymakers, while the presented efficiency approach could offer additional information and a different perspective of implications that would be significant for strategies. We shall also test alternative DEA models and a modified set of weights to identify the most relevant approach to measuring Triple Helix-based efficiency. Network DEA is suitable for the Triple Helix perspective, as it may include indicators of inputs and outputs created individually or mutually by actors. That way, the interactions between the Triple-Helix actors may also be covered.",
