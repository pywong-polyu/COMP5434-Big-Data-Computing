Although freely available, finding such resources often becomes a challenging task, because they are hosted on scattered websites and in different types/formats. These websites usually offer limited search options; at the same time, there is no aggregation service for audiovisual resources, nor a national registry for such content. To meet this need, the Open AudioVisual Archives project was launched and the first step in its development is to create a dataset with open access audiovisual material. The current research creates such a dataset by applying specific selection criteria in terms of copyright and content, form/use and process/technical characteristics. The results reported in this paper show that libraries, archives, museums, universities, mass media organizations, governmental and non-governmental organizations are the main types of providers, but the vast majority of resources are open courses offered by universities under the \"Creative Commons\" license. Providers have significant differences in terms of their collection management capabilities. Most of them do not own any kind of publishing infrastructure and use commercial streaming services, such as YouTube. In terms of metadata policy, most of the providers use application profiles instead of international metadata schemas.",

Additionally, national registry services have tried to record the institutions that create and/or hold audiovisual collections. In Greece, there is no aggregation service for audiovisual resources, nor a national registry. On the other hand, there are many audiovisual resources available online that are not searchable and easily findable. To meet this need, the Open AudioVisual Archives (OAVA) project has been launched. It is an EU cofinanced project that aims to develop the OAVA platform, an aggregation service for audiovisual resources in Greece. The OAVA platform will provide access to the aggregate metadata of audiovisual material as well as to its searchable content. This will be achieved through the application of deep learning models and the development of algorithms that perform Automatic Speech Recognition in Greek and in English.",

Europeana has developed the Europeana Publishing Framework [8] to help European cultural heritage institutions share their collections. Image and text resources make up 97% of Europeana's total content, while audiovisual resources make up the remaining 3% [4] . Europeana partners include the European Film Gateway, 1 the EUScreen 2 project and its successor, EUScreenXL. One thing to note in the case of audiovisual resources is that the criteria for data partners change slightly due to the characteristics of the format. Having a digital file format available on the Internet via a permanent URL is considered a prerequisite. [31] . Regarding metadata, legacy and local metadata schemas were converted to the Europeana Data Model using the MINT 3 tool; content selection criteria were not restrictive [38] . Examples of resource types are TV programs and series, movies, news, entertaining programs, movies or series of documentary character, advertisements, radio programs, homemade videos, etc. Copyright is a challenging issue especially for audiovisual resources. Thus, the EU carried out another project related to orphan audiovisual works. The FORWARD project was initiated in 2013 and lasted until 2017 with the aim to \"create a permanent registry for AV Orphan Works\" [33] .",

The National Centre of Audiovisual Media and Communication EKOME, established in 2015, aims to protect, support, and promote public and private initiatives \"in the field of audiovisual media and communication in Greece\" [19] . Based on the finding that audiovisual resources are produced and stored in different electronic environments, the EKOME is organizing the creation of a National Registry of Audiovisual Archives that aims to register all institutions holding audiovisual archives. The National Registry has not been created yet. Currently, the EKOME focuses on \"attracting investment through the production of films, television series, documentaries, animation, and digital games in Greece\" [19] .",

Providers simply decide which content may be considered eligible for inclusion. Selection criteria mostly apply in internal digitization projects or other collection development procedures. Studying the relevant literature shows that there is a high degree of homogeneity in the selection criteria described in the various studies and research papers [15] . The Digital Library Federation-Council on Library and Information Resources, published a report in 2001 with selection criteria to help libraries create \"highquality collections of free Web resources\" [32] . The criteria in this report were organized in 4 categories: context, content, form/use, and process or technical. The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) published in 2012 guidelines and criteria for the selection of electronic resources [12] . Criteria on content (reliability, subject, complementarity with other sources) and technical criteria were introduced, in addition to the evaluation criteria for commercial providers. NISO published a framework for the development of digital collections providing best practices on collection development, item selections, and metadata [30] . Item selection mostly focused on their technical characteristics. The American Library Association [1] published a set of criteria depending on the type of library (Public, School, Academic). The criteria were organized as general and special ones focusing mostly on content characteristics (reliability, objectivity, subject, relevance to the rest of the collection).",

All these five aggregation services are generic ones and present similarities to one another. They all cooperate with other institutions to aggregate content and provide policies, copyright best practices, preservation and conservation ideas regarding the aggregated content. The institutions providing their content are most often, galleries, archives, libraries, museums, as well as film archives and media institutions. Despite the generic character of the aggregation services, they all aim to aggregate audiovisual heritage resources among other types of resources. Currently, the audiovisual resources aggregated by each service are only a small fragment of the total content. The need of gathering and providing access to audiovisual material in a unified way is self-evident. National libraries play a key role in preserving a nation's heritage. With the advent of the Internet, new types of online content are easily created, spread, and lost once a web page is removed. Thus, many national libraries have begun to play an active role in the development of national digital archives and aggregation services for the collection and conservation of online and audiovisual resources. In many cases, existing library tools, criteria, and methodologies, that have already been applied to the development of online collections, are being extended and adapted to meet the needs of the new types of content. Focusing on Greece, this need to aggregate audiovisual material is imperative due to the absence of a national searchable registry.",

It is worth noting that for reasons of uniformity and ease of reading, a Likert scale was chosen to describe the degree of satisfaction of each criterion: 0-Very poor, 1-Poor, 2-Barely Acceptable/Fair, 3-Good, 4-Very good. Context criteria The present paper aims at compiling a collection of high-quality audiovisual resources from Greece that can be used in the context of open access services. Official organizations from the public or the private sector usually offer licenses that allow for third-party reuse (Criterion 1.1, Table 1 ). Multidisciplinary and (if possible) complementary resources should be used (Criterion 1.2, Table 1 ).",

In terms of completeness, coverage, and currency, a lower selection standard was applied (Criteria 2.5-2.7, Table 1 ). One final limitation is that the content should address the following 3 different target groups: individuals, research teams, content owners (Criterion 2.8, Table 1 ). Form/use criteria The most important criteria in this case are criteria 3.5-3.6 (Table 1) , i.e., those that determine how the content can be used by third parties and under what license the content is available. For certain providers, not all resources were selected for the dataset to comply with the terms of \"Fair Use.\" It is important that users do not have to go through a registration process. Criteria 3.1-3.3 that evaluate composition and site organization, navigational features, recognized standards, and appropriate technologies are also important. Criterion 3.4 for user support is rated 1 when the organization provides contact information, but no other contact option is provided. On the other hand, user support is rated 4 when chat communication is offered. Process or technical criteria The set of criteria 4.1-4.3 in Table 1 can be used to assess the overall integrity of the publishing software and the infrastructure used to deliver the content. Regarding the minimum technical characteristics required for the resources, a combination has been used that takes into account: a) recommendations by the Greek National Documentation Center, b) Europeana recommendations [34] , and c) the following specifications: lossless encoding and high frequency. A minimum of 16 KHz sampling rate is required, and recommended is 22KHz or ideally 44+ KHz. Bit depth must be 16 bit in case of wav files. For compressed audio in .mp3 format, 128 kbps bitrate for stereo or 64 kbps for mono is needed. The sound must be clear without ambient noise or music. Metadata Providing metadata is also important and rated using the criteria 5.1-5.4 in Table 1 .",

Even though only one-third of the eligible providers are universities, their contribution is 80% of the total 1710 resources. This, of course, affects the characteristics of the selected resources. Consequently, the vast majority of the resources are open courses and academic/scientific events. Trends in licensing and metadata policies are also affected by the volume of university content. Creative Commons licenses are the mostly used licensing scheme, while dedicated application profiles are used for the description of audiovisual resources.",

A feasible solution to this problem would be for the National Library of Greece or the National Documentation Centre, that acts as the national aggregator for Europeana, to adopt practices already implemented by the National Library of New Zealand and the National Digital Library of India. The National Library of New Zealand offers a shared repository to providers with small audiovisual collections and limited human resources and/or economic funds [27] . The National Digital Library of India promotes the use of open licenses and organizes training sessions and workshops focusing on diverse collection management issues, such as IT systems, licensing, and metadata [22] . The combination of these two strategies will likely contribute to the preservation, aggregation, better description, more clear usage rights, and easier access to audiovisual resources that will ultimately enable the provision of advanced information services.",

In Greece, there is no national policy for the management and long-term preservation of audiovisual resources. The Greek National Registry of audiovisual providers has not yet been implemented, and there is no reference point for the search and access to audiovisual material. The lack of nationwide policies and registration tools is expected to have a negative impact on both long-term preservation and access to audiovisual resources. Thus, institutions in Greece that may implement nationwide policies must undertake initiatives to safeguard the country's reservoir of audiovisual resources. Examples of such institutions could be the Ministry of Culture and Sports, the Ministry of Digital Governance, the National Library of Greece, the National Documentation Centre (as the national aggregator for Europeana), and the National Centre of Audiovisual Media and Communication EKOME.",
