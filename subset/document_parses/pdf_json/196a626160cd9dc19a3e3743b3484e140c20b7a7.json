It is recognized by some as genuine, and put down by others to his fontanelles continuing to grow too long after infancy. He suffered greatly from headaches. 2 My Country by Dorothea Mackellar (1885 Mackellar ( -1958 'I love a sunburnt country/Land of drought and flood\u2026'. It is a good poem, but tarnished by climate change deniers as a 'proof' that the recent-2019unprecedented bushfires and floods are just more of the same. There is a now disused Prime Minister who said 'Climate change is crap', and forbade civil servants' using the words 'climate change'. At present, he has a job in the UK where one would like him to stay. 3 Gratin, French for 'the top crust', i.e. the very well off. Literally, 'gratin' is the top layer of a dish of thinly sliced potatoes dressed in butter and olive oil, baked in the oven-pommes Anna. The gratin is made of two kinds of hard cheese grated and mixed with a few breadcrumbs. The gratin is the tastiest part of the dish-everyone wants more than their fair share of it.",

            "text": "Kellyanne Conway has a place in the future History of The Decline of the West. When Trump boasted, falsely, 'There were more people at my Inauguration than Obama's', aerial photos showed rows and rows of empty seats at Trump's swearing in. Conway defended The Donald, 'He was offering an alternative fact'. The expression 'alternative fact' makes no sense. It does to postmodernists, it seems. In her The Death of Truth 8 Michiko Kakutani argues-convincingly-for PoMo's dovetailing neatly into a former reality show's presenter getting elected to the Presidency of the USA. Trump's base won't have heard of PoMo: their real grievances, loss of jobs, etc. had them voting for a zany, a demagogue with a small vocabulary and strangulated syntax. What PoMo can do is give a gloss of respectability to the endless inarticulate tweets, which now rank as Presidential policy statements (p. 100), despite their contradicting other tweets (p. 95). And being full of personal insults and blah blah they are nevertheless taken as serious and important. The base just loves the superhot-air twaddle. Umberto Eco writes, 'Mussolini had no ideas, just rhetoric' (p. 102). It got him a long way-for a while. Kakutani cites a notorious alt-right troll and conspiracy theorist who said in a profile-piece in The New Yorker (Oct. 31, 2116) , 'Look, I read postmodern theory in college. If everything is a narrative, then we need alternatives to the dominant narrative \u2026 I don't seem like a guy who reads Lacan, do I? ' (p. 46) . Everything is not a narrative. The atomic table is not. 9 Of course we may need 'alternatives to the dominant narrative': But conspiracy theories don't cut the mustard. Kakutani's nicest point is, perhaps this: Putin's quackspeak man is, 'a foremost postmodernist theatre director who has been described as \"Putin's Rasputin\" and the Kremlin's propaganda puppet master'. (p. 136). Trump seems to know already how to direct his own theatre! Much of it theatre of the absurd. But: It woiks. The base and the Party of Lincoln are infatuated.",

            "text": "By chance I heard a Trumpism on Australian TV, 'If a second term scares the Democrats, what would twelve terms do with them?' In PoMo, this is an double irony: If twelve terms are impossible, the remark can be laughed off as a joke. However, it may be a serious one: 'If I could get away with it I'm up for it? Double ironies or the ironization of an irony is a PoMo move. An Australian journalist, Chris Uhlmann, wrote, 11 'It is not written that Trump will win again, what he may do on the way out is the real horror. Could his last act of his vandalism of American institutions be to burn down the village as he leaves?' He might? As for the twelve terms, Mitch McConnell the poker-faced Republican Senate Leader has had to reassure Americans that if Biden wins, Trump will go. The monstrous storming of the Capitol 12 put this in doubt. McConnell blames Trump for the attacks, but voted against the second Impeachment! As of December 18, 2020-Joe Biden having been elected President-Trump skulks in the White House refusing to concede. When he goes as go he must in the end, what? As of 24 November, the election of Biden has been officially confirmed. However, Trumpism may well live on. 13 Trump still has an enormous fascination for his base. Trump is not an ideologue, the Idol is Trump. However, he may finance a 'news' outlet on TV worse than Murdoch's poisonous Fox News. A real ideologue may take up where Trump left offif Trump don't run again-and the USA may be threatened by what the Founding Fathers feared most-a 'mob'. 14 10 Alex Woodward, Independent, New York, Thursday, January 30, 2020, 20:54 (online:www. indep endent. co. uk) . On PoMo's contempt for science, see The Death of Truth pp. 20, [36] [37] [38] [39] 43, 75, etc . The present Australian Prime Minister uses the words 'Climate Change' only when he can't avoid them. He favours as a fill-in before solar power, gas. It produces methane, more damaging even than CO2. There is plenty of sunlight here. Solar panels, please! 11 The Uhlmann quotes are from his initial piece, The Age, 22 September 2020, and from one by Orietta Guerra in the same newspaper, September 13, 2020, pp. 20, 36, etc. 12 For a firsthand account see Luke Mogelson, 'The Storm' in The New Yorker, January 25, 2021, pp. 34-53 . My memory of hearing Trump on 'twelve terms' is semi-confirmed, p. 43, col b . If you live in a republic, Mogelson is required reading. The report begins, 'By the end of President Donald Trump's crusade against American Democracy...' The cover of the The New Yorker has the American Eagle carrying off Trump: If only! The second Impeachment voted down, The Donald could still run for public office. The Union could still lose the Second Civil War! 13 The most incisive essay on Trumpism is by Finton O'Toole, in The New York Review, February 25, 2021, 'The Trump Inheritance', pp. 4-8. His analysis is, '...Trump lied prodigiously... his construction of \"alternative facts\" has deliberately and successfully obliterated fro his supporters the distinction between the fake and the genuine. But pure falsehood alone would not have created the bond between Trump and his base. What he managed to do was simultaneously to erase the distinction between the valid and the bogus and to remake it.' (p.6, col d ) By such a dodge a scoundrel might subvert the American Republic. Of America's future, O'Toole writes, ominously: 'The Republican Party is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump Inc.' (February 8, 2020 But don't blame Trump for America, blame America for Trump. In 2012, Peter Turchin-a University of Connecticut ecologist, evolutionary biologist, and mathematician-made a prediction that the USA was heading for a chaotic and violent 2020. He says:",

But he insists that the language is wrapped around 'something that actually happened'. A sceptical believer-they pop up in Sophia from time to time-may look at the myth bit with hermeneutic suspicion. With Nastika? The Genesis Chapter opens with, 'Now the Serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden.' And he goes on, agent provocateur that he is, to tempt Eve to eat of the very tree that she knows to be forbidden. Who was responsible for hiring a talking snake? Surely not God: almost certainly the imaginative myth writer. And, with due respect to His Holiness, does this whole story explain anything? 'God moves in mysterious ways\u2026' and explanations always fall short. And the nakedness element which follows the primal disobedience seems not to follow directly from the eating of the forbidden fruit. The standard Christian answer to: 'Why, suddenly, fig-leaves ?', is that a result of the primal transgression that Adam and Eve lost their primal innocence, and acquired concupiscence, that desire which we all have for things which are as forbidden as the fatal apple: Or, as in the Ten Commandments, 'our neighbour's wife.'

Was the Atonement gone through with by the Son of God because God was, infinitely, miffed by the sin of Eve and Adam? Should SHE not have just shrugged it off? Was God 'testing humankind to destruction', as the manufacturers of good motorcars do? Perhaps not. Or, are only Saints 'the new and improved model'? There is the nice French saying: 'To understand -fully -is fully to forgive.' An Infinite God-sulking? Just like one of us: 'A too too human God.' Furthermore: were God liable to ethical judgement by us, might we not regard God (The Father) as needlessly cruel to the Son. If the Atonement was necessary, how much insight may we have to this necessity? Again: might not God-theomniscient have come up with a different and less cruel solution to the problem? In Oxford, I put-some of this-to Anthony Kenny, then still a Catholic priest; his answer was-virtually-'It had to be done as it was done'. There is a considerable literature on the subjection of Son to the Father. I have not read it: Fr Kenny probably had. In the Australian liturgy of the Mass, when Christ's death is mentioned, there is an addition, 'To which he freely consented. ' Stevens' 'If only he would not pity us so much', is about God: 'God so loved the world that he sent His only begotten son\u2026' 29 to be crucified, '\u2026 a over-human god / Who by sympathy has made himself a man\u2026' is Christ, the Son of God. St Paul writes about Christ crucified: 'Here are the Jews asking for signs and wonders, here are the Greeks intent on their philosophy; but what we preach is Christ crucified: to the Jews a discouragement, to the gentiles mere folly\u2026' (I Corinthians I, Knox trans.). The earlier translations have 'folly to the Greeks'. The readers of Sophia will probably have a little of the Greek in them, and a fair dose of philosophy. Sophia is read by people who would understand why Paul was not keen to discuss 'Christ Crucified' in a Socratic Dialogue with the Greeks, 'intent on their philosophy.' Paul was on a mission-for him, no seminars! The existential crux is that there were in Christ's time two different ideas about the Messiah:",

(2) for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness, and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. (3): He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not (4). Surely, he hath born our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet, we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted (5). But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was bruised for our transgression; he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

Hepburn (1927 Hepburn ( -2008 In my long footnote 12, pp. 123-124 the, contested, reading of Timaeus 30 a 53 b goes thus, 'the Receptacle was recalcitrant'. When the Demiurge tried to order it by dropping into it the five regular solidswhich the Greeks understood-the Receptacle resisted the attempt by the Demiurge to produce a World, rational through and through, failed. This was a fall, if not a moral one. Hepburn had intended to take Holy Orders in the Presbyterian Church, but did not. I suspected a fall not caused by humankind-our Fall-had for him an aesthetic or moral attraction. I felt that this was the case, but I refrained from putting the question. I now wish I had.",

The opacity of much that the Christian religion's doctrine-its 'resolving' into Mystery-reminds me of a passage in the Metaphysical Poet Henry Vaughan (1621-1695): The Night. 34 There is in God (some say) 33 Metaphysical poetry, written by believers, is shot through with various doubts-. . . because they see not all clear while acknowledging 'a deep but dazzling darkness'. The two words dazzling and darkness are in tension, if not, quite, in contradiction. God seen would be dazzling-and the poet would have regarded this as a commonplace. Unseen, God leaves the writer in deep darkness, because He does not appear, even to this believer. The notion of the darkness of God is trivalent: (i) Because I cannot see or understand, I doubt that there is a God. (ii) God keeps us in the dark about so much, I am, though I believe, unhappy to find God less forthcoming than I would like. (iii) I am a mystic: but my experiences are not Illuminations. What I find is the darkness of God. So (iii) cancels (i); has affinities-of a sort-with (ii) but itself not quite what I had expected or hoped for. The darkness of God sometimes affects even mystics, in a negative way as the kernel of an-expectedly-positive-experience. 35 The Night is referenced John III 2 which gives an account of Nicodemus-a member of the Jewish establishment-visiting Jesus by night. So 'O for that night! where I in Him might live invisible and dim'. Close to Christ, Vaughan would be dim in the-positive-dazzle of the Risen Lord. Nicodemus met Christ before the Crucifixion, and provided Him a tomb.",

For the quotations from The Talmud, see Benatar pp. 222-223. House of Shammi maintained, by contrast that it would have been better had humans not been created.' To this Benatar adds, '\u2026 here [in my work] we have a decision in favour of Shammi, (pp. 222-223)'. The American poet Wallace Stevens might well have favoured Shammi.

You can see from the dates that Pliny's reading Longinus would be poetic licence. So, 'His book' is the account of the eruption of Vesuvius which Pliny wrote after it which, 'Made sure of the most correct catastrophe'; that is, recorded it for future generations. 27 Psychiatrists may agree, or disagree.
