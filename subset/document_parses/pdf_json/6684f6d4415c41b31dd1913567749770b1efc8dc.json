The most effective intervention measure will be to develop safe and effective vaccines to protect the population from the disease and limit the spread of the virus. An inactivated, whole virus vaccine candidate of SARS-CoV-2 has been developed by Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Wuhan Institute of Virology. The low toxicity, immunogenicity, and immune persistence were investigated in preclinical studies using seven different species of animals. The results showed that the vaccine candidate was well tolerated and stimulated high levels of specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Low or no toxicity in three species of animals was also demonstrated in preclinical study of the vaccine candidate. Biochemical analysis of structural proteins and purity analysis were performed. The inactivated, whole virion vaccine was characterized with safe double-inactivation, no use of DNases and high purity. Dosages, boosting times, adjuvants, and immunization schedules were shown to be important for stimulating a strong humoral immune response in animals tested. Preliminary observation in ongoing phase I and II clinical trials of the vaccine candidate in Wuzhi County, Henan Province, showed that the vaccine is well tolerant. The results were characterized by very low proportion and low degree of side effects, high levels of neutralizing antibodies, and seroconversion. These results consistent with the results obtained from preclinical data on the safety.",

It has jumped the species barrier and was transmitted from animals to humans with a strong tendency to establish itself in human population [1] [2] [3] [4] . The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic imposes massive public health and economic burdens worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV. They share 69.5% of the nucleotide sequence identity and use the same receptor for entry into cells. Vaccine candidates against COVID-19 are urgently needed to protect the general population, in particular high-risk groups such as the elderly and health care personnel. Strategies are required for rapid vaccine development, production at large scale, and widespread distribution worldwide. In doing so, critical requirements on vaccine safety and efficacy must be followed as recommended by the WHO and prescribed by national regulatory authorities [5, 6] .",

It belongs to the same Betacoronavirus lineage as the SARS-CoV and also uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor [3, 7, 8] . The virion is approximately 100-150 nm in diameter [9] . Spike glycoprotein (S), the membrane protein (M), accessory 3a protein, and the envelope protein (E) are located on the surface of virion, and the nucleocapsid protein (N) binds to the viral RNA in helical symmetry, forming the ribonucleocapsid inside the viral particle. Three S protein monomers form a homotrimer, which is the major antigen eliciting neutralizing antibodies, and thus a major target for vaccine development. Several strategies have been employed to express the S or truncated S protein, such as mRNA/ DNA vaccines, adenovirusand influenza-virus vector-based vaccines, and subunit vaccines based on previous experiences in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine developments [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . An alternative strategy is to take the advantage of a mature platform and to develop inactivated, whole virus particle-based vaccines.",

The structural protein E with a calculated MW of 8.4 kDa was not detectable, possibly due to its small size, low molar ratio among the structural proteins or weak reactivity with the anti-virion antiserum. The deduced molecular weights of the S, N, 3a, and M proteins are 142.1, 45.6, 29, and 25 kDa, respectively. As the S proteins are heavily glycosylated [26] and other proteins are modified, the apparent molecular weights of the full-length S, S1 and S2 and N, 3a, M proteins are approximately 200, 115, 90, 55, 35, and 26 kDa, respectively. The virion may contain degraded viral proteins and other accessory proteins including the 3a [27, 28] , which needs to be further clarified in detail using antibodies against the accessory proteins. The protein profiles of the inactivated virions on the gels were scanned and the relative quantity of the S, S1/S2, N, M, and 3a was 22.6, 10.6, 51.3, 8.9, and 2.5%, respectively.

The S protein is a co-translationally N-glycosylated in the ER, oligomerized if folded properly with the help of host proteins, and associated with the M protein in pre-Golgi and ER-Golgi compartment membranes [29] [30] [31] . The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 forms homotrimer and may be cleaved by host furin-like proteases into a S1 subunit for receptor binding (ACE2) and a S2 subunit for membrane fusion [3] . Both receptor binding domain and viral-cellular membrane fusion domains, and probably other regions, carry neutralizing antigen epitopes [32] . The homotrimers of the S proteins in the inactivated virions of SARS-CoV-2, assembled in mammalian cells, likely maintain their native structure, conformation, and neutralizing epitopes. These explained its excellent humoral immunogenicity in animals tested and in phase I/II clinical trials [21] . In this study, the cleavage of the monomeric S into S1 and S2 was also confirmed. Further characterization of the folding, glycosylation, maturation, trimer-formation, and cleavage in Vero cells are under way. The relationship between these post-translational modifications and the functions of the S protein, such as virus entry of cells, immunogenicity warrants further investigations.",

Little is known about the memory B-cell responses against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, apart from a recent study which demonstrated the persistence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in MERS survivors for up to 34 months [34] . On the other hand, antibody responses against another closely related coronavirus, SARS-CoV, were not persistent, since a 6-year follow-up study did not detect memory B-cell responses in SARS survivors [35] . Immune senescence is common in the elderly, who are one of the main targets of protection by a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Dosages and immune schedule study are very important in animals and in the highrisk population. In this study, the preliminary results in mice and rats showed that the NtAb titres reached the peak post-priming and boosting in an interval of 14 days for 84 days at least. The mice and rats have been injected twice or three times at a dose of 5 \u00b5g/ mouse and NtAb levels remain high for 6 months (Unpublished data). Longer interval between the priming and boosting increased the NtAb levels in animals, consistent with the preliminary results of phase I/II clinical trials [21] . Immune persistency will warrant further study by following up the volunteers in phase I and II clinical trials to test the NtAb titres over a long-period of time or donors of convalescence sera for plasma treatment of patients of COVID-19 [36] .",

It is a controversial issue because the severe side effect of ADE has not been observed generally by other researchers of SARS-CoV vaccine development [39] and in the preclinical study of SARS-CoV-2 study [17] [18] [19] [20] . For this vaccine, efficacy and safety were investigated in both Rhesus monkeys and ACE2 Tg mice (unpublished data). The results demonstrated that following vaccination in monkeys and transfer of specific neutralizing serum in ACE2 mice, the animals were protected from infection post-challenge with wildtype SARS-CoV-2 and no ADE was observed. Furthermore, ACE2-transcently expressed mice were used for this vaccine to provide critical evidence of safety and in vivo protection of the vaccinated animals [20] . Following both active immunization of the vaccine and passive immunization of antibody, the ACE2-expressing mice were protected from attack of challenging SARS-CoV-2 and no adverse reactions were observed [20] . Toxicity study was also performed in SD rats and Cynomolgus monkeys and the results would support immunization of the elderly at a high dose and boosting two times if needed.",
