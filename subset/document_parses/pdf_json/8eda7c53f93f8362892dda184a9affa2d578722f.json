We studied respiratory droplet generation and exhalation in human and nonhuman primate subjects with and without COVID-19 infection to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection, and other changes in physiological state, translate into observable evolution of numbers and sizes of exhaled respiratory droplets in healthy and diseased subjects. In our observational cohort study of the exhaled breath particles of 194 healthy human subjects, and in our experimental infection study of eight nonhuman primates infected, by aerosol, with SARS-CoV-2, we found that exhaled aerosol particles vary between subjects by three orders of magnitude, with exhaled respiratory droplet number increasing with degree of COVID-19 infection and elevated BMI-years. We observed that 18% of human subjects (35) accounted for 80% of the exhaled bioaerosol of the group (194), reflecting a superspreader distribution of bioaerosol analogous to a classical 20:80 superspreader of infection distribution. These findings suggest that quantitative assessment and control of exhaled aerosol may be critical to slowing the airborne spread of COVID-19 in the absence of an effective and widely disseminated vaccine. aerosols | respiratory medicine | COVID-19 | superspreaders S evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmits through the air by a combination of the large droplets exhaled when people cough or sneeze and the very small droplets people generate in their airways when they naturally breathe (1) (2) (3) (4) . How exhaled respiratory droplets vary between individuals, evolve over time within individuals, and change with the onset and progression of COVID-19 infection is poorly understood, yet critical to clarifying the nature of COVID-19 transmission-and other highly communicable airborne respiratory diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis (TB).",

At peak inspiratory flows during normal breathing, air speeds in the trachea and main bronchi can reach turbulent velocities (5) . The rush of air over the thin (5 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm) mucus layer lining the airways can break up the mucus surface into small droplets in the way strong winds produce breakup and spray on the surface of the ocean (6) . The nature and extent of this droplet breakup is dependent on the surface properties of the mucus itself (6, 7). Among properties most influencing droplet generation and droplet size are surface viscoelasticity (which resists the stretching of mucus surface on breakup) and surface tension (which lowers the energy expended in small droplet creation) (8, 9) . In airway lining mucus, both properties vary with lung surfactant type and concentration, as well as with composition and structure of mucus in close proximity to air surfaces (6) . Surfactant and mucin compositional and structural changes, driven, in part, by physiological alterations of the human condition-including diet (10), aging (11) , and COVID-19 infection itself (12)-may therefore be anticipated to alter droplet generation and droplet size (7) during acts of breathing.",

Our studies of exhaled aerosol suggest that a critical factor in these and other transmission events is the propensity of certain individuals to exhale large numbers of small respiratory droplets. Our findings indicate that the capacity of airway lining mucus to resist breakup on breathing varies significantly between individuals, with a trend to increasing with the advance of COVID-19 infection and body mass index multiplied by age (i.e., BMI-years). Understanding the source and variance of respiratory droplet generation, and controlling it via the stabilization of airway lining mucus surfaces, may lead to effective approaches to reducing COVID-19 infection and transmission.",

TB is an aerosolacquired pulmonary disease that is caused by exposure to and infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The rhesus macaque represents a highly refined model of clinical TB, with development of active pulmonary disease that shares remarkable similarities with clinical TB in humans (14) . Rhesus macaques (n = 4) were experimentally infected by small-particle aerosol exposure (\u223c2 \u03bcm) with Mtb (Erdman strain) at a target inhaled dose of 400 colony-forming units (CFU). Animals were monitored for development of disease thereafter, including biological outcome parameters correlative with development of disease (e.g., purified protein derivative positivity, C-reactive protein, radiographs, presence of bacilli in lavage fluid). Aerosol parameters measured within the face masks, which also was used in our COVID-19 primate model, included cumulative (total) particle counts and distribution-specific data collection. Results showed animals experimentally aerosol-infected with Mtb strain experienced development of active pulmonary TB over the next several weeks postinfection. Aerosol monitoring of the infected primates via face mask during postexposure observation showed a peak in total particles (\u223c3.5E+05 particles per liter exhaled breath) at week 4 postinfection (Fig. 5A) . The distribution of particles collected during infection markedly changed as the disease severity and tempo intensified, with the submicron fraction of particles produced increasing with days postinfection similar to what we observed with COVID-19 infection in the same NHP model (Fig. 5B) . The temporal development of active pulmonary TB in the infected primate showed an increase of total exhaled breath particles that continued to increase as bacillary load in the lungs of the infected animals increased until experiment terminus, as experimentally induced TB does not resolve without chemotherapeutic intervention. Similarly, total exhaled breath particles increased in the COVID-19\u2212infected primates as viral titers in the mucosal tissues continued to increase. However, due to the self-limiting nature of COVID-19 in the primate model, exhaled breath particles decreased once viral titers began to decrease in the infected animals. These two disease models demonstrate that, although disease pathogenesis differs, the physiological effects of disease induction correlate with the production of increased exhaled breath particles, and, in the case of self-limiting disease (as in the primate model of COVID-19), exhaled breath particle production decreases as disease burden declines.",

These results were compared with exhaled aerosol particle numbers from three family members in quarantine. As in the NHP infection study reported here (Fig. 3) , an extraordinarily high number of exhaled aerosol particles was observed in the infected human subject on days 8 and 9 postsymptoms (2,754 and 1,353 particles per liter), while exhaled particle numbers fell sharply on days 10 and 11 (224 and 29 particles per liter), attaining, in these last days, levels akin to the exhaled aerosol of the other three noninfected family members (in the range of 7 to 198 particles per liter). The present NHP study results (Figs. 3 and 4) shine a fuller light on this phenomenon of respiratory droplet numbers growing with viral load, then falling with the decline in lung infection. Our TB (NHP) results (Fig. 5) indicate that this relationship between increasing exhaled aerosol emission and diminishing droplet size, with the advance of lung infection, might apply to viral and bacterial lung infections other than COVID-19 and TB. While more research needs to be conducted in human and NHP models, it is possible that a transient effervescence in exhaled respiratory droplets may help explain the limited time window post COVID-19 infection during which infected individuals are most contagious.",

Eligible participants were healthy adults 19 y to 66 y of age, either essential workers at No Evil Foods in Asheville, NC, or students, faculty, staff, and other human volunteers at Grand Rapids Community College in Michigan. Participants were not screened for SARS CoV-2 infection by serology or PCR before enrollment. The trial was conducted on the premises of No Evil Foods and at Grand Rapids Community College. An illustrative (North Carolina) protocol is available in SI Appendix. For the North Carolina study, an independent review board (Ethical and Independent Review Services) determined formal Institutional Review Board (IRB) review to be unnecessary when considering the observational nature of the study and the corresponding minimal impact on human subject research. For the Grand Rapids Community College study, the college's IRB committee approved the protocol.",

Exhaled particles were measured by a particle detector (Climet 450-t) designed to count airborne particles in the size range of 0.3 \u03bcm to 5 \u03bcm. The particle detector was connected to a standard nebulizer tubing and mouthpiece that filters incoming air through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Each standard nebulizer tubing and mouthpiece was removed from sealed packaging before each subject prior to the subject's first exhaled particle detection. On subsequent counting maneuvers, the same mouthpiece, tubing, and HEPA filter were replaced into the particle counter system by the participant to insure effective hygiene. Subjects performed normal tidal breathing through a mouthpiece while plugging their noses over 1 to 2 min-beginning with two deep breaths to empty their lungs of environmental particles. Over this time frame, particle counts per liter diminished to a lower baseline number, reflecting particles emitted from breakup of airway lining fluid surfaces in the subject's airways. Once the lower plateau of particle counts was reached, subjects continued to breathe normally. Three to eight particle counts (average values of particle counts assessed over 6 s) were then averaged to determine the mean exhaled particle count and SD. Participants sat opposite to the study administrator with a Plexiglas barrier separating the participant and the administrator.",

A total of eight male (>7 y of age), purpose-bred rhesus macaques and wild-caught African green monkeys were used in our NHP study of COVID-19; four rhesus macaque monkeys were used in the TB study. NHPs are extremely limited in allocation for the purposes of biomedical research studies, and represent a scarce scientific resource. Therefore, acquisition and use may, at times, trump the balancing of particular desirable characteristics (e.g., gender) in the design of particular experimental cohorts. The use of \"all males\" in this study was not intentional inasmuch as it was imposed by the process of acquisition and allocation of animals for this study. The African green monkeys species used in a portion of the studies were acquired from a source that does not purpose-breed animals and rather acquires from natural habitat. Accordingly, demographics on these animals are limited (e.g., age) and are only estimated from dental record. Animals were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (BEI, USA-WA1/2020, NR-52281) and Mtb (Erdman) by small-particle aerosol previously characterized in our laboratory inhalation system (24) . Animals received (for the COVID-19 studies) an inhaled dose of \u223c2.5 \u00d7 10 3 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (SI Appendix) and (for the TB studies) an inhaled dose of 466 \u00b1 237 CFU. Animals were observed for 28 d or 60 d postinfection (COVID-19 or TB studies, respectively) including twice daily monitoring by veterinary staff. In our COVID-19 studies, mucosal and other biosamples were collected at 7 d before infection, at days 1, 3, 7, 14, and at necropsy (day 28) after infection. In our TB studies, mucosal and other biosamples were collected at 7 d before infection, at days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and at necropsy. During biosampling events and physical examination while anesthetized and in dorsal recumbency, and experiencing normal respiration, animals were individually sampled for exhaled breath aerosols. This sampling was performed using a modified pediatric face mask fitted with a HEPA-filtered inspiration port, and a corresponding sampler for exhalation. A particle counter (Thermo Systems Inc. AeroTrak handheld particle counter Model 9306-V2) was used to sample exhaled breath particles for five 1-min intervals at every sampling time point. Exhaled breath particle data were collected in a cumulative fashion. Quantification of swab viral RNA. Nasal swabs were collected in 200 \u03bcL of DNA/ RNA Shield and extracted for viral RNA using the Quick-RNA Viral kit. Samples were then quantified using RT-qPCR (SI Appendix, Methods).",
