Additionally, the schedule of the Chinese National College Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) has been the focus of people's attention. Students in Grade 3 Senior High school were under big study pressure during the isolation caused by COVID-19. Adolescents were in a high-risk period of depression [13] , and excessive life events and pressure may induce difficult-to-adjust emotions and psychological health problems [14] .

A large number of studies suggest that young people accumulate at least 60 min of Moderateto-Vigorous intensity Physical Activity (MVPA) per day, while limiting Sedentary Time (SED) to <120 min per day [16, 17] . However, in a survey covering 105 countries, 80.3% of 13-15-year-olds doing fewer than 60 min of MVPA per day [18] . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, daily transportation PA and leisure-time exercise were very limited. Most people spent longer time on sedentary behaviors at home, resulting in reduced Physical Activity (PA) [19] . In particular, long-term online academic learning was the major study method for adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. It inevitably led to lower levels of PA, and prolonged sedentary screen time. Insufficient PA level of adolescents was associated with increased anxiety level, decreased learning efficiency and increased risk of depression [20] . Research has approved that increase in SED resulted in poor mental health [21, 22] . High levels of regular PA can reduce students' anxiety and stress and improve their on academic performance [23] . Physical exercise have a favorable effect on various mood profiles, regardless of exercise types, duration (between 10 and 60 min) and recovery period (between 5 and 30 min) [24, 25] . Young people with severe mental illness showed reductions in anxiety and depression after the exercise intervention [26] . During the epidemic, adolescents maintaining moderate-intensity PA was associated with better immune function and better health conditions [27] .",

Yan'an City is a prefecture-level city located in the north of Shaanxi Province. It is a holy place for Chinese revolution and the first batch of national historical and cultural cities announced by the State Council. This survey included a total of 11 counties (Huangling, Huanglong, Yichuan, Luochuan, Fuxian, Yanxian, Ganquan, Yanchuan, Wuqi, Zichang, and Zhidan) and two districts (Pagoda and Ansai), including urban and rural areas. In China, middle schools include Junior High Schools and Senior High Schools. Specifically, Junior High Schools include Junior High School Grade 1-3, while Senior High Schools include Senior High School Grade 1-3. In our study, participants were divided into four groups: Junior Grade 1 and 2, Junior Grade 3, Senior Grade 1 and 2, Senior Grade 3, depending on whether they were in the graduating grade or not. The questionnaires were filled out by students with the guidance of their teachers through the google forms platform Questionnaires included three domains: demographic information (age, sex, grades, living areas, wake up time, bed time, etc.), PA/SED and mood states. A total of 5500 questionnaires were issued and 5319 questionnaires were received (response rate: 96.7%), with 4898 having complete and valid data of demographic information, PA/SED and mood states. Participants has signed written consents to participate. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Shaanxi Normal University.",

The IPAQ-SF consists of vigorous-intensity activities, moderate-intensity activities, and walking. Participants were required to recall the number of days they performed each activity (frequency) and the length of time (duration) they were involved daily in each activity during the last 7 days [31] . According to the official IPAQ-SF scoring protocol, the PA level was divided into three PA groups, including high, moderate and low PA group (see www.ipaq.ki.se). The average time spent on sedentary behaviors in each of the last 7 days was also asked in the survey. Participants were divided by the order of SED from low to high into three groups (high, moderate, and low SED group) according to the SED tertiles.",

The reason may be that the psychological and physical characteristics of girls in middle-school were more sensitive to various things than boys, and girls were more likely to produce tension and confusion in the face of emergencies. This was consistent with previous studies [42] . The total mood disturbance of the Senior Grade 3 was the highest, and significant differences existed in the mood states across different grade groups. The reason may be that the school study of the Junior Grade 3 group and Senior High Grade 3 group have been delayed for nearly 3 months, and their study efficiency and environment were very limited. More specifically, the pressure of the high school entrance examination and National College Entrance Examinations has caused students to be emotionally unstable and psychologically anxious. The students in the Junior Grade 1 and 2 have just entered the middle-school and the learning pressure was relatively small, so their state of mood was a stable level. A survey of general public (12-59 years) at the initial phase of COVID-19 outbreak in China indicated about one-third people had moderate-to-severe anxiety, and students and women were more prone to have higher stress and anxiety [43] . Affected by the epidemic, the start of school was postponed, and online learning became the main learning method for students. A survey found that online learning for more than 2.5 h per week can cause severe mood disturbance. Research has approved that the longer time students spent in front of the screen, the lower levels of psychological well-being [44, 45] . Therefore, in future pandemic, relevant departments should control online learning time and pay attention to the physical and mental health of adolescents.",

Higher levels PA was related to better performance in mood states tests, which was consistent with previous studies [46, 47] . For example, survey of Chinese college students' emotions and physical exercise after the outbreak found that physical exercise helped to alleviate negative emotions, and when weekly PA was 2500 Metabolic Equivalent of Energy (METs), it could more significantly alleviate negative emotions [41] . Li [48] found that moderate-intensity PA can help reduce the negative emotions of college students and produce positive mood states. Xu et al. [49] investigated the PA and mood state of the 18-69-year-old population and found PA was significantly related to the mood state of the residents, and physical exercise helped to reduce panic and depression. a b c Another study among 2678 (18-65 years) individuals with mood and/or anxiety disorders found that a large proportion of patients with mood and/or anxiety disorders did not exercise regularly, and those who exercise regularly had a low level of anxiety and higher levels of satisfaction with life [50] . In a review article covering 73 articles on the effects of PA on the mental health of children aged 3-18, it was reported that exercise had a small to moderate positive effect on the mental health of children, especially for children who were diagnosed as cognitively impaired or emotionally disturbed [47] . Compared to lower level PA, individuals engaging in higher PA had lower odds of experiencing anxiety, while there was no significant difference for moderate levels of PA [51] . In the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, research has found a significant positive correlation existed between PA and mental well-being, and maintaining higher levels of MVPA was an important strategy for mental health [52] . People who accumulated exercise for more than 30 min during the epidemic were less likely to experience symptoms such as anxiety and depression, while those who were sedentary for more than 10 h a day had higher levels of depression [53, 54] .",

Adolescents with longer time of screen behaviors were at higher levels of anxious [57] . However, some other studies have also found SED was not associated with depression [58, 59] , since mental health are influenced by many other factors, such as education, income and history of other disease.

Second, the IPAQ-SF and POMS were internationally recognized and have high reliability and validity, which can effectively provide the data needed for this survey, Third, the study was conducted during the outbreak of COVID-19, which was a public pandemic with global health threats. The results in such a unique social model was valuable for policymakers, schools, communities and families to design and implement strategies to ensure the PA and mental health in Chinese adolescents. The present study had several limitations. First, both PA and mood states were measured by self-reported tools, which may suffer from the same source of bias in this study. However, this may be the only method to evaluate the PA and mood states of adolescents during the COVID-19 isolation. Second, due to lack of supervision and patience, the data collected by online questionnaires may not be very accurate and reliable. Third, the online survey was conducted from March 8th to 15th, which was in a period of slow growth. Students have adapted to home isolation and online learning, and their mood state was relatively stable. In the future, further study can be conducted to investigate the objectively measured PA and sedentary behaviors of adolescents during emergencies and explore the exact relationship between PA/sedentary behaviors and emotional state.",
