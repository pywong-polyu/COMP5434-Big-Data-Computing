An accurate load prediction of hospital energy consumption is of paramount importance to a successful healthcare building energy management. In this study, eight machine learning models of single learning and ensemble learning were developed for predicting healthcare facilities' energy consumption. To validate the performance of the proposed model, an experiment was conducted on a general hospital in Shanghai, China. It was found that the two ensemble models, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model and Random Forest (RF) model, outperformed single models in daily electrical load prediction. A further comparison between models trained with daily and weekly temporal resolution electrical data shows that it is more likely to achieve higher accuracy with finer time granularity. Through feature importance analysis, the most influential features under the daily and weekly electrical load prediction were identified. Based on the prediction results, it is expected that hospital facility managers will be able to conveniently assess the expected energy usage of their hospitals with the machine learning models.",

Currently, the energy consumption of the building sector mainly comes from commercial and residential buildings. Large-scale commercial buildings are reported to have a high energy consumption, which can be up to 300 kW h/m 2 , 5 to 15 times of that in residential buildings (Liang et al., 2016) . In the commercial sector, healthcare buildings are particularly energy-intensive due to their constant need for power supply and strict requirements for air quality and disease control (Garc\u00eda-Sanz-Calcedo et al., 2019; Bawaneh * Corresponding author.",

The main functions of healthcare buildings include providing medical services and carrying out scientific research. Compared to other commercial buildings, healthcare buildings are distinguished by overloaded schedules, increased electricity usage, diversified electricity forms, and higher electricity consumption per gross floor area. For example, in the hospital context, a large amount of electricity has to be provided to make sure the normal operation of cold-chain equipment for vaccine storage, pumps for clean water supply, lighting, and other life-saving medical equipment for night-time and emergency care (Dholakia, 2018) .

However, there is a paucity of research that focused on healthcare buildings due to the complexity of their energy consumption patterns. Even though the amount of electrical load information related to diagnostic and medical treatment has been increased with the advancement of metering and sensing technologies, the detailed analysis based on the measured information remains scarce. Therefore, in this paper, the authors propose a one day-ahead electrical load forecasting model based on single and ensemble machine learning algorithms. To validate the performance of the proposed model, an experiment was conducted on Shanghai Tenth people's hospital, a general hospital under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Hospital Development Center (SHDC) . Daily electrical load consumption information was collected through an intelligent-Building Energy Support System (i-BESS). Because energy consumption patterns in buildings can vary greatly depending on the use of buildings (Park et al., 2016) , the ignorance of function related variables will result in a discrepancy between the predicted values and real values. To fill this gap, in this study, three types of patient occupants were taken into consideration, namely, the inpatient, outpatient, and emergency patients. In the present study, electrical load forecasting models of healthcare buildings are developed based on single and ensemble machine learning algorithms by taking account multi-factors simultaneously. 10 features that are classified into four categories (weather parameters, occupancy data, day type information, and Operation & Maintenance measure) are specified as input to the forecasting models. The daily electrical load forecasting models are trained with a database of a general hospital in Shanghai, containing 700 instances with complete data. To test the impact of time granularity on the prediction performance, these models are also trained with a weekly load dataset. The performance of the prediction models is evaluated by statistical metrics such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). Finally, a feature importance analysis is also presented to identify the critical attributes.",

            "text": "In the past decade, extensive research has been carried out to predict the load demand of buildings and various models have been proposed for real-world applications. These models can be broadly classified into two categories, namely physical models and data-driven models (Amasyali and El-Gohary, 2018) (see Fig. 1 ). In Physical models, physical principles are used to calculate the thermal dynamics and energy behaviors of buildings by taking temperature, humidity, and other physical variables into consideration (Wang et al., 2018a; Li, 2020) . Several building energy modeling tools, such as EnergyPlus, Transient System Simulation Tool (TRNSYS), Environmental Systems Performance-Research (ESP-r), and the Quick Energy Simulation Tool (eQuest), have been widely used in this area (Bui et al., 2020) . However, the performance of physical models depends on a large number of building parameters, such as building envelope structure, lighting system setup, pump water distribution, etc., making it more suitable for buildings at the design stage rather than for as-built (Shao et al., 2020) . To this end, data-driven models using machine learning algorithms to construct mapping functions between input and output data have gained immense popularity due to their ease of use, adaptability and high forecasting performance (Wang et al., 2018a; Wang and Srinivasan, 2017; Somu et al., 2020) . In addition, data-driven models are more practical than physical models since the data used are more available from buildings, such as energy consumption, climatic, temporal, and occupancy, which can be collected via sensing and communication technologies (Wang et al., 2018a) .",

Single prediction models were created by applying one prediction algorithm (Wang and Srinivasan, 2017) . Examples of single prediction models include multiple linear regression (Ji and Xu, 2015) , Artificial Neural Network (Platon et al., 2015) , Support Vector Machines (Wang et al., 2016b) , and long short term memory (LSTM) algorithm (Zhou et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019) . In ensemble learning prediction, instead of using one algorithm to build the forecasting model, multiple learning algorithms are needed to train its base models (Wang and Srinivasan, 2017) . The commonly used ensemble techniques are bagging (Tuysuzoglu and Birant, 2020) , boosting (Kadkhodaei et al., 2020) , voting (Tsai, 2019) , and stacking (Mahendran et al., 2020) . Among them, bagging and boosting are two of the most widely-used ensemble learning methods because of their theoretical superiority and strong experimental performance (Oza, 2005) , with Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) as the representative algorithms for each, respectively. The main difference between RF and XGBoost is that RF combines multiple predictors in a parallel way whereas XGBoost combines them sequentially (Wang et al., 2020a) . Based on the literature review, the prediction performance of single and ensemble prediction models in healthcare buildings context has been underinvestigated. Since XGBoost and RF are more advanced algorithms that could be used for electrical load consumption in buildings, these two algorithms are described in detail as follows.",

A heavier weight will be given to the training samples that failed the training. This process is repeated until the number of base learners reaches a value specified in advance. Finally, a strong model will be constructed by combining these base learners by their trained weights.

XGBoost can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. The mechanism of XGBoost is to first train a decision tree by using the training dataset and then use this tree to obtain the corresponding predicted value. A residual can be obtained by subtracting predicted value from the corresponding real value. Then, by inputting the new training sample and residual, a second tree is trained to optimize the previous residual. The iteration stops when the predefined threshold of parameters, such as max_depth, min_child_weight, are arrived at. The final predicted value is the sum of the predicted values of the previous predictors. After adding a base learner, the value of its objective function is calculated to ensure that the value of the objective function gradually decreases during the iteration process. XGBoost can obtain much better performance than a single prediction algorithm due to the process of correcting the prediction errors of preceding models in the iterative process.",

Different from bagging where all features are considered for splitting a node, RF only selects a subset of features at random and uses the best splitting feature from the subset to split each node in a tree. A problem with bagging is that decision trees can have a lot of structural similarities since they choose which variable to split on using a greedy algorithm that minimizes errors, resulting in a high correlation in their predictions. RF addresses this problem by generating sub-trees in a way that the resulting predictions from all of the subtrees have fewer correlations. RF contains several weak predictors that are trained through bagging and random variable selection. Therefore, RF has good anti-noise and generalization capabilities. Previous research has shown that RF can perform well in the field of load forecasting (Wang et al., 2018a; Morgenstern et al., 2016) .",

Established in 1910, STPH provides healthcare across broad areas of general and specialty care. Like other hospitals located in megacities of China, STPH is extremely busy providing medical services for patients not only from local areas but also from the surrounding regions due to urban agglomeration (Wang et al., 2016a) . As a result, STPH has experienced capacity strain over recent years. In 2018, it had 3.06 million person-times of outpatients and emergency patients, 100 thousand person-times of hospital discharge. The total floor area of STPH is 168,575 m 2 (Fig. 3) , consisting of various departments, such as operation theaters, intensive care units, examination and treatment rooms, and large-scale medical equipment, resulting in an annual electricity expenditure of 19 million Chinese Yuan. Electric power consumed in STPH consists of space heating and cooling, ventilation, lighting, office equipment, and medical diagnostic facilities such as CT and MRI. Generally, hospital buildings can be seen as an integration of general-purpose building space and healthcare-specific building space. Therefore, factors influencing energy consumption consist of common factors related to weather parameters (i.e., outdoor temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, barometric pressure, and precipitation) (Wang et al., 2018a) and some special factors relevant to occupancy, time and Operation &Maintenance (O&M). For occupancy, three types of patients are considered, including the number of outpatients, emergency patients, and inpatients. Because hospitals usually have different schedules according to day type, a parameter representing Weekday or Weekend/Holiday was also considered as an input to the forecasting model. In addition, different O&M measures related to the operational status of the central air-conditioning system are included to accommodate the changing indoor climate condition. The central air conditioning system will be turned on for heating or cooling and turned off at transition seasons, such as spring or autumn. Finally, a total of 10 parameters need to be considered to build a load forecasting model, as listed in Table 1 .",

For example, the main components of inpatient buildings are patient bedrooms and the supporting spaces, e.g., nurses' rooms, storage space, and possible food heating facilities (Morgenstern et al., 2016) . Therefore, the occupancy of hospitals mainly consists of three types of patients, i.e., outpatients, emergency patients, and inpatients. In order to ensure careful control of the indoor climate, healthcare buildings consume more energy than other types of commercial buildings, to achieve a comfortable indoor environment since occupants in hospitals are more sensitive to the physical environment . Occupancy fluctuations complicate decisions concerning the need for a variety of auxiliary facilities, including physical therapy, laboratory tests, surgical services, pharmacy, and housekeeping, and may ultimately impact the energy consumption (Littig and Isken, 2007) . These daily occupancy data were collected from the Healthcare Information System (HIS) of Shanghai. Fig. 5 shows the normalized value of occupants and load relationship of STPH for 1 month. It can be seen that the number of inpatients and emergency patients is small compared to that of outpatients. In addition, it can be seen that both the number of outpatients and electricity consumption have the lowest levels on Sundays.",

To investigate the impact of the interaction between the healthcare buildings and calendar variables on the electrical load prediction, a dummy variable was added to distinguish between weekdays and weekends/holidays. For STPH, weekday usually refers to Monday to Saturday while only Sunday is the weekend. In addition, the calendar from the hospital's official website was used to determine the holiday schedule. All holidays and Sundays were combined. In this study, the relationship between the day type and daily electrical load was statistically analyzed, and the violin plot is shown in Fig. 6 . As depicted in this plot, weekdays have higher load levels than the weekends/holidays. One possible explanation is that for weekdays, all departments will be under normal operations whereas, for weekends/holidays, only a small part of the departments will be open, e.g., the inpatient department.",

The other three types of air conditioning systems would not operate unless the outdoor temperature is higher or lower than an established threshold. According to the schedule of STPH (Table 2) , the central air conditioning system will not operate unless the outdoor temperature is higher than 30 \u2022 C in summer or lower than 8 \u2022 C in winter, which means that the electricity consumption is not linear with regard to the outdoor temperature and it depends on the Operation & Maintenance policy. Generally, there are two working patterns for these central air conditioning systems -cooling and heating. Otherwise, they will be turned off when it is a transition season (i.e., Spring or Autumn). During transition seasons, the central air conditioning system does not operate. In this study, a categorical variable that represents the operational status of air conditioning systems is introduced (Fig. 7) .

Within the single machine learning category, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gaussian Process Regression are selected. Linear Regression is a statistical method used for analyzing the linear relationship of multiple variables, and the simplest single machine learning algorithm (Shine et al., 2018) . Regularization technique is applied which can be used to prevent overfitting problems by adding a regularization term to the loss term. The regression model which uses l 1 regularization term (i.e., the sum of absolute values) is Lasso Regression and the model which uses l 2 regularization term (i.e., the sum of squared coefficients) is Ridge Regression. Elastic Net further combines the regularization terms of Lasso and Ridge regression to overcome their dependency on data and the resulting instability, to get the best of both models. SVR is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm that has the ability to perform regression tasks. Gaussian Process is a generalization of nonlinear multivariate regression (Heo and Zavala, 2012) . In the ensemble machine learning category, XG-Boost and Random Forest, are popular energy prediction models which builds a decision tree in a sequential and parallel way, respectively. Besides, the optimal parameters via GridSearchCV function of these above-mentioned algorithms are presented in the Appendix.",

When it comes to weekly data, the day type variable is not needed. Therefore, in the weekly electrical load prediction, these models were trained with three types of input variables, namely, weather, occupancy, and O&M related variables. For the weather variables, such as outdoor temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, pressure, and precipitation, data were derived by averaging the daily data during the whole week. For occupancy variables, namely, the number of outpatient visits, emergency visits, and inpatients visits, the data were derived by summing the daily data during an entire week. As for the O&M variables, values were identified according to the operation schedule (Table 2) . For the output variable, weekly load prediction of STPH, a sum of each week was used (Fig. 9) .",

For ensemble learning models, the MAPE of XGBoost and RF was 11.12% and 10.69%, respectively, indicating that RF is slightly better than XGBoost. When comparing the results of single and ensemble machine learning models, it appeared that the best single model (i.e., SVR) performed close to the best ensemble model (i.e., RF), with the ensemble model still outperforming the single model. Traditionally, it is recognized that ensemble models always outperform single models. However, the performance of a prediction model depends on several factors, such as input variables, selected models, and model parameters. The results of Module 2 showed that in certain situations, a single model may get similar performance as ensemble models. Due to the relatively high performance of SVR, XGBoost, and RF, they were selected as the base model for the subsequent analysis. By comparing the results of Module 1 and Module 2 in terms of SVR, XGBoost, and RF, it appears that prediction models trained with daily data have better performance than models trained with weekly data. The comparison shows that by dividing the data at a finer level of time granularity, the prediction performance of the machine learning model can be improved. Therefore, the authors suggest that if there are different operating patterns in different periods, the data collected at a finer level of time granularity will be necessary to improve the prediction accuracy of building energy consumption.",

It can be seen from Figs. 10 and 11 that the top 3 most influential features for Modules 1 and 2 were the same (i.e., outdoor temperature, pressure, and operation status of the central air conditioning system), indicating that the daily and weekly electrical load consumption are highly correlated with the same factors. Due to the high energy use related to space heating, cooling and ventilation loads, it was expected that outdoor temperature was the most contributing factor of energy consumption in hospital buildings. The operation status of the central air conditioning system (i.e., Ope), with its importance ranked the third, depends on the specific O&M measures in the tested hospital. Given the same weather condition, hospitals taking different O&M measures will consume different levels of energy. For example, some hospitals decided to open the central air condition system based on the outdoor temperature while others based that decision on the day of the year solely. As to the remaining features, they followed a different importance pattern in daily and weekly load prediction. In Fig. 10 , the result shows that in the case of hospital buildings, day type was the least influential feature mainly due to the around-the-clock operations of hospitals.",

However, healthcare buildings are characterized by energy-intensiveness due to the constant need for available power supply for medical equipment and stringent requirements for air quality, making them the key area of achieving the energy conservation goals in the building domain. In this study, the best prediction performance was 9.64% of MAPE (Table 3) . CVRMSE can be useful to indicate how much variation or randomness there is between the data and the model.

In this paper, the outdoor temperature seems to be the most important feature in both Module 1 and Module 2, which is consistent with many previous studies (e.g., Thinate et al., 2017b) . Since in complex buildings such as a hospital, the energy consumption of the air conditioning system can account for 67% of total energy consumption, whose main function is to keep a comfortable and constant indoor climate against the outdoor climate. Pressure came after temperature, which also has a great impact on energy performance. While for the third important feature, O&M related variable, the importance result is arguable. In most situations, the operation status of the air conditioning system has not been able to keep up with the change in the climate condition, that is it will operate on heating when the outdoor temperature is low and on cooling when the outdoor temperature is high. However, for the majority of public hospitals in China, there is an operation schedule for the central air conditioning system with a flexible period for heating and cooling. In addition, three types of patients were taken into consideration and they also had relatively high importance on electrical load consumption. With respect to the day type, it seems that the differentiation between weekdays and weekends/holidays is not sensitive to the prediction performance of these models. However, the rankings of these features are different in daily and weekly load predictions. One possible explanation is that these variables have different patterns in daily and weekly operations. For example, the number of outpatients is high on weekdays and is low on Sundays since the outpatient department will close on Sundays, which resulted in a significant increase in emergency patients on Sundays.",

The potential reason for the long computation time of Gaussian Regression was its working process in inferring a probability distribution over all possible values.

This paper makes several contributions in model design. Focusing specifically in hospital modeling, the authors developed an electrical load prediction model for healthcare buildings via single and ensemble models. Even though it is widely believed that ensemble models can deliver higher prediction performance than single models by combining multiple individual models together, it is not guaranteed and needs to be tested context-by-context. However, few empirical studies have been conducted to test it in the healthcare facility energy prediction context. Using the data of a general hospital in Shanghai, the experimental results of this paper confirmed that ensemble models indeed outperform single models in terms of almost all measurements. In addition, the scope of the involved independent variables of the models employed in this study is broader than the majority of previous studies. Not only the well-known energy variables were included, such as weather and day type, but also explored is the impact of occupancy and O&M variables on the performance of the prediction model, making the model context closer to the actual operation situation of hospital buildings. Furthermore, this study identified the most important features affecting energy consumption in the experimented hospital which can give insights to healthcare facility managers in how to create the O&M schedule more appropriately. By training the electrical load prediction with daily and weekly models, it shows that it is more accurate to conduct load prediction with finer time granularity.",

For example, data of four types of independent variables and dependent variables involved in this study are gathered through different methods/tools, such as weather station, Healthcare Information System (HIS), and smart meter. With the increasing popularity of big data and artificial intelligence, more efforts will be devoted to collect data in the area of healthcare facility operations by using multiple technologies. From this perspective, the methodology used in this paper can achieve its effective applications not only in the energy management systems but also in other fields of healthcare facilities management in the future.",

            "text": "In this study, eight algorithms from two load prediction approaches (single and ensemble machine learning) were compared, which has seldom been systematically conducted in previous studies. The ensemble models outperformed single models in electric load prediction of the tested hospital, demonstrating its ability to support the decision-making process of facility managers of hospitals. In addition, both general characteristics (e.g., weather parameters) and function-specific characteristics (e.g., the number of patients) were considered when building the prediction model, making the model context closer to the actual operation situation of hospital buildings. Although the proposed model has satisfactory predictive performance, the following limitations are acknowledged. The nature of the proposed method is data-driven, meaning the prediction performance highly depends on the quality of data. Even rigorous data preprocessing has been conducted before the formal experiment, there may still exist some data noise. Thus, the characteristics of data collected from a specific hospital may affect its accuracy. It would be better to test the performance of the proposed procedure in several hospitals. Besides, the occupancy in the hospital consists of several types of people, including doctors, nurses, patients, and their visitors, facilities managers, etc. In this study, due to the accessibility of data, only three types of patients were included. Further research can be conducted for a deeper analysis of the effect of occupancy by taking all of them into consideration.",

            "text": "Healthcare facilities are a vital part of social and medical organizations providing the society with needed healthcare. In addition, they are also the main battlefield of the public health emergency system fighting a pandemic like coronavirus disease 2019 . Serving as the lifeline for all activities, energy consumption plays an important role in ensuring the efficient operations of healthcare facilities. Predicting the electrical load of healthcare buildings accurately can support the decision-making processes of healthcare facility managers to improve building energy performance. This study compared the precision of eight machine learning models trained with daily and weekly datasets from a general hospital in Shanghai. It was found that for daily electrical load prediction, RF, XGBoost, and SVR were the most accurate ensemble and single learning models, with a MAPE on the test dataset of 9.64%, 9.81%, and 10.67%, respectively. These can be considered as reliable intelligent prediction models for facility/energy managers to conduct daily electrical load prediction in the future. In addition, based on the same dataset, the impact of forecasting granularity on prediction performance was tested. By comparing the results of daily and weekly load prediction, it was found that the performance would improve by using more granular or detailed energy usage data. One possible explanation is that a detailed load profile can decrease the uncertainty in computing. In terms of the feature importance, outdoor temperature, air pressure, and operation status of the central air conditioning system were found to be the top 3 contributing factors. ",
