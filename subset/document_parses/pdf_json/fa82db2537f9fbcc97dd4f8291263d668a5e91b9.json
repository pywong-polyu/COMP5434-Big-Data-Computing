The third rank of the cause of human mortality in the world and the second rank in Iran belong to occupational accidents and injuries (Izadi et al., 2019) . In addition, the international labor organization (ILO) estimates the cost of occupational accidents and work-related diseases as four percent of the gross national product (GNP) (Yilmaz and \u04aaelebi, 2015) . These accidents have various contributing factors. Hollnagel et al. have introduced two types of approaches, including safety I and safety II, to investigate and decrease job accidents. Safety I, as a reactive approach, studies what that goes wrong. While safety II, as a proactive approach, focused on what that goes right. One of the measures for safety II is the creation of positive organizational conditions, which can affect personal behavior and control accidents (Hollnagel, 2018) . This condition can be provided through different agents such as decreased job stress and increased positive safety climate. Of course, the correct paths should be investigated to implement effective measures.",

            "text": "Work-related stress is the substantial imbalance between a person's capabilities and job demands to cause great consequences (De Jonge and Dormann, 2017) . Based on the reports of the World health organization (WHO), more than half of the employees in the developed countries suffer from occupational stress (Torshizi and Ahmadi, 2011) . In general, stress is divided into two types, including physical stress and psychological stress (De Jonge and Dormann, 2017) . Physical stress can stimulate the biological responses in reaction to a stressful situation via releasing the hormones and occasion the effects such as sleep disorders, headache, and skin problems (Leung et al., 2012) . On the other hand, psychological stress shows an intensive trauma experience, which can cause the effects such as anxiety, sadness, anger, and tension at the workplace (Luan et al., 2020) . Various occupational dimensions, such as job control, conflict at work, job satisfaction, mental demand, physical environment, social support, workload, and responsibility can contribute to job stress in the workplace (Kazronian et al., 2013) . Figure 1 . The workflow of the method applied in this study. A.H. Khoshakhlagh et al. Heliyon 7 (2021) e08082 Several studies have been demonstrated the effect of job stress on accidents. Goldenhar et al. concluded that occupational stressors play an important role in 37 percent of industrial accidents and injuries (Goldenhar et al., 2003) . Kim et al. also observed that high job stress was associated with the occurrence of occupational injury among firefighters (Kim et al., 2016) . Leung et al. represented a model based on which the job stress impresses on accidents through safety behavior (Leung et al., 2016) . The results of the studies show that job stress plays a significant role in the occurrence of unsafe behaviors and accidents by decreasing concentration, distraction, memory impairment, work hesitation, and decision-making power (Day et al., 2012) . Moreover, job stress can affect accident occurrences through other paths. One of the probable paths is the changed safety climate. This factor shows the employees' perceptions of the organizational prioritization to the workplace's safety issues (Zohar, 2000) . Safety climate has various dimensions such as management's safety priority, commitment, and competence, management's safety empowerment, management's safety justice, workers' safety commitment, and workers' safety priority and risk non-acceptance (Casey et al., 2017) . The results of a study performed by Ajslev et al. showed that the safety climate has a reverse relationship to the accident occurrence (Ajslev et al., 2017) . On the other hand, Kuo concluded that the job stressors impress on the occupational commitment of police officers (Kuo, 2015) . Haque and Aston also investigated the relationship between occupational stress and organizational commitment. The results showed that stress influences the employees' performance and organizational commitment so that low occupational stress and high social support at the workplace can increase it (Haque and Aston, 2016) . Therefore, likely, there is a relationship between job stress and safety climate, and in this way, the accident occurrence is affected. The identification of the substantial dimensions and relationships helps to plan the measures for reducing accidents. However, to the best of the knowledge of the authors, no studies have examined them. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the relations of job stress dimensions to safety climate and accidents occurrence among the workers using regression models. Figure 1 shows the workflow of the method applied in this study.",

At the first phase, a list of people occupied in various departments, including 4621 persons, was prepared, and 2100 male workers (45.44%) were randomly selected. Given the low numbers of female employees in this company, they were not entered into the study. Also, it should be noted that most of the workers in industrial environments from Iran are males, and females are mostly employed in administrative jobs. In the next step, the medical records of these workers were studied and those with the inclusion and exclusion criteria were invited into the study. Finally, 1742 people (33.11%) remained in the study. Of them, 1530 persons (87.83%) completed the questionnaires. Inclusion criteria comprised having work experience higher than one year and having literacy. Exclusion criteria included the lack of cooperation and the lack of enough attention to complete the questionnaires. People from different departments of the petrochemical industry, including technical, electrical, machinery, maintenance, mechanical, welding, turning, and supervision parts participated in the study. The number of chosen people in each department was determined based on the ratio of the number of employees in each department to the total number of them. The lowest and highest relative frequencies belonged to supervisors and repairing workers with 3.6% and 18.4%, respectively. The protocol for performing this study was reviewed and approved by the medical ethics committee of Tehran University of medical sciences. All steps of the study were in accordance with the ethical code IR.TUMS.VCR.REC.1398.558. All participants confirmed consciously the consent form provided by the committee.",

So far, this questionnaire has been applied in several studies with different purposes. For example, Sugawara et al. evaluated the occupational stress among mental health nurses using GJSQ (Sugawara et al., 2017) . Inoue et al. estimated some job stress dimensions of Japanese employees occupied in hospitals and medical facilities, transportation, manufacturing, and the information technology, pharmaceutical, and service industries using this questionnaire (Inoue et al., 2014) . In the present study, GJSQ was used to assess the job stress dimensions among the workers of a petrochemical company. The NIOSH generic job stress questionnaire (GJSQ) comprised 21 dimensions, including background information (7 items), conflict at work (16 items), job control (16 items), employment opportunities (4 items), somatic complaints (17 items), general job information (12 items), health condition (24 items), self-esteem (10 items), job requirements (10 items), job satisfaction (4 items), mental demands (5 items), non-work activities (7 items), depression (20 items), physical environment (10 items), problems at work (6 items), social support (12 items), work hazards (5 items), work limitations (5 items), workload and responsibility (11 items), role conflict and ambiguity (14 items), and job future ambiguity (5 items). Kazronian et al. (2013) translated this questionnaire to the Persian version and validated it among Iranian firefighters. Any of the questions and dimensions were removed and changed in this version. They resulted that Cronbach's alpha coefficient of this questionnaire was greater than 0.70 and its intra-cluster correlation coefficient was equal to 0.70 (Cassidy, 1999) . However, in the present study, Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the questionnaire and coefficient of intra-class correlation was computed again. The options for answers were different, including yes or no, false and true, Likert from one to five, Likert from one to three, and open-ended replies (\u00c7ET _ IN-KAYA & Dicle, 2017). However, the scores of all dimensions were normalized between values of one and five. The dimensions with the qualitative and non-Likert answers including background information, general job information, health condition, non-work activities, and work limitations were removed. The total score of each of remained dimensions was also obtained by calculating the mean value of the scores of its questions.",

In the bivariate analysis, the dimension of job satisfaction had the highest correlation coefficient with the total score of safety climate. Nevertheless, in the multivariate analysis, the greatest correlation coefficient with the total score of safety climate belonged to the dimension of the physical environment. Job satisfaction is one of the most important factors affecting job stress. Huang et al. concluded that the safety climate perceptions of the employees have meaningful relationships with job satisfaction and engagement, and job satisfaction plays a mediator role between safety climate, employee engagement, and turnover rate (Huang et al., 2016) . Moreover, Nielsen et al. studied relationships between risk perception, safety climate, and job satisfaction based on the job demands-resources model. The results showed that a positive safety climate has a relation with high job satisfaction and safety climate has a mediator role between risk perception and job satisfaction (Nielsen et al., 2011) . The physical environment was another of the important job stress factors affecting the safety climate. It is clear that the poor physical environment such as workplaces with noise, heat, and vibration induces the perceptions of the low management prioritization to the safety and health issues and change the safety climate. Dejoy et al. concluded that environmental conditions could significantly affect the perceived safety climate of employees. The results are consistent with the results of the present study (DeJoy et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "Indeed, job dissatisfaction, poor physical environment, and other inappropriate job stress factors can affect organizational justice, as one of the most substantial dimensions of the safety climate. Bakhshi et al. showed that the organizational justice perceptions predict job satisfaction and organization commitment (Bakhshi et al., 2009) . The results of the present study also showed that there are significant negative correlations between all dimensions of the safety climate with the total score of the safety climate. However, the highest bivariate and multivariate correlation coefficients between the total score of the job stress with the dimensions of the safety climate were related to the management's safety justice. In a model represented by Fujoshiro and Heaney, there are two-ways relationships between justice and job stress. In this model, work organization and supervisor coworker behaviors influence appraisals of justice and stress. Moreover, job stress and organizational justice impress on each other and thereby cause health problems (Fujishiro and Heaney, 2009) . Gyekye and Haybatollahi concluded that the perceived justice level in an organization affects the safety perception and other organizational factors. The social exchange theory adjusts this relationship (Ayim Gyekye and Haybatollahi, 2014). Based on this theory, the response of employees at workplaces depends on their perception of organizational management behaviors (Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005) . Therefore, the lack of job satisfaction and appropriate physical environment makes a bad perception of the organizational behaviors and thereby leads to unsafe acts and accident occurrence. In addition, these factors disorder the balance of the demands and resources. The imbalance of the inputs and outputs causes cognitive failure and a person makes a mistake in performing the job (Day et al., 2012) . These errors can also cause accidents. Based on the results of the present study, when the effect of safety climate was moderated, two factors of job satisfaction and social support were only effective in the occurrence of accidents. These results justify the role of the social exchange theory. Therefore, social supports can compensate the existing failures such as job dissatisfaction. Kula states that both organizational and operational stress has an indirect effect on job satisfaction through supervisor support as a mediator variable (Kula, 2017) . Moreover, Woodhead et al. concluded that the support from supervisors and friends or family members as a job resource is associated with lower emotional exhaustion and higher levels of personal accomplishment (Woodhead et al., 2016) . Resulted by Havermans et al., social supports including co-worker and supervisor supports can adjust the relationship between psychosocial safety climate and job stress and diminish the negative effects (Havermans et al., 2017) . The results of the stated studies and the present study show the important role of job satisfaction and social supports in reducing the negative effects of other stress dimensions. Moreover, the results demonstrated that there is a relationship between job stress scales and safety climate factors. Therefore, the high job stress can create a negative safety climate and vice versa.",

The highest effects belonged to job satisfaction and physical environment. Furthermore, of the safety climate dimensions, management's safety justice showed the greatest correlations with job stress. In addition, with the adjustment of the effect of the safety climate, only two factors of the job stress including job satisfaction and social supports could be effective on the accident occurrence. These results demonstrate the high importance of these factors in accident occurrences. Therefore, the results obtained in this study can be used by the organizations for reducing the accident rate. To increase the positive safety climate and decrease the accident occurrence, industries must try to reduce job stress in the workplaces through controlling the important factors, such as low job satisfaction and poor social supports.",
