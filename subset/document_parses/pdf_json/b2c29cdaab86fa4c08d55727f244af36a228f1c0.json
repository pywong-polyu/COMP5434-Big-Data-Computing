Bioterrorism agents attack the respiratory tract, digestive tract, skin, blood, and glands. Many of the agents cannot be handled by the immune system, and Y. pestis can even survive, proliferate and spread in macrophages (Lukaszewski et al. 2005) . Acute and serious diseases occur after a short incubation period, often only several days. For instance, the symptoms of pneumonic plague include high fever, cold shivers, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, and dyspnea, followed by serious poisoning symptoms and death in two to four days. The mortality of pneumonic and generalized plague is up to 30~60%. Brucella spp. with anti-phagocytic capsules can proliferate in the lymphatic system and then enter into the blood resulting in toxemia, and its ability to evade elimination by the body results in long-term joint pain, fatigue, and disability, dramatically decreasing the quality of life of the patient.

For example, the main clinical syndrome of cholera is diarrhea, however at least six syndromes have been found for tularaemia, including bubonic, pneumonic, gastrointestinal, and systemic (typhoidal and septicemic) tularaemia. The similarity of clinical syndromes between diseases caused by bioterrorism agents and by other factors, makes accurate pathogenesis diagnosis more difficult for doctors when the etiology is unknown.

No specific reaction should occur for substances or strains that share structural similarity, close genetic relatedness or similar transmission routes with the targets. A detection method must be available for different specimens within appropriate operational-error to ensure the stability.

Less operational handling minimizes the possibility of contamination of the inspector and environment with bioterrorism agents. Because of difficulties arising from multiple reactions in one system and simultaneous multiple signal extraction, multiplex detection still shows unsatisfactory performance in stability, anti-interference, and reproducibility. Despite these shortcomings, multiplex detection is urgently required for identification of unknown pathogens and simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in one sample because multiple bioterrorism agents can be released in one sample, for example, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia psittaci and Influenza virus have been combined into aerosols and applied for biowarfare.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Multiplexed Detection"}, {"text": "Bio-threats are becoming increasingly serious with developing technology because of reductions in cost, and improved transmission and operation.
