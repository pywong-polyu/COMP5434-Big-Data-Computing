The effects of lockdown implementation, community isolation, environmental factors, demographic aspects, behavioural factors, diet etc. have been investigated. The effect of the aforementioned factors on the infected cases, cumulative infected cases, recoveries, cumulative recoveries, active cases, deaths and cumulative deaths are analyzed. The integrated effects of the aforementioned factors on COVID-19 outcomes are further amplified due to adequate and inadequate health facilities. The study will be helpful to scientists, researchers, pharmacists and biotechnologists in new vaccine design & to accommodate above factors for the betterment of susceptible & infected people of Maharashtra and similar demographies across the globe. Further, it pinpoints the need for more awareness and control strategies among the people to reduce the havoc, stress, fear, anxiety, pathogenicity and thereby reducing mortality.",

            "text": "The outbreak of novel coronavirus was initiated with its first reported case on March 9, 2020, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Since then, the state has been reported with 422,118 confirmed positive cases, 14,994 deceased cases as well as 256,158 recovered cases as of July 31, 2020. One-third of the nation's total COVID-19 cases have been reported in Maharashtra alone. Considering the same massive rate of spread around the globe, the development process of vaccines by many researchers had begun with the deciphering of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in January 2020. However, there are many uncertainties in the path owing to the possibility of failures in some of the trials, as well as some trials yielding unclear results. With a prolonged period of the time investment involved in the development of the vaccine, we have to wait for a year or so until a safe and effective vaccine is made available to the global community. Due to the same reason, many researchers have begun work in the context of spread patterns, factors affecting the spread, mortality and recovery, as well as the antibody mechanism of this novel coronavirus.",

The number of cases recovered daily started significantly increasing, as shown in Fig.3 , after the peak of infection is observed. After 12 days, the highest number of daily recovered cases were observed on May 17. During this peak to the peak period, it is observed that the infection spread is decreasing gradually, as shown in Fig.3 . By the end of May 2020, strict restrictions on movements of people, goods, and social life were relaxed gradually up to a certain extent considering the number of active cases, as shown in Fig.3 . Even with the ease in the restrictions, new positive cases and active cases continued to reduce till mid of June 2020. But owing to panic created by some localized peaks of new positive cases reported, restrictions in some hotspot areas were again made strict, which resulted in some amount of anxiety. Due to this abrupt change in the regulations, positive cases reported as well as active cases, can be seen increasing post-July 15, as shown in Fig.3 .

Ease in the restrictions for these high-risk zones was allowed up to a certain extent, only within the boundaries. High fluctuations are observed in the number of daily reported positive cases, but some of the peaks in daily recovered cases are observed in both containment zones. The overall effect can be summarized as though there is no significant reduction in daily positive cases, but due to some mass recoveries, active cases in both zones are decreasing considerably. It can be observed that fluctuations are typically wavy if navigated through scatter.

This clearly highlight's that active cases will increase gradually with not that much steep slopes immediately as is evident From Fig.9 Jalgaon MNC and Bhusaval are the two profoundly affected zones in the northern parts of Maharashtra. In cases of Jalgaon MNC, all four parameters viz. positive cases, recovered cases, deaths, as well as active cases are increasing throughout the lockdown period. However, the increase in daily positive cases is much higher than the number of recovered cases. Hence the curve for active cases can be seen continuously climbing, as shown in Fig.10 , with moderate slopes. On the other hand, Bhusaval zones possessed the mixed nature of the curve in the lockdown period. For June 2020, the daily positive cases can be seen decreasing, as shown in Fig.11 , which also resulted in stabilization of the net active cases curve in the same period up to a certain extent.",

For Kamothe, these values are lower as well except for active cases, where R-square is moderate as long as pandemic such as present one is considered, Fig.16 -Fig.25 . This is when data is analyzed on daily basis. On the other hand, when same data is plotted cumulatively, significant R-square values are noted. Of the three regions considered, Malegaon has highest Rsquare and Kamothe has least with Solapur in-between as far as recoveries are considered for mean RH, Fig.26 through Fig.28 . Typical wavy nature can be seen through all the figures while navigating through scatters. Though the evaluation metrics in the case of daily data have values extremely low in the context of statistical significance, it is noticeable that daily recovered cases are increasing against the mean temperature range of 26\u00b0 C to 30\u00b0 C with deviations of less than 2\u00b0C (measured over 24 hours). Feasible range of mean relative humidity for the increasing number of the daily recovered cases are different for each containment zones depending upon geological positioning of the zone. However, it may be noted that daily recovered cases are increasing against a more dominant RH range of 70% to 85% and fluctuations of 1-15 % (for 24 hours). In our previous work [38] , we have shown that higher relative humidity is responsible for an increase in the number of cases. However, it is essential to note that the same higher range of humidity is responsible for an increase in recovered cases.",

This is shown in Fig.29 (a) and Fig.29 (b) . Fig.29 (b) is scaled version of Fig.29 (a) to have more insight in view of X-axis. As can be seen from the figures, wavy nature, typically of a sinusoidal kind with fluctuations in amplitude, is observed. In-fact such a nature is consistent for all the figures almost ( Fig.16-Fig.30 ). This suggests that the active cases will fluctuate in the context of mean temperature and relative humidity with intermittent peaks of less amplitude than the first ones. This is, of course, possible if the undue disturbance of the public is not happening. Otherwise, a severe increase in active cases may happen. This is valid for Fig.16 through Fig.28 .

This resulted in an abrupt change in the lifestyle of most of the people and halted their habits of various kinds of outdoor exercises through walking, running, swimming, gyms etc. At the same time, most of the people in urban areas like Mumbai, Thane, and Nagpur preferred to eat a variety of spicy and fried types of food items. This increased laziness, cholesterol, obesity problems. After the lockdown period, the average consumption of caffeine by individuals has increased due to the consumption of tea and coffee considered as a hot beverage which is remedial solution. Due to this increased amount of caffeine consumption, many people started facing anxiety problems as caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that increases anxious feelings [41] . In the earlier period of lockdown, containment zones like Mumbai GN, Mumbai ME, KDMC, and Kamothe had faced a shortage of vegetable supplies due to restrictions on movement.

Hence overall control of the viral outbreaks in Malegaon MNC and Nagpur MNC zones is entirely satisfactory. The main reason behind promising results emerging out of these three profoundly affected zones can be considered as dominant and isolated communities. Once put into the strict restrictions, Sataranjipura, Mominpura, and Malegaon MNC behaved as totally isolated zones over broad areas owing to very negligible in and out movements. As a result of community isolations and practical difficulties in maintaining social distancing practices due to dense population, a saturation of viral infections may have been reached, leading to a significant reduction of total active cases in a shorter period.

The main reason behind this may be the slow recovery as compared to the increase in new positive cases, as shown in Fig.12. Deceased cases were found to be fluctuating with large variance (due to wide scatter), causing a total of 351 deaths till July 31, 2020. Other factors might have dominant effect for Solapur which needs critical attention. This region may face secondary or tertiary peaks for the COVID-19 pandemic. The comparison of all the above-mentioned containment zones shows that the infection spread, recovery as well as deaths in the case of this novel coronavirus, largely depends upon how a group of people in terms of communities are allowed to behave in a pandemic. Malegaon, Sataranjipura, and Mominpura containment zones can be considered as socially isolated communities during the time duration when strict restrictions were imposed. As a result of only exceptional in and out movements in these zones, the infection spread can be seen decreasing with a significant rise in recovered cases reported per day. On the other hand, the remaining containment zones under consideration in MMR show different results. It is crucial to consider the importance of physical boundary separation of a particular area or zone in the context of containment, as earlier three zones possess excellent isolation characteristics.

Too many fluctuations in the policies have resulted in more havoc. Furthermore, this hampered the mental health of the common public severely.

There is a continuous movement of passengers and goods on a daily basis in the context of essential services over the wider metropolitan area of 6355 km 2 .

For Solapur MNC, which is having a population density of 5345 / sq.km, 351 deceased cases are very much higher. This is due to the possibility of a lack of extreme critical situation medical care units available in semi-urban parts like Solapur MNC. Also, Solapur MNC has a population scenario in which the majority of people in the different communities prefer to avoid consumption of non-veg food, traditional Indian spices that contain onion, garlic etc.Containment zones like Mumbai ME and Mumbai GN, KDMC, and Jalgaon MNC, along with Kamothe in the Panvel MNC area, have a mixed population which highly prefer a variety of traditional Indian spices along with meat and seafood in the diet. But in these zones, the factors that drive the deaths are the high population density and, eventually, no practical social distancing in everyday routine. Also, due to the work nature, mutation and recombination of virus strains are very rapid, as discussed earlier in the MMR. This may cause severity in some COVID-19 positive cases having comorbidities leading to fatality. It is also important to note that some individuals with different community beliefs prefer not to take the diet that the majority of people follow in these areas. Such people could become high-risk individuals for getting infected and turning into severe COVID-19 cases. This is mostly due to their body's inability to interrupt essential virus functions in the course of virus mutations or recombination. It may also result in failure in the development of antibodies due to very much different food content than the other majority of people.These interrelated issues discussed above are believed to be tackled through some encouraging results seen in the containment zones of Sataranjipura and Mominpura of Nagpur MNC as well as Malegaon MNC. The deceased cases in Sataranjipura and Mominpura are 8 and 5 respectively as of July end, with the recovery rates of 85.77 % and 95.65 %. In the case of Malegaon MNC, though the deceased cases are relatively higher, the nature of the curve of the same is gradually decreasing. The reason behind the higher deaths in Malegaon MNC may be the increase in stress levels due to financial issues, occupational practices, ignoring early symptoms, hesitation to medication, hurdles in intense COVID-19 testing due to densely populated areas etc.",

The main reason behind this scenario can be a higher population density of Bhusaval (18436 /sq.km) than Jalgaon MNC (6788 /sq.km). Lack of social distancing practices, higher illiteracy compared to Jalgaon city, dominant population, delayed reporting of symptoms are some of the reasons behind the higher fatalities in Bhusaval. This zone might have uncontrolled mutations along with moderate medications, which caused higher deaths. KDMC in the Mumbai metropolitan region is the worst affected containment zone taken under consideration in this work. The total number of COVID-19 positive cases till July 31, 2020, was around 20000, with 357 deceased cases. KDMC has a mixed population scenario in which people in different communities have different occupational practices, diet patterns, housing natures etc. This resulted in higher uncontrolled mutations and recombination of viral strains.Evidence of which may be considered as delay in flattening of curves for daily positive cases reported and active cases.
