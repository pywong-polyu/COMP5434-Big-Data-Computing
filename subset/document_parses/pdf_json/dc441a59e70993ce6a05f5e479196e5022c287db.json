Tanner et al. ( 2008 ) have applied C4.5 decision tree algorithm on acute febrile illness affected individuals using simple clinical and hematological parameters. Further, this study also requires laboratory features such as platelet count, crossover threshold value of a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for dengue viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the presence of preexisting anti-dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. It is known that administration of these laboratory tests require 2-12 days (Sa-Ngasang et al. 2006 ; Vaughn et al. 1997 ) and in some cases the condition of the patient may not allow such a long wait. However, the research in Tanner et al. ( 2008 ) provides more insight into the scienti fi c understanding of the disease prevalence among the infected individuals. From the effective clinical management point of view, it is desirable to have a methodology that helps one to identify the suspected dengue individuals from simple clinical features. This helps to reduce the spread of the disease in the community.

Replication of all positive-stranded RNA viruses occurs in close association with virus-induced intracellular membrane structures. DENV also induces such extensive rearrangements of intracellular membranes, called replication complex (RC). These RCs seem to contain viral proteins, viral RNA, and host cell factors. The subsequently formed immature virions are assembled by budding of newly formed nucleocapsids into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby acquiring a lipid bilayer envelope with the structural proteins prM and E . The virions mature during transport through the acidic trans-golgi network, where the prM proteins stabilize the E proteins to prevent conformational changes. Before release of the virions from the host cell, the maturation process is completed when prM is cleaved into a soluble pr peptides and virion-associated M by the cellular protease furin.
