The aim was to repurpose a single 10 x 10 dressing for frontline HCPs during each shift to provide facial protection and limit cost for the institution. Earlier testing revealed that the dressing edge could catch on to the N95 mask sponge and create an interlocking mechanism to position two offloading areas next to each other rather than on top of each other. This enhances the distribution of pressure over a larger area and prevents additional pressure on any given area by stacking multiple layers. The rationale was that if pressure was equally distributed over the nose with the interlocking fit of the N95 mask sponge on the dressing edge, the cheekbones were only in need of friction control (maintaining mask integrity without adding bulk). Further, this placement was successful even with some small facial hair stubble present on the cheeks and chins of male staff members; the dressing sat snugly despite being applied over chin hair, and removal was painless.",

The KHUH Infection Control Team conducted the leak tests in late January and early February using the Hood method. 14, 15 The method involves placing a see-through polymer hood with an applicator window in front of the face and a tight-fitting seal around the HCP's neck. To determine a participant's individual sensitivity, a distinct smell (denatonium benzoate) is serially sprayed into the hood to determine at what point (after how many sprays) a smell is observed. Next, the hood is removed, and the participant is instructed to rinse his/her mouth and wait 15 minutes. Then a N95 mask is donned and the procedure repeated. The mask fit is deemed effective when no smell is observed if half of the sprays required during the sensitivity test are applied. The infection control team documents each time a person passes the fit test (smell only observed after more than the threshold number of sprays). A person who fails the fit test is fitted with a different sized mask and the spray test is repeated until passing; however, it only needs to be completed once per person. 14 Leak testing is the responsibility of each staff member and involves positioning the N95 mask on the head and fitting it around the nose by applying two fingers on either side of the nose and pressing the mask tight while breathing in. Next, hands are placed over the middle of the mask (without adjusting its position) and the staff member exhales sharply. If air escapes from the sides of the mask, the mask should be adjusted and all of the steps repeated until exhaled air exits only through the middle of the mask and no leaks occur on inhalation or exhalation. This process is repeated twice every single time an N95 mask is applied. 16 Where limited reuse of N95 masks is practiced, it is done in accordance with the KHUH infection control protocols governing mask functionality/ cross-contamination prevention and not to exceed five uses per person. 17 Eight volunteer staff members (four males and four females) with various Fitzpatrick skin types were included in this phase. Two work in the ED, two in ICU, one in a male surgical ward, and three in the wound care unit. All participants had previously passed the official N95 fit test. All staff previously wore N95 masks without skin protection. Participants applied the repurposed, separated atraumatic dressing segments on their own faces after an initial demonstration. The application took less than 5 minutes, inclusive of the time required to cut up the dressing. They then donned N95 masks and conducted manual leak tests. 16 All eight participants achieved the same mask positioning with the applied dressing beneath their mask as without.",

Three possible mechanisms of injury were identified in this experiment. The first was associated with direct high pressure causing skin indentations (ie, from mask edges, nose fitting device, and straps); the second a diffuse erythema in a linear pattern associated with lower pressure with or without friction (ie, mask edges moving). Both were more pronounced when no facial protection was present. The third was related to sweating: slight localized sweating underneath the mask was more pronounced when skin protection was used, attributable to the better integrity of the acquired seal. Associated moisture build-up from sweat is therefore a risk with this PPE configuration; accordingly, the use of a skin-protective acrylate 10 followed by meticulous facial care 9 is recommended for off-duty HCPs. All participants cut up the dressing into segments with ease and could easily apply the dressing to their faces with the use of a mirror. After donning this protective layer, the integrity of the N95 mask was also easily established, with all staff passing both the leak and the fit tests.",

Essentially, staff can greatly increase the risk for COVID-19 self-contamination if they touch their faces before all contaminated PPE is safely removed. 1 This stringent PPE process requires heightened staff awareness of this vital safety precaution, reinforcing the HELP enabler's focus on adequate nutrition and hydration in off duty times and recommendations to limit excessive amounts of fluids immediately before a shift.

This participant had a 1% increase in SpO 2 and the most pronounced skin damage present after the test.",

More research using different border dressings would be beneficial to expand the evidence base on this topic and give providers more options. The staff at KHUH is also mainly of West and East Asian descent, hence the lack of a nurse with a Fitzpatrick skin type 1. This is a major limitation because this skin type is usually the most sensitive to injury and skin insults. Further, although the Fitzpatrick scale is the criterion standard for sun-related skin damage, it may not fully predict pressure and shear damage on skin because deeper injuries may not be immediately visible. Further testing in institutions that have HCPs with Fitzpatrick type 1 skin is warranted.",

By cutting it into segments and carefully applying it without creases over the nose, cheekbones, and sides of the face, HCPs can achieve pressure redistribution and facial skin protection. This method does not appear to interfere with N95 mask integrity and in fact may provide additional leak protection by securing the mask more firmly in position, ultimately protecting against accidental viral transfer to the face. 1 Accordingly, these authors recommend that HCPs add an atraumatic silicone border dressing as a safe and beneficial option to protect facial skin under PPE. However, no dressing by itself (regardless of testing) can provide complete care of facial skin underneath N95 masks. It is critical that HCPs implement a comprehensive skin care approach. Frontline staff who \"HELP\" themselves by taking responsibility for their own skin care, who are well prepared, well rested, fed, and hydrated can more safely take care of others.",
