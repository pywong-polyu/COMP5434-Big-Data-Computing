Cytopathic effects initially induced by viruses followed by a cytokine storm may carry substantial health risks (4) . Infected people always experience mild infections, manifested by fever and dry cough, and they usually do not require hospitalization. Some people develop severe illness, which eventually turns into ARDS (3). Vitamin C, otherwise known as ascorbic acid, is a an essential nutrient. It boosts immunity and acts as a potent antioxidant (5) , promote the synthesis of vasopressin and cortisol, enhance the neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) function, and improve the body's resistance to viruses (6, 7) . COVID-19 patients undergoing Vitamin C treatment showed a significant decrease in inflammatory markers, such as Ddimer and ferritin, suggesting that Vitamin C may be useful for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 disease (6) . However, two large-scaled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have indicated that Vitamin C could not prevent sepsis and ARDS (8, 9) . Besides, a meta-analysis showed that the use of vitamin C was not associated with the decreased risk of COVID-19 (10) . Notably, these studies included limited sample sizes with potential confounders.",

In the present study, BMI (21) and smoking (22) were identified as confounding factors when COVID-19 was identified as the outcome (http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/). SNP harmonization was conducted to correct the orientation of the alleles. In order to determine whether instrumental variables were weak, the F statistics were used.

The sample size, selection and elimination of SNPs, choice of MR method of our study are all different compared with it, but the final conclusions are similar. This also further confirms that there is no significant causal relationship between vitamin C and COVID19. In terms of the MR study about Vitamin C and COVID-19, our research is the largest MR study to date. Our findings found no evidence that the genetic markers of plasma vitamin C are related to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, and these results are inconsistent with those reported in observational studies. Considering that the confounding effects of factors can be difficult to control even with advanced statistical adjustments, such as socioeconomic, institutionalization, dietary, medical comorbidities, and lifestyle behavioral factors, associations between Vitamin C and COVID-19 may not be clear (31) . The pro-inflammatory state caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the main pathophysiological process of the COVID-19, which is characterized by increased levels of serum interleukin-1,6 (IL-1,6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), resulting in \"cytokine storm\" and ARDS (32, 33) . Various Vitamins, anti-oxidants, and immunomodulators have been investigated to curtail inflammatory chain reaction. In addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, Vitamin C contains free radial oxygen and nitrogencaging properties (34) . In a prospective study involving 19,357 people, after more than 20 years of follow-up, results show that people with baseline plasma Vitamin C levels in the top quartile had a 30% reduction in the risk of pneumonia (35) . In experimental animal models, by inhibiting neuronal nitric oxide synthase-derived NO, Vitamin C injection into septic mice prevented impaired vasoconstriction, this promoting the dissolution of capillary microthrombi (36) . These observational studies cannot eliminate the influence of confounding factors and reverse causality. In a randomized clinical trial that included 216 septic shock patients, treatment with intravenous Vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone did not significantly prolong the duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration over 7 days, compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone (9) . Based on a meta-analysis of Vitamin C and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity including six RCTs (n = 572 patients), Vitamin C did not reduce mortality, ICU stays, hospital stays, and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation with high Vitamin C therapy (10) . In a separate sub-group analysis, no observable benefit could be seen for severe vs. non-severe illness, or the route of administration (IV or oral) (10) . Accordingly, findings from the largest randomized trial conducted to date are in accordance with those of our MR.",

We utilized the largest cohort of COVID-19 cases available to date, and this study involved the largest research study on genetic determinants of Vitamin C levels, which could overcome the limitations of conventional epidemiological study designs, such as confounding and reverse causality. This study is more time-efficient and less expensive than RCT. This study has some limitations. First, our datasets included the European populations, which limited the applicability of results to non-European populations. However, similar results have been obtained in populations with different ethnicities in previous randomized controlled trials of vitamin C supplementation (37) . Moreover, MR's linear effect assumption could not be used to further investigate non-linear causality (38) . In addition, a canalization effect could not be ruled out by our study (i.e., dilution of the gene-exposure association). Thus, the estimate might be inflated. Finally, the directional pleiotropy cannot be excluded, which is almost completely mediated through other causal pathways.",
