            "text": "The paper presents a study based on integrated non-destructive sensing methods aimed at defining the experimental vibration properties of a historical dome by using environmental microtremor measurements only. The integrated approach consists in the use of both contact and remote sensors to acquire ambient vibration data. The measurements of vibration were carried out with a high-sensitive tri-axial seismometer (Tromino) and a coherent radar system (Image By Interferometry System, IBIS-S). Five asynchronous velocimetric stations were arranged over a profile on the external side of the structure to acquire ambient vibration time-series on radial, tangential and vertical directions. In order to detect the displacements of the internal surface of the dome, the radar interferometer was positioned inside the church using three station points of measure along the main axis of the structure, with different geometric configurations for each station. With this technique, synchronous signals coming from the structure were simultaneously acquired and analyzed. Both seismic time-series and microwave signals were processed to derive the experimental vibration properties of the structure, mainly concerning the dynamic behavior of the circular dome. In addition, to evaluate the capabilities of the radar system in the indoor configuration, a Finite Element model of the structure was built, and the experimental results were compared to the numerical outputs.",

Many authors have proposed researches based on the use of radar sensors to measure displacement time-series on different kinds of structures, such as modern skyscrapers [2] , concrete and earth dams [3, 4] , bridges [5, 6] , stay-cables of stay-cabled bridges [7] [8] [9] , bell towers and historical structures [6, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and other civil infrastructures [18] . Terrestrial remote sensing techniques have been widely applied in many geological and environmental studies for the monitoring of unstable slopes [19] , landslides [20, 21] , mines [22] , sinkholes [23] and underground cavities [24] . Main structural studies were focused on the use of terrestrial remote sensing to perform static [25] and dynamic tests [26] . In both cases, ground-based radar remote sensing provides results in good agreement with conventional techniques based on the use of contact arrays and standard devices to measure the displacements of targets [1] .",

The studied structure is the historical church of \"Beata Vergine Assunta\", in the small village of Guasila (southern Sardinia, Italy). The experimental frequency response of its ancient dome is derived from output-only measurements of ambient vibration. In order to identify most favorable operative conditions, the terrestrial coherent radar system was positioned inside the church with different geometric configurations. The tri-axial velocity sensor was installed on the outside surface of the structure in four station points, including a ground station. The comparison between microtremor traces and microwave signals allowed the identification of the main experimental vibration properties of the structure. Finally, a numerical simulation has been proposed to better interpret the experimental results obtained using both direct sensors and no-contact systems.",

In Fig. 1 different images of the church of Guasila are shown. Since the construction time, several problems of stability have been described (e.g. in the technical reports of architect Cima) [28] . The problems were even attributed to the low technical qualities of the materials used to build the structure, mainly consisting of local stone, marl and sandstone, characterized by weak degree of compaction and lithification [28] . Recently, the structure has been studied in the framework of a restoration and diagnostic project based on multidisciplinary approaches [28] [29] [30] . In these studies, minero-petrographic analyses, geometricarchitectural surveys, structural surveys, geotechnical and geophysical investigations were carried to implement the knowledge concerning the structural health state of the church.",

The frequency peak at 4.0 Hz shows the maximum amplification along the radial component of displacement, but it is also present, although with lower amplitude, in both Tangential and Vertical components of the motion. Conversely, the frequency peak at 4.6 Hz mainly characterizes the horizontal Tangential spectral ratio and it does not show any substantial amplification along the vertical component (Fig. 7a) . The frequency peak at 10.8 Hz is affected by significant amplitude in all components of the motion with maximum amplitude measured along both vertical and tangential spectral ratios. The spectra, filtered by means of the signal recorded at [TR02] station, highlight amplitude peaks at frequencies higher than 7 Hz.

The position of the radar and the tilt of the antenna were modified in order to identify the most favorable geometries of acquisition.

The radar power profile that corresponds to this set of measurements is characterized by significant amplitudes of backscattered electromagnetic signals in correspondence to the range bins 29 (21.75 m, average distance from the radar system), 32 ( show high amplitude SNR peaks. However, these signals do not correspond to any clearly identified structural element of the church and were discarded for the analysis. Further measurements were performed installing the sensor in correspondence to the stations [ST02] and [ST03]. The results obtained for these sets of measurements are not discussed here, but were considered to derive more information about the experimental vibration properties of the structure. The radar power profiles show different range bins characterized by intense amplitude of the backscattered signals. These signals are probably due to the presence of many lateral backscatterers, corresponding to the architectonical elements that are present on the internal walls of the structure. In addition, the curvature of the surface of the dome does not represent a single backscatterer but can be considered like as a continuous distribution of reflective points, positioned at increasing distances from the radar sensor. This feature is confirmed by the comparison among the amplitude spectra, derived from different range bins that correspond to reflective points on the structure. The radar bins with SNR higher than 40 were selected for the displacement and the frequency analyses. Figure 9 shows the Power Spectral Densities functions derived from the signals corresponding to the range bins 32, 33 and 35, selected from the radar scenario of [ST01] station, configuration B. Two clear harmonic components are shown in all selected spectra. The first frequency peak recognized by the interferometric survey is centered at 7.68 Hz. This frequency peak is very close to the vibration frequency of 7.4 Hz, detected by means of the SSRs of microtremor, calculated for the vertical component of the structure motion (with different reference stations). This frequency component is characterized by high amplification in correspondence to the measurement taken on the dome of the church ([TR05], lantern). This frequency can be interpreted as a natural frequency associated to a structural vibration mode that mainly involves the dome of the church. In fact, this experimental vibration mode is characterized by prevalent deformations along the vertical component of the signals. The second frequency peak, shown by the graph in Fig. 9 , is localized at 15.34 Hz. However, this frequency component was not detected by means of the microtremor measurements. All Power Spectral Density (PSD) functions, derived from the dynamic microwave surveys, do not show any frequency peaks related to the first and to the second vibration modes of the structure (4.0 Hz and 4.5 Hz). This phenomenon could be due to the low amplitude deformation associated with these vibration modes in the LOS direction of the radar.",

The complementary approach was utilized to perform the dynamic characterization of the dome of the church of \"Beata Vergine Assunta\" in Guasila. Spectral analyses of microtremor were used to derive the main vibration properties of the structure starting from five asynchronous stations of environmental noise. Microtremor spectra showed high amplification effects at frequencies of 4.0 Hz, 4.6 Hz and 7.4 Hz for the radial, tangential and vertical components of the motion. Ground-based radar interferometry surveys were performed inside the structure. Interferometric results show that the experimental datasets contain the contribution of a natural mode of vibration, that mainly characterizes the upper part of the structure (circular dome) at the frequency of 7.68 Hz. Preliminary numerical outputs derived from the Finite Element analysis show a good agreement with the experimental results of the surveys. Future studies will be performed to improve the analysis of the interferometric data and to implement a more detailed Finite Element simulation. ",
