            "text": "Background: Studies have suggested that economic distress is associated with behavioral health outcomes, while availability of cash reserves for emergencies is associated with a reduction in economic distress. The objective of this study was to assess the extent that the availability of emergency cash reserves modified the association between experience of economic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and behavioral health outcomes in the general adult population of Thailand. Methods: We conducted a nationally-representative phone-based survey in late April 2021. Survey questions included questions on experience of economic distress, and a question on what participants would do to cover a 5,000 Thai Bahts (THB) emergency expense within one week, anxiety and depression screening questions, and questions regarding sleep, exercise, gambling, smoking, and drinking behaviors. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses with adjustment for complex survey designs, and stratified analyses with assessment of heterogeneity of odds ratios between strata and assessment of additive and multiplicative interactions. Results: A total of 1,555 individuals from 15 provinces participated in the survey (participation rate = 68.3%). Approximately 19.6% \u00b1 1.0% of the participants reported that they would cover the 5,000 THB emergency expense only with cash or cash equivalent without resorting to other means. Experience of economic distress was associated with anxiety disorder after adjusting for covariables (Adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.47; 95% CI [1. 45-4.19]). There was no evidence that availability of emergency cash reserves significantly modified the stated association, nor the association between experience of economic distress and other outcomes. However, with regard to anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and history of gambling in past 30 days, the p-for-trend values (p-for-trend < 0.001) suggested that those with emergency cash reserves had lower prevalence of these outcomes than those without emergency cash reserves. Conclusions: The study findings did not support our hypothesis that availability of emergency cash reserves modified the association between experience of economic distress and behavioral health outcomes. Nonetheless, the study findings can serve as potentially useful basic information for relevant stakeholders. Future studies should consider qualitative data collection and longitudinal study design in order to explore these associations at greater depths.",

Based on the family stress model proposed by Pauline Boss (Boss, 2002) , a given event or situation (including economic distress) can induce stress at varying degrees, depending on moderation by available resources and perception of the event or situation. A study based on the family stress model showed that economic pressure was associated with money-related stress (Prawitz, Kalkowski & Cohart, 2013) , and the association was moderated by financial adjustments (i.e., use of available resources) and perception of the event as being within the internal locus within one's ability to control, as opposed to an external locus outside of one's control (i.e., perception).",

Availability of emergency cash reserves may also enable individuals experiencing economic distress to perceive an unexpected expense as an issue within their internal locus of control (Prawitz & Cohart, 2016; Dwiastanti, 2017) , which would lessen the level of stress and behavioral health issues that the distress can induce.

The authors could not find such similar estimates or survey instruments prior to the current study. Given the exchange rate at the time of study (approximately 31 THB per 1 USD), we converted the amount to 12,400 THB. The amount was then adjusted for purchasing power using the ratio between Thailand's GDP (PPP) per capita (World Bank, 2021b) of $19,277 and Thailand's GDP (nominal) per capita (World Bank, 2021a) of $7,087, from which we obtained the ratio of 2.47. We calculated the emergency amount adjusted for purchasing power parity in the Thai context to be 12,400 THB/2.47 = 5,020 THB, rounded to 5,000 THB for ease of survey administration.

We calculated the sampling weight of each participant based on the ratio between the population in each region and the number of samples from the region. We specified region as the stratification variable and specified the unique ID variable when we calculated weighted analyses in order to account for complex survey design. We performed logistic multivariate regression analyses with adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in a similar manner as in previous studies (Siahpush & Carlin, 2006; Hertz-Palmor et al., 2020) . We also assessed additive and multiplicative effect modification in each association using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and multiplicative interaction terms, as well as p-for-trend, pseudo-R-squared, and the likelihood ratio (-2LL) values for Adjusted OR. We considered additive interaction to be present at 95% level of confidence if the 95% confidence interval of the RERI did not include the null value of 0. We considered multiplicative interaction to be present at 95% level of confidence if the 95% confidence interval for the multiplication interaction term did not include the null value of 1. If the p-for-trend was less than 0.05, we considered that there was a linear trend by the presented categories. The pseudo-R-squared and the likelihood ratio (-2LL) values were included as a measure of goodness-of-fit in order to compare an adjusted OR model for a given outcome to the others. Pseudo R-squared values can be interpreted as indicators of how well each model fit and was able to explain variations in the outcome. Generally, the higher the pseudo R-squared value is, the better the model will be. However, the pseudo R-squared may also be artificially inflated if independent variables are highly correlated with one another (i.e., there is collinearity). Likelihood ratio (-2LL) value refers to the extent that the variables in the model help explain the distribution of the outcome better than the outcome itself. For negative likelihood ratios, the further the ratio is less than -1, the better the model tends to be at explaining the outcome. All analyses were made with R version 4.0.3. Furthermore, as our definition of having available emergency cash reserves differed from the criteria used in the original study by the U.S. Federal Reserves, we decided to perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the extent that such differences influenced the study findings. In this sensitivity analysis, we considered those who answered that they would cover the 5,000 THB emergency expense \"With the money in [their] savings account, cash, or other liquid assets (e.g., converting mutual funds to cash)\" or \"Put it on [their] credit card and pay it off in full at the next statement\" without also answering other options as those with available emergency cash reserves.

Furthermore, considering the call for collaborative works between behavioral health and complementary fields (Ford et al., 2019) , the findings of this study may have implications for stakeholders in behavioral health and economics. We estimated that less than 20% of the Thai population would be able to cover a 5,000 THB ($160 US) emergency expense with cash or other liquid assets without needing to resort to loans, borrowing, or selling personal items. This was lower than in the United States, where 40% of the population had emergency cash reserves of similar purchasing power (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2019). Unlike the US Federal Reserves' study, our definition of having the required amount of emergency cash reserves did not include the use of credit card with repayment at the end of the month, as the use of Notes: * Adjusted OR (95% CI) included adjustments for sex, age, marital status, education level, and personal monthly income. ** Weighted likelihood ratio (-2LL) could not be displayed because \"models could not be fitted to the same size of dataset\"; unweighted -2LL displayed instead. *** Statistical program would not perform the test; \"Likelihood gets worse with more variables.\" Bold numbers denote statistical significance at 95% level of confidence.

Although our sensitivity analyses showed virtually no difference in the study findings, future studies should consider revising the definition of having emergency cash reserves available if there are changes in the context of credit card use in Thailand. We did not find evidence of moderation (i.e., effect modification) in the association between experience of economic distress and behavioral health outcomes by availability of emergency cash reserves to support our hypothesis based on the family stress model (Boss, 2002) . However, comparison of the overall adjusted OR to the stratified adjusted OR for anxiety disorder and depressive symptoms showed that the overall adjusted OR was between the two strata, which was what we would expect from effect modifiers. Thus the absence of statistical evidence for the moderation should not be considered as evidence that the family stress model was not relevant for the study population.",

Thus it was possible that participants who had depression became less likely to work, did not earn adequate income, and effectively did not have emergency savings. However, if experiences of economic distress were indeed stressors for anxiety and depression, then the prevalent anxiety disorder and depressive symptoms also could have been presentations of adjustment disorder with anxiety or depressed mood (Zelviene & Kazlauskas, 2018) . Future studies should consider adapting a longitudinal study design in order to reduce potential reverse causation, and also consider inclusion of measurement of adjustment disorder and a global measure of stress.",

Considering that other forms of gambling are illegal in the kingdom, the study findings should be interpreted in this context rather than the context of problem gambling, which is more commonly reported in the literatures (Johansson et al., 2009) . The p-for-trend value also indicated that participants with emergency cash reserves had significantly lower history of gambling than participants without emergency cash reserves. This difference in prevalence of past-month gambling might have reflected the differences in the psychology of personal finance between individuals (Housel, 2020) , and this issue should be explored at greater depths. Furthermore, it was not possible for us to determine whether the gambling behavior occurred after experiencing economic distress as a negative coping mechanism, or gambling itself was a factor that contributed to economic distress. Future studies should consider adopting the longitudinal study design, separating lottery purchase from other forms of gambling, and assessing the prevalence of pathological gambling.",

Firstly, the lack of financial liquidity might have been perceived by some participants as being embarrassing to report, and social desirability could have influenced our study findings. Secondly, the relatively high refusal to participate could have introduced selection bias to our study findings. However, the demographics of the study participants resembled the demographics of the Thai population aged 18 years and over (51.8% female, mean age 45.8 years) (Thailand National Statistical Office, 2020), suggesting that non-participation might have happened at random and was unlikely to introduce selection bias.",

Although there were no statistically significant additive or multiplicative effect modifications, study participants with emergency cash reserves had a consistently lower prevalence of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and history of gambling than participants without emergency cash reserves. The findings provide potentially useful basic information for stakeholders in behavioral health and economics. Further studies should consider qualitative data collection and longitudinal study design in order to explore these associations at greater depths.
