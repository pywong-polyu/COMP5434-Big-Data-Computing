This study aimed to illustrate the clinicoradiological features, microbiological spectrum, and clinical course of patients with SPE, as well as to promote the early identification, diagnosis, and prognosis of this unusual disease. Methods: Nineteen patients with SPE collected from the electronic medical records of our hospital were retrospectively reviewed during three years. Results: The study included twelve men and seven women with a mean age of 49 (15-78). The most common presenting features were fever (79%) and shortness of breath (73.7%). Chronic kidney disease (68.4%) and diabetes (36.8%) were the most common comorbidities. The most common source of infection was venous catheters (58%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most predominant pathogen in about 52.6% of the cases. According to the CT findings, bilateral opacities were detected in all cases, flowing by nodular in 73.9% and cavitations in 57.9%. Central distributions were the most patterns regarding the location of the lesion seen in 47.4% of the patients. All patients received antimicrobial treatment, while 13 cases administered systemic anticoagulant. Most of the patients (73.7%) recovered from their illness, while 26.3% died. The median duration of hospitalization was 11.5 days. Oxygen saturation level and altered mental status were significantly associated with the mortality rate of SPE patients. Conclusion: The study's findings presented that altered mental status and low oxygen saturation are associated with a high mortality rate in SPE patients, especially those requiring critical care. Early diagnosis of an embolic phenomenon to other organ systems like the central nervous system can greatly influence the patient's outcome.",

Bilateral parenchymal opacities (100%), nodules (73.9%), and cavitations (57.9%) were the most common radiological manifestations in our study. In contrast to our research, pulmonary nodules were the most common chest CT feature reported by the previous studies. 3, 5 According to the research by Goswami and Liu et al, All patients had peripheral nodular lesions on chest CT scan, and therefore probably caused by septic occlusion of the small peripheral pulmonary arterial branches. 1, 2 In the studies of KWON, the detailed CT characteristics of peripheral nodules in pulmonary septic emboli may be able to differentiate the causative microorganisms and to provide additional information regarding treatment plans in patients with SPE. 17, 18 In the absence of adequacy of echocardiographic findings or other signs of infective endocarditis were needed for further evaluation to identify the infectious source as reported by VOS et al. 19 In this study, echocardiography was performed for 15 patients. We detected significant abnormalities for only one patient found to have tricuspid valve vegetations with mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiography is known to provide greater spatial resolution compared to the transthoracic approach, and it is a superior method for detecting small vegetation. 20 The mortality rate for SPE in the current study was 26.3% (5 patients), while the recovery rate was 73.7%. 14 The probable reasons for mortality include refractory shock with resultant renal failure or grave pulmonary complications, including hemorrhage and hemoptysis. In 2013, Goswami et al described 40 patients with SPE; eight (20%) patients did 12 Early diagnosis of an embolic phenomenon to other organ systems like the central nervous system can significantly influence a patient's outcome, as NISHIMURA and his associates reported. 21 \u00d6z A et al demonstrated that elevated levels of plasma osmolality may have a predictive value for in-hospital mortality in acute pulmonary embolism patients. 22 In the current study, the prognostic factors associated with the outcome of SPE patients included low-level oxygen saturation and altered mental status and significantly associated with a high mortality rate of SPE patients. This study suggests that microbiological and radiological findings, comorbidities, and laboratory characteristics do not affect prevalence and impact on mortality in patients with SPE. Hypotension, fungal infection, infections caused by MDRPs, severe coagulation abnormalities, and septic shock accompanied by multiple organ failure were all identified as risk factors for SPE mortality by Jiang and Ye et al, which are incompatible with the current study findings. 11, 23 Limitations The retrospective aspect of this research and the selection bias involved in a single-centre study are the main limitations of our research.",
