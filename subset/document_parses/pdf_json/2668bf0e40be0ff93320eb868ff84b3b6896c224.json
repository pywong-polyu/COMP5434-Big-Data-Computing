In addition to functional gains, exercise is considered to be a cornerstone for enhancing cognitive function in frail older adults with cognitive impairment and dementia. We assessed the effects of the Vivifrail exercise intervention for functional capacity, cognition, and well-being status in community-dwelling older adults. Methods In a multicentre randomized controlled trial conducted in three tertiary hospitals in Spain, a total of 188 older patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia (aged >75 years) were randomly assigned to an exercise intervention (n = 88) or a usual-care, control (n = 100) group. The intervention was based on the Vivifrail tailored multicomponent exercise programme, which included resistance, balance, flexibility (3 days/week), and gait-retraining exercises (5 days/week) and was performed for three consecutive months (http://vivifrail.com). The usual-care group received habitual outpatient care. The main endpoint was change in functional capacity from baseline to 1 and 3 months, assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary endpoints were changes in cognitive function and handgrip strength after 1 and 3 months, and well-being status, falls, hospital admission rate, visits to the emergency department, and mortality after 3 months. Results The Vivifrail exercise programme provided significant benefits in functional capacity over usual-care. The mean adherence to the exercise sessions was 79% in the first month and 68% in the following 2 months. The intervention group showed a mean increase (over the control group) of 0.86 points on the SPPB scale (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32, 1.41 points; P < 0.01) after 1 month of intervention and 1.40 points (95% CI 0.82, 1.98 points; P < 0.001) after 3 months. Participants in the usual-care group showed no significant benefit in functional capacity (mean change of \u00c00.17 points [95% CI \u00c00.54, 0.19 points] after 1 month and \u00c00.33 points [95% CI \u00c00.70, 0.04 points] after 3 months), whereas the exercise intervention reversed this trend (0.69 points [95% CI 0.29, 1.09 points] after 1 month and 1.07 points [95% CI 0.63, 1.51 points] after 3 months). Exercise group also obtained significant benefits in cognitive function, muscle function, and depression after 3 months over control group (P < 0.05). No between-group differences were obtained in other secondary endpoints (P > 0.05).",

            "text": "Physical inactivity seems to play a key role in the loss of muscle function and functional capacity, which in turn appears to be a crucial factor related to frailty. 5 Against this background, the potential benefits of different exercise interventions in frail individuals have been widely demonstrated in the literature, showing marked improvements in frailty hallmarks--for instance, gait ability, muscle strength, balance, and falls. 6, 7 It is recognized that physical exercise improves metabolic health by suppressing muscle atrophy, blunting inflammatory responses, and protecting against loss of bone density, and it may also contribute to preserve insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial activity, and physical function. 8 There is strong evidence to support that the inclusion of tailored exercise programmes is probably the best method to improve the hallmarks of frailty, including functional capacity, muscle function, and health status. 9, 10 In particular, multicomponent exercise programmes consisting of resistance (power), balance, and gait-retraining exercises are the most effective interventions for preventing most, if not all, of the complications of frailty syndrome (i.e. poor balance, reduced muscle strength, poor gait ability, and increased incidence of falls), and their prescription is recommendable for frail older adults, as well as for persons with prefrailty. 6, 10, 11 Additionally, physical exercise and specifically multicomponent exercise training may be a cornerstone for improving physical and cognitive function in frail individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. 12 In line with this concept, we recently developed an innovative multicomponent exercise training programme termed Vivifrail (http:// vivifrail.com/resources/), which is based on promoting exercise in older population through individualized programmes designed to prescribe tailored physical exercise. 13 In a recent study, 11 the Vivifrail multicomponent tailored exercise programme was very effective in the short-term (4 weeks) and prevented severe functional decline and strength loss in institutionalized older (i.e. physical frailty reversion and recovery of autonomy). Multicomponent exercise face-to-face interventions would seem advisable as an essential activity to protect older adults from severe functional decline. 14 The community-based approach is the best way forward, and physical exercise is one of the main interventions with systemic effect proven to improve physical impairment related to frailty (low body mass, strength, mobility, physical activity level, and energy). 15 The present multicentre study aimed to examine the effects of the Vivifrail multicomponent exercise intervention performed by frail/prefrail community-dwelling older adults with cognitive impairment and mild dementia for functional, cognition, and well-being status.",

The study protocol has been published. 17 The multicentre RCT was conducted from 1 September 2017 to 31 May 2020, in the outpatient geriatrics clinics of three tertiary hospitals in Spain (Geriatric Depart-ment of Hospital Universitario de Navarra, the Matia Fundazioa in San Sebastian and the Hospital of Getafe). Regarding the sample size calculations, assuming an alpha error of 5%, a correlation between pre-intervention and post-intervention values of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) of \u03c1 = 0.5 and a standard deviation for the SPPB of \u03c3 = 2.5, the required sample size to have a power of 90% to detect a minimum difference of 1 point between groups in the post-pre SPPB score was 101 patients per group. Taking into account an expected loss of patients along the follow-up of 15%, the final sample size required was 120 per group for this multicentre study. 17 The study followed the principles of Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra Clinical Research Ethics Committee.

Initial load was set at 0.5 kg (dumbbells) and gradually increased in 0.5 kg increments for upper-body exercise; lower-body leg extensions started with free weight repetitions and gradually increased in 0.5-kg increments using ankle weights to gradually increase the intensity of lower-body leg exercises based on the functional reserve of the older patients. The exercise intervention comprised a 5day-a-week routine of multicomponent exercises (i.e. resistance, balance, and flexibility exercises 3 days per week and walking 5 days per week) during 12 consecutive weeks (for more details, see http://vivifrail.com/resources/).

            "text": "The protective effect of physical exercise in community dwelling older adults has been well confirmed in the literature, supporting exercise as a cornerstone for preserving functional status and muscle function in this population. 10, 15, 28 Contrastingly, physical inactivity is recognized to promote frailty, and physical exercise is known to maintain or improve the function of many of the physiological systems that can be altered in frailty, including muscle and heart function, endocrine function (e.g. glucose metabolism), and inflammation, and delay the onset of multiple chronic diseases. 29 Previous trials have highlighted the potential benefits of a multicomponent exercise programme (resistance, endurance, flexibility, and balance exercises) on the functional capacity in older populations and for reducing the likelihood of developing disability after long-time exercise interventions (i.e. 6 months or over). 6, 30, 31 One of the main findings of our study is that 1 month of the intervention was sufficient for improving functional capacity in the oldest old. In addition to functional and muscle function (i.e. handgrip strength) gains, our results show that the Vivifrail exercise programme has a beneficial effect on cognition in older frail/prefrail patients with MCI and mild dementia, assessed by MOCA and MEC-Lobo, respectively. The role of physical exercise on cognitive function has been widely investigated in older adults, 32, 33 and specifically, multicomponent exercise training seems to provide the best results on cognition in older patients with MCI and dementia. 6, 12 Strikingly, cognitive function enhancements might mediate physical function improvements in acutely hospitalized frail elders. 34 Thus, physical activity shows promise as modifiable risk factor to reduce the risk of dementia and related neurodegenerative Data are mean (SD) unless otherwise stated. Significant differences were found between groups for SPPB score and CIRS score (P < 0.05). diseases. 35 Mechanistically, the neural and vascular adaptations induced by exercise in older adults are hypothesized to promote cognitive enhancements through stimulation of neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and synaptic plasticity and by reducing pro-inflammatory processes and cellular damage brought about by oxidative stress. 36 Moreover, the combination of different training modalities, with special emphasis on resistance training, appears to be the best strategy for pre-serving or improving cognitive function, but further research is warranted to better understand the underlying physiological mechanisms induced by exercise in community dwelling frail older adults with MCI and dementia. Considering the mood status, patients in the exercise group also had better outcomes regarding depression than peers in the control group. The exercise programme was, however, unable to influence the occurrence of falls during the intervention period. Data are expressed as mean (95% CI). All data were derived from linear mixed-effects model. For each group, data are expressed as change from baseline to 1 month and 3 months post-intervention, determined by the time coefficients (95% CI) of the model. Between-group differences were determined with time x group interaction. All the endpoints were adjusted by age, sex, endpoint baseline value, and SPPB baseline value. Although there is consistent evidence for exercise as an effective therapy for falls prevention in community dwelling older adults, 37 our findings reveal no difference in incidence between groups. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the short duration of the intervention period (i.e. 3 months). The present study is in line with the previously published World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Consortium of Healthy Aging, which stresses the importance of maintaining intrinsic capacity domains (i.e. locomotion, vitality, cognition, psychological, and sensory) and specifically functional status to preserve autonomy and independence in everyday activities that enables wellbeing. 38 Our results suggest that the Vivifrail multicomponent exercise programme may help to mitigate the trajectory of frailty and disability in community dwelling older adults with MCI and/or mild dementia and seems to also provide benefits in mood, cognitive, and muscle function, which are key components of intrinsic capacity. Our data support the notion that, in accordance with the WHO framework, tailored physical exercise should be prescribed to older adults and should be considered a frontline treatment for preventing functional decline, cognitive impairment, and muscle function deterioration that commonly occurs during the aging process. 14, 39 Our study has several strengths including its multicentre randomized design. Also, we focused on a particularly vulnerable segment of the older adult population, which included patients with multiple co-morbidities and geriatric syndromes as MCI/mild dementia (who are frequently excluded from exercise studies). Our findings suggest that a home-based, individualized multicomponent exercise programme (Vivifrail; www.vivifrail.com) has beneficial effects on many health-related outcomes, overcoming barriers often encountered with traditional exercise interventions such as material resources and transport limitations. Finally, to minimize the potential bias, the assessment researchers were unaware of the study design and group allocation.",

Although a rigorous randomization procedure was carried out, significant between-group differences were obtained at baseline for functional capacity (SPPB scale) and co-morbidities (CIRS score). Also, there was missing data at 1 and 3 months post-intervention due to the characteristics of the study population (octogenarians and nonagenarians with multiple geriatric syndromes) and the coronavirus lockdown during March-June 2020. Additionally, more patients discontinued the study in the intervention group compared with the control group, which could have influenced in the results obtained. The specific features of the study population (i.e. frail or prefrail older patients according to the Fried criteria 18 with MCI or mild dementia) limit the generalizability of our results. Thus, care should be taken when extrapolating our findings to other cohorts. Lastly, the adherence to the exercise training programme progressively dropped during the intervention period (79% of the total sessions were completed after 1 month of intervention and 68% at 3 months). Our exercise adherence rate was, however, higher than in other studies that developed similar home-based exercise interventions. 40 Our findings highlight several future directions for research. The effectiveness and safety of the Vivifrail exercise programme may be examined in future RCTs with longer intervention periods (> 3 months). In addition to physical exercise, further research is needed to establish consistent evidence about the effect of multidomain interventions including cognitive training on functional capacity and cognition in community dwelling older adults with cognitive impairment.",

Also assessed were changes in mood status (15-item Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale Spanish version [GDS]; scale of 0 [best] to 15 [worst]), 25 visual analog scale of the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) 26 questionnaire for quality of life (QoL) assessment (Spanish version of the EQ-5D; scale of 0 [worst health state imaginable] to 100 [best health state imaginable]), and handgrip strength (dominant hand).",
