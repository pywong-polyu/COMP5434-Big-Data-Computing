Methods: Clinical trials involving antiviral drugs for treating COVID-19 were retrieved from the ICTRP database. For each trial, the study design, number of participants, primary endpoints, source register, antiviral mechanism, and results were evaluated. Results: On June 10, 2020, 145 eligible clinical trials were retrieved from the ICTRP, of which 99 (68.3%) were randomized trials, 109 (75.2%) were parallel assignment trials, 38 (26.2%) were double or single blinded, 130 (89.7%) involved two groups, and 75 (51.6%) included more than 100 participants; and clinical improvement or recovery and virusnegative conversion were the two most common endpoints, accounting for 40.7% and 18.6%, respectively. The drugs were divided according to the antiviral mechanism into HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors (PIs), hepatitis C virus NS3 PIs, and anti-influenza drugs. Conclusion: The design characteristics of clinical trials of antiviral drugs for treating COVID-19 as well as the mechanism of action and antiviral efficacy of the drugs were evaluated in this study. The results of these trials could constitute a reference for future clinical trials to be executed on COVID-19 treatment and prevention.",

Nevertheless, Wu et al 6 reviewed some antiviral agents (including remdesivir, favipiravir, oseltamivir, lopinavir, umifenovir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine) with supporting agents (including nitric oxide, ascorbic acid, azithromycin, interleukin 6 antagonists, and corticosteroids). However, the need for more clinical trials on broad-spectrum antiviral drugs as well as antimalarial drugs for COVID-19 is urgent, particularly because the development of COVID-19 vaccines is in highly preliminary stages.",

Accordingly, the WHO has facilitated the cultivation of the notion that controlled trials are for the global public good; thus, the ICTRP can aid health information producers as well as other related individuals to use and produce health improvement knowledge. 7 The ICTRP was thus established with the aim of ensuring that all health care decision-makers are provided with a comprehensive view of research, which can consequently engender enhanced research transparency and increase validity and value of scientific evidence.",

Using the registered clinical trial data on ChiCTR and ClinicalTrials.gov, we reviewed the essential attributes of China's registered clinical trials on COVID-19. 8 Antiviral and antimalarial drugs are the two main classes of therapeutic drugs that have been determined to be effective against COVID-19, but given the pandemic spread of COVID-19, the focus of most registered trials has been shifted to antiviral drugs. Consequently, the period from January to June 2020 has witnessed a considerable increase in the number of registered COVID-19 clinical trials worldwide. Antiviral drugs designed for specific viral targets remain the most effective resources for controlling the spread of the virus. Here, we analyzed ICTRP-registered clinical trials for antiviral drugs against COVID-19 and summarized their study design and antiviral mechanism data as well as their results so as to provide a reference for COVID-19 treatment.",

Currently, COVID-19 treatment involves symptomatic comprehensive intervention as well as supportive therapy. During DovePress a pandemic, frontline medical personnel must step up their treatment approaches continually. Although some antiviral drugs have been verified to exhibit activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, determining their clinical efficacy through clinical trials is essential. Clinical trial registration ensures that researchers follow clinical trial transparency and crucial content availability with regard to the ethics of medical research and understand their obligations. With the progress of COVID-19 prevention and control research, registries have witnessed a continually increasing number of registered clinical trials: before March 2020, most of the relevant clinical trials were registered only in China, but as the outbreak became a pandemic, the number of such trials registered in other countries including Iran, the United States, and Spain is also increased.",

Although a double-blind randomized trial produces least bias and although clinical studies afford the highest level of evidence, 37 most of the currently retrieved trials were exploratory, with relatively small sample sizes. 38 Nevertheless, for 26 and 5 studies on antiviral drugs, the sample sizes were >1000 (17.8%) and >10,000 (3.4%), respectively. Regarding the number of groups, 10.3% of the reviewed trials were determined to have included one group and the remaining 89.7% were determined to have included two or more groups. In addition to conventional parallel and group designs, new design types were used in the current clinical trials, including adaptive design (in JPRN-JapicCTI -205238 and ISRCTN50189673), factorial design (in PACTR202004893013257, ACTRN12620000445976, and NCT04403100), and sequential assignment (in The activity of drugs against SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in vitro; thus, such drugs may be effective against COVID-19 in vivo, which can be confirmed through clinical trials.

In the clinical trial of remdesivir for severe COVID-19, 453 patients were to be enrolled ideally; however, only 237 patients could actually be enrolled, and the results demonstrated no significant clinical benefit in adult patients with severe COVID-19. 30 At present, the results of only a few registered clinical trials have been reported. Clinical trials including a large sample, a placebo, and randomization are still needed to DovePress verify antiviral drug efficacy. The WHO and its partners are launching an international randomized clinical trial, named \"Solidarity,\" to facilitate research on effective treatments for COVID-19 by reducing the design and implementation time by 80%. A limitation of the present study is that clinical trials of antimalarial drugs and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were not included. Our previous research revealed that antimalarial drugs and TCM also account for a large proportion of clinical trials. 8 In particular, natural products such as baicalein (ChiCTR2000033286) may play a key role in antiviral action and tissue repair; further clinical trials should test their efficacy. In the future, model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) may be employed to evaluate the efficacy of different antiviral agents employed in globally registered clinical trials. This is because MBMA can combine data from different types of clinical trials and concurrently probe the influence of various factors on efficacy parameters. 39 Moreover, in the future, we aim to assess the effectiveness as well as safety of COVID-19 clinical trials so as to provide strong evidence for aiding the mitigation of COVID-19 in the affected countries.",
