(ii) Is There a Known Causal Association with the Vaccine or Vaccination? Enquiries to ascertain whether there is evidence to support a known causal association with the vaccine or vaccination should involve a literature search for all reports of the specific event of interest following vaccination. Where available, information on the outcomes in these patients should be ascertained, and how the particular serious adverse event affected the development and use of any associated vaccines established. It is helpful to further widen the search by conducting a literature review for similar events that have been reported following the administration of vaccines, with particular note of whether implicated vaccines shared the same vector, excipients, or adjuvants as the vaccine under study. In addition, further evidence can be collected through a detailed search of similar events in the study and the whole program, even if these events were considered to be unrelated previously, involving collection of all relevant case details to validate the diagnosis, including the clinical path of the condition, and a review of the patients' past medical history.
