            "text": "Various telemedicine services have garnered interest with the development of information and communication technology (ICT) [1, 2] . In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for telemedicine due to the risk of infection in physical hospitals. Several types of telemedicine services using biological signals, such as blood pressure [3] , blood glucose [4] , ECG, SpO2, and temperature [5] have been proposed as healthcare indicators to prevent critical illness and frailty. For example, Yamazaki et al. [3] proposed a robotic system to monitor the blood pressure and heart rate of a patient at home using a sphygmomanometer. In addition, Glooko, Inc. [4] proposed a cloud service that manages blood glucose meters and insulin doses for diabetic patients and is used for in-hospital consultations and remote guidance. Alternatively, Abo-Zahhad et al. [5] proposed a wireless emergency telemedicine system that continuously collects and evaluates biological signals; if abnormal values are encountered, physiological data are immediately submitted to a remote medical server via both the cellular network and the Internet. In particular, the heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are important indicators of physical and mental illness because they are modulated by the autonomic nervous system, autonomic nerve response [6] , and mental stress [7] . To monitor the HRV, remote photoplethysmogram techniques [8] [9] [10] , rPPG for short, are expected to be a casual non-contact method that can be implemented in telemedicine services because they do not require dedicated wearable devices or electrode pads required for photoplethysmogram (PPG) [11] and electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. In fact, the heart rate and its variability obtained by rPPG are used as indicators for patient monitoring [12] , sleep monitoring [13] , and neonate monitoring [14] .",

            "text": "Despite having advantages for telemedicine services, the error in the HRV obtained through rPPG increases due to several factors, such as lighting conditions [15] , body motion [16] , and camera parameters [17] . Accordingly, one of the major concerns is to establish a method to suppress the influence of these factors for achieving highly accurate rPPG measurements [18] [19] [20] . To improve the quality of the rPPG, a blind source separation (BSS) algorithm [18] was introduced. For example, independent component analysis (ICA), which seeks the source signals that are maximally independent in a statistical sense, is commonly used as a BSS algorithm and is feasible for HR measurement but requires a long-time series signal and cannot be expected to achieve high performance. In contrast to BSS, a model-based method that uses the pre-knowledge of different color components is also proposed. The chrominance-based method, named CHROM, proposed by De Hann et al. [19] , considers diffuse reflection, which relates to pulsation, and specular reflection, which does not pertain to pulse signal, which together make the color variations. Therefore, they use a linear combination of chrominance features to remove specular reflection by assuming a standardized skin color to white-balance the images. Furthermore, the blood volume pulse signature (PBV) method proposed by De Hann et al. [20] uses the unique signature defined by the absorption spectrum of hemoglobin and retrieves the pulse by restricting all color variations to the pulsatile direction. While these efforts are underway, they have not yet been able to scale up from the laboratory to an actual situation, such as telemedicine services, because it is difficult to completely eliminate the effects of body motion and lighting.",

            "text": "The purpose of this study was to build up knowledge about the constraints and limitations of measuring HR and HRV accurately by rPPG, which would provide guidelines for preparing the camera settings and shooting environment. Therefore, we investigated an effective, appropriate setup considering illumination, camera parameters, and body motion to achieve precise HRV measurements by rPPG in telemedicine situations. First, in terms of illumination, the light source should emit sufficient energy, because the amplitude of the blood pulse is proportional to the intensity of illumination [21] ; that is, the higher the light intensity, the stronger the measured pulse signal. However, if the illumination is too high, image clipping may occur. In addition, the direction of illumination [21] is important because the dark and bright areas of the face change due to its uneven surface. Second, the frame rate of the camera should be carefully considered. A lower frame rate causes a larger error in detecting the blood pulse interval (R-R interval or RRI) [22] . As a result, the accuracy of the HRV measurement may be affected by the frame rate because it is derived from the frequency analysis of the RRI. Third, considering the illumination condition, it is necessary to suppress body motion because it changes the direction of the camera and light source, resulting in the fluctuation of shade on the face. Therefore, the development of effective pulse extraction methods that compensate body movements is one of the main goals in rPPG studies [23, 24] . One robust rPPG method [23] divides the whole face into many small regions and combines the different regions with weights to reduce the effect of body movements and measure the HR. However, the extent to which body motion is involved in accurate HRV measurements has not been investigated. In the experiment, various conditions concerning illumination, the direction of light, the frame rate of the camera, and body motion were examined to verify the accuracy of the RRI and HRV measurements.",

The camera was connected to a PC via USB 3.0, and the video image was captured at 720 \u00d7 540 resolution and saved in an uncompressed format. In addition, a contact-type ECG sensor (LRR-03, GMS Co., Ltd., Yangju-si, Korea) was used to measure the blood pulse simultaneously with the measurement using the camera for comparison. The signal of the ECG sensor was recorded at a sampling rate of 100 Hz using a 16-bit A/D converter. Only the onset and offset times of the rPPG and ECG were synchronized because the sampling rates of these sensors differ. Figure 1 shows the experimental setup. The camera was placed at a distance of 0.5 m from the subject, as done by Verkryusee et al. [8] . The subject was instructed to sit and look at the camera. Additionally, to suppress head (body) motion, the subject was asked to put his chin on the head fixation apparatus. The height and orientation of the camera were adjusted so that the entire face was within the angle of view. The subject's face was illuminated from the front and/or top by LED lights of the same wavelength (white color). Incidentally, to prevent external light from entering, the experiment was conducted in a room with no windows. In the experiment, three healthy males (21-22 years old) participated as volunteers. Written consent was obtained from the participants before the experiment, and the experimental procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the institution. To obtain the optimal rPPG conditions, the accuracy of RRI or HRV was evaluated through experiments under three different conditions. A detailed description of each condition is provided below.",

With respect to the light source direction, it had three conditions: front, top, and front and top. In addition, the illuminance was adjusted to 4 degrees: 100, 300, 500, and 700 lux per light source direction. Considering all combinations of the three lighting directions (front, top, and front and top) and four illuminance conditions (100, 300, 500, and 700 lux), we investigated 12 different light source conditions in total. Here, the condition of 500 lux from the top is the standard for a typical room, and the captured image is overexposed when it exceeds 700 lux. Incidentally, the frame rate of the camera was set to 30 fps, and the measurement time was 2 min.

Here, 30 fps is the standard frame rate of a typical camera. Additionally, the aperture value of the camera was adjusted so that the brightness of the image would be constant regardless of the frame rate because the amount of light received by the image sensors decreases as the frame rate increases. In this experiment, the accuracy of three types of HRV metrics (LF, HF, and LF/HF) was evaluated. To obtain reliable HRV values, the measurement time was set as 6 min because the HR measurement guideline [22] mandates a measurement time of at least 2-5 min to calculate the HRV.",

Here, it is thought that body motion includes not only head motion but also minute motions, such as facial and lip movements, and breathing. As mentioned before, the direction (angle) of the light source to the skin and to the camera are changed when the face moves significantly, which affects the extraction of the blood pulse. Additionally, small facial movements, such as movements of muscles around the mouth during speaking, also affect the light reflection on the facial skin. As a result, it appears as a noise component of blood pulse. To evaluate the effect of such body motions, three types of conditions were considered: fixation, non-fixation, and non-fixation and speaking. In the fixation condition, the subject's head was constricted using the fixation apparatus, as in the previous experiment. Meanwhile, in the non-fixation condition, the subject was instructed to look at the camera without head constriction. In the non-fixation and speaking condition, the subject was also asked to respond to questions from the experimenter based on the medical interview sheet in addition to the non-fixation condition. The other experimental conditions including the illumination, the lighting direction, and the frame rate were defined as the appropriate conditions and values derived in the experiment described in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. Additionally, the accuracy of the HRV metrics (LF, HF, LF/HF) was evaluated for each condition. Figure 2 shows an overview of the entire processing flow used to obtain the HRV measurements. The process comprises four steps: region of interest (RoI) detection, pulse extraction, peak detection, and HRV calculation. A detailed description of each step is provided below.",

This method obtains the pulse wave signal by detecting the fluctuation of the green component of the skin color region, which is extracted from the RoI, as hemoglobin absorbs green light. In this study, the pulse wave is obtained by calculating the average of the green component x g (t) of the RoI in the pulse extraction process, as shown in Figure 2 .

The outliers exceeding the threshold were removed and modified by spline interpolation, as shown in Figure 3b . In addition, the time series RRI was resampled again at 4 Hz using spline interpolation, referring to [22] , because the data intervals of RRI were unequal. Then, to analyze the fluctuation of RRI, known as HRV, we computed the short-time FFT of the 2-min (480 samples) Hamming sliding window with the 15-s (60 samples) increment. Here, the length of the sliding window was defined by referring to the guideline [22] to obtain reliable HRV values. Finally, as a result of this spectral analysis, three critical frequency domain parameters were obtained: very low frequency (VLF, 0.0033-0.04 Hz) power, low frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) power, and high frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz) power. These were quantified in normalized units to minimize the impact of differences in total power.

The effect of body motion was evaluated based on the HRV spectrum to examine changes in HRV spectral analysis during body movement. In the spectral analysis, the short-time FFT of the time series RRI was computed using the 2-min (480 samples) Hamming sliding window with the 15-s (60 samples) increment. Figure 7 compares the spectrum acquired by the POS method, whose robustness against body movements has been verified in previous studies [22] , and the ECG in the fixation, nonfixation, and non-fixation and speaking conditions. These different conditions are denoted as FIX, nFIX, and SPK. In the FIX and nFIX conditions, the spectrograms of the rPPG are close to those of the ECG. However, there is a small amount of noise in the SPK condition. Table 1 summarizes the MAE of the RRI and the correlation coefficients of the HRV metrics. The results show that the MAE of the RRI in SPK was approximately twice as large as that of FIX and nFIX, and the correlation coefficients of the HRV metrics of SPK were much lower. In addition, the comparison between FIX and nFIX shows that the correlation coefficient of LF/HF is approximately 0.30 lower. As a result, the MAE was larger, and the correlation was lower in the nFIX and SPK conditions with body motion. A possible reason for this is that body motion reduces the accuracy of face tracking. In addition, it is thought that light reflection from the skin also changes with motion, and such color distortion appears as noise in the pulse signal and causes a decrease in accuracy. ",

            "text": "Appropriate light source conditions were experimentally investigated for telemedicine services. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the RRI measurement with rPPG was affected by the direction and illuminance of the light source. As for the direction of the light source, the accuracy of RRI extraction is better when illuminated from the front than from the top or from the top and front. This is because specular reflections on the skin surface due to the change of light source direction cause different rPPG strengths in RGB components. This result shows an agreement with the study by Wang et al. [30] which indicated that the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of a single light source was higher than that of multiple light sources due to the different color changes in the facial area. Therefore, in general environments with many light sources, such as offices and homes, it is desirable to either turn off the lights or block the external light in addition to preparing a light source in front of the face.",

            "text": "In terms of illuminance, for the FR condition, the accuracy is minimized under low illuminance (100 lux). The reason for this is that the amplitude of the pulse signal caused by the heartbeat becomes smaller and the camera noise becomes larger in a low-illuminance environment. In fact, Wang et al. [30] also noted that the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) decreases at low light levels. To address this problem, near-infrared (NIR) remote photoplethysmography (PPG) [31] is thought to be an effective method because it uses infrared light. Figure 6 indicates that the MAE of the RRI decreases as the frame rate increases. This is thought to be due to the time difference between frames. For example, because the time interval between adjacent frames is 33.3 ms in the case of 30 fps, the standard error of the R-peak can be theoretically \u00b116.6 ms. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the R-peak can be \u00b15 ms for 100 fps. In addition, the sampling rate was adjusted to 250 Hz using spline interpolation for the detection of pulse signal peaks; however, the complemented peaks did not perfectly match the actual peaks. In the measurement of HRV, the correlation coefficients of LF, HF, and LF/HF exceed 90% at 30 fps or higher, which indicates that the variation in HRV can be accurately estimated. Furthermore, in previous studies investigating the effect of frame rate [32] , it was shown that even if the frame rate was reduced to 20 fps, the effect of the frame rate on HRV was not significant. Therefore, it is thought that the appropriate frame rate of the camera is 30 fps or higher when measuring HRV.",

The results show that the mean absolute error of the RRI was minimized when 500-700-lux light was shone from the front. In addition, HRV showed a high correlation coefficient when the frame rate was higher than 30 fps. These findings can set the basic requirements for not only telemedicine but also other studies using the rPPG technique. However, because the accuracy of RRI and HRV measurements are greatly affected by body motion, it is necessary to suppress body motion, especially head motion. It is also important to develop rPPG algorithms that are robust and adapt to various body motions, which would contribute to accelerating the use of rPPG in telemedicine services. ",
