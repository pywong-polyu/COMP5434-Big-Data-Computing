Under the Health Care Systems Research Network-Older Americans Independence Centers AGING Initiative, a multidisciplinary Stakeholder Advisory Panel was convened to develop recommendations to improve the capability of the clinical research enterprise in US nursing homes. The Panel considered the nursing home as a setting for clinical trials, reviewed the current state of clinical trials in nursing homes, and ultimately developed recommendations for the establishment of a nursing home clinical trials research network that would be centrally supported and administered. This report summarizes the Panel's recommendations, which were developed in alignment with the following core principles: build on available research infrastructure where appropriate; leverage existing productive partnerships of researchers with groups of nursing homes and nursing home corporations; encompass both efficacy and effectiveness clinical trials; be responsive to a broad range of stakeholders including nursing home residents and their care partners; be relevant to an expansive range of clinical and health care delivery research questions; be able to pivot as necessary to changing research priorities and circumstances; create a pathway for industry-sponsored research as appropriate; invest in strategies to increase diversity in study populations and the research workforce; and foster the development of the next generation of nursing home researchers.",

Of the 1.3 million residents of US nursing homes, only a few hundred participated in RCTs relating to COVID-19. 1 As with the entire US COVID-19 clinical research enterprise, the problem was not lack of resources. 2 An effective clinical research effort in nursing homes to address prevention and treatment of COVID-19 faced overwhelming challenges, beyond those directly related to the evolving pandemic. 3 These included an underresourced, unstable nursing home industry, complex regulations relating to federal and state oversight of nursing homes, the need for special protections of the vulnerable nursing home population in conducting research, and the absence of clinical research experience and infrastructure in long-term care settings, especially relevant to the conduct of clinical trials. 4 Recognizing the need to improve the capability of the clinical research enterprise in nursing homes, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) funded the AGING Initiative, a joint endeavor of the Health Care Systems Research Network and the Older Americans Independence Centers, to develop a set of recommendations for creation of a nursing home clinical trials research network to improve efficiency in conducting clinical trials in nursing homes. Toward this end, a multidisciplinary Stakeholder Advisory Panel was convened, which met virtually on 7 occasions over a 9-month period beginning in October 2020. The Panel considered the nursing home as a setting for clinical trials, reviewed the current state of clinical trials in nursing homes, and ultimately developed recommendations and a roadmap for the establishment of a nursing home clinical trials research network.",

An increasing proportion of nursing home residents require more medicalized, post-acute care. There may be numerous family members involved in decision making. Often, the number of direct care staff may be inadequate, insufficiently trained, and there are high rates of turnover. There can be infrequent and inconsistent involvement of primary care providers. In addition, there is a high degree of regulation and fear of sanctions, as well as an abundance of time-consuming, mandated documentation. 6 The challenges of conducting research in the nursing home setting have been well described (Table 1) . 6 The vulnerability of nursing home residents can create a sense of misgiving among administrators, nursing and medical directors, staff, health care providers, and residents and families about participation in research. Even during nonpandemic times, the presence of outside research staff can create logistical and administrative burdens. Furthermore, there are high levels of turnover of nursing home administrative leadership and staff, complicating the performance of clinical trials that are initiated and carried out over extended periods of time.",

Promote financial partnerships and collaborations with private organizations and foundations, as well as funders like the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). 3. Provide direct financial and other incentives to participating nursing homes to facilitate engagement and commitment (eg, participation might be factored into Star Ratings). 4. Prioritize use of civil monetary penalty funds to support clinical trial research in nursing homes. 5. Provide special funding opportunities and preferences particularly directed to the next generation of researchers specially focused on the conduct of clinical trials in nursing homes, including grants for pilot studies that will form the basis for funding of a larger trial.",

This experience has underscored the need for a coordinated national clinical trial infrastructure that can be called on in the context of a public health crisis and used in an ongoing way to more efficiently plan and implement clinical trials designed to improve nursing home care and resident outcomes.",

            "text": "Leveraging existing partnerships between researchers, institutions, and groups of nursing homes is an essential first step in establishing a nursing home clinical trials network. The number of investigators performing trials in nursing homes, and with established relationships is relatively modest; building an infrastructure around these individuals and capitalizing on their relationships with one another could serve as an efficient way to initiate the network. A complementary strategy includes building upon existing NIA-funded collaborative efforts such as the Research Centers Collaborative Network (https://www.rccn-aging.org/), the Health Care Systems Research Network-OAICs AGING Initiative (https://theaginginitiative. wordpress.com), 11 and the Imbedded Pragmatic AD/ADRD Clinical Trials (IMPACT) Collaboratory, which fosters pragmatic trials embedded in health systems with a specific focus on the care of older adults living with dementia. Other relevant collaborative research efforts funded by NIA include initiatives focused on deprescribing (https://deprescribingresearch.org/) and geroscience. 12 The vast majority of members on the Stakeholder Advisory Panel strongly endorsed the need for a nursing home clinical trials network that will take a long-term view focusing especially on nursing home residents' needs and the outcomes of their care, and not driven by the threat of a future public health crisis or limited to a specific research focus. However, it is important to acknowledge that there was not complete unanimity among our multidisciplinary Stakeholder Advisory Panel regarding the conceptualization, feasibility, or even the need for a centrally funded and administered network with an expansive research agenda. Some advocated for having more than 1 network, each with a different focus based on research area (eg, dementia or geroscience 13 ) or clinical trial type (eg, a network limited to the conduct of pragmatic clinical trials). Still others suggested that the network should be expanded to other types of settings, such as assisted living communities, senior living residences, and even home health agencies. Finally, the level of exclusivity of the network was left unresolved, with the following questions remaining unanswered. Should the network be limited to trials funded through NIH or foundation grants, or should funding also be sought from pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers seeking to study their drugs, devices, and technologies in the nursing home setting? Should the network be limited solely to trials led by university-based investigators? And how can collegiality be fostered among investigators working in highly competitive, siloed academic environments to allow the network to come together?",
