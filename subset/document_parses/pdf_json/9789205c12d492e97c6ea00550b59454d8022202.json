            "text": "Understanding the molecular and cellular composition of tissues and their relative organization in three-dimensional space of a complex tissue microenvironment (spatialomic organization) is essential for obtaining fundamental insights in tissue biology and interplay between various molecules and cells, and for more accurately determining changes due to disease or treatments. This is especially true in the case of cancer, where insights into the complex tumor microenvironment help guide therapeutic choices (Binnewies et al., 2018) . Similar profiling of the cells infiltrating a transplanted tissue helps predict graft survival (Sablik et al., 2020) . Techniques to quantify multiple molecules in a single sample, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, flow cytometry, and mass cytometry, have revolutionized the field by providing deep characterization of tissue composition, yet they lack information about spatial organization of the various molecules and cells Bodenmiller et al., 2012) . Immunohistochemical (IHC)-based and immunofluorescence (IF) based imaging methods provide information about spatial distribution of molecules and cells in tissues, yet were limited to detecting only 3-6 analytes at a time in the past (Cappi et al., 2019; Frampton et al., 2015; Gannot et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2011; T\u00f3th and Mezey, 2007) . Thus, a great deal of recent effort has focused on increasing the multiplexing capabilities of such imaging-based techniques, and several methodologies for detecting multiple antigens in a single tissue section are now being developed. For example, brightfield IHC-based techniques have been developed by using cycles of IHC staining and de-staining using organic solvents (Akturk et al., 2020; Dixon et al., 2015; Fountaine et al., 2006; Gerdes et al., 2013; Glass et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2013; Remark et al., 2016; Stack et al., 2014) (Dixon et al., 2015; Fountaine et al., 2006; Gerdes et al., 2013; Remark et al., 2016; Stack et al., 2014) . Similarly, methodologies using IF-based imaging have been developed, such as CycIF that achieves multiplex imaging via de-staining using fluorescence bleaching (Lin et al., 2015 (Lin et al., , 2018 , and the 4i method that achieves the same by eluting antibodies after each round of staining (Gut et al., 2018) . These methods, although providing high multiplex IF capabilities, use harsh protocols to remove the stain in each cycle, which has the potential to harm sensitive tissues.",

Indeed, such reagents have redefined single-cell genomics by multiplexing cells from different samples (Gaublomme et al., 2019; Stoeckius et al., 2018) . DNA-tagged antibodies have also recently been used very elegantly for multiplexed IF imaging (Agasti et al., 2017; Beechem, 2020; Goltsev et al., 2018; Jungmann et al., 2014; Saka et al., 2019; Schnitzbauer et al., 2017) . The CODEX method combines DNA tagged antibodies and in situ primer extension with fluorescently tagged nucleotides to achieve high-level multiplexing (Goltsev et al., 2018) . Although CODEX aids in deeper understanding of the tissue architecture, its complex experimental setup and design impedes wider accessibility of the technique. Another technique, immuno-SABER, uses cycles of in situ DNA hybridization and removal (primer exchange reaction) for multiplexed IF imaging with DNA-tagged antibodies (Saka et al., 2019) . However, it also requires a complex design of DNA oligonucleotides and setup for the exchange of DNA strands and concatemers. Thus, a need exists for a rapid, mild, and easy-to-use method for multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging.",

The method relies on sequential steps of immunofluorescent labeling with a set of such antibodies and gentle removal of the fluorescent labels post imaging, followed by another round of labeling with a new set of fluorescently labeled antibodies ( Figure 1A) . Importantly, the SeqStain methodology utilizes efficient and selective enzymatic processes, such as treatment with DNase I or restriction enzymes, for rapidly cleaving fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides (oligos) off the antibodies, thereby removing the fluorescent labels from immunofluorescently labeled substrates in the de-staining steps. Subsequently, the cleaved labels are washed off prior to initiation of the next round of staining. The enzymatic removal of fluorescent oligonucleotides also offers flexibility in the oligo sequence design, the length and complexity of the oligos, and the types of oligos that can be used. Thus, cyclic steps of staining tissues with SeqStain antibodies and de-staining with nuclease treatment allow efficient and rapid multiplex immunofluorescent imaging of cells and tissues.",

Additionally, the oligo chains were designed so that the fluorescent dye molecules on the DNA were spaced apart by >5 nm dye-to-dye distance (~15 nt apart) to prevent any unwanted dye-dye interactions (Woehrstein et al., 2017) . SeqStain antibodies were generated in a two-step process ( Figure S1B ). In step 1, a 5\u2032-amine modified 29-nt-long single-stranded DNA chain (linker oligo), containing a pre-specified 15-mer sequence for hybridization with a complementary docking oligo, was covalently attached to the antibody. SDS-PAGE showed an average of 2-5 linker oligos chemically conjugated to an antibody during a typical labeling experiment ( Figure S1C ). In step 2, a fluorescently labeled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) complex, containing a docking oligo and multiple fluorescently labeled oligos, was hybridized to the antibody-DNA conjugate. This design of the dsDNA also allows for using many copies of fluorescently labeled DNA oligos to tune the signal intensity on the antibody. Subsequently, SeqStain antibodies were purified by using the 100-kDa size-exclusion column. Formation of the fluorescent DNA-antibody complex was confirmed by using 4% agarose gels ( Figure S1D ). This method of using fluorophores on the complementary oligonucleotides also avoids chemical quenching of the fluorophores during the antibody-DNA conjugation step. Analyses of fluorescence intensity after repeated cycles of heating and slow cooling during dsDNA hybridization (steps that are utilized to prepare fluorescent dsDNA-labeled SeqStain antibodies) showed no loss in fluorescence during this step ( Figure S1E ), confirming that this method of preparing SeqStain antibodies does not lead to any loss of fluorescence signal.",

Staining of cells with the fluorescent oligo complex alone (no antibody) showed no staining. Additionally, imaging of cells with both SeqStain and conventional antibody labeling methods showed no difference between immunofluorescence labeling using DNA-modified primary antibody versus unmodified antibody ( Figure S1G ). Furthermore, counterstaining of non-fluorescent SeqStain antibody labeled cells with a fluorescent secondary antibody showed cell staining similar to the unmodified primary antibody used via the conventional approach (Figure S1H), suggesting that the chemical conjugation of antibodies with oligonucleotides has minimal effect on their binding properties. Furthermore, oligos containing five repeats for complementary strand binding showed high fluorescence signal-to-background ratios (data not shown), and was, thus, utilized in all the assays presented here.

Of note, we incorporated an EcoRV restriction site in the dsDNA sequence on the SeqStain antibodies. After fluorescence imaging, treatment of cells with DNase I resulted in rapid loss of the fluorescence signal ( Figure 1B, top) . Alternatively, treatment with EcoRV also resulted in rapid loss of fluorescence on the cells ( Figure 1B , bottom), suggesting that both types of nucleases can be used. Treatment of cells stained with either a single SeqStain antibody ( Figure 1C ) or co-stained with two different SeqStain antibodies ( Figure  1D ) with DNase I rapidly reduced the fluorescence signal-to-background levels, suggesting that the fluorescence signal from multiple fluorophores can be simultaneously removed. Furthermore, DNase I removed the fluorescence on subsecond timescales from stained cells (Video S1). Keeping DNase I longer on the cells did not show any loss in sample integrity or increase in background signal ( Figure S2A ). SeqStain antibodies showed high fluorescence and low background that was similar or better than the cells immunostained by using the conventional methods ( Figure S2B ). Furthermore, staining of \u03b1-tubulin on RAW cells by using SeqStain antibody either prior to DNase I treatment or after two sequential DNase I treatments ( Figure S2C ) showed no loss in structural information or integrity of fine intracellular structures. Similarly, staining of \u03b1-tubulin on podocytes by using SeqStain antibody either prior to or after DNase I treatment ( Figure S2D ) showed no loss in structural integrity of fine intracellular structures, including F-actin, further suggesting that SeqStain is a gentle technique. Moreover, given that chemical conjugation of linker oligo to antibody can be performed by using a variety of methods, we tested two additional orthogonal chemistries to generate SeqStain antibodies ( Figures S2E and S2F ) (Gong et al., 2016; Stoeckius et al., 2017) and found that these methods had no effect on the staining and de-staining levels (Figures S2G and S2H) , suggesting that antibody modification can be successfully accomplished by using multiple different methods.",

            "text": "Finally, to evaluate SeqStain for multiplex staining, we used a 6-plex panel to iteratively stain and de-stain the immobilized RAW cells in three rounds of staining and de-staining ( Figure 1E ). Staining was performed with a set of two unique antibodies, each with a unique fluorophore-labeled DNA tag, per round. Cell nuclei were stained by using 4\u2032,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescent signal from the antibodies was removed by using DNase I. Quantification showed complete removal of both fluorophores after each round, with no effect on DAPI staining, suggesting that this treatment does not affect the integrity of cells, nuclei, or nuclear materials. A concern for the antibody-based multiplex staining methods is that application of so many antibodies, either together or sequentially, could crowd the antigens, making multiplexing difficult. To address this, we stained and de-stained immobilized cells with the same SeqStain antibody for five cycles ( Figure S3 ). Furthermore, the samples were further stained, de-stained, and re-stained with a second set of two antibodies for five more rounds. We found no loss in immunofluorescent labeling capability of these samples, likely because only a subset of epitopes were engaged during each cycle and that, although the fraction of available epitope for antibody binding decreases over time, it likely did not reach saturation during these experiments (only five cycles of binding) using the low antibody concentrations utilized here. It is quite possible that either use of much higher concentration of antibodies in each cycle or performing additional cycles would reach a point of full epitope occupancy or masking. Together, these data show that SeqStain offers a rapid and robust multiplex immunofluorescence imaging platform.",

However, extension of such methodology in a multiplex environment is limited by the number of species (such as mouse, rat, goat, or sheep) available to generate unique secondary antibodies. Premixing primary antibodies with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies or purified antigen-binding fragments (Fabs, the regions of antibodies with antigen-binding capacity; Coulter and Harris, 1983; Mariant et al., 1991) prior to their use in staining could potentially overcome some of these limitations. Here, as an alternative to using primary SeqStain antibodies for multiplex staining, we tested whether fluorescent-DNA-labeled secondary antibodies (SeqStain secondary Ab) or Fabs of secondary antibodies (SeqStain Fabs) (Figures 2A and 2B ) could be applied in the SeqStain protocol. Such reagents have at least two major advantages: (1) by pre-complexing these reagents with primary antibodies, we can achieve signal amplification for targets with low level of expression; (2) these reagents might be quickly pre-complexed with many different primary antibodies, thus circumventing the need for modifying primary antibodies with fluorescent DNA.",

Furthermore, use of a 6-plex panel of primary antibodies pre-complexed with SeqStain Fabs to iteratively stain and de-stain immobilized RAW cells also showed efficient labeling and clearing of fluorescent signal from these cells ( Figure S4D ), further suggesting that SeqStain methodology can be applied with a variety of reagents for rapid multiplex immunofluorescence imaging.",

We selected a set of commercially available, well-characterized antibodies (see key resources table) that recognize several different cell types for these assays. First, we validated the prepared SeqStain antibodies. Figure S5 shows that the developed SeqStain reagents provided expected antigen-staining patterns on tissues and was comparable with the conventional IF staining. For example, staining of mouse spleen sections ( Figure S5A ) showed that anti-immunoglobulin D (IgD) and anti-IgM SeqStain antibodies expectedly stained B cell clusters, and the anti-CD169 SeqStain antibody stained marginal zone macrophages around the B cell cluster in ring-like pattern similar to the staining observed by using conventional methods (Goltsev et al., 2018; Sarvaria et al., 2017; Sic et al., 2014) . Staining using anti-CD68 and anti-CD11b SeqStain antibodies, which stain macrophages in the spleen, similarly provided expected patterns. Remarkably, we also found that staining of serial sections of a murine spleen tissue for an antigen (MHC II) by using two different approaches-SeqStain and conventional immunostaining, respectively-yielded a similar pattern of MHC-II-positive B cell clusters throughout the tissue section (Kuwano et al., 2007) (Figure S5B ), suggesting that SeqStain antibodies provide results similar to those by conventional approaches. Similarly, staining of human kidney tissue sections ( Figure  S5C ) showed that anti-human SeqStain antibodies against cytokeratin-8, CD31, CD45, synaptopodin, podocin, Na + , K + -ATPase, EpCAM, and collagen IV provided expected and comparable staining patterns in comparison with the unmodified antibodies used in the conventional approach. Not surprisingly, use of SeqStain Fab pre-complexed with primary antibodies also provided staining-pattern results comparable with the staining patterns observed by using conventional indirect immunofluorescence, as exemplified on human kidney and tonsil tissue sections in Figures S5D and S5E . Furthermore, we found that the type of fluorophore used to label the dsDNA complex on SeqStain antibodies did not have any material effect on their performance, suggesting that most commonly available fluorophores can be used to fluorescently tag the DNA on the antibodies ( Figure  S6A ). Additionally, as with the SeqStain-stained cells, fluorescent DNA-labeled SeqStain antibodies showed high fluorescence signal and low background signal, similar to or better than the tissues immunostained by using the conventional methods ( Figure S6B ). Together, these data suggest that SeqStain antibodies and Fabs are highly efficient in immunostaining a variety of complex tissues and provide staining results comparable with those of conventional methods.",

Human kidney tissue ( Figure 3 ) stained with a variety of SeqStain antibodies showed complete removal of fluorescence signal after a brief treatment with DNase I, and removed the fluorescence on subsecond timescales (Videos S2, S3, and S4). Notably, DNase I treatment of tissue sections stained by using the fluorescent antibodies via the conventional method (whereby the fluorophores do not contain a linker DNA) did not result in any loss of signal ( Figures S6C and S6D ). More importantly, DNase I treatment did not harm the integrity of the tissues. To probe this further, especially to make sure that the extensive DNase I treatment does not remove DNA-binding proteins from the nuclear DNA, we treated human kidney sections with increasing amounts of DNase I (by repeatedly staining the sections with DNase I either five times or ten times) and subsequently stained the cells with conventional anti-histone H1 antibody. Results showed no loss of histone levels or chromosomal DNA, suggesting that these treatments do not reduce sample quality ( Figure S7A ). To examine whether the technique is amenable to nuclear proteins, we stained tissue sections with anti-histone H1 SeqStain antibody. Results showed successful nuclear histone H1 staining by the antibody and, upon treatment with DNase I, efficient removal of the antibody-associated fluorescent signal, suggesting that SeqStain is amenable to staining such subcellular compartments as well (Figures S7B and S7C) . Finally, when tissue sections stained with SeqStain antibodies were co-stained with conventional fluorescent secondary antibody, using spectrally non-overlapping fluorophores, it showed an overlapping staining pattern ( Figures S7D and S7E ), suggesting that the chemical modification of primary antibody with fluorescent dsDNA sequences does not harm the antibody properties and does not hamper its recognition by a secondary antibody. Again, treatment of the doubly labeled tissue section with DNase I showed selective removal of the SeqStain fluorophore without negatively affecting the conventionally conjugated fluorophore, the staining pattern, or the tissue integrity. DNase I treatment also completely removed the fluorophore signal from the SeqStain secondary antibodies ( Figure S7F ), Together, these data comprehensively show that SeqStain methodology is equally efficient for immunofluorescence staining of complex tissues.",

            "text": "It is often desirable to maintain immunofluorescent labeling on an antigen while staining and de-staining other antigens on the same sample. However, such applications are difficult to incorporate in the current multiplex imaging techniques. Given that SeqStain relies on nuclease-based enzymatic removal of fluorescent signals, SeqStain methodology offers the possibility of selective removal of fluorophores. To test this, we engineered two unique restriction sites (EcoRV and SmaI) in the linker oligo sequences and used them to prepare the following SeqStain antibodies ( Figure 4A ): anti-EpCAM and anti-collagen IV SeqStain antibodies containing EcoRV restriction site in dsDNA linkers, and anti-Na + , K + -ATPase, and anti-aquaporin 1 SeqStain antibodies containing SmaI restriction site. Subsequently, we labeled human kidney cryosections with a combination of anti-Na + , K + -ATPase, and anti EpCAM SeqStain antibodies bearing AF488 and Cy3 fluorochrome tag, respectively ( Figure  4B ). Imaging results showed expected labeling of the distinct tubular segments with the two antibodies (Borges Da Silva et al., 2015; Goltsev et al., 2018) . Next, to selectively remove only one of the two fluorescent labels, we treated the tissue samples with EcoRV restriction endonuclease, which resulted in selective removal of the signal from the anti-EpCAM but did not affect the fluorescent signal from the anti-NA + , K + -ATPase antibody ( Figure 4B ). Subsequently, to determine whether this would have any negative consequences on staining with antibody labeled with DNA containing the same EcoRV restriction site and to study the utility of this method in a multiplexed setting, in the next round of staining we applied anti collagen IV SeqStain antibody containing EcoRV restriction site and the Cy3 fluorescent tag. Imaging results show tubular basement membrane stained by the collagen IV antibody along with the Na + , K + -ATPase-positive transport channels in the tubules that were labeled in the previous round of staining ( Figure 4B ). Next, for selective cleavage of the other signal, we treated the tissue sample with SmaI restriction endonuclease, which selectively removed the signal from anti-Na + ,K + -ATPase antibody. Finally, to determine whether this would have any negative consequences on staining with antibody labeled with DNA containing an SmaI site, in the next round we applied anti-aquaporin 1 antibody containing SmaI restriction site and the AF488 fluorophore, with expected staining of the cortical proximal tubules upon imaging ( Figure 4B ). The results clearly show that the SeqStain methodology allows selective de-staining of fluorescent markers in a multiplex setting, offering significant advantages where maintaining staining of specific markers or antigens is needed. Such retained stains can also serve as structural markers for imaging in subsequent rounds and help better orient the stacks of the whole tissue during image analyses.",

Each round of staining used two unique SeqStain antibodies followed by imaging of the whole slide and de-staining with nuclease DNase I. Again, DAPI-stained nuclei provided a guidepost for aligning the various image sets at the end of the experiment. Results in Figure 5A show a high level of fluorescence staining by each SeqStain antibody, followed by complete and rapid removal of fluorescent label from both channels after DNase I treatment ( Figure S8A ). After completion of the imaging rounds, images were stacked and aligned by using DAPI-stained nuclei using ImageJ (Arganda Carreras et al., 2006; Schneider et al., 2012) . CellProfiler-based image analyses showed that the individual cells can be efficiently segmented computationally for cell-based fluorescent signal analyses of SeqStain-stained tissues ( Figures S8B-S8D ).",

Images of the entire tissue section clearly showed no changes in overall tissue morphology or integrity due to the repeated cycles of staining and de-staining. Staining of different myeloid cells by using CD169, CD68, and CD11b revealed their spatial relationship with respect to B220 + B cells. Quantification of the inter-cell distances by using Fiji showed cells in distinct cellular neighborhoods ( Figure 5C ). As expected, the CD169 + macrophages were found in the marginal zone area lining B220 + B cell clusters, in close contact with the B cells as is typical for these cell populations, whereas the CD68 + macrophages were predominantly found in the red pulp region of the spleen. Additionally, the CD11b + cells were found scattered outside the red pulp region (Borges Da Silva et al., 2015; McCulloch et al., 2018; Walzer et al., 2007) . Thus, SeqStain can be used to profile the heterogeneous myeloid populations in the spleen whose distinct spatial location and relationship with other cell types help orchestrate the immune responses. Quantification of MHC II levels revealed that CD68 + and CD11b + macrophages in the spleen had low levels of MHC II expression (Sheng et al., 2015) whereas CD169 + macrophages residing in the marginal zone area had higher expression of MHC II (Martinez-Pomares and Gordon, 2012; Veninga et al., 2015) . As expected, B220 + B cells had the highest expression of MHC II among the cell types analyzed (Accolla et al., 2014; Murakami et al., 2007) . Thus, by quantifying the relative spatial location of cells and their co-expression of markers, SeqStain offers a simple yet robust method to understand the spatial organization of various cell types in the tissue and an ability to generate spatial relationship maps (SRMs).",

            "text": "Next, we expanded the antibody set to profile human kidney tissue and also tested the feasibility of using three-color antibody mixtures for staining in each round. We developed a 20-color panel (19 unique antibodies + DAPI) and used it to stain a human kidney tissue section in nine cycles of staining and de-staining (Figures 6 and S9) . Additionally, to confirm staining, we used a few of the antibodies twice to obtain a 25-plex image of the kidney tissue at high resolution. As above, images were stacked and aligned by using DAPI-stained nuclei for data quantification (Arganda-Carreras et al., 2006; Schneider et al., 2012) . Results show a high level of immunofluorescence staining by each SeqStain antibody, followed by complete and rapid removal of fluorescent label from each of the three channels after DNase I treatment. Aligned images of the whole tissue section clearly showed no loss of integrity of the tissue or changes in tissue morphology due to the repeated cycles of staining and de-staining. This was further confirmed from the analyses of images after repeated staining with the same antibody in a different cycle, such as vimentin and aquaporin 1. Analyses of the stained images from two different cycles clearly showed high overlap of fluorescence signal without any loss in signal intensity or increase in background fluorescence (Figures S10A and S10B). Further analyses of various kidney tissue substructures by using 20-plex images from this experiment clearly showed the presence of expected immunophenotypes, spatial relationships, and distinct cellular neighborhoods in the various parts of the kidney (Figures 7A and 7E ). Composites of pseudocolored images revealed a predominant presence of proximal tubules (AQP1) consistent with the histology of renal cortex ( Figure 7B ) (Nielsen et al., 2002; Singh et al., 2019) . We were also able to identify the collecting duct (AQP2 + AQP3 + EpCAM + Cyto7 + Cyto8 + ) (Hatta et al., 1987; Schiano et al., 2019; Skinnider et al., 2005) , Distal convoluted tubules (AQP2 \u2212 AQP3 \u2212 EpCAM + Cyto8 + UMOD \u2212 ), thick ascending loop of Henle (EpCAM + uromodulin + Na + ,K + -ATPase + AQP2 \u2212 AQP3 \u2212 ), and their spatial location with respect to one another ( Figures 7B-7E ) (Fissell and Miner, 2018) . Similarly, in the glomerulus we were able to discern the three components of the glomerular capillary filter: podocytes (WT1 + and vimentin + ), glomerular basement membrane (collagen IV + ), and glomerular endothelial cells (CD31 + ) (Fissell and Miner, 2018) . In addition, the specialized contractile mesangial cells of the glomerulus can be discerned by vimentin staining in the absence of WT1 staining (Johnson et al., 1991; Miner, 2012; Palmer et al., 2001; Qi et al., 2017) . In the renal interstitium, collagen IV delineates the tubular basement membrane, forming a network throughout the entire tissue (Figures 6 and 7E ) (Miner, 1999) . Peritubular capillaries visualized by CD31 staining can be seen as a disconnected network of cells within this tubular basement membrane (B\u00e1b\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 et al., 2017) . The renal interstitium also contains stromal cells that can be visualized by vimentin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin staining ( Figure 7E ) (Boor and Floege, 2012) . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for the SARS coronaviruses, was found to be highly expressed in the proximal tubular cells identified by ACE2 co-expression with AQP1 Lely et al., 2004) . The normal human kidney had resident immune cells that were identified by CD45 staining whereas the renal macrophages were identified by co-expression of CD45 and CD68 ( Figure 7E ) (Belliere et al., 2015) . Image analyses using HALO and Fiji showed clear SRMs and the expected proximity of glomerular podocytes (WT1 + Vim + ) with the glomerular endothelial cells (CD31 + ) and the glomerular mesangial cells (WT1-Vim + ) as their cellular neighborhood in the glomerulus (Figures S10C and 7F). In summary, these experiments show that SeqStain is highly applicable for multiplexed spatial profiling of various types of tissues and allows for rapid generation of SRMs.",

            "text": "Spatial profiling of cells in tissues provides critical insights into disease pathogenesis and can be diagnostic, especially for diseases such as cancer where spatial heterogeneity often leads to poor clinical outcomes (Binnewies et al., 2018; Dagogo-Jack and Shaw, 2018; Johnson et al., 2018) . To address such needs, recent years have seen a surge of innovative multiplex staining techniques at both transcriptomic and proteomic levels (Akturk et al., 2020; Dixon et al., 2015; Fountaine et al., 2006; Gerdes et al., 2013; Goltsev et al., 2018; Gut et al., 2018; Halpern et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2015; Remark et al., 2016; Saka et al., 2019; Satija et al., 2015; Stack et al., 2014) . However, the existing protein multiplexing methods either use harsh de-staining conditions or require complex experimental setup. The SeqStain methodology presented here is a gentle, easy-to-use, and efficient multiplex imaging technique that provides a unique platform for obtaining such spatialomic insights. The method combines antibodies that are pre-labeled with fluorescent dsDNA with a gentle, enzymatic method for removing fluorescence signal after each cycle of staining. In particular, we demonstrate multiplex staining of immobilized cells and tissue sections whereby de-staining gently removes the fluorescent signal to pre-staining levels on the whole slide. Strikingly, de-staining using the SeqStain method was also rapid and removed ~99% of the signal in <1 min without affecting sample integrity or tissue morphology. The unexpected findings from our work are that the nuclease treatment did not seem to affect tissue integrity, as determined by repeated treatment of cells and tissues with DNase I. This is not entirely unexpected, as nucleases have also been used in the SeqFISH methodology (Lubeck et al., 2014) . Additionally, by engineering specific restriction sites into DNA during antibody modification, we show that selective de-staining is possible with SeqStain. Retention of selective markers for subsequent rounds might be important for spatial alignment of tissues when it is not possible to perform whole-slide scanning or for measuring information about multiple neighboring antigens via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or other such methods, whereby keeping a fluorophore fixed on one antigen might be helpful while changing the second or third fluorophores on different antigens. SeqStain is thus a highly configurable and rapid multiplex IF imaging method. Furthermore, the enzymatic approach for the removal of fluorescent labels offers flexibility in the design of oligo sequence used for conjugation, the length and complexity of the oligos, the types of fluorophores that can be included, and the types of oligo-based higher order structures that can be used. Moreover, the method is easily scalable to tens of different markers, as exemplified by the data presented by using a 10-plex or a 25-plex SeqStain panel. Signal amplification, if necessary for markers expressed at low levels, can be done using a number of published techniques (Ali et al., 2014; Li et al., 2008; Mullis and Faloona, 1987) , which include increasing the number of fluorophores on the oligos, increasing the number of fluorescent oligos on the docking oligos, using different DNA structures (such as branched DNA [Collins et al., 1997] , origami folded plasmids [Jungmann et al., 2014] , or Fluorocubes [Niekamp et al., 2020] ), or pre-complexing primary antibodies with SeqStain Fabs and SeqStain secondary antibodies.",

We also show that such modifications do not affect their function in any way by testing in a variety of systems. To avoid cross-reactivity, pre-complexation of SeqStain Fabs or SeqStain secondary antibodies with primary antibodies can also be used during staining. This paves way to build a multiplex panel that combines SeqStain antibodies, SeqStain secondary antibodies, and SeqStain Fabs by opening up additional ways of staining tissues in multiplex analyses. Utilizing Fabs and secondary antibodies for SeqStain not only improves sensitivity of detection for markers expressed at low levels but also facilitates higher throughput by reducing the time it takes to prepare reagents for SeqStain. Furthermore, SeqStain is performed by using a simple perfusion setup with readily available components, which together forms an elegant staining platform. In fact, this setup transforms standard confocal microscopes into a multiplex imaging appliance which, when combined with a motorized stage, enables high-level data acquisition by this method.",

            "text": "SeqStain offers significant advantages over some of the other multiplex techniques that have recently been described in the literature, such as CODEX and ImmunoSABER. Unique, barcoded primers, each of different lengths that are attached to each antibody, are a key part of CODEX. Therefore, primer design, and keeping track of primers, barcodes, and primer pairs during iterative rendering becomes cumbersome. SeqStain does not require any complex primer design or barcodes for its application. Similarly, ImmunoSABER uses concatemer extension using the PER method for multiplexing. This requires a certain level of expertise and therefore cannot be readily employed. In contrast, our dsDNA design is very simple, allowing use of almost any sequence. Similarly, SeqStain has significant advantages in its simple de-staining step. CODEX uses TCEP to break the disulfide bonds for removing fluorophores attached to DNA, which could limit its applications and requires a reaction time of approximately 5-10 min. ImmunoSABER utilizes formamide treatment (50%) for 10 min followed by washes to destabilize the DNA duplex, which could also limit its applications to specific tissue types, whereas SeqStain does not have any such limitations. Additionally, de-staining in SeqStain is rapid, with almost complete removal of fluorescent signal within 1 min for most antigens. Such rapid de-staining also ensures that the integrity of nuclear DNA is preserved during the process. Moreover, SeqStain offers a simple solution for signal amplification, if needed, using SeqStain secondary antibodies and Fabs, whereas CODEX relies on tyramide signal-based amplification, which is incompatible for de-staining. Although ImmunoSABER offers signal amplification solutions, the PER method requires a certain level of expertise. Finally, unlike other methods, the SeqStain method utilizes publicly available and widely utilized image analysis programs such as Fiji (ImageJ) and CellProfiler for image registration, stacking, segmentation, and intensity measurements and for generating SRMs and cellular neighborhoods.",

We also note some of the limitations in our current study, although we did not observe any of these shortcomings in our research. First, unlike CODEX and ImmunoSABER, where all the antibodies are applied to the tissue in the first cycle, SeqStain requires repeated rounds of staining with cocktails of antibodies, which might result in an overall longer time period for a multiplex imaging experiment or difficulty staining some of the molecules in later cycles of staining, due to instability or loss of antigen. Second, the de-staining step for some of the intracellular compartments, such as the nucleus, requires longer incubation with the nucleases to provide the enzyme enough time to diffuse into such intracellular compartments. Third, the hybridization step required to generate fluorescent dsDNA requires heating and cooling steps that might result in chemical or thermal instability of some of the fluorophores, making such fluorophores inappropriate for this method. Finally, the data presented here primarily concern fresh frozen tissue sections, and it is likely that further optimization will be required to adapt the protocols to fixed tissues and other types of tissue sections, although we believe that the method is fully adaptable to these other types of tissues.

For the other channels in each round, the same transformation as the corresponding DAPI channel was applied with the Transform Virtual Stack Slices plugin in Fiji. To measure distances of various cell types from the B-cell cluster, a region of interest was selected, and the cluster was traced manually using the signal from the DAPI and B220 channels. Euclidean Distance Map to the boarder of the cluster was calculated with Fiji. To measure signal intensities of each channel, the nuclei were first segmented using the DAPI channel. Segmentation was performed using the StarDist plugin, which uses an already trained model for convolution neural network (DSB 2018 dataset) (Schmidt et al., 2018) . Once segmented, intensities for each channel were calculated on a per cell basis. Alongside, the EDM measurements for each segmented cell was calculated. In order to generate the plot profiles of the same markers from distinct rounds, first a stack of the corresponding images was generated. From the stack, a random region was cropped, and stack was converted to individual images. Plot profiles were calculated by drawing an arbitrary yellow line at the same position in both the images using Fiji. The overlay plots were generated using GraphPAD PRISM 9. To compute the signal to noise ratio for the immunofluorescence images, a region of interest (ROI) was defined using Fiji. The defined ROI was positioned in a region with positive staining to calculate the integrated density (signal), this was repeated for four more regions with positive staining and the average is shown. Subsequently, the defined ROI was positioned in a region without cell or tissue staining to calculate the integrated density (noise) and repeated for four additional times as before. Between the SeqStain and conventional immunofluorescence images for each set, the same ROI was used by utilizing the selection tool in Fiji.",
