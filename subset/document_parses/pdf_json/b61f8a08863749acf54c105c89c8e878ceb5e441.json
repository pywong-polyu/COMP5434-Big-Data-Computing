            "text": "Respiratory masks having similar standards of 'N95', defined by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, will be highly sought after, post the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, such a low-cost ($$1/mask) mask design having electrostatic rechargeability and filtration efficiency of >95% with a quality factor of $20 kPa \u00c01 is demonstrated. This filtration efficacy is for particles of size 300 nm. The tri-layer mask, named PPDFGO tri, contains nylon, modified polypropylene (PPY), and cotton nonwoven fabrics as three layers. The melt-spun PPY, available in a conventional N95 mask, modified with graphene oxide and polyvinylidene fluoride mixture containing paste using a simple solution casting method acts as active filtration layer. The efficacy of this tri-layer system toward triboelectric rechargeability using small mechanical agitations is demonstrated here. These triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)-assisted membranes have high electrostatic charge retention capacity ($1 nC/cm 2 after 5 days in ambient condition) and high rechargeability even in very humid conditions (>80% RH). A simple but robust permeability measurement set up is also constructed to test these TENG-based membranes, where a flow rate of 30-35 L/min is maintained during the testing. Such a simple modification to the existing mask designs enabling their rechargeability via external mechanical disturbances, with enhanced usability for single use as well as for reuse with decontantamination, will be highly beneficial in the realm of indispensable personal protective equipment.",

            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has made a significant impact on global health and economic conditions and its impacts on humanity will last for several years [1] . Social distancing, regular-interval sanitization and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the precautionary measures for human protection recommended by the World Health Organization. Facial respiratory mask is an integral part of any PPE [2] . In this scenario, various respiratory masks were proposed and designed by different research groups [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , apart from the well-established, commercially available masks such as 'N95' [3, 8] . Different easy to make do it yourself (DIY) masks are also proposed to protect respiratory systems from the direct virus attack, and such DIY masks of nonwoven fabrics of several layers are found to be efficient in stopping the particulate matter of size down to a few nanometers [4] [5] [6] 9] . The mechanism behind such masks is mainly based on size exclusion and inertial impaction [10] . The efficient working of such masks critically depends on the layering which would create a large pressure difference in space between the human nose and the external environment leading to breathing issues. Hence, an efficient filter against virus (size $0.120 lm, where the viral aerosols will be >$0.120 lm) [11] needs to be attained with minimum layers. It is recommended to use a less layered (3-4 layered with a pressure difference of 5-8 mbar) mask having better filter efficacy toward aerosols (<5 mm) and droplets (>5 mm) for prolonged usage as a PPE. Further, particles of smaller size (<1 mm, where a typical size of virus such as SARS-CoV-2 is found to be in the range of 0.05-1 mm) [12] can slowly diffuse through the nonwoven fabrics-based masks, even those with several layers. Masks are not only studied in terms of their filtration efficiency (E \u00bc 1 \u00c0 g aftermembrane \u00f0 \u00de g beforemembrane \u00f0 \u00de \u00c2 100, where g is the particle number density of a particular size), but also by quality factor, Q defined as \u00c0 loga DP where a is defined as 1 \u00c0 E=100 and DP is the difference in the pressure caused by the implementation of the mask. [6] Conventional respiratory masks, say N95, are mainly 4-5 layered systems having nonwoven fibers of polypropylene (PPY) as an active layer [13] . The electro-/melt-spun fibers of PPY are microporous structures and also may hold electrostatic charge gained via the process of development [14, 15] . Thus, along with the size-assisted filtration by the pore and inertial impaction, the electrostatic attraction-assisted filtration is also found to be occurring in PPY layers. Such masks have efficiency at the 95% level as respiratory masks to protect even from virus and bacteria [16] . But, it has been found that the charge on the PPY fabrics does not hold for more than 8 h upon exposure to the ambient conditions and hence, such masks drastically decrease in efficiency after such a short period [17] . Though by design, N95 masks are made for single use, in the present scenario of high demand and scarcity, there are efforts to reuse them [18] . With several methods being tried, a team of scientists has put together the techniques for decontamination and reuse of N95 masks based on experimental data and following the guidelines issued by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), USA [19] . There have also been attempts to recharge the N95 masks post decontamination for better filtration efficiency [8] . Masks made of rechargeable, reusable material have gained attention in the recent past and a few types of such chargeable mask are reported by different groups [3, 8, 20] . Further, a simple mechanical energy-assisted charge restoration post decontamination will be an ideal user-friendly solution for the next generation of economically viable masks affordable to all types of the socioeconomic classes of humanity.",

The amount of mechanically induced static charge among two systems will depend on their position in the triboelectric series [23] and further apart in position in this series, the pair of system works better as a triboelectric generator (higher charge and hence potential difference) [23] . Fluorinated polymers represent the highest electronegative systems in this series, and polymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon, PTFE) belong to this category. These materials have higher triboelectric negative charge generation capacity than PPY-based on their position in the triboelectric series [23] . Wang et al. have shown that self-powered electrostatic attraction-based separation-assisted face masks can be developed using PVDF-based nonwoven fabrics [24] . Popular textile materials such as nylon and silk represent positive triboelectric materials. Hence, the combination of such systems may constitute a novel triboelectric generator (TEG) and eventually will be useful in developing facial respiratory masks.",

Further, the oxygen functionalities in GO can ensure adhesion to the surface it is incorporated in and it is important in developing stable coating formulations, such as purification membranes or filters. Such a GO coating was found to be effective even in water purification, as discovered by one of the authors [27] where they have shown that GO coated silica sands can be used as efficient water filter systems that work even against metal ion impurities. Further, the high concentration [30 weight (wt)%] peroxide (hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2 ) assisted chemical development of GO makes it possible to disinfect the membranes using <10 wt% H 2 O 2 assisted disinfection, a popular method in practice toward the disinfections of membranes and other surfaces. The commercial availability of GO also makes it useful as an additive in the TEG for triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) [25] . Recent studies show that GO [28] and other graphene derivatives have high anti-bacterial activity [29] , along with other functional properties [29] , where those make them as ideal systems for respirator mask applications.",

It is suggested to use this as a modifier to the PPY nonwoven fabric backbone. Moreover, self-assembled GO membranes are proposed as efficient filtration membranes in different fields [30, 31] . Combining these ideas, we propose here a novel low-cost TENG-assisted mask design with conventional mask materials such as PPY nonwoven fabric, modified with optimum amount containing PVDF and GO mixture and nylon. A tri-layer mask is shown here for its efficacy toward small particle filtration (<0.5 mm) with triboelectric rechargeability, while having efficient permeation capacity to the air. The modified PPY fabrics have higher water contact angle (WCA) ensuring the efficient stopping capacity toward water droplets. The third layer will be cotton, a material positioned at the neutral point in the triboelectric series [23] , where it will be in contact with the body to ensure the comfortable wearability of the mask. The cost analyses also show the commercial applicability of these proposed rechargeable masks and the details are discussed in the later part of the article.",

Ambient air is leaked into the inlet chamber by a valve and pumped out at the exit valve in the outlet chamber. The membrane, with O-ring seals, functionally separates the inlet which is exposed to ambient conditions from the outlet, simulating conditions representing the environment and the respiratory system. BME280 sensors (pressure, humidity and temperature sensor from Bosch Sensortec) are placed on either chamber. Aerosols containing particles of nano to micron sizes are introduced using a nebulizer (Make: BPL Medical Technology, Model: N10) at the inlet side. A Sensirion SPS30 particle sensor was placed in the output chamber to measure the particle density of the aerosols that reach the outlet chamber through the separator.

The pressure on the downward side (outlet) of the membrane is monitored while the system is being pumped maintaining a flow rate of about 30-35 L/min. Figure 5d shows the pressure measured as function of time with various membranes. The first 30 s show the ambient pressure before the pump is started and as expected, the ambient pressure is the same as the atmospheric pressure when the pump is off. Once the pump is switched on, the pressure drops to a new equilibrium value determined by the flow rate and the membrane permeability. The pressure drop is larger for the tri-layer as compared to monolayer and also the PPDFGO has a larger pressure drop, but the drop is only about 2.5 mbar and would not cause any discomfort or breathlessness if used as a mask. The relative humidity (RH, %) difference between the down (outlet) and upstream (inlet) sides of the membrane is also monitored with and without flow and in the presence of aerosol particles for monolayer PPY, PPDFGO mono and trilayer, as shown in Fig. 5a-c. Here the initial times show readings of the sensors in the inlet and outlet side without any pumping/flow. This takes care of any differences in the ambient conditions of the two sensors. Once the flow is switched on, the RH% drops on either side of the system as moisture is removed by the pump. The blue shaded region in the plots (Fig. 5a-c) shows the response of the sensors to the introduction of the aerosol from the nebulizer which is basically water droplets containing particles (MoS 2 particulate matter of size <10 lm) of differing sizes. It is to be noted that the initial humidity of the chamber may vary with the extent of pumping. The RH% difference between the inlet and outlet increases as the membrane does not allow all the droplets to reach the outlet side of the test system. The RH% difference measured across each of the membranes studied is marked in the corresponding plot. Tri-layer shows the maximum difference in RH of 15%, thus the membrane not only filters particles, but also does not allow moisture to pass through. This is in tune with WCA measurements, as explained before, that PPDFGO has higher hydrophobicity than the PPY.",

The Q for the tri-layers is lower, but these are all still in the range of 20-40 kPa \u00c01 and fall well above the range of values of the common mask materials studied [4, 6] . The PPDFGO tri has a Q value of $20 kPa \u00c01 , indicating its suitability as a respiratory mask [33] . To further establish the role of the nanocomposite paint of GO and PVDF in PPY, PPY membranes modified with PVDF alone and GO alone are also prepared and named as PPDF mono and PPGO mono, respectively. It is found that though the filtration efficiencies of the PPDF mono and PPGO mono (complete coverage) are comparable to that of PPDFGO mono, their Q values are rather poor as compared to that of PPDFGO, Supplementary Fig. S5 .",

A charge of $2 nC/cm 2 is being generated on PPDFGO and the corresponding voltage is measured as $20 V. A simple mechanical agitation, such as hand-bending or sliding one over the other (nylon and PPDFGO mono), is found to be helping to recharge the tri-layer mask system (PPDFGO tri) and this surpasses other external recharging methods of N95 [8] , otherwise such masks are inefficient after a small period of exposure ($8 h).
