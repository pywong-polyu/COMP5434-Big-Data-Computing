This study assesses the content and engagement on psychiatry residency program Instagram accounts. Methods A full list of psychiatry programs was gathered from the American Medical Association Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA). FREIDA was used to collect demographic information about a program. Program Instagram accounts were reviewed and assessed for content, and engagement scores were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate regression was used to analyze the information collected from the Instagram accounts. Results There are 109 (42.9%) psychiatry residency programs with Instagram accounts; 99 (90.8%) accounts were opened in 2020. Analysis of the content of posts revealed posts with the following themes: 50.5% were departmental, 21.9% were social, 14.9% were other, 10.1% were academic and professional, and 2.6% were educational. Using multivariate regression, a higher total number of followers was correlated with the total number of accounts followed (p \u2264 0.001) and Instagram stories (p = 0.047) (R 2 = 0.579). Engagement score was correlated with a total number of followers (p \u2264 0.001), program size (p = 0.048), and whether an account was active (p = 0.003) (R 2 = 0.450). Conclusion Results demonstrate that 2020 led to an increase in the number of psychiatry residency program Instagram accounts and engagement with followers. Instagram provides a way to further promote a program, yet there is room for improvement to diversify the content.",

The content of Instagram posts was further evaluated according to the following themes of the posts: educational, departmental, academic and professional, social, and other. Educational posts informed followers about diseases, mental health, or the history of the field. Departmental posts focused on recruitment, including news and updates for the program, activities like meet-and-greets, or highlights of faculty and residents. Academic and professional posts were focused on research and academic conferences. Social posts showed residents outside of the hospital spending time together at non-work-related events. The posts categorized as \"other\" did not fit these categories. Other types of posting reviewed were Instagram Stories (highlights that disappear after 24 h but can be archived on a profile), Instagram Reels (15-s videos with audio, effects, and creative tools), and Instagram TV (videos between 15 s and 10 min). Program websites were also viewed to determine if they linked directly to their residency Instagram page.",

            "text": "Our study investigated the use of Instagram among psychiatry residency programs and described its trend, content, and engagement rate. Based upon our analyses, Instagram has increased in use by psychiatry residency programs since COVID-19, as the vast majority of programs formed their accounts after the announcement of virtual recruitment. As such, Instagram may act as a potential platform, or additional social media avenue, for psychiatry residency programs to recruit applicants. Program size was associated with the number of followers and engagement of a residency program Instagram account. Larger programs had more followers and a greater engagement score. Beyond simply program size leading to greater alumni networks, there are likely more residents to disperse the time-consuming tasks of managing and updating a page, which can lead to more engagement. Because engagement was found to be correlated with the number of account followers and the number of accounts a program follows, programs of all sizes are recommended to engage with more accounts to help increase their audience. While there is no information to objectively quantify a program's engagement with applicants, previous literature has suggested that having an active social media presence is an important aspect of a residency program because applicants value the additional information when determining whether to apply to or rank a program [14] .",

As departmental, social, and academic posts were correlated with more followers and higher engagement scores, creating more of these posts are opportunities for programs to grow their accounts.

In a survey of plastic surgery applicants, 89% were interested in educational content and 98% wanted to learn about resident life [9] . While educational material could help teach on mental health topics from pharmacology to coping skills, for psychiatry, these posts did not increase the total number of followers or engagement score for psychiatry programs.",
