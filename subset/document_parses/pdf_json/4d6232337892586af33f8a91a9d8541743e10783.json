Among 515 individuals with Covid-19 from Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) and the Korean Clonal Hematopoiesis (KoCH) consortia, we found that CH was associated with severe Covid-19 outcomes (OR=1.9, 95%=1.2-2.9, p=0.01). We further explored the relationship between CH and risk of other infections in 14,211 solid tumor patients at MSK. CH was significantly associated with risk of Clostridium Difficile (HR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.3, p=6x10 -3 ) and Streptococcus/Enterococcus infections (HR=1.5, 95% CI=1.1-2.1, p=5x10 -3 ). These findings suggest a relationship between CH and risk of severe infections that warrants further investigation.",

            "text": "Acquired mutations that lead to clonal expansion are common in the normal aging hematopoietic system (clonal hematopoiesis, or CH), yet are known to alter stem/progenitor and lymphoid function and response to environmental stressors, including systemic infections 5, 6, 9, 10 . The mutational events that drive CH overlap with known drivers of hematologic malignancies. However, the majority of mutations in CH appear to occur outside of canonical cancer driver genes 11, 12 . The impact of individual mutational events on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells differs by the nature of the genomic aberration. For example, chromosomal aneuploidies result in a predisposition for lymphoid fate specification and transformation 13, 14 while point mutations in DNMT3A result in increased myeloid differentiation 6, 15 . Heterogeneity also exists across CH phenotypes by driver gene in regards to its impact on inflammatory signaling 6 . For example, mutations in TET2 result in heightened secretion of several cytokines including IL-1\u03b2/IL-6 signaling that may partially explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease 5, 9, 16 . Moreover, systemic infections and the resultant inflammatory signals can lead to increased clonal fitness of TET2 mutant cells and clonal expansion 10, 17, 18 .",

In a large cancer patient cohort, CH is also associated with other severe infections, namely Streptococcus/Enterococccus and Clostridium difficile infections. Our exploratory analysis suggests that the relationship between CH and Covid-19 and CH and Clostridium difficile infection may be partly driven by non-driver CH. Clonal expansions characterized by non-driver mutational events could be facilitated by multiple mechanisms. Many classes of genetic alterations, such as copy number events (CNVs), structural variants, non-coding, and epigenetic changes, are not detectable using the targeted panels included in this study. As such, the observed events that are highly enriched in CH could be 'passenger' mutations that co-occur with a positively selected, undetected 'driver' mutation such as recurrent CNVs. 12, 13 Alternatively, driver mutations may have been incompletely classified as \"non-driver\" events using our methodology. However, cancer driver genes tend to recur in multiple patients, and the majority of witnessed non-driver mutated genes in our cohort were non-recurrent suggesting that clonal expansion, and not the specific event driving clonal expansion, may be associated with Covid-19 disease severity. This will need to be further studied in larger cohorts. All rights reserved.

A substantial body of evidence now links somatic alterations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to a variety of health outcomes, with inflammation emerging as a key mediator. [2] [3] [4] [5] [10] [11] [12] [13] Our data, along with results in the accompanying manuscript by Zekavat et al., demonstrate a similar association between CH and increased infection severity. This association may be due to residual confounding by variables that are unknown and unaccounted for in our models. Alternatively, this could represent a novel pathophysiology that links CH-induced changes in hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and lymphoid cell function with immune regulation and infection response. Future investigation including functional studies will be important to clarify the mechanisms underlying the association between CH and infection risk and to develop potential interventional strategies to attenuate inflammation, clonal expansion, and infectious sequelae in patients with and without cancer.",

The sequencing test utilizes genomic DNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue as well as matched patient blood samples.

MSK-IMPACT contains most of the commonly reported CH genes with the exception that earlier versions of the panel did not contain PPM1D or SRSF2.Pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 2x100bp paired-end reads. Sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using BWA (0.7.5a).
