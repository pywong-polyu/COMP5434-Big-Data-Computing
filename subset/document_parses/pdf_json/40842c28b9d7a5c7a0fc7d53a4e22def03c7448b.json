            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading around the globe since December 2019. There is an urgent need to develop sensitive and online methods for on-site diagnosing and monitoring of suspected COVID-19 patients. With the huge development of Internet of Things (IoT), the impact of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) provides an impressive solution to this problem. In this paper, we proposed a 5G-enabled fluorescence sensor for quantitative detection of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 by using mesoporous silica encapsulated up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs@mSiO 2 ) labeled lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). The sensor can detect spike protein (SP) with a detection of limit (LOD) 1.6 ng/mL and nucleocapsid protein (NP) with an LOD of 2.2 ng/mL. The feasibility of the sensor in clinical use was further demonstrated by utilizing virus culture as real clinical samples. Moreover, the proposed fluorescence sensor is IoMT enabled, which is accessible to edge hardware devices (personal computers, 5G smartphones, IPTV, etc.) through Bluetooth. Medical data can be transmitted to the fog layer of the network and 5G cloud server with ultra-low latency and high reliably for edge computing and big data analysis. Furthermore, a COVID-19 monitoring module working with the proposed the system is developed on a smartphone application (App), which endows patients and their families to record their medical data and daily conditions remotely, releasing the burdens of going to central hospitals. We believe that the proposed system will be highly practical in the future treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and other mass infectious diseases.",

In February 2020, the World Health Organization named the coronavirus-infected pneumonia \"COVID-19\" , and up till now, this pneumonia has affected more than 200 countries and 30 million people. Coronavirus (CoV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a diameter of 80-120 nm, which can cause a variety of acute and chronic diseases. Before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, six CoV strains have been confirmed to infect humans (Velavan and Meyer, 2020; Chiolero, 2020) . Among them, Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused severe acute respiratory diseases worldwide (Cheng et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2015) . SARS-CoV-2 discovered this time is a novel coronavirus and considered to be the seventh coronavirus that can infect humans. It enters the human cell by recognizing the corresponding receptor on the target cell through the spike protein (SP) on its surface and replicates and synthesizes new virus inside the cell to cause infection (Hoffmannet al., 2020) . The most common symptoms of an infected person are fever, dry cough, and muscle pain. A small number of SARS-CoV-2 patients have intestinal signs and symptoms (such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) (Chenet al., 2020) .",

            "text": "To diagnose suspected patients of COVID-19, the routinely used medical methods include chest CT scan, molecular diagnosis and immunological detection technology Won et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020a; Xiang et al., 2020) . A chest CT scan uses a series of X-ray images taken from the chest and create a cross-sectional image of the lungs by computer processing to reflect radiologic features. However, this method requires bulky medical equipment, which can only be used in central hospitals (Cui and Zhou, 2019) . Molecular diagnosis includes gene sequencing technology, reverse transcription real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Won et al., 2019) , digital PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology (Yu et al., 2020) , etc. They identify or amplify nucleic acid molecules of SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples, and apply specific tracers, such as fluorescent particles, in the reaction process to realize quantitative diagnosis. Although these approaches are accurate and sensitive, the time-consuming and difficult operation of RNA extraction makes each test costly. Immunological detection techniques mainly include chemiluminescence, electrochemcial method (Mavrikou et al., 2020) , enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) (Li et al., 2020a; Xiang et al., 2020) . Among them, LFIA shows great superiority in point-of-care tests of SARS-CoV-2 because it needs no professional operation and has rapid detection speed (Huang et al., 2020b) . Traditional LFIA suffers from low sensitivity since colloidal gold is routinely served as the label. When the analyte concentration drops to a certain level low, the red color appeared on the test strip cannot be distinguished by the naked eyes, which can be detrimental to the limit of detection (LOD) (Guo et al., 2021) . Grant et al. (2020) demonstrate a half-strip LFIA for the semi-quantitative detection of nucleocapsid antigen of SARS-CoV-2. In their work, an LOD of 0.65 ng/mL with recombinant antigen was achieved with the use of an optical reader. However, most of the LFIAs are usually performed off-line, which may impede real-time and effective monitoring of the patient's condition. Thus, it is critical to develop sensitive and smart detection methods of SARS-CoV-2 to release the burden on diagnosing COVID-19 and promote intelligent monitoring of suspected patients at remote place.",

Evolved from the Internet of Things (IoT), IoMT focuses on medical applications in IoT and stands for a platform for interconnection of medical-grade devices and their integration to health networks (Catarinucciet al., 2015; Qadri et al., 2020) . With the advancing of the fifth generation (5G) networks, and edge computing (Pan and McElhannon, 2018) , varieties of medial sensors have reliable and massive connection to hospital systems or personal mobile devices due to the strategies of Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) and Ultra-reliable and Low-latency Communications (uRLLC), which further boosts IoMT growth (Sachset al., 2019; Ji et al., 2018; Kapassa, 2019) . As shown in Fig. 1 , these medical sensors located in the perception layer can monitor and receive patient information through physical signals such as light, electricity, pressure, temperature, etc., and transmit it to the edge and fog layer through wireless communication (such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.) with ultra-low latency and high reliability, and finally reach the cloud layer, providing hospitals and other medical institutions with the latest medical conditions. On the one hand, IoMT based smart medical system can maximize the limited medical and human resources of the hospital, and facilitate patients to obtain faster and more convenient medical services. On the other hand, the integration of mass medical data are essential to prevention and prediction of pandemics that may occur in the future. Furthermore, suspected patients can be kept informed of their health status and monitored effectively with the use of IoMT based sensors. They can stay up to date on critical health information by conducting remote consultations with specialist doctors (Guoet al., 1109) .",

A paperbased lateral flow assay using up-converting nanoparticles with mesoporous silica encapsulated nano-shell structure (UCNPs@mSiO 2 ) as fluorescence labels is developed to quantitatively detect SP and Nucleocapsid Protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2. UCNPs are a kind of rare-earthdoped luminescent nanomaterials which can convert near-infrared (NIR) excitation into visible light. Compared with other traditional nanoprobes, such as colloidal gold or quantum dots, UCNPs have unique advantages of low toxicity, anti-Stokes shifts, narrow emission spectrum, and not being interfered by biological autofluorescence (Guo et al., 2021) . By encapsulating with mesoporous silica as shell outside, UCNPs@mSiO 2 show great water solubility, good biocompatibility and stability, which prove to be an excellent candidate for biological probe in LFIA. SP is the membrane surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 and is an important site of action for host-neutralizing antibodies. It is also a key target for vaccine design. NP is a significant structural protein of SARS-CoV-2, which plays a critical role in the process of virus packaging, replication and protein translation. The measurement of NP has a high diagnostic value for suspected patients before the antibody appears and shortens the window period of serological diagnosis (Li et al., 2020b) . Thus, by detecting the SP and NP content in the patient's respiratory tract specimens, early diagnosis of COVID-19 can be achieved. The proposed system is designed to read the test strip in 10 min and can connect to edge hardware devices (personal computers, smartphones, IPTV, etc.) and fog layer of the network to perform reliable data transmission with low latency and high security. Through the gateway devices and fog servers, the medical data are finally transmitted to the cloud for big data storage and analysis, which benefits for disease control and medical statistics. Furthermore, a COVID-19 monitoring module working with the proposed the system is developed on a smartphone application (App), which endows patients and their families to record their real-time medical data and daily conditions remotely, releasing the burdens of going to central hospitals.",

UCNP is a kind of rare-earth-elements-doped nanomaterial which will illuminate under near-infrared excitation. Because SP and NP both have more than two antigenic sites, we use sandwich format of LFIA in the experiment. The detection theory is illustrated in Fig. 2a . A paper-based disposable strip is used to detect extracted SARS-CoV-2 SP and NP based on the principle of antibody-antigen specific binding. Two test lines (TLs) are drawn on the nitrocellulose (NC) membrane with antibodies of SP (for TL1) and antibodies of NP (for TL2) of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. A control line (CL) is drawn on the same membrane with goat anti-mouse IgG solution by using a scribe instrument. Fluorescent labels, UCNPs@mSiO 2 , are initially conjugated with monoclonal antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 and then evenly dispensed on the conjugate pad with XYZ three-dimensional dispenser in a concentration of 2.2 mg/mL. When a SARS-CoV-2 positive sample (contained SARS-CoV-2 SPs or NPs) is applied, the target proteins will initially bind to the UCNPs@mSiO2 labels and then be captured by the TLs, forming the sandwich complex of antibody-protein-antibody. As a result, the fluorescent signal appears on the TLs, whose intensity is positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 concentration. Because antibodies on the UCNPs is murine, goat anti-mouse IgG on the CL can always capture the UCNP labels. Thus, fluorescence on the CL is stable and can be used to decide whether test strip is valid.",

It is composed of a focusing lens, a 980 nm wavelength optical filter, a light emitting diode (LED) module with 980 nm wavelength, a motor driver, a high-speed camera, a Bluetooth model, and a micro controller unit (MCU) preembedded with control and processing modules. The sensor can be connected with computers or smartphones through Bluetooth. A certain software integrated with COVID-19 detection function is used for start the measurement. After confirming the right position of the inserted test strip, the control module of the system will automatically start the motor driver to move the test strip forward and backward. During the round trip of the test strip, the LED constantly emits 980 nm near-infrared laser on the surface of the test strip, whose light spot is shaped into a rectangular focal line of 3 mm \u00d7 1 mm due to a front cylindrical lens, to excite UCNPs on the TLs and CL. This whole process is recorded by the high-speed camera which is placed on the top of a filter. The images captured by the camera are segmented into a size of 75 \u00d7 25 pixels according to the identified fluorescence signal windows and then grayed out and de-contextualized by the data processing module. Each obtained frame is traversed pixel by pixel, and the fluorescence intensity of each frame is determined by averaging the sum of gray values of each pixel. As a result, several signal peaks will appear in the TL and CL areas during the movement of the test strip. When the measurement ends, a raw data curve is drawn in the dialog box and is subsequently processed by a smoothing algorithm and a noise filtering algorithm. Eventually, we integrate the effective area below each peak to obtain the fluorescence intensities on TLs and CL and calculate T1/C and T2/C by making ratios. The obtained T/C value is used to determine the analyte concentration because they are positively correlated. The proposed fluorescence sensor is accessible to edge hardware devices (personal computers, smartphones, etc.) through Bluetooth, and can transmit the medical data to fog servers and central cloud servers for edge computing and big data storage. Based on 5G small cells and macro base stations, medical facilities such as local hospitals can have rapid and reliable access to these critical data. To provide real-time proactive prognosis with suspected patients, an App with COVID-19 monitoring module which works with the fluorescence sensor is developed on a smartphone. For the purpose of proactive health management, in this study, fuzzy logic and deep learning algorithms has embedded into the system. According to the preestablished knowledge base of historical data and the newly delivered test data, the system can draw accurate conclusions on positive or negative detection results with the principle of maximum degree of membership after confirming the user's personal information. Since the security of patient-generated data is paramount, we are looking forward to employ complete cryptographic techniques to guarantee the privacy security during data transmission (Tiwari et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "The proposed fluorescence sensor is capable of realizing quantitative detection of SP and NP of SARS-CoV-2 based on UCNPs labeled lateral flow strips and can be promisingly used for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from patient's nasopharyngeal samples. The detection time lasts 10 min in total, which is much shorter than that of nucleic acid detection (last for hours), benefiting much for the rapid point-of-care diagnosis. To verify its feasibility, we purchased recombinant SP and NP of SARS-CoV-2 from Acro Biosystems (Beijing, China) and obtained virus culture of SARS-CoV-2 from local hospitals to conduct a comparative experiment. We initially tested the sensor with standard solutions containing different concentrations of recombinant SP and NP. As is shown in Fig. 4a and b , a well-established linear relationship existed between the concentrations of recombinant proteins and the fluorescence intensity. The insets in Fig. 4a and b are the fluorescence intensity curve drawn in the sensor at the LODs of the SP concentration (1.6 ng/ mL) and NP concentration (2.2 ng/mL). For both recombinant proteins, the fluorescence intensity on TLs increases with the increase of SP and NP concentrations. When the concentration reaches 200 ng/mL, the fluorescence intensity becomes saturated, indicating that upper limit of detection is reached. Moreover, no crossover occurred between SP and NP detection. For recombinant SP, we reach a quantitative range from 2 ng/mL-200 ng/mL with an LOD of 1.6 ng/mL. As for recombinant NP, an LOD of 2.2 ng/mL is achieved and the detection range is from 2.2 ng/ mL-200 ng/mL. We obtained the above LODs by setting a threshold above background noise. Only if the calculated T/C value is 0.3 values above the noise baseline is the signal considered valid. We applied a refined concentration gradient of analytes for testing, and it was discovered that when the analyte concentration went below the stated LODs, the fluorescence on the TLs became so faint that was drowned out by background noise (interfering fluorescence on the test strip), leading to extremely low T/C value, which could not be considered as valid. The difference in the limit of detection between two kinds of proteins is probably caused by the difference in their amino acid sequence and the different expression and renaturation in the process of recombination, which eventually leads to unequal binding ability to the antibody. It is also worthy to note that, because the murine antibodies can always bind to the goat anti-mouse IgG, the fluorescence intensity on the CL remains stable once the test strip is valid. Therefore, T/C value is used to reduce errors of test results. Compared with other LFIA reports on antigen detection, this system exhibits superiority in quantitative detection and short time consumption (Shown in Table 1 ).",

            "text": "We further tested the virus culture of SARS-CoV-2 to verify the feasibility of the sensor of detecting real samples. Inactivated virus with a concentration of 50,000 copies/mL was obtained from a P2 laboratory in Chongqing, China. In order to cleave the cell membrane so that the NP can be exposed to the outside, we used cell lysis buffer (composed of 32.9 mmol/L K 2 HPO 4, 136.9 mmol/L NaCl, 5 g/L Casein-Na, 0.1% S9 and 0.02% NaN 3, pH = 7.4) to dilute the virus sample. In dilution process, the buffer was initially mixed well with the virus sample under ambient temperature, and the obtained solution was then settled for 3 min in a centrifuge tube. After repeating the above process, a set of virus solution with concentration gradients (ranges from 1000 copies/mL to 10,000 copies/mL) was obtained. To conduct the experiment, we applied 90 \u03bcL of each well-mixed solution to the test strip for 10 min and used the proposed fluorescence senor to test the results. As is shown in Fig. 4c and d, the sensor provided two TL values of detection, representing the concentration of SP (T1) and NP (T2), respectively, and we calculated (T1+T2)/2C value to reflect the virus concentration. As a result, the newly calculated curve follows a positive linear relationship with the virus concentration. Moreover, when a negative sample is applied (containing only cell lysis buffer) to the tests strip, there are no signals detected on TLs, proving that the proposed sensor has high accuracy, which holds great potential in the medical market of diagnosing suspected COVID-19 patients. It is worth mentioning that the slope of the detection line gradually decreases as the detection concentration increases. This is mainly because the antigen-antibody binding efficiency follows an S-shaped curve (Russell et al., 1989) . Excessive SARS-CoV-2 antigen contained in the sample liquid will eventually reduce its binding efficiency with the antibodies immobilized on the conjugate pad and test lines, thus resulting in a slowdown in the growth rate of the light signal intensity.",

            "text": "To address the stability of the proposed fluorescence sensor, we conducted three sets of repeated experiments by using different concentrations of virus culture fluid from low (1500 copies/mL) to high (8000 copies/mL). Each set of fluid sample was measured 20 times separately, and we calculated the average value, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV %) of each set to demonstrate the reproducibility and stability. From Table 2 we can observe that, irrespective of the analyte concentration, the result data in a same set of test fluctuates little around the average and the CV% is under 7%, indicating that the system has good stability and reproducibility in a wide range. It can be observed that the system CV% under low antigen concentration performs better than that under high antigen concentration. This is due to the nature of the binding efficiency between antibody and antigen commented above. The result proves that when the virus concentration exceeds 10,000 copies/mL, the fluorescence intensity on TL1 and TL2 will change irregularly, making it hard for quantification. However, instability in this case is acceptable because the proposed fluorescence sensor is designed for early diagnosis and proactive prognosis of suspected COVID-19 patients. On the one hand, people in real life without obvious abnormalities (such as fever, severe cough) are almost impossible to reach such a high virus concentration in the body. On the other hand, if one's SARS-CoV-2 test result is found to be slightly higher than the normal value, intervention from hospital or medical institution is required with no delay. Thus, the detection sensitivity and stability at low virus concentrations should be the key factors of this sensor to focus on.",

In order to guarantee the privacy security of patients and to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) of the system, we are looking forward to employ reliable transmission protocols and well-established encryption algorithms in data transmission and storage. In this study, we also develop a COVID-19 monitoring module on a smartphone App that works with the proposed sensor to realize online detection and monitoring of suspected COVID-19 patients. As is shown in Fig. 5 , the sample solution extracted from the patient's nasopharyngeal swab is applied to the sensor, and the sensor's data storage module and 5G networking module enable biomedical information to be processed and sent out instantly. Users first log in to the module to create a personal nominee account. After performing point-of-care tests of SARS-CoV-2, they have the option of manually or automatically transferring the results to the recording log. These recordings can be dynamically and timely collected by the hospital systems due to the advancing of IoMT. Once the hospital system detects the anomaly, doctors or experts can make a quick and accurate response by generating remote consolation or face-to-face medical help. Moreover, due to the positioning function of the module, hospitals are able to rapidly locate the COVID-19 suspected patient's geographic location as soon as the positive report is uploaded. In this manner, the hospital can notify the relevant authorities to quickly screen and isolate vulnerable areas, significantly mitigating the risk and means of virus spread. Furthermore, to enable two-way monitoring, the system is endowed with functions of intelligent decision. Sudden abnormal events such as sudden server illness must reach the destination node before the deadline; otherwise, the patient's life will be threatened. Therefore, we embedded fuzzy logic and deep learning algorithms into the system to make it event-driven. Based on this method, the system can intelligently identify the urgency of the current situation according to the established data base.
