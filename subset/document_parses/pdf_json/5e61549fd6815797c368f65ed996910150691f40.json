            "text": "Confronted with an emerging infectious disease at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community faced concerns regarding the safety of autopsies on those who died of the disease. This attitude has changed, and autopsies are now recognized as indispensable tools for understanding COVID-19, but the true risk of infection to autopsy staff is nevertheless still debated. To clarify the rate of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs were taken at nine points in the PPE of one physician and one assistant after each of 11 full autopsies performed at four centers. Swabs were also obtained from three minimally invasive autopsies (MIAs) conducted at a fifth center. Lung/bronchus swabs of the deceased served as positive controls, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR. In 9 of 11 full autopsies, PPE samples tested RNA positive through PCR, accounting for 41 of the 198 PPE samples taken (21%). The main contaminated items of the PPE were gloves (64% positive), aprons (50% positive), and the tops of shoes (36% positive) while the fronts of safety goggles, for example, were positive in only 4.5% of the samples, and all the face masks were negative. In MIAs, viral RNA was observed in one sample from a glove but not in other swabs. Infectious virus isolation in cell culture was performed on RNA-positive swabs from the full autopsies. Of all the RNA-positive PPE samples, 21% of the glove samples, taken in 3 of 11 full autopsies, tested positive for infectious virus. In conclusion, PPE was contaminated with viral RNA in 82% of autopsies. In 27% of autopsies, PPE was found to be contaminated even with infectious virus, representing a potential risk of infection to autopsy staff. Adequate PPE and hygiene measures, including appropriate waste deposition, are therefore essential to ensure a safe work environment.",

Viral pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is the most frequent cause of death in fatal cases of COVID-19. Beyond the dramatic changes in the lungs, the effect on multiple other organs is currently interpreted mainly as a systemic inflammatory reaction. Several authors have described endothelial impairment with consecutive activation of the coagulatory system [2, 5, 13, 20, 22, 26] .",

The swabbed areas were not cleaned or disinfected before swabbing except in the case of autopsy no. 1, in which the gloves (but no other items) were cleaned with disinfectant wipes (Schuelke Safe & Easy Bagless) before swabbing. Finally, the tips were placed in the transport container. (Fig. 1 shows the swab locations.) Two swabs per location were taken next to each other, one for RT-PCR testing and one to test virus infectivity (virus isolation). In all the full autopsies, swabs were performed on the PPE of the autopsy-conducting physician and one autopsy assistant after the autopsy's completion. (For an overview of the number of samples taken, see Supplementary Table 2 .) The samples for RT-PCR testing were stored in refrigerators at 4 \u00b0C while swabs intended for eventual isolation of the infectious virus were frozen at \u2212 80 \u00b0C.

In only 2 of 11 full autopsies, neither the physician's nor the assistant's PPE was contaminated. Notably, in one of those two autopsies, the gloves were wiped with disinfectant at the end of the autopsy before the swabs were taken. This clearly affects the result of the glove samples in this autopsy, but an impact is unlikely at the other locations, as the disinfection took place at the very end of the autopsy. Pomara et al. report a considerably lower positivity rate of 5 of 16 autopsies (15.6% of 32 PPE samples taken) [18] , but they evaluated only face shields. In our study, the front of safety goggles was contaminated in only a single case, resulting in an even lower positivity rate (1/22 goggle samples; 4.5%) than that of Pomara et al. while gloves (64%), aprons (50%), and shoes (tops: 36%; soles: 27%) were frequently positive. The distribution of the contaminated PPE items indicates that intensive mechanical contact is a cause of contamination. As expected, samples from the gloves tested positive most often, followed by swabs from the apron. Handling the cadavers and organs makes it difficult to avoid any contact, simply because the examiner's distance from the specimen is necessarily minimal. The virus-contaminated material, very likely from gloves and aprons, reaches the shoes and floor, from which the shoe soles are also contaminated. This spatial sequence is supported by a stepwise increase in the Ct values, denoting a decreasing viral RNA load (Fig. 2D ). Due to the design of our study, we cannot draw conclusions regarding a possible additional contribution from aerosols, but all the samples from the FFP masks, the sides of safety goggles, and the backs of protective clothing tested negative for viral RNA, suggesting that aerosols are unlikely to be a relevant contamination source in the autopsy setting. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the viral RNA may be less stable on those surfaces. Nonetheless, direct touch and splash represent the main threats of viral material transmission. This direct transmission is likely to be independent of the type of pathogen, substantiating the necessity of proper PPE and hygiene measures, including waste disposal during and after autopsies.",

Remarkably, even though all the samples were shipped on dry ice by an experienced courier service, none of the negative samples came from HH, where the samples could be shipped in house.

Gloves (64%), aprons (50%), and shoes (36%) showed the highest frequency of RNA contamination. Infectious virus was isolated from 21% of the RNA-positive glove samples (3/11 full autopsies).",

Together with hygiene measures, including appropriate waste disposal, PPE enables the safe performance of COVID-19 autopsies, which are essential for a better understanding of the disease. Pathologists investigating future infectious diseases are advised to select appropriate PPE and hygienic measures as a basis for conducting autopsies as an important source of new knowledge.",
