The general assumption is that codon biases reflect a balance between mutational biases and natural selection. Today we understand that the codon content is related and can affect all gene expression steps. Starting from the 1980s, codon-based indices have been used for answering different questions in all biomedical fields, including systems biology, agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology. In general, codon usage bias indices weigh each codon or a small set of codons to estimate the fitting of a certain coding sequence to a certain phenomenon (e.g., bias in codons, adaptation to the tRNA pool, frequencies of certain codons, transcription elongation speed, etc.) and are usually easy to implement.",

Specifically, the selection can be related to frameshifting and various central intracellular phenomena such as transcription, translation, mRNA stability, RNA and DNA methylation, co-translational folding, splicing, transport, and more (see review in [5] [6] [7] ). Thus, techniques for analyzing codon distribution have been used in recent years for many objectives, including studying the evolution of transcripts [8, 9] , the biophysics of translation (i.e., the molecular mechanism of translation and its dynamics: e.g., ribosomal movement, tRNA diffusion, etc.) and other gene expression steps [10] . Such techniques also have been used in biotechnology [11] , for investigating phenotypic patterns from viruses to bacteria [12, 13] , and for studying human diseases [14] [15] [16] [17] . A CUB index is a term that describes a measure with a numerical value that aims to have biological meaning (e.g., related to selection or gene expression aspects), and it is based on the codon composition of a gene.",

The Effective number of codons (ENC) [27] is computed similarly to the computation of effective population size in population genetics, aiming to provide the extent of codon preference in a gene while considering amino acid degeneracy levels. In a basic manner, the ENC estimates the total number of different codons used in a sequence. The Intrinsic codon bias index (ICDI) [28] is inspired by both the RSCU and the ENC. It gives a value between 0 (equal usage of all codons, i.e., no bias) and 1 (one codon per amino acid, i.e., extremely high bias) to each gene. According to Arif Uddin [25] , a value greater than 0.5 indicates high bias, whereas a value lowers than 0.3 means little bias. Shields et al. suggested an index which is based on the chi-squared (v 2 ) test, and it is called the 'scaled' v 2 [29] ; the v 2 is defined as the deviation from equal usage of a codon within the synonymous group normalized by the total appearances of the codon (excluding AA with one codon).",

Nevertheless, as the indices described in this section check how much the codons of a gene(s) fits the tRNA pool, they can be implemented and yield biological conclusions on any gene in any organism even if there is no strong global correlation between CUB and tRNA levels in that organism. Beyond this relation between codon composition and translation speed lies a more complex set of phenomena that link codon usage and tRNA abundance to various aspects of translation regulation. Translation regulation is affected by tRNA modifications, codons order, codons usage with rare cognate tRNAs, rRNA-mRNA interactions, wobble interactions, mRNA folding, and more [40, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .

These indices capture complex signals that are partially affected and affect codons. A change in the codon composition can affect the such long patens and these pattern induces a selection pressure on codon composition. We thus believe that the notion of codon-based index should Designed to account for background nucleotide composition and can also be adapted to correct for di-nucleotide biases.

For example, under the assumption that evolution shapes coding sequences to improve gene expression regulation, if a gene shares longer sequence blocks with the rest of the genome, it is possibly more optimized and more highly expressed. The ChimeraARS [57] index (average repetitive substring) is based on the coding region's tendency to include long substrings that appear in other coding sequences and assume to be regulatory regions. If the coding region has more such longer common substrings (which are usually longer than three nucleotides, i.e., a codon) with other coding sequences, the ChimeraARS score is higher. It is known that some regulatory signals are expected to appear in specific regions of the coding region (e.g., at the beginning or the end). The Chimer-aUGEM [58] index aims at capturing this aspect by considering both the size of the commonly detected substring and its location within host genes. The input to these two indices can be based on an alphabet of codons (and in this case, the substrings have lengths in multiples of 3) or nucleotides (in this case, the lengths are not in multiples of 3). We believe that alphabet of nucleotites is also relevant since these patterns are partially encoded by codon usage.",

Additional codon pairs bias index is the codon pair score (CPS) [60] . The CPS is defined as the observed ratio's natural logarithm over the expected number of occurrences of a particular codon pair in all protein-coding sequences of a species. A negative CPS value means that a specific codon pair is underrepresented, whereas a positive CPS value indicates that a particular codon pair is overrepresented. Codon pairs that are equally under or overrepresented have a CPS equidistant from 0. From the CPS, a gene score of codon pair bias can be calculated by the average of the CPSs of all codon pairs in the gene [61] .",

For example, the mean typical decoding rate (MTDR) [64] is an index that aims at inferring the typical decoding rates of codons composing a certain coding region based on ribosome profiling data [63] . The index assumes that the normalized read count distribution of each codon is related to a sum of two random variables: normal (related to the typical decoding rates; where the mean of the distribution is the typical decoding rate of the codon) and exponential distributions (which is related to traffic jams and extreme biases in the experiment protocol). The parameters of these distributions are fitted to each codon separately based on the maximum likelihood approach. The MTDR of a gene is defined as the geometric mean of its codons' typical decoding rates. Gardin et al. [65] developed a similar index of codon decoding time called 'Ribosome Residence Time' (RRT) based on a different statistical approach (average of the relative frequency distributions). Another study by Cohen et al. [66] used Native elongating transcript sequencing (Net-seq data) [67] (a procedure for capturing nascent RNA transcripts directly from live cells, Fig. 3B ) to estimate the typical transcription elongation rate of the RNA polymerase related to nucleotide 5-mers, which is then used for estimating the mean transcription elongation rate of a transcript. The mean typical transcription elongation rate (MTTR) is computed per gene based on the geometric mean of the reciprocals of all its k-mer scores.",

From our analysis, indices that consider more biophysical aspects of translation (tRNA copy number, i.e., tAI), complex patterns (Chi-meraARS), and uses experimental data (Ribosome profiling data, i.e., MTDR) tend to have higher correlation with PA; however, there are outliers such as the nTE. Using a reference set (highly expressed genes, according to PA) also improves the correlation with PA (CEC, CAI, FOP). Previous researches had found similar correlations and results [21, 71, 72] . It is important to mention that different indices are based on measurements (mRNA levels, tRNA copy number, and more). Therefore, these measurements and their quality can influence the index value and can by itself induce differences among the computed indices even though the indices are from the same type. Furthermore, for most of the analyzed indices, the correlations obtained for the Human genome were relatively lower (Fig. 4E) . Possible explanations for these results include: 1) The fact that the effective population size of humans is lower than in the case of the unicellular organisms, and this results in lower evolutionary pressure and less optimal codon usage. 2) In multicellular organisms gene expression regulation is more complex and encoded in complex patterns in the coding region longer than single codes. Indeed, the ChimeraARS, which can capture longer patterns, performed relatively well both in the case of unicellular organisms and in the case of the human genome.",

When comparing the correlation between different indices, we can see from our analysis of a small number of indices that typically indices from the same type correlate better in all analyzed organisms. Moreover, most correlations are positive since the indices' values are in the same direction and trend for most genes. A negative correlation can be seen between all indices and ENC. The negative correlation results from the index's calculation method; in all indices, a higher value indicates higher bias or higher adaptation. In the ENC index, a higher value indicates lower bias. Additional negative correlations can result from the different aspects that the different indices capture, for example, codon expected distribution, biophysical aspect, and more. Interestingly, the indices' pairs with the highest correlation were identical in all the analyzed organisms (the indices with the highest correlation are FOP and CBI).

They tend to be more tightly regulated, and they specifically tend to have a more efficient translation, which is captured by various types of indices. Therefore, we believe that developing indices to quantify the extent of codon bias can help understand different regulatory motifs and even predict gene expression when experimental data is not available.

When choosing an index, it is useful to understand the available data; for more known organisms, indices that use additional information can be used or even indices based on experimental data. For less known organisms, indices that are based solely on the genome are preferred. Moreover, there is a need to understand which aspect of gene expression is important to capture.

Therefore, when creating new indices, creating a published tool can enhance the usage in the index. There are available software or online tools for different indices [31, 75, 79, 97] .

However, this is a non-trivial mission as the aim of the indices reported in this review in many cases is not only to estimate the non-uniform usage of codons. As mentioned, they are used, among others, to predict various aspects of gene expression, to capture specific patterns in the coding regions, and for various additional objectives. Thus, developing a good framework for such an evaluation is challenging and should consider all the different CUB indices' usages.
