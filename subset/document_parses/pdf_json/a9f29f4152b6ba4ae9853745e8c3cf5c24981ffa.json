However, cross-reactivity among flaviviruses (such as RBV, TABV, SLEV) in different complexes is frequently observed with HIA test especially in sequential flaviviral infections (Casals, 1957) . To positively identify the causative virus(es), a wider panel of HIA antigens including other flavi-and alphaviruses previously detected in this region (i.e. Dengue, Rocio, Cacipacore, Iguape, VEEV IIIA (Mucambo), Una and Mayaro viruses) or plaque reduction neutralization tests would be necessary. Unfortunately, the small volumes of sera available did not allow for this. PCR might also be used to detect viral RNA but as arboviral infections are generally transient, the chance of the sera collected being viremic is extremely low. Enzyme-linked immunoassays and hemagglutination inhibition (HIA) test, among others, are classical tests that lack specificity and have inherent problems in interpretation, in areas that are hyperendemic for flaviviruses. Testing by these methods may result in broad cross-reactions and therefore difficulty in determining the etiologic virus (Beaty et al., 1989) . Hemagglutintion inhibition requires a wide panel of viral antigens usually along with acute and convalescent sera to adequately determine specific etiologic agents by identifying fourfold rise or fall in titre values. ELISA inhibition methods increase specificity and sensitivity and this has been demonstrated when compared with HIA for dengue diagnosis and surveillance (Beaty et al., 1989; Fern andez, 1990) .

We also found statistically significant associations among VEEV-seropositive bats and roosts in close proximity to humans and their livestock, as well as for TABV-seropositive bats (especially vampires) and their feeding and roosting habits in rural communities. Our data suggest that bat flaviviruses may be more easily transmitted among bats than the alphaviruses or that there is a difference in the viruses in circulation at the time of this study. Bat species tested and other factors may also influence the different rates observed. However, there is not enough data here to suggest that bats are less infected by one of these genera.
