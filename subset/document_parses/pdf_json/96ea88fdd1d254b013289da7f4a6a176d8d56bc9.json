Since the ground state is more populous at thermal equilibrium, the Stokes shift is more prevalent and commonly used in Raman spectroscopy. 16, 17 In a Raman spectrometer, a detector is used to measure light that has been inelastically scattered from a sample after it has passed through a series of filters, and these measurements are converted into a Raman spectrum. This is a plot of the intensity of the scattered light against the Raman shift in wavenumbers. 18 Intensity of a Raman peak at a particular Raman shift increases as the concentration of molecules responsible for the peak increases. A Raman spectrum can therefore be thought of as a molecular fingerprint giving information about the molecules present in the sample through the analysis of the position, height, and width of peaks present in the spectrum. Raman spectroscopy can identify biomolecular features (such as lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and amino acids) within biological samples. In recent years, clinical applications of this light-based technique have gained traction in oncology, [19] [20] [21] inflammatory diseases, 22, 23 transplantation 24 and virology. 25, 26 For example, Camacho et al. 25 developed surface enhanced Raman sensors for the detection of the Zika virus by functionalizing coreshell nanoparticles with Zika ZIKV NS1 antibodies and reported a sensibility of 10 ng/mL.",

            "text": "In a pandemic context, fast near real-time screening is required to track and contain the propagation of a virus. Airports, schools, workplaces, and remote communities would benefit from a rapid, reagent-free screening technique. The sensitivity and the label-free approach of Raman spectroscopy makes it a candidate for fast, robust, low-cost, and transportable means of viral screening to complement the diagnosis capacity of the gold standards. Any COVID screening tool should be applicable to all users, regardless of symptoms, age, sex, time-of-day of sample collection or diet. This poses a challenge when developing a label-free Raman spectroscopic approach as saliva composition is affected by time of day, sex, age and potentially other underlying health conditions. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] A 2021 study (n = 30 for COVID positive volunteers) found that Raman microspectroscopy could detect COVID-19 infection in saliva with 84% sensitivity and 92% specificity. 39 However, the clinical cohort was restricted to elderly volunteers who had presented to hospitals and the study design required saliva collection to occur prior to breakfast. Thirty-six percent of positive cases were severely or critically ill, and a further 30% had symptoms and evidence of pneumonia upon imaging. Another recent study (n = 29 for COVID positive volunteers) determined infrared spectroscopy could be used to discriminate between COVID-infected and non-infected saliva with 93% sensitivity and 82% specificity. 40 As for the previous study, both the COVID-positive and negative cohorts consisted of hospitalized, symptomatic patients requiring treatment. Most labelfree tests would be aimed at screening non-hospitalized people who may be symptomatic or asymptomatic with different levels of severity of COVID-19 infection.",

Features presenting a large variance have a higher weight and by sorting them according to their weight, only the k-best features are retained, where k was varied between 5 and 80 for the spectral features and 5 and 72 for the peak features. A Random Forest classifier (RF) with 200 estimators is then used to further reduce the feature set, this time with a multivariate technique rather than a univariate one.

Instead of being represented by multiple instances from the original feature space, each bag is now represented by a single instance, based on the similarity measure from the new feature space. Under MILES, the mapping is done using an intermediate instance pool (IIP) which contains all the instances. It is also possible to create a discriminative instance pool (DIP) which is a subset of the IIP represented only by the best instances. This method is called a MIL with discriminative mapping (MILDM) algorithm 43 .",

The area of laser excitation was small (24 \u00b5m 2 ) relative to the area of the droplet (approximately 12 mm 2 ). Due to the crystallization process and dilution of biomolecules within saliva, not all spectra necessarily carry molecular information relevant to the COVID status of the patient. As a result, a ML approach needed to be adapted whereby each spectrum acquired from a saliva droplet from a volunteer could be treated independently ( Figure 4) . The ML approaches that were employed are based on multiple instance learning (MIL); specifically, MIL via embedded instance selection (MILES) and MIL with discriminative bag mapping (MILDM). The implementation details of techniques are presented Figure 4 : Machine learning schematic workflow. The ML workflow consists of a 5-fold cross-validation (CV) embedded in a 5-time repeat loop creating different splitting of the training and validation sets. Feature selection, bagging, mapping, and training steps are repeated for each fold. Raman spectra are represented by spectral peaks and fitted peaks. Each instance is represented by the relevant features which are selected using a combination of a variance-based algorithm, acting as a broad skimmer, and a random forest (RF). Each bag is then mapped from a multiple instance representation to a single instance representation through an instance similarity measure; the mapping function being different for MILES and MILDM. A linear Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is used to train each model and output a classification probability for patients in the validation set. After each CV procedure, a receiver operating ROC curve is computed with a corresponding AUC value to assess the model performance. The final output is the ROC and AUC averaged over the 5 repetitions, ensuring further stability. All rights reserved.

It is likely that in this study, we may not have captured the full molecular profile of every saliva drop. Therefore, we have developed in parallel a rapid singlepoint Raman spectroscopy platform similar to the probe we have already developed and commercialized for detecting brain cancer 20, 53, 54 . This can image a whole droplet within a few seconds and is portable, affordable and suitable for high throughput screening.
