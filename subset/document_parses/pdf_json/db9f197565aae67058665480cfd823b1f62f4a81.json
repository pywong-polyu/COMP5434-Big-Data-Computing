However, the long treatment duration (i.e. two years or longer) has a high impact on patients and healthcare systems in terms of (severe) toxicity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), resource use, and healthcare costs. While durable tumour responses have been observed and PD-1 blockade is discontinued on an individual basis, no consensus has been reached on the optimal treatment duration. The objective of the Safe Stop trial is to evaluate whether early discontinuation of first-line PD-1 blockade is safe in patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma who achieve a radiological response.",

Although melanoma has a lower incidence than other types of skin cancer, melanoma is responsible for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths worldwide, and its incidence is increasing [2, 3] . The life expectancy of melanoma patients is mainly determined by disease stage, and patients with advanced-stage disease have a significantly worse prognosis [4] . Since the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and targeted therapies, the prognosis of patients with advanced (i.e. irresectable stage IIIC) and metastatic (i.e. stage IV) melanoma has improved significantly [5] [6] [7] . Nowadays, first-line monotherapy with the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockers nivolumab (Opdivo\u00ae) or pembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae) is administered most frequently in patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma [8] [9] [10] .",

Interestingly, durable tumour responses have been observed after early discontinuation (< 2 years) of PD-1 blockade [14] [15] [16] , not only in patients who achieved a complete response (CR) [16] but also in patients with a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) [17, 18] . In patients who discontinued PD-1 blockade early because of adverse events (AEs), outcomes were not compromised and tumour responses were ongoing at > 5 years after treatment commencement [5, [19] [20] [21] [22] . Therefore, early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade is considered feasible [23] , in particular since rechallenge with PD-1 blockade induces overall response rates of up to 90% in patients with progressive disease (PD) after prior discontinuation of PD-1 blockade [24] . As pre-specified criteria for (early) discontinuation of PD-1 blockade were lacking in retrospective analyses [25, 26] , it is not yet known which patients can safely discontinue PD-1 blockade at an earlier time point. Based on the median time to objective response of approximately 3 months in patients with advanced melanoma [11, 27] , the preferred treatment duration of PD-1 blockade is considered to be at least 3-6 months [25] .",

First, treatment with PD-1 blockade is associated with a broad spectrum of AEs (e.g. pneumonitis, colitis, nephritis, and endocrinopathies), which can develop rapidly, severely, and can be, although rare, even fatal [29] [30] [31] [32] . Some of these AEs can persist lifelong (e.g. hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes). Although the incidence of these immunerelated AEs is not associated with the dose of PD-1 blockade, the incidence gradually increases with treatment duration [33] . Second, PD-1 blockers are intravenously (IV) administered at the outpatient clinic regularly with intervals of 2, 3, 4, or 6 weeks, which may significantly affect patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), productivity, and time of informal caregivers. Third, a treatment duration of \u2265 2 years is associated with high costs for expensive drugs, IV treatment administration, personnel, and management of treatment-related AEs.",

As PD-1 blockade will be discontinued earlier than two years, participation in this trial may affect treatment efficacy which will be evaluated as the primary objective of this study. As a result, participation in this trial may affect clinical outcome and even survival of these patients. Importantly, following the development of disease progression, retreatment with monotherapy PD-1 blockade (preferred) or other treatment options can be initiated at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist. However, as an increasing number of physicians discontinue treatment on an individual basis at achieving CR or PR, the additional risk of participation in this trial is considered limited compared to daily clinical practice. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor quality and patient safety in this multicentre trial. As discontinuation of PD-1 blockade should neither lead to an increased number of fatal or life-threatening events, nor an increased incidence of new or symptomatic brain metastases, these are considered as SAEs which need to be reported expedited (i.e. within 24 h) throughout the course of the trial to the sponsor and will be made available to the DSMB. After the inclusion of 75 patients, the DSMB will review the data and advise on study continuation, based on the number and severity of SAEs. If the available data are not sufficiently mature after the inclusion of 75 patients (e.g. as a result of fast inclusion), 6-monthly DSMB evaluations will be added until the DSMB has confirmed that the provided data are mature, or until 200 patients are included. If the incidence of these particular SAEs is unexpectedly high, this could result in early termination of the study after consultation of the DSMB.",

The decision to discontinue treatment early is based on the treatment regimen and response-driven; only patients achieving CR or PR upon first-line monotherapy with PD-1 blockade are eligible. Patients with SD are not eligible, as patients who achieve SD as best overall response and complete two years of PD-1 blockade have a significantly worse PFS compared to patients with CR or PR (PFS of 40% vs. 82-85% at 24 months after completion of 2 year pembrolizumab treatment [5] ). Currently, monotherapy with PD-1 blockade is the most frequently administered ICI for the treatment of advanced and metastatic melanoma in patients with a more favourable risk profile. In patients with rapidly progressive and/or (severe) symptomatic BRAF-mutant melanoma, BRAF-directed therapy is often prescribed as first-line treatment [8, 9] . In patients with rapidly progressive melanoma, cerebral metastases and/or elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), combination therapy with nivolumab-ipilimumab is usually preferred, in particular in patients with BRAF-wild type melanoma. For the Safe Stop trial, patients treated with the combination nivolumab-ipilimumab or BRAF/ MEK inhibitors will not be eligible, as inclusion of these patients would affect the homogenous population with regard to patient characteristics and administered therapy.",

First, patients treated with different PD-1 inhibitors (i.e. nivolumab or pembrolizumab) are eligible, as these drugs are considered interchangeable based on OS and AEs [5, 8, 22] . Second, as 18 F-FDG-PET/CT is often performed for initial staging of melanoma, low-dose CT is allowed as baseline scan in strictly prespecified cases. Third, for response evaluation, RECIST instead of immune-based response criteria (iRECIST) is used, as iRECIST is not yet applied in daily clinical practice [34, 43] . Fourth, the study was not designed as randomised controlled trial to compare outcomes of patients with early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade with the outcomes of patients treated for two years. As patients usually have access to a treatment duration of two years, randomisation to early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade was considered not feasible in this setting. Furthermore, as an increasing number of physicians discontinue PD-1 blockade early on an individual basis [25] , this trial design facilitates shared decision making and may prevent overtreatment, thereby potentially reducing AEs and the number of hospital visits. The decision to early discontinue PD-1 blockade in patients with tumour response is based on pre-specified criteria and patients' wishes.",
