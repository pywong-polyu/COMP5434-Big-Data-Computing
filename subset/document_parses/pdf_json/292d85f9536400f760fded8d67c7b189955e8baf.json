With increasing age, pro-inflammatory cytokines increase while the immune effect decreases, making the elderly more susceptible to the virus [1] .",

Its pathogenesis includes the following: 1) SARS-CoV-2 recognizes and enters the receptor of human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), preferentially infecting pulmonary epithelial cells [3] . Theoretically, cells and tissues that express ACE2, including kidney, cardiovascular system, reproductive system, liver, lung, central nervous system, and lymphatic system, are all potential targets for the novel coronavirus [8] . 2) SARS-CoV-2 can also enter cells by membrane fusion and release nucleic acid to synthesize new viruses, causing cytopathic effects and cell e930278-2 death and pathological changes in tissues and organs [8] . Some studies suggest the mechanism of death in COVID-19 is the large number of alveolar injuries and progressive respiratory failure. Histological examination shows bilateral diffuse alveolar injury with cellular fibrous mucus-like exudate, formation of a hyaline membrane in lung tissue, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration dominated by lymphocytes in both lungs [13] . Moreover, autopsies of COVID-19 patients confirmed the presence of thrombosis in microvessels, which indicates that blood coagulation is an important factor leading to organ failure in COVID-19 patients [18] .",

            "text": "Changes in the anatomical structure of the lung and muscle atrophy in the elderly change the physiological function of the respiratory system, decrease airway clearance capacity, decrease of lung reserve, and decrease defense barrier function. The baseline levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tissue and circulation of the elderly also increase with age, especially interleukin (IL)-1 b, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), resulting in \"inflammatory senescence.\" These cytokines are rapidly-rising, early-response molecules in high-risk groups of serious diseases, and they are the main factors of \"cytokine storm\" in some infected patients. They amplify the activation of inflammatory pathway by activating nuclear factor-k light chain enhancer (NFoff) of B cells, which is a pathophysiological injury response that leads to increased mortality. Corresponding to inflammatory senescence, the immune response of the body to pathogenic threats or tissue damage is slower, which is called \"immune senescence.\" Innate immunity and adaptive immunity function decrease with age. This is characterized by: decreased pathogen recognition; chemotaxis, and phagocytosis of macrophages, natural killer cells, and neutrophils; a decrease in (TCR) diversity of T cell receptors that recognize viruses; and the thymus, which is mainly responsible for the production of immature T cells, begins to be replaced by adipose tissue in those over age 60 years, so that the reserve of immature T cells decreases. At the same time, the antibody secretion ability of B cells decreases with age, which can lead to decreased immune response and the irreversible degradation of both innate and acquired immunity. These changes make it impossible for the elderly to fight and resolve the COVID-19 infection effectively and efficiently [9, 20, 21] .",

In the elderly, the diversity of gut microbiota is reduced and the ecological imbalance is aggravated. One of the changes repeatedly found is that the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes is decreased [23] . The intestine and the lung can show an interactive relationship: intestinal endotoxin, microbial metabolites can affect the lung through the blood, and when inflammation occurs in the lung, it also affects the intestinal microflora [22] . A typical example is COVID-19. A clinical study from COVID-19-positive patients in Hubei, China, revealed that 46% presented with gastrointestinal (GI) problems, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain early in the disease [23, 24] . The most common digestive tract symptom in adults and children is diarrhea, with the reported incidence of diarrhea in patients with COVID-19 ranging from 2% to 49.5% [25] . The ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and plays an important role in the control of intestinal inflammation and intestinal microbial ecology; when the ACE2 receptor is activated by SARS-CoV-2, it can cause inflammation (enteritis) and eventually diarrhea [23, 25, 26] . Seventeen studies in China, the United States, and Singapore showed SAR-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in the stools of an average of 43% of COVID-19 patients [23] . Studies have shown that the Firmicutes phylum, the genus Coprobacillus, and the species Clostridium ramosum and Clostridium hathewayi are correlated with COVID-19 severity. In contrast, Alistipes onderdonkii and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are negatively correlation with COVID-19 severity [23, 26] .",

Its heterogeneity can be defined as the phenomenon that wild-type (WT) genetic polymorphism and somatic mutations are dynamically co-expressed in different proportions in a single mitochondrial DNA genome, and these mutations are distributed in the organelles of a single cell [28] . In different types of human cells, the heterogeneous mtDNA genome is expressed in the mitochondria, which complements the normal mitochondrial function [28] . The biological significance of mtDNA heterogeneity lies in the fact that cellular mitochondria can effectively regulate energy state-dependent changes through cooperative transcription and translation mechanisms [30] .

The mitochondrial membrane-anchored mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) is an important part of the cellular antiviral defense system. A study has shown that SARS-CoV-2RNA is preferentially located in mitochondria [32] , especially in patients with age-related diseases whose mitochondrial function has been impaired, and COVID-19 can use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 mutation to give priority to infection and destruction of mitochondria [33] . The deposition of SARS-CoV-2RNA in mitochondria can also damage the function of mitochondria, potentially leading to a decrease in energy and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [32] . In the physiological process of cell respiration, the production of ROS is out of control, which further lead to serious damage to MtDNA, morphological changes, and functional damage [29] . SARS-CoV-2 changes mitochondrial dynamics in varying degrees. It induces or inhibits various mitochondrial processes in a highly specific way, changing most mitochondrial metabolic pathways and the number and distribution of mitochondria in cells, so as to ensure effective replication and avoid the mitochondrial antiviral response, and promote the progression of infection [34] . Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the signs of aging [31] and it plays a core role in aging. In people ages 80-85 years, mtDNA has undergone about 1000 replications, and impaired replication is the reason for the decrease in the number of mitochondria in the elderly [29] . When mitochondrial dysfunction occurs, it has a negative impact on immunity and inflammation and is a potential risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection [32] .",

In severe cases, it can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), metabolic acidosis, and multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome [2] . Pneumonia in the elderly often occurs in atypical ways, including dyspnea and exacerbation of underlying diseases. The most common clinical symptom is fever, followed by cough, fatigue, sore throat, and expectoration [37, 38] . fever and respiratory symptoms are sometimes not obvious, and patients may only present with non-specific symptoms such as loss of appetite, changes in mental and cognitive state, and decreased physical strength. Some patients show symptoms suggestive of deterioration due to coexisting underlying diseases, making COVID-19 easy to be miss and misdiagnose. COVID-19 can be considered when there is no apparent reason for atypical symptoms such as change of consciousness, change of respiratory state, and deterioration of basic disease [5] .",

Despite these challenges in developing a vaccine, elderly patients are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 because of the high morbidity and mortality rates of middle-aged and elderly COVID-19 patients. The characteristics of elderly patients, such as aging and an increased likelihood of having a variety of chronic diseases, can lead to a decline in their immune ability and may leave them with an insufficient ability to resist the virus.

It had good safety. After 2 doses, the efficacy of the vaccine was 70.4% and the protection rate was 64.1%, but the duration of protection could not be evaluated. The vaccine was suitable for people age 18 years and older [57] , but its efficacy could not be evaluated in the elderly group [58] . The vaccine can be stored and distributed at 2-8\u00b0C, making it particularly suitable for global distribution [58] .

Recently, the British government approved the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, and it became the first country in the world to approve the vaccine. It is reported that the first people to receive the vaccine are the elderly and staff in nursing homes, followed by people over the age of 80 years, as well as healthcare and nursing staff [60] .
