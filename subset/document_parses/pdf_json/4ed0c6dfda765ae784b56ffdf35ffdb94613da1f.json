Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell surface receptor that recognizes the coronavirus spike protein has protective effects against inflammation and chronic hyperglycemia in animal models. The roles of ACE2 in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections remains ambiguous due to contradictory findings. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between human plasma ACE2 levels in diabetics and the high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the medical records of 245 patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive who have chronic diseases were analyzed. We also recruited 404 elderly subjects with comorbid chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension and obesity, and investigated the ACE2 plasma levels. Plasma concentrations of ACE2 were much lower (2973.83\u00b12196.79 pg/mL) in diabetics with chronic disease than in healthy controls (4308.21\u00b12352.42 pg/ml), and the use of hypoglycemia drugs was associated with lower circulating concentrations of ACE2 (P=1.49E-08). Diabetics with lower plasma levels of ACE2 may be susceptible to severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that the poor prognosis in patients with diabetes infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be due to low circulating ACE2 levels.",

The median age of DM patients was 56.9 years, and 57.8 years for non-DM group ( Table 2) . Patients with diabetics have at least one comorbidity (hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and obesity). All subjects take at least one of the following medications: antihypertension drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, hypoglycemic drugs, or ACEIs. We found that plasma concentrations of ACE2 were significantly lower in diabetics patients (2973.83 \u00b1 2196.79 pg/mL) than in the non-DM group (4308.21 \u00b1 2352.42 pg/mL) ( Figure 1A ), which indicated that downregulated ACE2 levels were correlated with impaired glucose homeostasis in patients with diabetes.

            "text": "About 20-50% of COVID-19-infected patients were diabetic, and the mortality of patients with diabetes is 50% higher than those without diabetes [9] . It had been reported that accumulation of angiotensin I (Ang-I or A [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ) and reduced A [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] concentration in patients succumbing to ARDS full name is related to mortality, which suggest that ACE2 activities may be reduced in the non-surviving ARDS patients [10] . Consistent with this perspective, our study indicated that lower plasma ACE2 in diabetics treated with hypoglycemic drugs may be correlated with higher mortality from COVID-19. However, there are controversial results regarding the value of plasma ACE2 levels in the risk of COVID-19. Recent studies show that higher plasma level of soluble ACE2 (sACE2), which are associated with a higher risk for mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation, heart failure and diabetes mellitus, might contribute to improved methods of identifying risk for severe COVID-19 infection [11] [12] [13] . Several studies have found that the use of ACEI/ARB led to an increase in circulating ACE2 levels, thus, accounting for a lower risk of all-cause mortality of COVID-19 compared to non-users [14, 15] . The mean age of all participants with heart disease included in these previous studies were elder than those in our clinical trials, and about 80% of these patients have a history of taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs, while only about 50% of patients have such history of drug intake in our investigation. As our study focuses on the plasma ACE2 level in Chinese diabetics, the possible effect of genetic variation on plasma ACE2 levels remains unclear. Differences in the demographic makeup of the patients included in the study may account for the inconsistencies between our data and those of other studies. Our findings may provide some biological context for the devastating effects of COVID-19 towards diabetics.",
