Nonetheless, the observed differential changes in uninsured individuals in Blue, Purple, and Red states are noteworthy, and may be partially explained by several factors. Most states that did not expand Medicaid were Red states. 2 This is significant because, in non-expansion states, the Marketplaces represent one of the most important sources of insurance for those seeking coverage, especially low-income individuals. However, Marketplace coverage may be unaffordable to this segment given a lack of Marketplace subsidies for certain individuals below the poverty line (known as the Marketplace coverage gap 6 Substantial modifications to some states' Medicaid programs are being contemplated. Several Medicaid expansion states have applied for (and have been granted) Section 1115 waivers, with the majority of the waivers that would have the effect of decreasing Medicaid enrollment originating from Red states. 5 Due to various legal challenges (and more recently COVID-19), these waivers have not yet been fully implemented. 5 Tracking the uninsured rate is vitally important as the policy landscape continues to evolve, and millions of people lose their jobs (and thus their health insurance) because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
