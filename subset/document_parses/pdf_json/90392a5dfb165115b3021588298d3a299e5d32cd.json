Our research seeks to analyse disaster management systems from a national perspective by examining the Korean management of the COVID-19 crisis according to a four-phase epidemiological disaster management system. Utilising a meta-study, official documents, reports and interviews, we explore the role of the control tower mechanism related to the life-cycle of disaster management, and Korea's sustainable containment strategy. This study begins with a discussion of the crisis and disaster management literature and provides specific information related to the Korean government's response to COVID-19. It continues by detailing specific strategies such as wide-spread testing, tracking, treatment and quarantine that have enabled Korea to prevent wide-spread community transmission. The study concludes emphasising the relevance of systematic national disaster management, providing insight into methods for containment in Korea -a system commended by the WHO. Implications include the extension and the efficient application of disaster management theory by empirical application and integration of concepts.",

In the past, these functions mainly included the management of natural disasters like floods and typhoons; however, since the early 1990s, man-made disasters such as building collapses, gas leaks, and ship sinking accidents have also come under the auspices of disaster management. Therefore, man-made disaster management systems have also received attention in this new phase. Today, new types of disaster, entirely different from conventional disasters, are threatening our society: information and communication disruptions, paralysis of transportation and transportation systems, terrorism, and epidemics. In particular, as global health disasters such as COVID-19, SARS, and MERS threaten the international community, the necessity to establish a disaster management system from a national perspective has become paramount. In other words, the paradigm of national disaster management is changing into various new forms. In addition to the massive cost in terms of lives lost and economic upheaval, there has been a complete and utter interruption of the regular pattern of life in terms of education, work, and public transport-not to mention, an unprecedented impact on healthcare systems. When faced with such a crisis of unknown magnitude and epidemiology, citizens look to their governments for leadership, guidance and information. Therefore, the government should move away from passive activities and deal with the situation more actively and systematically at the national level.",

            "text": "Since December 2019-when the first COVID-19 cases were detected in Wuhan, China, unbeknownst to the rest of the world-mass contagion was underway. On 31 January 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared an international public health emergency, and on February 28 the WHO raised the global risk level of COVID-19 to \"very high.\" On March 11, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. As of June 2020, six months after the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the world has experienced mass infection, with nearly sixteen million positive cases and 650,000 deaths spread across all the continents. The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented leadership challenge for governments worldwide-the kind of challenge that has been historically restricted to situations of war or serious natural disasters. In addition to the massive cost in terms of lives lost and economic upheaval, there has been a complete interruption of the regular pattern of life in terms of education, work, and public transport-not to mention, an unprecedented impact on healthcare systems. When faced with such a crisis of unknown magnitude and epidemiology, citizens look to their governments for leadership, guidance, and information While the different political ideologies of socialism, communism, and capitalism in the post-World War II era have led to divergent views on the roles of government, in times of crisis it is clear that the government has the role and the responsibility to protect citizens from harm. Clearly, the ability to respond quickly, sensibly, and responsibly to a wide range of emergencies is a \"must-have\" for political leaders. This study adopts traditional crisis management theory to include four distinct phases. In particular, the study analyses the actions and strategic responses of Korea's national disaster management system in each phase -evaluated as an excellent case of disaster management by the WHO.",

The first phase lasts from 19 January to 18 February; the second phase from 19 February to 21 March; the third phase from 22 March to 5 May; and the fourth phase, which started on 6 May, is ongoing. The world suffers several major and minor disasters every year. Therefore, it is imperative that governments-which are obliged to protect the lives and properties of their people-put in place preventive measures in anticipation of expected or impending disasters, and establish systems of prompt emergency recovery and restoration in the event of a disaster. The purpose of this study is to explore how to establish an effective governmental disaster management system for each stage. Therefore, we examine the Korean disaster management system and analyse the features of its system.",

            "text": "Disaster management refers to the development and implementation of policies on disaster prevention, planning, response, and recovery to minimise damage caused by disasters [1] . National disasters are chaotic situations that threaten the existing social order. As a disaster unfolds and the situation is exacerbated, known reality undergoes a drastic change and the ability of the public to comprehend and attribute meaning to what is happening is seriously challenged. If the crisis persists, it poses a complex threat not only to human lives, but to the systemic cooperation that links authorities and institutions. Crisis management is potentially dangerous for the control, reputation, and public legitimacy of leadership. For the purposes of this paper, we define disaster as \"a serious threat to the basic structures or the fundamental values and norms of a social system, which-under time pressure and highly uncertain circumstances-necessitates making critical decisions.\" [2] . Gilbert [3] stresses that a disaster is an attack from the outside that interferes with the social system, with three models believed to exist. The \"repression of social vulnerability\" model showed that disasters were caused by vulnerabilities inherent in the internal processes of a society. In addition, the expression \"entrance into a state of uncertainty\" means that a disaster is a result of the failure to identify real or hypothetical risks and occurrences, when the conventional framework for understanding reality stops functioning. Posner [4] (2004) suggests that, for effective disaster management, a crisis should be classified into one of four types. In other words, national disasters have unique characteristics, unlike those of organisations or systems. Therefore, the response to national disasters needs to be designed with the disaster's unique characteristics in mind. As Turner [5] notes, disaster management is the result of the time-specific exposure to risk factors that have accumulated over a long period since the onset of visibility. According to the man-made disaster model, technical, social, institutional, and administrative devices cause disasters [5, 6] .",

This \"interaction\" refers to that between the causes of the disaster and the factors that spread the damage. Alternatively, disasters generally do not result from a single cause. Even if there is a specific, definitive cause, this has a reciprocal synergistic effect on the occurrence of other factors. Eventually, this interaction will determine the overall intensity and scope of the damage. Thus, disasters in modern societies are increasing the density and complexity of their interactions, with one type of disaster causing another, and vice versa [8] . Another characteristic of disaster is \"uncertainty,\" which means that the nature of the disaster may change, and disaster management organisation and existing disaster response must, therefore, change accordingly [9] .",

Disasters have uncertainty of \"occurrence\" and \"progress\", because \"occurrence\" of disasters usually exists outside the forecast range. Even if disaster factors are minimised, disaster occurrence is inevitable. These theoretical frameworks for disaster management can be largely divided into two categories: the disaster management strategy and the disaster management process. First, the disaster management strategy is divided into prevention and restoration strategies, focusing on theoretical discussions on risks and uncertainties [10] . The Disaster Management process is usually divided into four stages, mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery, based on the time of the disaster [9, 11, 12] . Mitigation refers to pre-risk preparedness [13] , activities which eliminate or suppress disaster triggering factors before a catastrophe occurs [11, 14] . Preparedness refers to the ability to develop response capabilities in advance for response activities in the event of a crisis [11, 12] . These two stages require close interconnection [9] . Response is an activity that applies the various duties and functions of disaster management agencies after the disaster has occurred [9, 11] , and recovery refers to the long-term course of activity for healing in the designated area.",

The scale of disaster impact and damage is also difficult to confirm, as disasters are by nature unpredictable, even after their occurrence, especially as one disaster is likely to lead to a chain of subsequent new disasters, as disasters are known to interact [15] [16] [17] . Among the characteristics of a disaster, \"complexity\" refers to the restructure and relationship among the agencies involved after the occurrence of a disaster. A disaster is characterised by complicated processes, factors, causes, and restorative actions. This complexity arises as factors related to the progression of a disaster, directly and indirectly, affect other factors. This is also linked to the aforementioned \"interaction.\" Therefore, it is critical to identify the elements of disaster management systems that should be equipped so as to enhance the effectiveness of response management in environments that are under strain and affected by the factors of interaction, uncertainty, and complexity [18] . Contemporarily, the disaster management literature has also evolved, with companies increasingly becoming transnational and technology and platforms [19, 20] creating new types of interdependency.",

At the nation-state level, disaster management encompasses numerous functions depending on the level of significance assigned to a particular crisis. While there is some precedent of infectious diseases such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola, given the mass contagion underway in the United States and Europe questions arise as to the best practices for COVID-19 containment and the key success factors for crisis management. National disaster management, in particular, is a complicated process requiring analysis and management within the lifecycle of disasters. Within existing studies, there are a few disaster cycle studies, which are often divided into mitigation-planning-response-recovery before and after a disaster occurs. However, there is little research on how to deal with disasters periodically after their occurrence, as many national disasters seem to be finite in location time and circumstance. In addition, there is a paucity of research on disaster management systems from a national perspective. Given the duration and persistence of COVID-19, there is still urgency and relevancy in understanding best practices. In this study, we present the case study of Korea's national disaster management mechanism in response to COVID-19, which was commended by the WHO.",

In search of a relevant model to analyse a wide range of disaster management activities, we first evaluated relevant crisis management models including the onion model for strategic crisis of Pauchant and Mitroff [22] and the crisis management model of Mitroff [23] . Pauchant and Mitroff [22] 's onion model categorises organisations that are vulnerable to a crisis and those that are prepared for the crisis, and the model of Mitroff [23] divides the disaster situation into pre-crisis and post-crisis. After reviewing these models, therefore, we determined that they were not suitable for the time development pattern of a crisis situation. Similarly, we considered Coppola's [24] approach to the crisis management team and Carter's [25] international disaster management model; however, none conformed to the event trends related to the need for central control and government. Fink's [26] four-stage model examines crisis as an extended event with sufficient warning signs that precede the event: the prodromal stage, the acute stage, the chronic stage, and the resolution stage. However, there was a lack of explanation of the important characteristics and elements of each stage. We also considered the three-step model of Coombs [27] but ruled it out as specifics related to issue management were neglected. Based upon a meta-analysis, we concluded that the crisis management process model was most suitable as it includes the analysis of the development process, i.e., the issue's life-cycle. As disaster management has generally focused on the metaphor of a crisis's \"life-cycle,\" we opted to revise the existing life-cycle models [26] [27] [28] and developed these models to deal with a disaster after its occurrence.",

In other words, depending on the life-cycle of disasters, this study classified the four phases of the disaster management system as proactive, reactive, emergency response, and recovery, which then is recycled by integration of best practice through post-mortem analysis [29] . The proactive phase conducts programs that reduce the likelihood of a crisis by considering the risks and the possible responses upon early discovery. It is necessary to collect, evaluate, and develop such strategies. The reactive phase includes preparation of an operational plan to handle an emergency or to maintain the ability to respond to a crisis whose likelihood is high despite mitigation efforts. In particular, this is the phase when damage from a disaster increases explosively. The response phase is the most crucial as this is when steps are taken in response to the crisis being at its peak. The recovery phase refers to the period when the damage is first reduced and there is recovery. The subject of this study, COVID-19, was considered the most suitable risk management process model because it has a time-ordered nature (See Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S1 and Table S2 ). ",

On 31 December 2019, 27 patients with pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China-all of them had visited a wet market in Wuhan. The KCDC, which determined that the new infectious disease had originated overseas, formed the \"Task Force for COVID-19\" in Wuhan, China on 3 January 2020, and designated the crisis as \"Attention (Blue).\" Accordingly, the Commission continued to identify overseas trends and began monitoring and responding to suspected cases. In the event of a suspected case, a basic epidemiological survey was conducted by a public health center, and the central epidemiological investigator decided whether to conduct an examination after the patient had been admitted to a state-designated sound pressure bed, or whether to implement management measures such as active monitoring. In addition, from January 8th onward, Wuhan was designated as a contaminated area, and a health status questionnaire was created for those who arrived in Wuhan. If they had a body temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius or more, or if they had respiratory symptoms such as coughing, they were quarantined. Phase 1 goes from the first confirmed COVID-19 case reported in Korea on 20 January 2020 to the super spreader incident, when the number of infections exponentially increased. Upon identification of the first case in Korea on January 20th, having planned for a potential crisis, the KCDC immediately upgraded the designation of the crisis from \"Attention (Blue)\" to \"Caution (Yellow)\" and began intensive management (See Figure 2 ). It began intensive contact tracking and developed a system of thorough examination and treatment-even the asymptomatic were quarantined to check for infection.",

Upon identification of the mass contagion in Daegu and Gyoengbuk provinces, the Korean national control tower raised the crisis level from 'Alert (Orange)' to 'Serious (Red)' on 24 February. The Korean government conducted mass testing early, frequently and safely to keep community contagion from worsening. Kang Kyung-wha, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview with the BBC that the importance of testing was the key to enabling Korea to have a low fatality rate because it enabled early detection of further infection and the rapid treatment of infected people. Korea has tested approximately 2.1 million or 4.05% of the population as of 10 September 2020, which is one of the highest ratios in the world.",

It was recommended to limit the operation of some high-risk facilities and industries by staying at home as much as possible and to minimise contact amongst colleagues. The government also urged the public to observe personal hygiene practices such as regular washing of hands and coughing with the mouth covered and to refrain from attending activities such as religious events or visiting indoor sports facilities, which could lead to close contact in tight spaces. In addition, contact tracking and epidemiological investigations, containment and monitoring were continuously conducted. To this end, the government has established a system for supporting epidemiological investigations of COVID-19 by using smart city technology (See Figure 7) . This system collects big data such as the mobile phone location information and the credit card usage history of an individual and derives their movements within ten minutes. Immediately after the contagion began, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport began working on the development of this system and developed and transferred the system to the KCDC within a month. The Korean government has already established a \"smart city data hub platform\" and can analyse various kinds of big data in real-time such as data concerning traffic, energy, environment, and safety in cities. Previously, an epidemiological investigator had to make a phone call to the relevant institution to obtain the desired information and data in order to analyse movement. Through this new system, real-time data was exchanged among 28 related institutions to ascertain the movement within ten minutes. Confirmed COVID-19 positive cases are tracked by trained medical staff to locate and examine their potential contacts and isolate them, if necessary-this is called contact tracking investigation. Through this system, the results of interviews with confirmed patients can be complemented, and real-time analysis of big data is possible so that the movement of confirmed cases and their location over time can be automatically identified. In this way, a large-scale outbreak area-or hot spot-is analysed and the source of infection is identified. Additionally, various other statistical analyses are also possible under this system.",

Although issues regarding invasion of privacy were raised, the system was nevertheless implemented. Precedent for this came from the MERS crisis. In the case of MERS, the Ministry of Health considered personal privacy and protected the identity of individuals from healthcare facilities, leading to the release of patients who did not even know they were infected and permission for them to freely move throughout the city.

In summary, after establishing the initial model, several rounds of meta-analysis were performed to refine it. Thus, the incomplete preliminary theoretical framework, which can be seen as an early model, indicated the simplification and classification of key factors through existing disaster response research. The study aimed to present a refined model by performing continuous analysis based on an incomplete framework and modifying the factors and their relationships. A number of studies and cases have shown that the responsibilities assigned to various organisations and agencies [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , and the factors that actually affect disaster response, are regular. Therefore, the goal was to classify these elements according to timeline in terms of system theory based on these regular factors.

To cope with a new infectious disease, updated manuals were needed based on the latest knowledge, and this study realised the need for these and for the equivalent control tower to manage the implementation of the process and allow for fluid decision-making to enable rapid analysis and proactive response to amend the crisis situation. To begin with, it was necessary to establish a mechanism for a collaborative work network with the central government's national control tower and local governance. In particular, COVID-19, which overshadows the graveness of MERS or SARS, has led to the awareness that not only medical professionals but the general public too are alert to the threat of infectious diseases. In particular, it can be confirmed that collaboration between enterprises, local government, the scientific community and the KCDC is instrumental in business consultations and partnerships between local government and the KCDC, which serve to provide the national control tower with resources such as mask production, testing kits and test result processing, and communication technology such as mobile apps like 'CoronaMap' to inform the public of tracking.

Taiwan has a similar stringently controlled border control with extensive efforts to contain the importation of disease via travel advisories, flight bans, entry restrictions, airport screening equipped with infrared fever screening, and home quarantine managed by the Taiwan Centre for Disease Control. Similarly, any travellers from abroad are isolated with thorough contact tracing within 24 h and home isolation for 14 days. Local health authorities check twice daily with symptomatic individuals sent to hospital. Stringent border controls have led to transparency in the importation of cases and is one policy that has significantly helped abate community transmission [39] . Taking isolation and quarantine one step further, New Zealand, which recently had a second wave despite stringent border controls, announced that after 102 days straight of no new cases the second wave has prompted a new set of more stringent isolation and quarantine measures. As of 13 August 2020, 32 hotels have been set up as facilities to isolate and quarantine all COVID-19 infected citizens and some relatives will be taken to mandatory quarantine with 'tourism indefinitely cancelled' [40, 41] .",

Therefore, it was recognised that the management of differentiated quarantine measures was important at each step of disaster response. Finally, the government should pay attention to preventing infectious diseases in everyday life, including overseas trips, and practice preventive measures, such as the National Action Guidelines, based on mature civic awareness. In addition, cooperation should be requested for investigation and preventive measures necessary to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This study is expected to be path-breaking in this field as there are not many related studies in the case of the current pandemic, despite COVID-19-inspired awareness of the need to systematically manage disasters at a national level.

In contrast to much traditional literature and the fundamental guiding values of western capitalism that purport a limited view of government, we argue that, similar to a wartime undertaking, pandemics such as COVID-19 require coordination and response that can only be carried out at a national level. While disaster management is widely studied, there is a void in studies analyzing the role of government in managing national disasters in general and of specific practices that have led to sustainable containment. While we recognize that there are a number of potential models to attain a level of containment, few studies have evaluated a long-term sustainable approach with specifics that enable the functioning of society on an economic level that is sustainable and avoids lockdown. Evidenced in Figure 11 , Korea's disaster management system based on control tower mechanism has led to a system that enables containment and that is somewhat sustainable as daily life with social distancing is allowed to proceed. While the current level does not indicate containment, clear testing and identification of cases, tracking and quarantine coupled with a health care treatment protocol provides some semblance of order and reassurance. that enable the functioning of society on an economic level that is sustainable and avoids lockdown.

This study reconstructed a real lifecycle model based on the factors affecting the disaster response presented and is based on a meta-analysis of COVID-19 policy cases. To this end, through data specially requested from the Korean National Assembly, we applied a daily timeline model to traditional disaster management models by dividing events into four phases that are presented in a single timeline. The characteristics existing at each stage were analysed along with the indications for specific demarcated stages considering specific events that signified a major change in policies. Application of a traditional model with demarcated time periods and detailed actions of the Korean Government provides insight into how Korea, a country which identified its first COVID-19 case on January 20th, managed the situation Korea as noted has been praised by the WHO and is currently working with the UN on sharing of best practice on COVID-19 management.",

The KCDC also decided on a full non-disclosure of information which includes the engagement of industry and empowerment stakeholders including doctors, researchers, the scientific community and industry, with a firm commitment to base responses on fact and medical knowledge rather than politics. A second example is the establishment of the mask stabilisation committee which was convened and was key to the production, supply, price control and enforcement of mask usage in public, a cornerstone effort that enabled Korea to continue to use mass transit such as the subway system and for businesses to operate with social distancing.

Early identification of COVID-19 positive individuals, many of whom may be asymptomatic and not requiring treatment, is critical. Korea also utilised the ability to legally conduct epidemiological investigation to systematically track the movement of COVID-19 positive patients. While we recognise this is a controversial point, tracing and tracking introduces an issue of public good versus private benefit and a trade-off between these. By enabling the government to track and utilise existing technology such as GPS data and surveillance, there is a degree of accuracy and procedures for every COVID-19 positive case. This effort and these actions, which complement the quarantine and interview process and the quick turnaround of testing, enable accurate reconstruction of epidemiological paths. Therefore, we recognised that the management and implementation of measures to test, trace and quarantine are quintessential elements in Korea's disaster response and ability to avoid lockdown.",

Through in-depth interviews and focus groups, we confirmed that Korea has had exceptional follow through including border control which involves isolation and quarantine of entire flights in off-site locations that are segmented by age with older passengers going to more comfortable facilities than younger passengers, private transportation from the airport to testing centers or to homes for quarantine with instructions, and two daily calls to every individual in quarantine, which is in addition to mandatory login to a mobile app and GPS tracking overseen with a local case officer. Additionally, the authors have witnessed posters in their residences with pictures indicating the sterilisation of the building after a COVID+ patient was identified, the closing of retail locations upon epidemiological tracking, hand sanitizer in virtually every elevator and grocery store, and temperature checks at most public and private locations upon entry. Such stringent implementation ensures compliance and restores faith in the measures, policies and actions the government takes on behalf of society. Combined with social distancing, nearly 20 daily text messages, numerous apps to trace COVID patients, mask supply, and KCDC daily updates, the public is kept informed and the Korean Government has provided sufficient information and follow through measures to ensure effective implementation and to cultivate mature civic awareness. This latter is quintessential as ultimately compliance and widespread buy-in is essential as collective awareness and effort is necessary to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.",

In particular, the case study of the Korean government's national disaster management analyzed the role of the government from mitigation and planning phases to execution, with details of specific policies and actions in response phases to the beginning of what we term the sustainable containment phase of disaster management. Future post-response quantitative studies based on case studies and research models in other countries are expected to be useful. Akin to the role of national defence, in disaster cases the government has a critical role in containment and stabilisation of the country. Lastly, in terms of disaster management, should this be effectively managed the last phase of containment and recovery is attainable. This study presents the successful national disaster management system of the Korean government. However, considering the nature of the COVID-19 virus, there is still a possibility of the pandemic reoccurring; thus, sustainable management is required until the virus is conquered.",
