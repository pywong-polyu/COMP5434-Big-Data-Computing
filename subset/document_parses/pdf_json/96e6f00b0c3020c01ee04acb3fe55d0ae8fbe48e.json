Specimens were tested at the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Science in Bangkok, Thailand using the standard World Health Organization protocol [9, 10] . For A(H1N1)pdm09, seroconversion was defined as \u22654-fold rise in HI or MN antibody titers and a minimum titer on the second sample of 40. For all other virus types and subtypes, seroconversion was defined as \u22654-fold rise in HI antibody titers only and a minimum HI titer on the second sample of 40. Because several studies have suggested that a minimal titer of 20 may be optimal for assessing seroconversion to novel viruses, we also assessed A(H1N1)pdm09 seroconversion based on a minimal titer on the second sample of 20 [11, 12] . If a baseline titer was <10 (lower limit of detection), the titer was set equal to 5 for analytic purposes. Human immunodeficiency virus testing methods for the BMCS have been previously described [8] . Although access to influenza vaccine is limited in Thailand with <5% coverage in high-risk groups in 2010 and 2011, it is not known whether BMCS participants received influenza vaccine before baseline serum collection.",

However, comparisons between the seroincidence rates in our study and those of other studies should be made with caution because most published studies on A(H1N1)pdm09 seroincidence were based largely on studies using HI alone [2] . In comparison to our findings, another Thai study that estimated A(H1N1)pdm09 infection rates in various populations after the first wave of the pandemic using an HI titer \u226540 found infection rates of 3% in adults in the general population, consistent with our finding of an A(H1N1)pdm09 seroincidence of 4% after the first wave of the pandemic based on HI alone [13] . Although using a minimal HI titer of 40 as a marker of immunity is standard for serologic studies, several studies have found that in polymerase chain reaction-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infections, the optimal HI titer cut-off value was 20 for identifying persons with prior infection [11, 12] ; this lower cutoff increased the positivity of our HI assay 3-to 4-fold and may more accurately reflect true seroconversion rates by HI. Data on A(H1N1)pdm09 seroincidence among individuals infected with HIV are limited. We found no differences in A (H1N1)pdm09 seroincidence among HIV-infected and HIVuninfected MSM. Likewise, a US study comparing HIV-infected women with CD4 cell counts \u2265350 cells/mm 3 and HIV-uninfected women found no differences in A(H1N1)pdm09 seroincidence [14] . A Taiwanese study comparing HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men also found no difference in A(H1N1) pdm09 seroconversion based on HI [15] . In Australia, A (H1N1)pdm09 seroprevalence among HIV-infected persons based on single serum samples was similar to national seroprevalence estimates, and results were not different based on CD4 cell count or HIV viral load [16] . Although our study and prior studies suggest that HIV infection does not confer an increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection, HIV-infected persons in these studies were not severely immunocompromised, making it difficult to draw conclusions about risk among HIVinfected persons with low CD4 cell counts. It is possible that individuals infected with HIV were unable to mount detectable antibody responses after influenza infection due to B-cell dysfunction [17] , thus accounting for the lack of differences in susceptibility to influenza infection seen among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals. However, the fact that seroincidence was similar among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals rather than higher among HIV-uninfected individuals would suggest that HIV-infected individuals do mount a detectable antibody response to influenza infection. Prior studies have demonstrated that HIV infection confers an increased risk for severe influenza infection, supporting the importance of targeted influenza vaccination among persons infected with HIV [18] .",

First, one quarter of men had elevated titers to A (H1N1)pdm09 at baseline based on MN, whereas only 0.5% of men had elevated baseline titers based on HI. The MN findings may suggest that Thai adults had relatively high levels of preexisting cross-reactive antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09 from prior infection with other influenza viruses [19] . However, detection of cross-reactive antibodies to previously circulating influenza strains by MN is unlikely to have impacted our results because we defined A/H1N1pdm09 infection as evidence of a 4fold rise in A(H1N1)pdm09 antibody titers using paired sera rather than as a single titer of \u226540, as some prior studies have done based on HI testing results. Second, although A(H1N1) pdm09 seroincidence was similar among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected MSM, our study may not have had adequate power to detect differences in seroincidence by HIV infection status. Third, A(H1N1)pdm09 seroincidence varies by age group, and our data reflect only seroincidence among younger adults in Thailand. Strengths of our study include testing of paired sera to determine seroincidence rather than just seroprevalence of antibodies to A(H1N1)pdm09 and availability of sera from several time points allowing estimation of seroincidence after both the first and second years of A(H1N1)pdm09 circulation in Thailand.",

Although HIV infection did not appear to increase the probability of A(H1N1)pdm09 seroconversion, the majority of HIV-infected MSM in this study were young and had relatively preserved immune function. It remains unclear whether severely immunocompromised persons infected with HIV are more susceptible to A(H1N1) pdm09 influenza virus and to seasonal influenza viruses in general. Given that persons infected with HIV are at risk for more complicated illness once infected with influenza, these individuals should continue to be prioritized for influenza vaccination during seasonal influenza epidemics and pandemics.",
