Over the past 40-45 years, the engineers have shown an increasing interest in geosynthetics and their field applications, mainly because the use of geosynthetics offers technically efficient, costeffective, environmentally friendly and/or energy-efficient alternative solutions to many field problems in the areas of civil, mining, agricultural and aquacultural engineering [1] [2] [3] [4] .",

Such products, called the geonaturals, have a short lifespan when used with earth materials due to their biodegradable characteristics, and therefore, they have not many field applications as the geosynthetics have [1, 5] . Though the geonaturals are significantly different from the geosynthetics in material characteristics, they can be considered as a complementary companion of geosynthetics, rather than a replacement, mainly because of some common field application areas. In fact, the geonaturals are also polymeric materials, since they contain a large proportion of naturally occurring polymers such as lignin and cellulose.",

The fibre reinforcement is not only alternative ground improvement technique, but it may also make several construction projects cost-effective as well as environmentally friendly and sustainable. As the fibres can be obtained from many waste products (e.g., old and used tyres, used plastic materials, etc.), their utilization can greatly help solve the waste disposal problems; otherwise, a significant volume of the landfills can be occupied by these wastes. Thus, the fibre-reinforced soil engineering has become a subject of special importance in civil engineering and other related fields.",

For the ground engineering projects, it is important to consider the sustainability aspects, while developing and selecting the ground engineering techniques that aim to increase the ground-bearing capacity, improve stability and reduce the ground settlements for the field projects. The sustainability considerations should focus on reduction in energy consumption, lower carbon emission during construction and reduced consumption of transported/manufactured materials by recommending the utilization of recycled/ waste and locally available materials. The selection of the ground improvement technique must be based on life-cycle assessment with estimation of carbon footprint.",

Geosynthetics help conserve energy and promote more durable and sustainable structures. Use of geosynthetics assists in reducing the carbon footprint contributed by infrastructure development while minimizing the use of natural resources and transported materials. Many field examples have been presented in the books [1-4, 6, 7] and the recent technical articles [8, 9] , explaining the benefits as low-cost, enhanced longevity, resilience and safety of critical infrastructure, all because of many special features of geosynthetics, including noncorrosiveness, long-term durability under soil cover, highly resistant to biological and chemical degradations, lightness, high flexibility, installation simplicity and quick construction [1] [2] [3] [4] .",
