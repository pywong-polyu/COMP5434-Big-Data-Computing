            "text": "For decades, Ivermectin (IVM) has been recognized as a robust antiparasitic drug with excellent 32 tolerance and safety profiles. Historically it has been used as the drug of choice for 33 onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis global elimination programs. IVM is also a standard 34 treatment against intestinal helminths and ectoparasites given its action as an oral insecticide. 35 The current humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is a regional public health threat that requires 36 immediate action. Venezuela\"s public health system has now crumbled due to a 70% shortage of 37 medicines in public hospitals, low vaccination campaigns, and the massive exodus of medical 38 personnel. Herein we discuss the repurposing of IVM to attenuate the burden imposed by the 39 most prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in Venezuela including soil-transmitted 40 helminths, ectoparasites and, possibly, vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Additionally, novel 41 experimental evidence has shown that IVM is active and efficacious against Chagas disease, 42 Leishmaniases, arboviruses, and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. In crisis-hit Venezuela, all of the 43 aforementioned infectious diseases are public health emergencies that have been long ignored 44 and that also require immediate attention. IVM\"s versatile nature could serve as a powerful tool 45 to tackle the multiple overlapping endemic and emergent diseases that affect Venezuela today.",

Venezuela\"s public health system has now crumbled due to the 70% deficit in resources, and has led to a spillover to neighboring countries [2] . but it can also inhibit parasite replication inside the vector [10,11]. Therefore, it can rapidly 137 reduce the mean incidence of malaria infections [1, 9] . For these reasons, repurposing orally-138 administered IVM could be a sensible complement to the long-established vector control 139 protocols [1, 9] . This is particularly appropriate for Venezuela, where national malaria incidence 140 increased 10-fold over a decade, and where persistent hot-spots make diseases control 141 particularly difficult [2] . Venezuela [2] . Although no effective all-stage antitrypanosomal drug has been described to date, 166 IVM has been reported to increase triatomine mortality [1] . Thus, IVM is emerging as a potential where these diseases overlap in distribution [20] .",

Starting in 1993, mass drug administration (MDA) of IVM in a biannual or quarterly fashion 103 has interrupted transmission in 11 of the 13 hyperendemic foci in the region [5] by elimination of 104 microfilaria and inhibition of their release from gravid female adult worms [1,5]. Two remaining 105 foci in the Venezuelan and Brazilian Amazonia are still to be adequately controlled. These are 106 regions where the most vulnerable indigenous Yanomami communities live. Recent MDA efforts 107 have achieved a 70% decrease in onchocerciasis transmission and morbidity in the Venezuelan 108 focus, highlighting the feasibility of complete interruption with minimal resource investment [5]. 109 Control of intestinal nematodes has been difficult in Venezuela. Many nematodes fall into the 110 category of soil-transmitted-helminths (STHs) which constitute one of the most common causes 111 of morbidity nation-wide. IVM, which induces neuromuscular disruption in nematodes [1], is highly effective in combination with albendazole/mebendazole against Strongyloides stercoralis, 113 Enterobius vermicularis, roundworms, whipworms and hookworms [6]. Some recent reports 114 have placed prevalence rates for STHs in rural Venezuelan communities as high as 65% [7], but 115 this number is likely an underestimate due to the lack of consistent surveillance. Cardinal clinical 116 features of STH infections in children include malnutrition, anemia, stunting of somatic growth 117 and intellectual development, fatigue, impaired concentration and memory and an overall 118 reduction in school attendance [6]. IVM-based MDA approaches have the potential to reduce 119 the prevalence of STH infections thus increasing community\"s productivity and economic 120 development in the future. Due to its effectiveness against scabies, IVM is the only registered 121 drug for ectoparasitic infections in WHO's 21th Model List of Essential Medicines [8]. Since no 122 epidemiological bulletins have been issued by the national government in recent years, scabies in 123 Venezuela could have already reached epidemic proportions.",

As a result of human migration, deforestation and climate change, a rapidly-increasing 148 number of cases have been reported inside Venezuela (61,576 cases between 1990 and 2016) and 149 exported elsewhere [2]. IVM has shown great promise as an endectocide against disease-150 transmitting vector, the phlebotomine fly (sandfly), with a maximum effect 1-2 days after 151 administration [1]. Both commercially-available IVM and its experimental derivatives have 152 shown antileishmanial activity against Leishmania major and Leishmania amazonensis in vitro at 153 micromolar concentrations [1,12]. However, since maximum plasma concentrations of standard doses of IVM in vivo only reach peak nanomolar concentrations, further research should focus 155 on the possible immunomodulatory role of IVM instead of its direct antiparasitic effect in 156 Leishmania sp. infection. Repurposing IVM could open new ground for alternative therapeutic 157 options to the painful, potentially toxic and prolonged therapy with pentavalent antimonials. 158 Chagas disease, caused by protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by hematophagous 159 triatomine bugs, is another chronic trypanosomatid infection with high cumulative prevalence in 160 Venezuela. Unfortunately, its burden is difficult to estimate since the national program for 161 disease surveillance and control was shut down in 2012 by the national government [2]. 162 Nonetheless, recent surveillance samplings of triatomines from the capital district have revealed 163 that up to 76.1% of the bugs were naturally infected, setting the stage for active transmission in 164 large urban areas and the persistent hyperendemic foci that remain in rural communities of 165",

Notably, Venezuela ranked 3rd in number of cases of Dengue reported 172 (125.000) during the 2010 epidemic, while Chikungunya and Zika incidence reports have gone 173 as high as 112 and 2124 cases per 100.000 people respectively[2]. IVM has shown to inhibit 174 replication of many Flaviviruses (Dengue, Zika, Yellow fever) and other arboviruses such as Page 10 of 16 Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, possibly targeting non-structural protein 3 helicase or 176 nuclear import/export proteins[1,13,14]. However, these findings have been shown in vitro, and177 equivalent plasma concentrations to standard IVM dosage in humans remain to be determined as 178 well as to whether these would prove appropriate within therapeutic ranges. Further trials are 179 required to assess the true impact of IVM in halting transmission of endemic arboviruses and its 180 potential large-scale use in humans. 181 Additionally, a more recent study reported the antiviral activity of IVM against severe acute 182 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, possibly due to inhibition of 183 importin \u03b1/\u03b21-dependent nuclear import of viral proteins [14]. The report also showed a 93% 184 decrease in viral RNA at 24 hours, and an effective clearance of all viral particles at 48 hours. No 185 toxicity effects were observed. As with Leishmania sp. infection, additional research is necessary 186 to determine other potential effects of IVM on viral and host targets at physiological 187 concentrations including nicotinic receptor activity, immunomodulation and spike protein 188 docking. 189 This is a clear example of the versatile uses of IVM also against other emerging pathogens.190However, controlled trials are required to prove its effects in humans, with careful consideration 191 to the neurotoxic effects of IVM, which can be amplified in context of a compromised blood-192 brain-barrier due to viral neurotropism and a pro-inflammatory state.193 Ivermectin to enhance WASH-MDA Integrated Approaches 194 Combining WASH and MDA interventions can potentially reduce multiple NTDs as a long-term 195 sustainable solution for many Venezuelan communities. In addition to deworming, STH transmission routes can be narrowed through WASH interventions that create barriers for 197 parasites [15]. This approach, however, requires an effective drug such as IVM that can interrupt 198 transmission of multiple nematodes to prevent reinfection. IVM is also effective against many 199 ectoparasites that can be prolific in the same impoverished, overcrowded areas with inadequate 200 sanitation and hygiene. 201 The primary barrier, sanitation, can prevent fecal pathogens from reaching the environment 202 through the safe collection and disposal of feces. Secondary barriers, such as water treatment and 203 hand washing and tertiary barriers including cleansing of vegetables and kitchen utensils 204 interrupt the transmission route of parasites already in the environment and prevent them from 205 reaching new susceptible hosts [16]. 206 Previous cluster-randomized trials have shown the impact of WASH conditions in reducing 207 roundworms [15,17,18] after deworming with Albendazole. However, Albendazole alone is less 208 effective for treating other STHs, such as whipworms and hookworms [17,19]. But a co-209 administered ivermectin-albendazole treatment against STHs can have a higher efficacy when 210 compared to a single-dose albendazole treatment [17,19]. Other authors suggest that the 211 combined ivermectin-albendazole MDA can maximize effects against malaria and STHs in areas212",

The crisis is allowing the formation of 218 disease corridors to neighboring and other countries in the region, breaching their already 219 vulnerable public health systems. 220 According to WHO statistics from 2006 and 2008, Venezuela ranked the lowest in deworming 221 coverage of pre and school-aged children amongst all 31 STH endemic countries in Latin 222 American and the Caribbean [21]. Thus, in a multidisciplinary effort led by scientists, 223 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and several international organizations, such as Rotary, 224 efforts have been put into the implementation of local deworming campaigns, the \"Deworming 225Venezuela\" project.226The versatility and broad therapeutic spectrum of IVM make it an outstanding tool against 227 multiple overlapping endemic diseases in Venezuela.

BeyondEhrlich's vision of the \"magic bullet\" as a compound targeting a single pathogen in an exclusive and highly precise fashion, ivermectin (IVM) has emerged as the first multi-target drug capable of tackling a broad range of endoparasites and ectoparasites, viruses, and disease-transmitting58 vectors [1]. Many tropical and subtropical regions, such as Venezuela, are endemic to numerous infectious agents with overlapping demographic and geographic distributions.
