Methods: An online survey was developed to assess changes in pediatric rheumatology practice due to the pandemic. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: From 70 countries, 493 pediatric rheumatologists (80.3% in pediatric rheumatology practice for 5 years) responded to the survey. Around 70% disagreed that the pandemic led to reduced prescription of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, conventional synthetic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Almost half were more likely to taper corticosteroids faster. One-fifth hesitated to switch the major immunosuppressant during a flare. Patients encountering difficulties obtaining hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab due to shortages were noted by 192 (38.9%) and 44 (8.9%), respectively. Twenty to 30% indicated that their patients had experienced a flare or delay in diagnosis/intervention due to postponed appointments.53% mentioned use of phone calls/smartphone applications while 47% shifted towards video consultations for patient care. Respondents indicated an increased number of patients with Kawasaki disease (30%), macrophage activation syndrome (15.6%), unusual vasculitic rashes (31.4%), and hyperinflammation (33.5%) during the pandemic. Conclusion: This is the largest survey to date addressing changes in pediatric rheumatology practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary changes were due to delays in clinic appointments, increase in use of virtual technologies, and concerns about the use of immunosuppressive therapies. An increased number of patients with Kawasaki disease/hyperinflammation mentioned by the respondents is noteworthy.",

Almost half of the respondents were more likely to taper corticosteroids faster, and one-fifth hesitated to switch a patient's major immunosuppressant drug during a flare. In addition, 15% agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic had led to the reduced prescription of biologic DMARDs. Pediatric rheumatology patients experienced delays in the diagnosis of a rheumatic disease or in receiving an intraarticular corticosteroid injection. Some patients had difficulties obtaining HCQ and tocilizumab, mainly due to delayed clinical appointments and shortages of the drugs due to their use for COVID-19 treatment or prophylaxis.

(221 respondents, 93% adult rheumatologists, 60% in rheumatology practice for >5 years), almost half indicated that they decreased use of biologic DMARDs, while 12.2% stated the same for csDMARDs [17] . In our study, these ratios were 15.8% and 9.1%, respectively. In another survey study among 271 rheumatologists from U.S.A. (9% pediatric rheumatologists and 3% were treating both adult and pediatric populations), 50% of the respondents disagreed that pandemic led them to reduce the use/ dosage/frequency of biologic drugs [18] . However, it is noteworthy that pediatric rheumatologists had higher odds of reducing the use/ dosage/frequency of biologic drugs compared to adult rheumatologists [18] . Gupta et al. reported that around two-third (66.5%) of the respondents were more inclined to initiate HCQ, and 64.2% were less inclined to change the major immunosuppressant drug during a flare (vs. 8% and 20% in our study, respectively) [17] . During the pandemic, rheumatologists were concerned most about the use of rituximab, followed by cyclophosphamide, as compared to cyclophosphamide followed by rituximab, in our study. In the study by Mehta et al., 56% of the respondents agreed that pandemic led them to reduce the use/ dosage/frequency of corticosteroids [18] . Similarly, around 60% preferred earlier taper of corticosteroid treatment during inactive disease in the study by Gupta et al. [17] vs. 43.8% in our study. The ratios regarding the use of csDMARDs and corticosteroids were similar between the study by Gupta et al. and our study. However, their respondents were more inclined to initiate HCQ, reduce the use of biologic DMARDs, and less inclined to change the major immunosuppressant during a flare, as compared to our respondents. The survey by Gupta et al. was taken two months before ours. In this period, we gained more scientific evidence about the use of biologics, the prophylactic potential of HCQ, and the risks associated with immunosuppressant use during the pandemic, which may explain some of the differences. Another point is that adult patients probably have more comorbidities than their pediatric counterparts, and old age is an independent risk-factor for severe COVID-19. These points might have caused more hesitation in adult rheumatologists while changing major immunosuppressants or initiating biologic DMARDs, as compared to pediatric rheumatologists.",

While there is ongoing debate about its efficacy for COVID-19 treatment, most studies have not supported a prophylactic effect of HCQ for COVID-19 [12,31\u00c033] . Moreover, several researchers have noted the risk of insufficient availability for patients who require HCQ for their underlying disease in case it is prescribed prophylactically for COVID-19 [34\u00c036]. In our study, more than one-third (38.9%) of the respondents stated that their patients experienced difficulties obtaining HCQ due to shortages. In a recent worldwide online survey study on HCQ/CQ use by rheumatologists, 71% of the respondents reported that at least some of their patients experienced HCQ/CQ shortages during the pandemic [37] .",

Of the respondents, 53% mentioned use of phone calls and/or smartphone applications while 47% shifted towards video consultations for patient care. Before the pandemic, the use of virtual technology in most healthcare systems was minimal [44] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual technologies were rapidly implemented to maintain access and continuity of medical care by minimizing in-person visits [45] . This rapid implementation may have caused some adaptation problems for both physicians and patients or their parents. This may be the main reason for delays in patient care. Shenoy et al. recently reported their experience with implementing teleconsultations (mainly through What-sApp video conferences) for the care of patients with rheumatic diseases in India [46] . Teleconsultations was accepted by 74% of the patients at the beginning, but increased with time. The median satisfaction of the patients from teleconsultations was nine on a 0\u00c010 scale (10, the highest). And, three-fourths of respondents mentioned that they would have stopped drugs or self-medicated without teleconsultation [46] . Thus, during the restrictions dictated by the pandemic, virtual technologies were a good source for continuing patient care, and the problems with adaptation can be overcome with time and experience.",

On the other hand, the main strength of the study was the very high number of respondents from different countries. The majority of respondents were experienced pediatric rheumatologists, as well.

In addition, an increase in the number of patients with Kawasaki disease or hyperinflammation syndrome was mentioned by a substantial number of respondents was noteworthy and consistent with the increased reports in the literature. Better understanding of the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the community of pediatric rheumatologists will help tailor future updated recommendations regarding the management of our patients during the pandemic, school and social attendance according to the needs of routine clinical practice [16] .",
