Our analysis is based on a unique dataset that tracks various health outcomes and workplace risks among healthcare workers during the first four months of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The setting provides an exceptional opportunity to test for work-related disparities in health, while controlling for confounding determinants of the SES-health gradient. We find that low-SES nurses were systematically more likely to contract COVID-19 as a result of workplace exposure. These differentials existed in all healthcare institutions, but were particularly large in non-hospital settings. In contrast, we find no relationship between SES and non work-related infection rates. The differences in workplace infection rates are substantially larger than those implied by standard 'task-based' indices of transmission risk, and cannot be attributable to easily identifiable metrics of workplace risk. Together, our results show how subtle differences in work conditions or job duties can substantially contribute to the SES-health gradient.",

Moreover, the estimated SES gradient is similar when we restrict the sample to nurses who received a PCR test.

Indeed, we find that Low-SES nurses were more likely to have contact with a COVID-19 patient. Conditional on workplace contact, however, we find no significant differences in the duration of exposure or the probability of a high-risk contact.

SESbased differences in adherence to safety protocols could arise from different levels of knowledge about the disease and the sources of transmission (Lange, 2011) or heterogeneous preferences towards risk (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010) . Although we cannot entirely rule out this channel, several pieces of evidence contradict a behavioral mechanism. First, unlike the general public, who may have misperceived the risks from COVID-19 early in the pandemic (Alsan et al., 2020; Simonov et al., 2020) , frontline healthcare providers were more cognizant of the risks of the disease and the potential sources of infection. Second, we find no systematic differences in infections rates among nurses who were not exposed to COVID-19 at work, suggesting similar levels of risk-taking outside the workplace. Finally, we find systematic differences in the magnitude of the SES-infection gradient across different healthcare institutions, with effect sizes that are three times larger in non-hospital settings. These heterogeneous effects are inconsistent with a simple behavioral mechanism, which should affect risk-taking similarly across institutions.",

These measures have been used to measure the size and characteristics of at-risk populations (Baylis et al., 2020b; Baker, Peckman and Seixas, 2020) , to evaluate differential economic effects across workers , and to guide the policy response (Aum, Lee and Shin, 2020; Chopra, Devereux and Lahiri, 2020) . To measure viral transmission risk, researchers typically combine O*NET data that provide detailed information on a range of specific job requirements (such as physical proximity, frequency of face-to-face interactions, etc.) with assessments from health experts on the role of these factors for viral transmission risk (see Baylis et al., 2020a; Beauregard, Connolly and Haeck, 2020) . Although the ordering of the O*NET 'task-based' measure of infection risk aligns with our estimates of observed workplace infection risk, it drastically understates the disparities in infection risk across occupations and does not account for the large differences in infection risk across healthcare institutions. Taken together, our results show how large disparities in workplace infection risk can arise, even across workers in similar occupations with similar tasks. The findings provide a cautionary note for subjective task-based measures of infection risk, and highlight the critical need for data on incidence of workplace COVID-19 infections across a variety of occupations and industries.",

Nevertheless, the magnitude of the differences in risk do not align. Our preferred estimates imply that the former group had a 50 percent higher risk of workplace-related infection. In contrast, the gap in infection risk on the 100 point 'task-based' index is 4 points, less than one third of the cross-occupation standard deviation in risk. Combining our estimated differences in infection risk with the occupation/industry risk index, we calculate that an implausible 98 percent of jobs carry zero risk of transmission risk. 18 We also found that the occupational differences in workplace infection risk were three times higher in non-hospital settings that were not identifiable in occupational-based indices.",
