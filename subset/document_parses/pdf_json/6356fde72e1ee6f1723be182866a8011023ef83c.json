SARS-CoV-2 can spread efficiently in humans, with a basic reproductive number of 2.2e2.5, as determined in Wuhan, suggesting high transmissibility [1, 2] . Large outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community setting have been reported [3] . However, previous experience of an outbreak of MERS-CoV infection in Korea, where one single patient infected many others in an overcrowded hospital setting, raised the concerns about potential occurrence of large outbreaks in the hospital settings [4] . Furthermore, patients with existing diseases admitted in hospitals as well as health care workers are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and at a high risk for COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality [5] . We herein report the preparedness of a large hospital in Taiwan to respond to the COVID-19 threat while maintaining core functions of health care during the pandemic.",

We instituted the standards of PPE requirement, infection control measures and environmental cleansing for clinical care and transportation of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients in the hospital. The logistics department prepared a negative pressure room expansion plan and ventilator allocation for large-scale community outbreak, checked the storage and consumption of important medical supplies, including PPE and alcohol sanitizer.",

Hospital staff with symptoms would be asked to take two real-time reverse transcriptaseepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, at least 24 h apart, before they were allowed to go back to work after improvement of the symptoms.

Our HCWs and patient also followed our national policy, wearing mask in hospital since late January. A total of 5722 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in our hospital during the study period between December 31, 2019 and May 31, 2020. Twenty-five patients were confirmed COVID-19, including two inpatients at the time of diagnosis [ Fig. 1 ]. Our first inpatient was a case of community-acquired pneumonia, and COVID-19 was diagnosed on Feb 17, 2020, two weeks after her hospitalization. On hundred fifty-four HCWs having close contact with the patient were tested, and all showed negative results in RT-PCR. However, four of our HCWs (three nurses and one sanitor) were infected in a nosocomial outbreak associated with the second inpatient diagnosed on Feb 26, 2020. This patient, who had no abnormal TOCC, was not diagnosed until she developed a pneumonia 10 days after admission. We did a thoroughly investigation for the outbreak and its association with the first inpatient. The first and second inpatients were hospitalized with five days apart, and they were admitted into two different departments in two different buildings respectively. During the hospitalization, the two patients did not receive examination or treatment in the same space at the same time. The medical staff who take care of them are also in different groups. The four infected HCWs didn't having contact with the first inpatient. Based on the investigation result, we believed the second inpatient is a case of community acquired COVID-19, and she was asymptomatic upon admission [9] . Responding to the outbreak, we implemented a more rigorous visitor restriction and opened an outdoor pharmacy to reduce the people flow in hospital. We universally requested our staff and patients to wear surgical masks and enhance hand hygiene, the outbreak ward was closed after a complete environmental cleaning. All clerk, intern, post-graduate year residents were all prohibited from taking care of patient in the isolation/quarantine ward. Our eTCB was reinforced by widely testing SARS-CoV-2 and isolating or quarantining all patients with respiratory or systemic symptoms or pulmonary infiltrates found on chest films. After global pandemic was declared in March 2020, all the confirmed cases were identified at our outdoor quarantine station or epidemic clinic, and the results of PCR testing for 146 symptomatic HCWs in CGMH were all negative.",
