Prevalence data show that alcohol and tobacco use start at an early age, whilst precocity has been associated with an increased risk to develop substance use disorders [5] . According to the EnCLASS survey carried out in France in 2018 among 20,000 middle and high school students aged 11 to 18, alcohol is the first psychoactive substance children experiment with [6] . The number of students found to have drunk at least one alcoholic beverage in their life in Grade 6 (44.3%) clearly indicates that this initiation to alcohol begins in primary school. However, less than one in ten middle school students in Grade 6 (8.6%) reported that they had been drinking in the past month. The number of students using tobacco is significantly lower at the beginning of the middle school (1.4% last month smoking), although 7 .6% reported that they had already smoked. As with lifetime use of alcohol, the \"middle school years\" seem to mainly Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18 , 3852 2 of 17 be a phase where young adolescents are introduced to tobacco. For the two substances studied, boys experimented more than girls. Alcohol is still the first substance used during adolescence, followed by tobacco. Moving from Grade 9 (last grade of middle school) to Grade 10 (first grade of high school) is characterized by pursuing experimenting. As is true for middle school, alcohol is the most commonly used substance among high school students (85.0%), considerably more than tobacco (53.0%).",

            "text": "Substance use motives among young people are manifold. Alcohol and tobacco use behaviours are related not only to individual factors, such as poor awareness of druguse-related risks, but also to the social context young people find themselves in; this is particularly important in shaping or in failing to shape their self-esteem and their ability to develop favourable health behaviours. For prevention actions to be efficacious in improving risks awareness and social skills, it is important to implement early interventions; it has been suggested that preventive actions among young people should be initiated early on in their lives [7] [8] [9] [10] . Continuity in action over several school years, especially during the transition between primary and secondary school, could also be a factor predictive of efficacy [8, 9, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Concerning the specific qualities that make prevention programmes at school efficacious among schoolchildren, a few studies have shown the benefits of a theoretical base integrating the promotion of health and the development of psychosocial skills through the use of individuals' experiences and resources derived from their environment [8, 10, 11, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . In addition, the training of relevant staff and the integration of the educational community, parents in particular, could have a favourable impact on prevention interventions [8, 11, 17, 19] .",

The control group received a non-specific health promotion and prevention intervention in a two hour session, for students in their last year of primary school. The name given to this control intervention was \"Cap Sant\u00e9\", which could translate as \"Heading for health\". Assessment measures were the same at baseline and across the three follow-up time points respectively at 6 months, 18 months, and 30 months after the start of the Primavera and Cap Sant\u00e9 interventions. The baseline assessment took place in the last year of primary school, before the start of the intervention; the first follow-up time point also occurred in the last year of primary school, but after the intervention. The second assessment endpoint took place during the first year of secondary school, before the summer holidays. The last follow-up time point was due to take place 30 months after the start of the intervention. However, the SARS-COV2 pandemic crisis made it impossible to carry out the last assessment, at 30 months from the launch of the intervention (spring 2020).",

Randomization of the school classes or schoolchildren was not used in order to limit a potential bias of interindividual influence. Indeed, as the Primavera prevention programme aimed to have a direct impact on the schoolchildren's educational environment (class, school, and home), random allocation between intervention and control groups applied to schoolchildren from the same classroom or the same school would have created biased assessment conditions (the intervention would have had an impact on the control group). Clustered randomization is often used in this type of assessment for similar reasons [19, [23] [24] [25] [26] . To have a sufficiently large pool of participants, a sample of twelve secondary state schools from the Amiens academy was constituted over a restricted geographical zone. The sample was composed of schools in a geographical area within a 30 km radius of the prevention programme centre (Saint-Quentin, France). Among them, the four schools most distant from the restricted geographical zone were excluded, to optimize commuting for the prevention programme organizers. In all, eight secondary schools were randomized, providing a theoretical pool of 826 schoolchildren in first-year secondary school, corresponding to a recruiting pool of 41 primary schools. Randomization was carried out using the randomized block method. Two blocks of four secondary schools were computer generated. Allocation was 1:1. Figure 1 shows a flow chart of the recruitment process for the schools and the participants. should devote a maximum amount of time to workshops per class and per year. The programme aims to reinforce psychosocial skills, in particular self-esteem, self-efficacy, motivation, adaptation strategies, and empowerment. The experiential approach, thus, encourages subjects to think about their way of life, about what they consume and what makes-or prevents them-to consume, the negative and positive consequences of these behaviours, their ability to act to find individual and collective satisfaction and well-being, taking into account the physiological and psychosocial limitations that characterize each individual. From their own experience and experience shared within a group, individuals become aware of their sources of satisfaction, enabling them to find pleasure in life, avoid pitfalls, and remain free to make their own choices. The experiential approach, thus, aims to provide subjects with tools that will help them, particularly in terms of prevention, to understand their own life experience, in their ",

The efficacy of the programme was demonstrated on one of the primary outcomes, past-month alcohol use, after adjustment during follow-up time point 2 (ORa2 = 0.07 [95% CI: 0.01-0.66]), at the end of the first year of secondary school, i.e., at the end of the second year of the prevention programme. The probability of experimenting with tobacco (second primary endpoint) was not different between the group exposed to the Primavera programme and that exposed to the control programme. The effect of the Primavera programme compared to the control programme was more contrasted for the secondary outcomes: lesser probability of current alcohol use at follow-up time point 1 (end of primary school) but poorer PSS3 psychosocial skills for \"When I have decided to do something, I see it through\" at follow-up time point 2, a difference that was not found after complete A2 adjustment. However, it is important to note that the students from the Primavera group had poorer baseline psychosocial skills PSS2 and PSS4-6 (including the complete adjustment model for PSS2) before the start of the Primavera or the control interventions, differences that disappeared after the start of the prevention interventions. An improvement in psychosocial skills PSS2 could, thus, reasonably be attributed to the Primavera programme (\"When I have problems, I ask my friends for help\"). Despite the fact that an adjusted comparison could not be conducted for the denormalization of alcohol and tobacco use at home, intergroup differences concerning the denormalization at school were found at follow-up time point 1, with greater denormalization of tobacco use but a lesser denormalization for alcohol use in the Primavera group compared to the control group. This is, to our knowledge, the first published randomized controlled study on a universal school-based prevention programme on alcohol and tobacco use and psychosocial skill development in France. The Primavera programme met most of the recommended criteria for the development of prevention programmes against alcohol and tobacco use in schools: beyond the need to address substance use issues, it aims more widely to develop psychosocial skills [7, 8, 11, 17, 19, 21] , it is multimodal [8, 11, 17, 19] and pluri-annual [9, 12] . In addition, the programme is implemented across the primary-secondary school transition, a critical period in terms of emotional, social, and academic adjustment [13] [14] [15] . This programme is in current use in French schools by several trained teams. Qualitative feedback from participant schools shows that Primavera is well received and accepted by educational teams, children, and parents. For example, teachers reported that, following their experience with the Primavera intervention, they continued to use an experiential approach, when appropriate, in some teaching sessions.",

To compensate for this, all the outcomes were introduced in adjustment model A2. Secondly, after randomization, the two groups did not follow programmes of the same intensity. The control prevention programme had a more limited duration than the Primavera programme and was not prolonged beyond the first year. Thirdly, the intended number of students for the two groups could not be reached, and attrition was higher than expected after the students' transition from primary to secondary school. The transition from primary to secondary school, which proved to be the most delicate stage in the follow-up of the samples, could partly explain this high attrition. The fact that some of the students went to non-state secondary schools or moved away is the most plausible hypothesis identified by the school nurses for the reduction in numbers observed. Fourthly, the last assessment (time point 3) could not be conducted at the end of the third year of the programme due to the health crisis brought on by the SAR-COV2 pandemic. Finally, regulatory constraints did not enable a follow-up of the students' individual evolution between assessment time points; as in most studies of this type [8, 19, 35, 37] , a cluster randomization was the only choice, and this reduced the power of the statistical analyses.",

For the first time in France, using a rigorous methodology, it has been possible to demonstrate the usefulness of implementing a multimodal, generic, universal, pluri-annual, prevention programme based on an experiential approach.",
