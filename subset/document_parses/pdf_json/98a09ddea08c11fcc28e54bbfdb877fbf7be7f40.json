Clinicians involved in managing public health crises are prone to experiencing a range of emotions including anxiety, fear, and grief that can lead to disasterrelated distress. [1] [2] [3] This has become increasingly evident as the pandemic continues, and these reactions impact the resilience and retention of the ED workforce. 4, 5 Critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) is a recommended practice for processing clinician reactions and may reduce the incidence of disaster-related distress. 6, 7 It is likely most effective when performed as soon as possible in time and place to an event. 7, 8 However, the coronavirus pandemic demands that emergency clinicians balance a variety of stressors while on shift including high acuity, patient surge, and risks to personal physical safety. In response, we designed and implemented a video-based ED debriefing program to support the well-being of our emergency clinicians. Our program had the following objectives: 1) to facilitate discussion regarding emotional reactions to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); 2) to provide peer-to-peer support in an era of social distancing; and (3) to identify resources to improve self-care and build resilience. The objective of this paper was to describe the details of our program and report the results of our evaluation of its acceptability and initial impact on emergency clinicians providing care during the coronavirus pandemic.",

An invitation was sent to ED attending physicians, resident physicians, and NPPs by email to participate in voluntary debriefings on well-being and emotional reactions to COVID-19. To increase psychological safety, the email stated that each session would be for a single clinician role group (eg, attending physicians only) and identified the facilitators (DLM and JKT, both present for all sessions). 9 The email provided a link to the secure, password-protected Zoom meeting.

Discussion (45 minutes): The facilitators prompt reflection on emotional reactions to recent events in the ED or at home, steering the discussion toward empathic validation, normalizing reactions instead of problem solving. Facilitators often modeled these statements at the start of this phase as an \"ice-breaker,\" and communicated with participants using the chat function in addition to the video. 3.

Emergency clinicians sought opportunities to understand their peers' emotional reactions to COVID-19 and support the range of emotional responses to the uncertainties and risks pervading both work and home environments. Debriefing also provided emergency clinicians with a platform to discuss unmet needs to improve self-care and build resilience. Unlike critical-event debriefing and debriefing in simulation, there is less of a consensus around the best approach to debriefing clinicians on the emotional impact of a long-term public health crisis and occupational risk. 6, [15] [16] [17] We therefore employed an explorative approach to debriefing, focusing on empathy, compassion, and normalizing reactions. However, as the pandemic continues, debriefing specific emotions such as anxiety, guilt, isolation, and grief may become increasingly important at different phases of the crisis. 2, 3 Seventy-seven percent of respondents participated in two or more sessions. However, the voluntary nature of these debriefings may predispose our population to represent a subgroup of emergency clinicians who are more comfortable with sharing their emotional reactions with peers and showing vulnerability. This may influence our survey results and suggests that debriefing with peers may be a strategy to safeguard well-being for some but not all emergency clinicians. Recognizing this variability, we recommend that EDs interested in implementing a peer-based debriefing program incorporate it into a comprehensive approach to clinician wellness.",

It is possible that low staff turnover of our attending group contributes to increased comfort with vulnerability. There may be less heterogeneity in professional experience for attendings than NPPs, influencing their perceived comfort with speaking up in these sessions. Hierarchy in clinical experience may also contribute to this finding. The attending leadership role may make speaking up easier, whereas NPPs are a clinically supervised group. Finally, the mean number of participants per session was higher for NPPs than attending physicians; this may also have contributed to the psychological safety of the debriefing environment. Further investigation is warranted as we grow the program to include other frontline emergency providers (eg, nurses and pharmacists). In the meantime, we plan to mitigate this potential factor by using Zoom's breakout-room function.",
