Its role in the coagulation cascade may partly explain the association of hypocalcemia with such outcomes. Calcium may also result in arterial relaxation and reduced blood pressure through perivascular receptor activation, leading Patients with hypocalcemia had a higher number of comorbid conditions (Charlson index \u2265 3-39.9% vs 28%). One possible explanation could be the higher prevalence of renal dysfunction in such patients predisposing them to low calcium levels [9] . The incidence of acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, sepsis, and arrhythmias were higher for PE patients with hypocalcemia. The increased incidence of the above conditions may be partly due to more comorbid conditions in patients with hypocalcemia. Additionally, hypocalcemia itself has been linked to certain complications. Severe hypocalcemia has been linked to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia and seizures [10] . Low calcium levels have been specifically discussed in relation to several neurological and cardiac complications, including seizures, status epilepticus, and coma among other complications, although there is discussion as to whether or not these complications may be explained by other causes unrelated to calcium [10] . Moreover, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, hypocalcemia has been found to be associated with increased risk of acute respiratory failure and mortality, underscoring the risk of more complicated hospitalization courses [11] .",

Reports have indicated that pulmonary thromboembolism patients with hypocalcemia had higher death rates than those without hypocalcemia [5] . Additionally, there is an association between hypocalcemia and increased mortality in critically ill patients [12] . In critically ill patients, hypocalcemia is thought to occur most often because of heart failure and hyperadrenergic states [13] . The mechanism of calcium disequilibrium in critically ill patients may be due to end-organ resistance to parathyroid hormone, impairment of the parathyroid hormone secondary to catecholamine excess or pro-inflammatory cytokine release and inhibited parathyroid hormone release and cellular redistribution of calcium. Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency may also be present in critically ill patients and is reported to be prevalent in as many as 78% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients [13] . Patients with PE may require ICU hospitalizations and may require mechanical ventilation, catheterization, and thrombolytic use [14] . These results warrant further studies to confirm these findings and investigate possible mechanisms.",

There are several prognostic assessment tools that exist for PE patients, including the pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI) and the simplified PESI (sPESI) [15, 16] . Moreover, imaging and cardiac biomarkers are also used to stratify patients with an intermediate and high risk of PE [17] . Previous research has identified hypocalcemia to be an independent predictor of 30-day mortality following a PE. An optimal prediction rule, which contains hypocalcemia and several variables from the PESI and sPESI, has been shown to have higher predictive value and validity than the PESI and sPESI respectively [5] . Our findings endorse the relationship between hypocalcemia and in-hospital mortality that has been discussed in the literature, and hypocalcemia may be a valuable future prognostic tool for PE patients.",

This study examines numerous demographics of PE hospitalizations, offering a comprehensive and thorough overview of PE hospitalizations. We obtained the population used for this study from the NIS, an extensive, multiethnic hospital-based registry. However, as with any study, there are limitations that should be noted. Data from the NIS is subject to biases associated with retrospective studies. Additionally, the NIS reports information on hospitalizations and not from individual patients; therefore, patients admitted numerous times would be included more than once in the data set. The database also uses ICD-10 codes to report information, leaving it subject to coding errors. Thus, hypocalcemia itself may not have been coded in every patient. Additionally, the exact etiology of hypocalcemia cannot be elicited through NIS. Finally, the NIS does not include information about the severity of the diagnosis at the time of admission. For example, it does not include the precise calcium level of patients with hypocalcemia.",

Patients hospitalized with a PE and concurrent hypocalcemia may be at higher risk of numerous in-hospital complications, including sepsis, arrhythmias, acute kidney injury, and death. The findings of our study may reflect the effectiveness of using calcium as a prognostic marker in patients hospitalized with a pulmonary embolism. ",
