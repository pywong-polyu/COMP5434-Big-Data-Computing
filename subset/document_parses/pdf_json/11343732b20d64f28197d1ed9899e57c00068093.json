Garbero et al. report the results of the COMPACT-2 trial investigating high volume coupled plasma filtration and adsorption (CPFA) in 115 patients suffering from septic shock [1] . The study was prematurely determined due to a potential harmful effect of CPFA as mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) was 54% in the treatment and 29% in the control group. In particular, early mortality after 3 days was more than twice as high in the CPFA group and a significant treatment dose-response effect on mortality even suggested a putative causal relationship.",

Potential effectors of this observation require careful consideration. Both CPFA and full blood hemoadsorption have the potential to remove both injurious and protective substances involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis. It is, therefore, conceivable that extraction of protective factors diminishes beneficial physiological responses such as immune homeostasis restoration, endothelial integrity re-establishment as well as a reduction of coagulopathy.",

In contrast to CPFA and CytoSorb hemoadsorption, TPE combines two therapeutic measures in a singular intervention [5] . It effectively removes injurious mediators such as proinflammatory cytokines, endothelial destabilizing factors (e.g. Angiopoietin-2, Heparanase-1) and molecules involved in intravascular coagulation (e.g. von-Willebrand factor) ( Fig. 1) . Simultaneously, the exchange of septic plasma with that from healthy donors leads to a replenishment of protective but consumed factors involved in anti-inflammatory processes (e.g. immunoglobulins), in endothelial stabilization (e.g. Angiopoietin-1, Heparanase-2) and in anti-coagulation (e.g. Antithrombin-III, Protein C, ADAMTS-13).
