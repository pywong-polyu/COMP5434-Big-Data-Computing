We conducted a prospective cohort study including 321 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 through RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs. Quantitative Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA cycle threshold values were used to calculate the viral load in log 10 copies/mL. Disease severity at the end of follow up was categorized into mild, moderate, and severe. Primary endpoint was a composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death (n = 85, 26.4%). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load over the second quartile (\u2265 7.35 log 10 copies/mL, p = 0.003) and second tertile (\u2265 8.27 log 10 copies/mL, p = 0.01) were associated to unfavorable outcome in the unadjusted logistic regression analysis. However, in the final multivariable analysis, viral load was not independently associated with an unfavorable outcome. Five predictors were independently associated with increased odds of ICU admission and/or death: age \u2265 70 years, SpO 2 , neutrophils > 7.5 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L, lactate dehydrogenase \u2265 300 U/L, and C-reactive protein \u2265 100 mg/L. In summary, nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load on admission is generally high in patients with COVID-19, regardless of illness severity, but it cannot be used as an independent predictor of unfavorable clinical outcome.",

Different studies have already addressed this issue, identifying clinical signs and several biomarkers as predictors of unfavorable outcome 5-7 . In this regard, different studies have addressed the possible association between the viral load in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and the clinical outcomes. Some studies have reported that a high number of virus copies in NP swabs, mainly defined as a cycle threshold (Ct) < 25 or < 22 in the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), was an independent risk factor for intubation and/or death [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, other studies have not found independent association between low Ct values and critical care admission or death 12, 13 .

Consequently, this parameter cannot be used as a predictor of COVID-19 unfavorable outcome, defined as admission to ICU and/or death. Moreover, this prospective cohort confirms that the independent risk factors for ICU admission or death are those previously identified by Salto-Alejandre S. et al 7 . Thus, at first hospital evaluation, advanced age, hypoxemia, neutrophilia, and increased levels of LDH and CRP have high sensitivity and specificity to accurately discriminate patients that would potentially develop a critical disease from those with a favorable course. The evidence to date reveals that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and the pathogenicity and virulence of this microorganism is not fully understood. Furthermore, as there are many methods to perform the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome, the interpretation and comparison of results in literature is highly controversial. As an example, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has shown slightly higher sensitivity than standard RT-PCR 15 . Table 5 . Independent predictors of unfavorable outcome (ICU admission and/or death): Multivariable logistic regression model. The final multivariable model was composed of five variables (therefore 17 events per variable) demonstrated as independent predictors of unfavorable outcome: Age \u2265 70 years, SpO 2 < 95%, neutrophils > 7.5 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L, LDH \u2265 300 U/L, and CRP \u2265 100 mg/L). Such model reported a Beta Coefficient of -4.08 (standard error = 0.46), a Wald statistic of 78.72 (degrees of freedom = 1), and an overall apparent performance of 84.2% (sensitivity = 70.6%, specificity = 89.4%, PPV = 70.3%, NPV = 89.1%). The variables included were explanatory and contributed to giving the model an ability to explain roughly 52.1% of the variation of the outcome (Nagelkerke R 2 value = 0.521). A higher nasopharyngeal viral load (above the second quartile or the second tertile) was not independently linked to an increased risk of ICU admission or death. Several previous studies have demonstrated that a high value of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract (URT), defined as a Ct < 25 or < 22 in the RT-PCR, is an independent risk factor for respiratory failure 8 , intubation, or death 9 , using multivariate logistic regression and time-based analyses 10 . Pujadas et al., using a Cox proportional hazards model, also showed an independent association between viral load in the URT and mortality 11 .",

Argyropoulos et al., on the other hand, showed that viral load was inversely correlated with disease severity, being higher in patients with mild COVID-19 16 . The reason for this conflictive result was, however, that NP sampling in patients with severe or critical symptoms was obtained at a later time point in the disease course. Lastly, Lee et al. found that viral load quantification was similar among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients 17 , and our results support this conclusion. Certainly, most patients in the present cohort who suffered an unfavorable outcome had a high SARS-CoV-2 viral load quantification (above the 50th percentile) at hospital admission, but half of the patients with mild COVID-19 also exceeded said limit.

For higher viral load cut-off points, the probability of belonging to the mild or moderate group was similar.

Nevertheless, according to the Spanish nationwide seroepidemiological study, this finding should not be surprising: a third of the population with positive PCR was asymptomatic, and 20% of the seropositive symptomatic participants did not have previous SARS-CoV-2 genome detection 18 .

The study has also some limitations. The viral load quantification in the URT samples, through NP swabs, was only performed at a single time point, and we have not data on the dynamics according to the clinical outcomes. Additional synchronous and longitudinal sampling from other sources, such as blood or stools, would have been important comparators. Regarding the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load, further studies are required to refine the use of the standard and novel techniques, which is especially important due to variabilities in specimen collection, the lack of systematic quantification assays, and inconsistencies in protocols between different laboratories. Also, the lack of association of NP viral load with unfavorable outcome, should be confirmed when COVID-19 be caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 variants.",
