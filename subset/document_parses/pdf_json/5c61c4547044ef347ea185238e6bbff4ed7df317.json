SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 29.8 kb that encodes 29 different proteins [1, 4, 5] . The virus has four structural proteins: surface glycoprotein (spike), envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). Spike is a key protein on the viral surface, which mainly binds to the host cell surface protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate the entry of the virus into the target cell [6, 7] . The virus has 16 non-structural proteins (nsps); the first 11 are encoded within ORF1a, while the last 5 are encoded within ORF1b. In addition to the structural and non-structural proteins, the virus contains nine accessory proteins named ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORF9c, and ORF10 [5, 8, 9] .",

Several projects for effective vaccine development have been undertaken, and some of these vaccines are now commercially available for human administration [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Most efforts to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 focus on the spike protein as the main antigenic target. Although the spike protein is a promising B-cell epitope that is expected to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies, a mixture of diverse B-and T-cell epitopes would be more effective in ensuring a robust and life-long humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The major challenge in developing such an efficient vaccine is to discover a group of appropriate B-and T-cell epitopes that can confer immunity against a wide range of viral strains. More importantly, the current emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant mutations worldwide warrants an urgent need for the identification of appropriate B-and T-cell epitopes of the original virus as well as of the new variants of the virus.",

This approach is considered one of the most effective for discovering antigens by screening the entire microbial proteome using various prediction tools [16] . The in silico vaccine candidate identification approach, designated as reverse vaccinology (RV), starts with the genetic material of the selected pathogen with the subsequent performance of rational computational predictions to come up with a manageable list of targets to be validated experimentally. This approach significantly reduces the time needed to develop a vaccine and provides reasonable targets that are identified based on the selection criteria. RV has been frequently applied with success to discover vaccine candidates for various types of pathogenic microbes (mostly bacteria) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . To date, however, RV has not been rigorously applied to the analysis of viral genomes to identify potential candidates for viral vaccine development.",

Although a limited number of studies have analyzed the whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2, they identified epitopes without further comprehensive workflow to generate a shortlist of the most promising epitopes [26, 27, 30] . Instead, a long list of potential epitopes confined only to the T-cell category is provided, requiring further analysis and validation. Furthermore, most of these reports examined the sequence of the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome without considering emerging mutational events that may cause epitope escape. This type of epitope escape may reduce the efficacy of the immune response, resulting in sub-neutralizing antibodies that can generate antibody-dependent enhancement [31] [32] [33] .",

The identified candidate epitopes were further analyzed based on their predicted antigenicity, allele coverage, and induction of interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3). Furthermore, mutation analysis of all variant isolates was performed to determine the conservation of the selected epitopes. Our comprehensive approach includes both horizontal (across the whole coding regions of the genome) and vertical (across many sequenced genomes) screening for B-and T-cell epitopes. Based on our results, we provide a shortlist of the candidate epitopes for designing a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the usefulness of a comprehensive RV workflow that can be applied to other pathogens as well.",

In addition, MHC binding predictions were used for T-cell epitopes, in which a median consensus percentile cutoff \u226420 was used for CD4(+) T-cell epitopes, and a phenotypic frequency with a 6% cutoff was used for CD8(+) T-cell epitopes. In addition, allele coverage was calculated for the CD8(+) epitopes using the 12 most common alleles (HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*23:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*44:02, and HLA-B*44:03).

Briefly, the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved for the identification of both B-cell-and T-cell-candidate antigens (hereafter denoted as B-cell and T-cell antigens, respectively). The selection of antigenic protein candidates was based on the cellular location of the protein, protective antigenicity score, calculated epitope densities, and allele coverage. As for the epitope analysis, epitopes were prioritized based on their predicted antigenicity score, followed by toxicity prediction and host homology. For T-cell epitopes, the ability to induce IFN-\u03b3 and allele coverage were additionally assessed for selection. After the candidate epitopes were selected as both T-cell and B-cell antigens, mutation analysis was carried out to determine the distribution of the mutations observed in the current SARS-CoV-2 variants, within the selected proteins, as well as in the identified epitopes. All of the online analysis tools used in this study were adjusted for default parameters unless otherwise specified. Our RV-based systematic workflow was built to provide a list of the most promising candidate epitopes for the induction of B cells and T cells to augment protective immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus for better vaccine development. Figure 1 . Illustration of our workflow of reverse vaccinology applied for the in silico screening of immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 viral epitopes. First, data retrieval of the selected pathogen (SARS-CoV-2) was carried out, which was followed by protein analysis through the determination of three aspects (cellular localization, antigenicity, and epitope density). Subsequently, the identified B-cell and T-cell epitopes were analyzed based on their predicted antigenicity, allele coverage, and IFN-\u03b3 induction (for T-cell epitopes). Next, epitopes were further checked for their toxicity and host homology. Finally, mutation analysis was conducted to determine the conservation of the selected epitopes.",

Next, epitope density was calculated for each selected protein, and the values are summarized in Table 1 (for B-cell antigens) and Table 2 (for T-cell antigens). For the selected T-cell antigens, epitope density was calculated based on the activation of both CD8(+) T cells and CD4(+) T cells, along with the allele coverage for CD8(+) T cells ( Table 2 ). The allele coverage was calculated using the following B-cell epitope densities for three virion membrane proteins (nucleocapsid protein, membrane glycoprotein, and spike protein) were found to have similar scores at around 0.03, while ORF10 had the highest epitope density with a value of 0.131, which is 4-fold higher than that of the other three proteins. The CD4(+) epitope densities of T-cell antigens ranged from 0.015 to 0.062 (nsp6 (0.062), nsp4 (0.044), ORF3a (0.036), ORF10 (0.026), and low values for both spike protein and nsp3 (0.015 and 0.017, respectively). Thus, the spike protein and nsp3 are less likely to activate CD4(+) cells (helper T cells) because both proteins were predicted to contain fewer CD4(+) epitopes compared to the other antigenic proteins (nsp6, nsp4, ORF3a, and ORF10). In contrast, CD8(+) epitope densities ranged from 0.058 to 0.131 for the T-cell antigens; the highest value was obtained for ORF10 (0.131), followed by the nsp4 protein (0.080). Thus, ORF10 and nsp4 are very likely to activate CD8(+) cells (i.e., cytotoxic T cells). As for the allele coverage score, the lowest score (0.25) was assigned to ORF10, followed by nsp6 with a score of 0.75. The remaining three proteins (spike protein, nsp3, and nsp4) exhibited the highest score of 1.0 with maximum allele coverage, suggesting that these three proteins have a wider coverage within the population.",

            "text": "It is well known that IFN-\u03b3 plays a crucial role in defense activation and the regulation of pathways to elicit the antiviral activity of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells [48, 49] . In addition to the antigenicity score, the ability of the T-cell epitopes to induce IFN-\u03b3 was predicted using the IFNepitope online tool (Table 4 ). Subsequently, allele coverage was calculated for CD8(+) T-cell epitopes for the 12 most distributed alleles within human populations (Table 4 ). For the CD4(+) T-cell epitopes, allele coverage was assessed based on the IEDB consensus percentile with 10 % as a cutoff to enhance selection stringency. The IEDB consensus percentile is a uniform scale that allows comparisons between different predictors of HLA class II responses at the population level. This is a preferred method for the prediction of affinity to CD4(+) as the median consensus percentile (MCP), in which a lower value reflects a higher affinity of the epitope for CD4(+) cells. Analysis of the T-cell epitopes resulted in the identification of five epitopes for CD8(+) cells and three epitopes for CD4(+) cells, which were found to fulfill three criteria, namely antigenicity, IFN-\u03b3 induction, and allele coverage, for both CD8(+) and CD4(+) cells (Table 4 ). Among the T-cell epitopes, the five epitopes for the stimulation of CD8(+) cells were predicted to have maximum allele coverage (12 out of 12 allele subtypes) with different antigenicity scores. The highest antigenicity score of 1.27 was observed in the third epitope of nsp3, which was followed by the nsp6 and ORF10 epitopes with scores of 1.11 and 0.90, respectively. These three epitopes were predicted to be CD8(+) cell-activating epitopes. Moreover, with respect to the CD4(+) cell-stimulating epitopes, the ORF3a epitope had the highest antigenicity score (0.81) with a median consensus percentile of 4.8. The remaining two CD4(+) cellstimulating epitopes, nsp3 and nsp4, with an identical score of 0.41, showed a median consensus percentile of 9.9 and 2.0, respectively. Subsequently, toxicity and host homology were assessed using ToxinPred (Supplementary Table S1 .3) and BLAST-NCBI, respectively. None of the selected epitopes were predicted to have toxicity or host homology (in humans). Thus, a total of 15 epitopes in the 8 viral proteins were identified as antigenic epitopes responsive to immune cells, making them potential vaccine candidates (Tables 3 and 4 for B-cell antigens and T-cell antigens, respectively). Moreover, T-cell epitopes were analyzed for their TLR4 binding using the HPEPDOCK server; as a control, a synthetic lipopolysaccharide peptide was used (docking scores are summarized in Supplementary Table S2 , overview of the molecular docking for epitopes is in Figure S2) . Compared with the docking score of the control peptide (\u2212152.192 ), all identified T-cell epitopes were predicted to have higher scores except for the epitope 1 of nsp3, TLNDLNETL, with a score of (\u2212151.528). More importantly, the HPEPDOCK negative docking score reflects a better docking with a higher binding affinity between T-cell epitopes and TLR4, suggesting that these selected epitopes are likely promising vaccine candidates.",

Accordingly, variations and polymorphisms in the antigens may create challenges in subunit vaccine development. Therefore, a mutation analysis of all publicly available isolates of SARS-CoV-2 derived from patients was performed to check for the mutations within the selected epitopes. First, all mutations were collected from the CoV-GLUE, a web application to track SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (32,435 mutations at the time of analysis as of January 2021, Supplementary Table S1 .4). The distribution of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome was analyzed, and the number of mutations in each protein was ranked and presented as a percentage ( Figure 2 ). The analysis showed that 21% of mutations were distributed in the nsp3 protein followed by 13% in the spike protein. Viral proteins with a mutation distribution of less than 10% and higher than 3% were ranked in the following order: nsp12 (8%), nsp2 (7%), nsp13 (5%), nsp14 (5%), nsp4 (5%), N (5%), nsp15 (4%), and ORF3a (4%). After the analysis of the mutational distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, the mutation density (MD) for the selected proteins was calculated, in which values of MD were normalized to be 1 as the highest possible value and 0 as the lowest possible value (Tables 1 and 2) . Among our selected proteins, ORF3a has the highest mutation density (1.00) followed by the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and nsp3 with values of 0.85 and 0.81, respectively. Next, epitopes that were selected from our RV workflow were screened to select epitopes with minimal or null mutations (Supplementary; Table S1 .5 containing the mutations among selected epitopes). To do this, the mutation density per amino acid site (i.e., site mutation density) was calculated per 100,000 sequences. The site mutation density results were grouped into three categories. The first category consisted of epitopes with mutations with MD < 0.01. These epitopes were accepted. The second category consisted of epitopes with > 3 sites, each with MD > 0.5. These epitopes were excluded. The third category consisted of epitopes with 1-3 sites, each with MD between 0.01 and 0.5. These epitopes were subjected to reanalysis.",

On the other hand, five epitopes were subjected to reanalysis for their antigenicity, toxicity, and host homology using new sequences with the highest frequent replacement (summarized in Table 5 ). Among the three epitopes of the spike protein, two epitopes were found to have mutations; the B-cell epitope (10LVSSQCVNLTTRT22) had L18F and R21I mutations, and the T-cell epitope (258WTAGAAAYY266) had a A262S mutation. The ORF10 epitope (27IAQVDVVNF35) had a V30L mutation. Comparison of the reanalyzed antigenicity scores of these epitopes to those of their original sequences showed similar and/or higher antigenicity scores. Both the membrane glycoprotein epitope (168ITVATSRTLSYYKLGASQRVAGDSGFAA195), with a T175M mutation, and the ORF3a epitope (66KKRWQLALSKGVHFV80), with a K75N mutation, showed lower antigenicity scores compared to their original sequences. Despite mutational replacements, most epitope sequences are predicted to retain immunogenicity without toxicity and host homology.

A previous interactome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that ORF10 protein may play a role in hijacking the ubiquitination pathway of the host proteins, in which ORF10 directly interacts with one member of the Cullin 2 (CUL2)-RING E3 ligase complex [52] . Given that ORF10 is involved in the manipulation of host proteins for viral pathogenesis, we performed a structural analysis of ORF10 despite its lack of homology to known proteins or conserved domains. The structural features of ORF10 were assessed using two protein structure prediction tools, PredictProtein and PEP-FOLD3. Several secondary structural features of the ORF10 protein were predicted (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Based on the ORF10 amino acid sequence, most amino acids were predicted to be exposed to the solvent (Supplementary Figure S1) . Although ORF10 is a short polypeptide with 38 amino acids, it is predicted to have an alpha-helix that can form a complex with the CUL2 member. In addition, ORF10 has highly antigenic epitopes (Tables 3 and 4) , which are promising subunit vaccine candidates awaiting further validation studies in vivo. The role of ORF10 is still controversial, as there are two different views: one view relies on the lack of evidence on ORF10 expression or function in host cells, suggesting that ORF10 is a non-essential and most likely non-expressed protein [53] , while the second view suggests ORF10 as a potential target for vaccine development [54] , which supports our prediction.

In this in silico study, we aimed to identify potential B-and T-cell epitopes by first analyzing probable SARS-CoV-2 proteins for a manageable list of epitopes that are promising candidates for vaccine development. Our epitope selection process involved the identification of major antigens for the stimulation of B and T cells using protein analysis and epitope-based analysis and provides a comprehensive workflow for the discovery of antigenic candidates. SARS-CoV-2 proteins, such as spike, M, and N, were selected as B-cell antigens and were reported as B-cell targets in SARS-CoV-2 patients [55] . Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, which is responsible for the first B-cell response, has been reported to antagonize the RNAi pathway (antiviral immune defense mechanism) and play a role in immune evasion by suppressing IFN-I [56, 57] . Membrane glycoprotein, which is the most abundant viral protein in SARS-CoV-2, plays a role in viral assembly and the negative regulation of the host antiviral response. It has been reported to exhibit pathogenicity through its C-terminal region [58] , which was found to have a highly immunogenic domain in our study; the selected epitope (105-117) lies within the pathogenic C-terminal region (100221). The spike protein is the main target for neutralization by B cells, as it holds the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds to the host target cell receptor, which mediates the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell membrane [59, 60] .",

            "text": "Recently, a peptide microarray study of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome was performed to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution [73] . Among the list of epitopes identified in the serum, several epitopes were found to be matched with our selected epitopes, such as the two epitopes derived from the membrane glycoprotein, namely 105 RTRSMWSFNPETN 117 and 168 ITVATSRTLSYYKLGASQRVAGDSGFAA 195 , and the ORF3a-derived epitope, 66 KKRWQLALSKGVHFV 80 (the matched sequence is underlined). In addition, an epitope derived from the spike protein-258 WTAGAAAYY 266 -has been identified in several in silico studies [25, 26, 74, 75] and was later identified as one of the epitopes that induce long-term immunity [76] . Moreover, several studies have identified that immunodominant epitopes from patients were overlapped with 8 epitopes out of 13 identified epitopes from our list [77] [78] [79] . Altogether, these studies further validate our approach, supporting the use of the epitopes screened in our study to develop an efficient SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to utilize a workflow involving the assessment of a series of parameters, including antigenicity, allele coverage, and mutation analysis, for evaluating the selected epitopes.",

Our in silico RV approach was composed of two parts: (1) analysis of the various functional aspects of viral proteins, including antigenicity, allele coverage, epitope density, and mutation density, was carried out for the selected proteins based on annotated cellular location; and (2) epitopes were analyzed for antigenicity, allele coverage, IFN-\u03b3 induction, toxicity, host homology, and site mutational density. By narrowing down the list of candidate epitopes with mutational replacements, we offer a list of 13 epitopes as subunit vaccine candidates. The candidates identified using our approach can be further tested as recombinant proteins in in vitro or in vivo studies to validate their antigenicity and avoid unwanted side effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement.",
