Poschet and colleagues 5 found in an in vitro study that azithromycin led to an increase in the pH of host cells, which may impede viral entry, replication, and spread. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is believed to possess a unique furin-like cleavage site in the spike protein 6 (the protein that facilitates viral entry into host cells). Poschet et al found that azithromycin reduces levels of the enzyme furin in host cells, and may therefore interfere with viral entry.

Moreover, it is vital to assess its safety profile in the context of COVID-19.

In vivo research effectiveness Only one trial was identified on the effectiveness of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19, conducted by Gautret and colleagues in France and reported in a pre-print 14 (see Table 1 ). The researchers recruited 20 patients to their trial investigating the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (200 mg ter die sumendum for 10 days), and compared clinical outcomes against 16 control cases. Of the twenty patients who received hydroxychloroquine, six additionally received azithromycin to prevent super-infection (500 mg on Day 1, then 250 mg daily for 4 days). Patients receiving azithromycin had a daily electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor their QT interval. The authors found that the six patients who received azithromycin combined with hydroxychloroquine were significantly more likely to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 on Days 3, 4, 5, and 6. On Day 6, 57.1% of the hydroxychloroquine group, compared to 100% of the combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin group, were virologically cured (P<0.001).

Furthermore, one of the six patients in the combined treatment group who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on Day 6 subsequently tested positive on Day 8.

The authors have not identified convincing evidence to support the co-prescription of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, and would advise extreme caution in adopting this approach.
