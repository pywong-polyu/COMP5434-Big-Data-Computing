Hasan and colleagues used quantitative strategies to assess 56 textual news stories in Bangladesh and found violence against medical care providers in 54 (96%) of the 56 stories involved physical violence [20] . Two graduate theses in China used qualitative methods to analyze news reports. Xie analyzed 276 media reports and 198 video stories and concluded that violent events against medical care providers were not reported objectively by the media [21] . Xiong examined 68 media reports of 10 events of violence against medical care providers occurring between 2009 and 2012 and concluded that the media did not report the events accurately or comprehensively [22] . Although valuable to the field, these studies did not detail the problems present in media reports and, thus, offer only a first step toward implementation of achievable solutions to improve media reports.",

Since most media reports for violence against medical care providers from over 10 years ago were not available online when our research was conducted, we limited the years of our search for reports to 2007-2017. Python programming was developed to search and automatically save the searched reports into a MySQL database. The MySQL database included the full-text media reports plus six objective fields for each media report: an assigned ID number, the title of the media report, the website link to the original report, the date of publication, the name of the source website, and the search terms used to identify the report. The search was conducted between August and October 2018. Preliminary searches captured 17,221 media reports after excluding duplicate reports based on an identical URL, including 6030 from portal news websites, 9850 from national news websites, and 1341 from local news websites ( Figure 1 ). After the database was created, we used two steps to screen for eligible reports. First, we manually reviewed report titles and removed reports that did not include the relevant search terms or that consisted of incorrect search terms in the title. (Note: Unlike academic datasets such as PubMed, Baidu News does not support precise searches and therefore can generate irrelevant records in the search [38] ). This step excluded 13,388 irrelevant reports ( Figure 1 ). Second, we reviewed the full-text reports remaining after the first step and excluded reports based on the following criteria: (1) not involving violence against medical care providers; (2) irrelevant to the 10 selected events; or (3) not expected to include aspects of the evaluation checklist below, such as editorial opinion pieces rather than news stories. The second step removed an additional 3045 ineligible reports.",

Each individual guideline in each of the four broad sets of guidelines was discussed in turn to assess the technical and practical feasibility of transforming the recommendation into an operable and objectively coded item that could be used by the research team. Following two rounds of extensive group discussions, the research group selected initial items for inclusion from the four considered guidelines. Those items comprised the initial draft of the evaluation checklist. The draft checklist was pilot tested and refined through evaluation of 50 media reports. Last, a final checklist of 14 items was created. The final checklist included items that were grouped into three parts: adherence to professional recommendations (eight items); balanced inclusion of the perspectives of patients, medical care providers, and hospital administrators, which reduces bias in reporting and provides all perspectives on the event (three items); and evidence that interviewees provided consent to include their perspectives (three items). All checklist items could be scored in an objective, yes/no manner. The complete checklist appears in Table 1 . a. Indicate consent from medical care providers when their perspectives are included b. Indicate consent from patients when their perspectives are included c. Indicate consent from health administrators when their perspectives are included Note: A yes/no binary option was used to evaluate all 14 items. Item g signifies information on how to seek help from a division within the Chinese health commission to take charge of the management of hospital (including dealing with the patient's complaints), while item h indicates information on how to seek help from a mediator that is typically outside the health department, such as in a court of law court or a public security office.",

Only about half the reports concerning violence against medical care providers in our study complied with this recommendation. One possible reason for this result is that many emerging news websites and platforms fail to hire journalists and editors who have professional education or training on media reporting [45] . For example, many news websites use batch processing and crawler programs to automatically obtain news from other media sources and release the stories on their own websites [46] . A second likely contributing factor is the lack of internal supervision within the website platforms or external supervision from the government. Despite some recent initial progress, Chinese governmental supervision to ensure media reports follow the professional recommendations remains at an early stage [47] . There is no published evidence to suggest internal supervision occurs at most Chinese media outlets.",

For example, over 95% of reports excluded information on victim or perpetrator services (e.g., helplines, advocacy, or counseling services) [55] . One possible explanation for this finding is that Chinese journalists may not have requisite knowledge and awareness to incorporate appropriate information in their stories.

For those reports that included the interviewees' perspectives but did not actually obtain the consent of interviewees, lack of professional education and training among journalists and the fierce competition between media companies are likely factors that led to such results. Journalists may prefer to report a breaking news story quickly in an attempt to attract the public' attention, even if they fail to collect appropriate perspectives in a proper way (namely, informing the interviewees and obtaining their consent before gathering the perspectives of interviewees). For example, the \"Maternal death in Xiangtan\" event involved the death of a pregnant woman from amniotic fluid embolism in Hunan Xiangtan County Maternity and Child Health Hospital on 10 August 2014 and led the decedent's family members to multiple acts of violence, including physical attacks on doctors and nurses, forcing medical staff to kneel in front of the decedent's body, and blocking of the hospital gate. In early stages of media reporting about the event, statements from the patient's family members were prominently included, but the perspectives of the medical care providers and hospital administrators were omitted. As a result, descriptive words like \"bloody\", \"nude,\" \"tragic death,\" \"absence of medical staff in the operating room,\" and \"an unidentified man was found smoking in the operating room\" emerged in media reports, exaggerating details of the event and creating inappropriate critiques and attacks toward the medical care providers and hospital [57] . In fact, the final medical investigation by the local health department found the death was caused by multi-organ failure that was initiated by amniotic fluid embolism. The medical staff had not committed any errors during the process of diagnosing and treating the patient [58] .",

We recommend three specific policy actions. First, either the Chinese government or a prominent professional journalism association in China should improve education and training for journalists to raise their competency and awareness. Strict and standard qualification exams should be implemented nationwide for all journalist candidates (including writers and editors), and the training and exams should incorporate training on professional standards concerning the reporting of violent events. Second, internal reviews should be conducted for all media reports, including both traditional and online media, to ensure they meet professional standards. Third, central and local governments should strictly and regularly monitor media reports about violence against medical care providers to assure their adherence to professional reporting standards, thus maximizing the role of media in creating a safe and positive relationship between medical care providers and their patients and preventing unwanted violence against medical care providers. Automated monitoring systems might be developed by the government to detect media reports out of compliance with professional recommendations, facilitating the government oversight process. Without such steps, continued media reports that violate international standards could create continued risk of harm to medical providers in China.",

Other events occurred during the study time period in China, but including additional events would be unlikely to change our findings, as all domestic journalists receive similar education and work under the same government regulations [41, 59] . Second, our checklist was limited to data that we could evaluate reliably and feasibly. We omitted other professional recommendations, such as adherence to objective reporting, because we were unable to verify whether those recommendations were followed or not. Third, we only focused on Chinese media reports about violence against medical care providers. Our findings may not generalize to other countries and cultures.",

In an era of explosive information that is ubiquitously available, media sources play an increasingly central role in how citizens understand and relate to their medical providers. Media also can influence the public's perception of unwanted events like violence against medical care providers. Unfortunately, the majority of domestic media reports about violence against medical care providers in China did not comply with professional journalism recommendations. They frequently failed to list the real and complete names of writers and editors, improperly revealed details of the violent event, and excluded mention of prevention strategies or suggestions for resolving conflicts. They also reported the perspectives of medical care providers, patients, and hospital administrators in an imbalanced manner and failed to mention interviewee consent to share those perspectives when provided. We recommend improved education and training for journalists in China, enhanced internal review within media sources, and increased government monitoring of Chinese media to reduce improper media reports of violence against medical care providers, thus reducing unwanted copycat violence events by readers.
