            "text": "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is home to two of the circulating beta coronaviruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. MERS-CoV was first discovered in KSA in September 2012 [1] and has subsequently spread to 27 coun-tries. Of the global total of the reported 2949 laboratory-confirmed cases through June 1, 2020, 74% (2167) cases including 842 deaths were reported by KSA [2, 3] . SARS-Cov-2, first reported in China in December 2019 [4] , received pandemic status on March 11, 2020 [5] , and since has caused over 10 million cases and over half a million deaths worldwide [6] . In KSA, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 2, 2020 [7, 8] ; three different seeding patterns helped its spread to all areas and municipalities [9] . With 170,639 cases including 1430 deaths [10] by June 25, 2020, KSA is among the top 20 countries with highest total confirmed COVID-19 cases [6]. The overall Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in KSA (0.70%), is much lower than that reported in other countries such as the USA (5.68%) and the UK (14.12%) [6] . Immunity due to past MERS-CoV exposure [11] could be a potential reason. To describe the clinical picture of COVID-19 in KSA and assess potential interaction between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, we reviewed data from hospitalized patients in the largest academic teaching hospital in KSA that serves also as a referral center for MERS-CoV. We describe the demographic, clinical characteristics and outcome in their 99 hospitalized COVID-19 infected patients and the outcome of MERS-CoV tests.",

Hospitalized patients are drawn from SARS-CoV-2 tests done at KSUMC, and only summary data are available on outcome among non-hospitalized patients. We included all consecutive adult individuals aged 18 years or older, who were hospitalized for at least 24 h with confirmed COVID-19 during the study period. Patients who were still hospitalized by end of study period were followed till discharge or death on or before June 6, 2020. All patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing upon admission.",

Compared to the high percentage of fever reported early from China (90%) during their peak of the epidemic, our cohort had a lower percentage of fever similar to the observation of 31% in New York, USA and 45% in Europe [13] . This difference is likely due to increasing awareness about other symptoms which lead to early diagnosis. Similar to SARS [14] and MERS [15] , patient's age, comorbid conditions and certain laboratory abnormalities were associated with poor in-hospital outcomes in COVID-19 patients [16] . Underlying chronic medical conditions are commonly reported in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with variable proportions between studies probably due to variable hospitalization criteria (94% in USA, 77% in UK, 23% in China, 20% in KSA) [17] [18] [19] .

The best current approach is with source control of infection, proper use of personal protective equipment, early diagnosis and isolation of cases, with rapid contact tracing and quarantine, with supportive care for patients. Although from the 99 patients only nine had positive bacterial cultures; two from sputum and seven from blood with only one of those blood cultures considered a true pathogen; 53 (53.5%) patients received antibacterial therapy for a median of 4 days.",

Severe disease, abnormal chest X-ray on admission, lymphopenia, raised inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin), and end organ damage (high creatinine or high AST) were associated with poor prognosis. Large sample case series will help us confirm the generalizability of these findings.",
