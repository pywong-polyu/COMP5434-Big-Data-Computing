The infection spreads primarily from one person to another by contact and respiratory droplets that are expelled orally. A susceptible person may inhale these droplets from the air or, less frequently, the droplets may land on surfaces (such as tables and door handles) that people touch and subsequently transfer the virus to their faces [2] . For these reasons, the most important measures that can be taken in terms of prevention are to keep physical distance between people, adequately ventilate indoor spaces and wash hands with water and soap, which dissolves the lipid envelope of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a technical brief for the prevention of COVID-19, targeted at water and sanitation practitioners and providers [3] . This document emphasizes the key importance of hand hygiene in preventing infection, and recommends that Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) practitioners work to enable more frequent hand hygiene with water and soap or using alcohol-based handrubs (ABHRs). It further states that the current WHO guidelines for the safe management of drinking water and sanitation services are sufficient in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It also highlights many co-benefits that can be realized by safely managing water and sanitation services and applying good hygiene practices.",

            "text": "The primary means by which the virus spreads is clearly through respiratory droplets and close contact, but some concerns were raised that the infection may also be spread fecal-orally. This is not impossible as during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2003 there was one cluster of cases associated with a defective wastewater system in an apartment block [4] . At the time, SARS-CoV was found in sewage wastewater and found to be active from 2 days at 20 \u2022 C to 14 days at 4 \u2022 C [5] . During the current pandemic, RNA from SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the feces of patients with COVID-19, but usually it has not been possible to isolate the active virus, suggesting that the fecal route may not be infectious. While several studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA fragments in the fecal matter of patients throughout their illness and after recovery, current evidence underscores the difficulty of culturing the virus in excreta. Three studies reported the infectious virus in feces, while others have not found infectious virus in this medium. One study found infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the urine of one patient and detected viral RNA in gastrointestinal tissue [6] . Preliminary research has found SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in raw sewage but not in treated effluents, and wastewater analyses have been used to determine COVID-19 prevalence among some populations [3] . In addition, enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 tend to be quite sensitive to halogen disinfectants and ultraviolet disinfection [2] . For these reasons, treated drinking water is unlikely to pose a significant risk of COVID-19 and wastewater is also unlikely to be an important risk factor, particularly in high-and middle-income areas where adequate water and wastewater systems are in place. Although fecal transmission cannot be entirely ruled out, such transmission-if it exists-would likely only play a minor role in the pandemic. A number of co-incident factors need to occur to increase the likelihood of water outbreaks [7] . Outbreaks with lipid-layered viruses are uncommon and the water pathway will only be potentially viable if: (1) the presence of active virus in stool is verified (2) in areas with a large number and high density of COVID-19 cases (e.g., hospitals and some urban areas) (3) with an inadequate sanitation or sewage system, presenting drainage failures inside buildings (as was the case reported during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak) or (4) that contaminate a nearby deficient drinking water distribution system with contaminant ingress in the absence of disinfectants (5) in a period of time that is sufficiently rapid for the virus to remain active and (6) with a lack of monitoring to prompt rapid corrective measures. The contamination of drinking water systems via their sources is even more unlikely due to the relatively long time necessary for the full cycle, and the fact that lipidlayered viruses in water tend to adhere to particles that are usually largely removed in drinking water treatment systems, with disinfection deactivating any remaining viruses. The contamination of recreational waters and of urban runoff water that comes into contact with a population may present additional challenges.",

Comorbidity may be a risk factor for COVID-19 outcomes, and in several countries, health institutions were overloaded at different stages of the pandemic [8] . Eliminating other causes of hospitalization would alleviate these institutions and allow them to focus on COVID-19. Socioeconomic status may also play a crucial role in the pandemic. People who live in poverty, in informal and migrant settlements, are homeless or are incarcerated in prisons are much more likely to be affected for several reasons, ranging from a lack of information and resources to protect themselves to the adverse living conditions in crowded settlements and a lack of access to sufficient water for handwashing. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic requires a mobilization of frameworks that specifically focus on these groups, such as the framework on the human rights to water and sanitation [9] . This paper emerged from public discussions held in April 2020 onward by different key actors on open web-based seminars-organized by UNESCO's Intergovernmental Hydrological Programme, WHO Americas and other partners-to discuss the potential implications of the pandemic for the water sector. This paper expands on those discussions with the purpose of exploring some of the main interlinkages between the water sector and COVID-19, and exploring recommendations to improve responses at different levels.",

As of 15 April 2020 (50 days after the first case was reported in LAC), over 70,000 people were confirmed as infected by SARS-CoV-2 across almost the entire region. Most LAC countries have adopted physical distancing measures to prevent the dissemination of the coronavirus through person-to-person contact, suspending or restricting the function of educational and cultural institutions as well as that of noncritical business. In this relatively short period, COVID-19 has had a very significant social and economic impact, the real extent of which is yet to be determined, notably on those from vulnerable groups. In addition, many migrants are returning to their country or area of origin, potentially disseminating the virus among particularly vulnerable communities [10] . For low-income and middle-income countries and deprived areas that have very limited resources to address pandemics, this influx can place additional pressure on water services that are already facing considerable difficulties.",

Latin America and the Caribbean is the most urbanized region on the planet, with over 80% of the population living in cities, including 20% in slums, and its high human density can contribute to the propagation of pathogens-particularly airborne and waterborne viruses [13] . The region has six megacities with over ten million inhabitants each, and a large number of big cities contain peri-urban areas, slums and informal settlements that are often extremely crowded and face a number of challenges in terms of water supply and sanitation [14] . While around 87% of LAC's population has access to sanitation, only 31% have access to some form of safely managed services [8] . Around 2.2% of LAC's population (nearly 15 million people) still practice open defecation. Water access is generally higher in urban areas (97% access) and very significant progress was achieved over the last few decades, but several urban water supply systems face problems with effective disinfection, pressure, supply continuity and water quality [15] . In rural areas, around 15% of the population still lack access to a water supply. Episodic contamination of drinking water sources by fecal microorganisms from human and non-human sources is a challenge [12] .",

While in some respects this diversity can be considered one of the region's strengths (e.g., by contributing to its resilience), it also complicates generalizations and water resource management with inequalities presenting considerable challenges.",

            "text": "A key issue of concern is the inadequate financing for the maintenance of the existing systems and the urgent need for water provisioning systems to be significantly upgraded and improved, especially in areas where the most vulnerable segments of the population are located, such as rural populations and native peoples. Water-quality monitoring systems are often limited or nonexistent due to tight financial resources. In addition, many LAC water systems do not have the ability to maintain adequate disinfection levels throughout the whole distribution network, with peri-urban areas located in the fringes of the network suffering increased risks [16] . If the current efforts to constrain and address the risks posed by COVID-19 (including its social and financial impacts) leave the water and sanitation sector behind, the rapid deterioration of existing water provisioning systems will likely pose significant risks to human health in the short and long term [12] . Affordability and inequality issues are particularly noteworthy. In some countries, water services are intermittent due to the high cost of electricity, which can represent around 65% of the operating costs. The high energy cost is also one of the reasons why wastewater treatment plants are not in operation, even when infrastructure is in place. The benefits of investing in water and sanitation largely outweigh the costs. An investment of USD 1 in water and sanitation services has a return in the range from USD 5 to USD 28, also encompassing reductions in health care expenditures [17] . Furthermore, the H1N1 outbreak in Mexico showed that if investments were made to the school water services, the rate and number of days where economic activities were stopped could have been significantly reduced. Financing for scientific research is also scarce in LAC, and this is reflected in a significantly lower number of researchers and research outputs when compared with other regions [18] . As knowledge and innovation are key to advancing policies and informed decision making and management, limitations in this field also limit the adoption of adequate and efficient solutions, with particular relevance to the local level.",

In such areas, these messages may be accompanied by messages emphasizing the need to use water wisely. Consider the need for water for additional hygiene practices, such as to shower and to wash exposed clothing. Provisions must be made for the dry season and priorities in allocations may be needed.
