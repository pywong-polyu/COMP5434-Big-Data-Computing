In their new road map for NTDs 2021-2030, the World Health Organization (WHO) highlights the global elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem as target for 2030 [3] . Elimination as public health problem is therein defined as <1% proportion of heavy intensity infections [3] . According to mathematical modelling as well as multi-country and multi-year studies, elimination of schistosomiasis as public health problem can be achieved relatively quickly [4] [5] [6] . Once countries or areas have achieved this goal, they likely wish to move further down the elimination road, aiming for the interruption of schistosomiasis transmission, defined as zero incidence of infection.",

            "text": "Clearly, as long as interruption of transmission has not been achieved, recrudescence of transmission and disease remains a threat. Recrudescence of transmission can easily occur due to the asexual reproduction of the parasite in its intermediate host snail and the release of thousands of cercariae into natural freshwater, which are then able to infect the next definitive human host [7, 8] . Hence, as long as some, even very few people remain infected with schistosomes, the parasite's lifecycle can be perpetuated and the risk of recrudescence remains [9] . Also after the transmission of the parasite was successfully interrupted in an area or country, transmission can be reintroduced as long as the intermediate host snails thrive and Schistosoma eggs are released into the snails' freshwater habitat. To avoid recrudescence in areas where interruption of transmission has not yet been achieved, control and elimination efforts need to be maintained. To prevent reintroduction of schistosomiasis in areas considered post-elimination settings, a sensitive detection and timely treatment of cases through effective surveillance-response mechanisms is necessary [3] . Regarding the clonal reproduction of the parasite in its intermediate host snail, the detection of the parasite in the snail by xenomonitoring will constitute an important part of surveillance activities [7, 8] .",

            "text": "Interventions to control the morbidity caused by urogenital schistosomiasis in Zanzibar started in the 1980's when S. haematobium was highly prevalent on the islands Pemba and Unguja [10] [11] [12] [13] . Control interventions were enforced by large-scale mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns in schools implemented in the early 2000s [14] [15] [16] . These interventions paved the way for one of the first projects to eliminate urogenital schistosomiasis from an area in sub-Sahara Africa: the Zanzibar Elimination of Schistosomiasis Transmission (ZEST) project, implemented in Pemba and Unguja from 2011 till 2017 [17, 18] . Over the course of ZEST, considerable progress towards the elimination of urogenital schistosomiasis was made [6, 19] . During the ZEST project, MDA with praziquantel was implemented biannually in schools and whole communities across the islands Pemba and Unguja. In addition to biannual MDA, snail control and behavioural change interventions were implemented in 30 selected shehias (smallest administrative areas) in Pemba and Unguja, respectively, as part of a cluster randomized trial supported by the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) [17] . The impact of the interventions was monitored in annual cross-sectional surveys in 90 study schools and shehias from 2012 until 2017. The interventions reduced the S. haematobium prevalence in Zanzibar from 3.9% to 1.5% in 20-55 year old adults, and from 6.6% to 1.9% in 9-12 year old schoolchildren from 2012 to 2017. In 2017, heavy S. haematobium infection intensities (\ufffd50 eggs per 10 ml urine) occurred in 0.1% of year old adults and in 0.5% of 9-to 12-year old schoolchildren [19] . Hence, within the ZEST project, urogenital schistosomiasis was eliminated as public health problem from most schools and communities in Zanzibar in 2017 and the S. haematobium prevalence was significantly reduced [6, 19] . While the SCORE trial was concluded in early 2017, MDA in schools and shehia communities continued under the lead of the Zanzibar NTD Program, and was implemented annually in 2017 and 2018. No MDA was conducted in 2019 due to procurement issues.",

The randomization of schoolchildren for participation is explained elsewhere in detail [17] . In brief, in each grade eligible for participation, girls and boys lined up stratified by sex, and every third child was selected until the requested number was reached. In 2012-2020,~120 children from grades 3 and 4 were selected. In addition, in 2012, 2017 and 2018,~120 children from grade 1 were selected. Finally, in 2019 and 2020,~25 children each from grades 1, 2, 5 and 6 as well as from nursery were selected. The additional grades were included in 2019 and 2020 to obtain a better picture on the age profile of S. haematobium infections. The study procedure was explained in lay terms in Kiswahili to the enrolled children. Upon registration, the children were asked about their demographic data, their travel history, and in years with preceding MDA also about their participation in the last SBT round. All enrolled children received an information-and a consent-sheet for their parents or legal guardians to read and sign. On the next day, all children that submitted an informed consent form signed by their parents or legal guardians were given a plastic container (100 ml) to provide their fresh own urine sample.",

Travel outside the home island, for example to the sister island, or mainland Tanzania, or other African countries, was not a significant risk factor in our study. Hence, at least to date, importation of urogenital schistosomiasis to Zanzibar does not seem to be a challenge and threat for elimination efforts. This finding is in contrast to reports from the neighboring island Mafia, where urogenital schistosomiasis is considered as an imported disease [49] . Also, access to clean water by having a tap or well near or at the home was not significantly associated with a S. haematobium infection in our study. This is in contrast to assumptions that access to clean water can improve the situation in endemic countries and reduce exposure to schistosomes [42, 50] . However, one has to keep in mind that many drivers for infection are complex, interconnected and multidirectional and that a systems epidemiology approach is necessary to put them into context [51] .",

            "text": "Zanzibar has made great achievements towards schistosomiasis elimination over the past years applying population-based interventions. The current evidence that the S. haematobium prevalence and morbidity rebound quickly over the period of a 16-month treatment gap in hotspot areas but remain low in areas with a weaker force of transmission, emphasizes the need to rethink carefully future elimination strategy approaches. Clearly, due to the spatial heterogeneity of S. haematobium infections in Zanzibar and the varying risk of reinfection, future interventions aiming for interruption of S. haematobium transmission need to consider the microepidemiology of the islands and be adapted to it [19] . We hence suggest that interventions targeting hotspot areas in Zanzibar should be re-intensified and ideally include biannual MDA, snail control, behavior change and, in a multi-sectoral approach, improved access to safe water and sanitation. In low prevalence areas, future efforts might shift from MDA towards surveillance-response, including risk-based test-and-treat approaches using new and sensitive pointof-care diagnostic tools, xenomonitoring, focal snail control and health communication to ensure the identification and treatment of those infected but to avoid overtreatment and treatment fatigue of the healthy population. Setting up an effective surveillance-response system in areas that are or become low prevalence areas, will also help to sustain the gains made by reacting to any outbreak and sign of recrudescence in time and thus to ultimately progress towards a sustained interruption of S. haematobium transmission across Zanzibar. Our results also indicate that interruption of MDA and potentially other interventions, for example caused by a lack of donor funding, procurement issues, or the current Covid-19 pandemic, can result in a rapid resurgence of transmission and disease that needs to be reacted to in time. Finally, our study highlights the need for more research on the sustainability of the gains of control and on the criteria and conditions required for stopping schistosomiasis MDA.",
