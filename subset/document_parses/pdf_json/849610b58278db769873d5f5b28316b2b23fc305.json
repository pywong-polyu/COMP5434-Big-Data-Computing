Different activities performed at the same location have commonalities resulting in less inter-class variations; while the same activity performed multiple times, or by multiple residents, varies in its execution resulting in high intra-class variations. We propose a Local Feature Weighting approach (LFW) that assigns weights based on both inter-class and intra-class importance of a feature in an activity. Multiple sensors are deployed at different locations in a smart home to gather information. We exploit the obtained information, such as frequency and duration of activation of sensors, and the total sensors in an activity for feature weighting. The weights for the same features vary among activities, since a feature may have more importance for one activity but less for the other. For the classification, we exploit the two variants of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Evidence Theoretic KNN (ETKNN) and Fuzzy KNN (FKNN) . The evaluation of the proposed approach on three datasets, from CASAS smart home project, demonstrates its ability in the correct recognition of activities compared to the existing approaches.",

However, in the case of two different activities, such as \"making tea\" and \"making coffee\" less inter-class variations exist. The notable events include the use of cup, hot water, sugar, coffee and tea. In such a scenario, tea and coffee would be the most discriminative features and thus, should have the higher weights among the identified features.

Further, we weight the same feature differently in each activity class, in accordance with the feature's contribution in the correct classification of that class. For activity classification, in contrast to an adhoc classification method specifically designed for KFS, we use simpler and computationally less intensive variants of KNN classifiers: FKNN and ETKNN.

Discriminative features within each activity class are identified using interclass distance, while activities are recognized using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). Changes in the daily behavior of a smart home resident are identified using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and K-means clustering. PNN is used to assign label to the activity instances, while deviated patterns from routine are monitored through clustering (Fahad et al. 2013) . Intra-class and inter-class variations in activities are addressed using the neuro-fuzzy classification technique (Ordonez et al. 2013 ). The approach proposed by Fahad et al. (2015a) , learns the correct and incorrect distances to assign labels to the activity instances and then the confidence score of assigned labels is measured using the sub-clustering within activity classes. Another recognition approach, for activities sharing similar events, uses frequent pattern mining to find activity patterns in a particular location and then activity clusters are formed using DBSCAN clustering method (Hoque and Stankovic 2012 ). An online activity recognition approach recognizes the label from incomplete sensor stream using headmost sensors only rather than all sensor events, which reduces the average time (Liu et al. 2019) . Headmost sensors are considered as the key sensors of an activity. A comparison of different deep learning methods for classification of human activities in a smart home shows the best performance of LSTM (Liciotti et al. 2019) .",

We count the number of instances of each activity A n where the r th feature f r mn exists, given as where | \u22c5 | is the cardinality of a set, and C r n counts the number of times f r appears in all instances of A n . Thus we can find the intra-class importance of f r in A n . Higher the value of C r n the more important f r is for that activity. In contrast to the fixed weighting based on the number of selected features per activity class (Tahir et al. 2019 ), we propose a two-level varying weights method to deal with both intra-class and inter-class variations. Let \u0302 be an R \u00d7 N feature-count matrix obtained by column-wise scaling the values of C r n given as Each column of \u0302 represents the counts of appearances of all feature in an activity A n , while each row has the counts of appearances of the same feature in N activities.

Thus a feature with high importance in A n and less importance in other activity classes is assigned a high weight for A n . The weights can vary for the same feature in different activity classes.

DST generates a single score s using the orthogonal sum \u2295 of the two beliefs (Shafer 1976 ), given as FKNN assigns a degree of class membership to an activity instance rather than associating the instance to a particular activity class (Keller et al. 1985) , which leads to a membership vector (x) = { xn } N n=1 containing N membership values for the new instance I (x) , one for each class. The membership value is viewed as a confidence in the assignment of an instance to that activity class. For example, if the new activity instance I (x) is associated with class A i with membership value xi = 0.9 and with another class A j with xi = 0.05 , then I (x) would be assigned to A i with high membership value. Contrary to this, if I (x) is associated with A i , A j and A k with membership values of 0.55, 0.44 and 0.01, respectively, then it can be concluded that I (x) does not belong to A k , while I (x) has high relevance with both A i and A j . This degree of membership can be useful for further analysis in the classification. xn of I (x) for an activity class is higher if there are more samples of a particular class in its neighborhood and their distances from I (x) is smaller compared to the other samples in the neighborhood given as where K is the number of samples belonging to the activity A n in the K nearest neighbors of I (x) .

Total number of activity instances in Kyoto1, Kyoto7 and Kasteren are 120, 272 and 499, respectively. In Kasteren, single resident performed the 10 activities, while in Kyoto1, 20 participants performed the five activities. In Kyoto7, two occupants living together in a smart home performed the 14 activities. These three datasets have activities with less inter-class and high intraclass variations. Some activities in these datasets have a few instances. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on these challenging benchmark datasets. Table 2 shows the results of using LFW with the variants of KNN compared to using all the features without weighting on the three datasets. In the case of Kyoto1, activity classes are quite separable with less intra-class variations, therefore all the approaches show comparable results in the classification of activity instances . The Kasteren dataset contains the activities performed at the same location which share similar features, such as 'Use toilet', 'Take shower' or 'Prepare breakfast', 'Prepare dinner', and 'Get drink'. These activities are difficult to discriminate because of less inter-class variations. The significance of LFW can be observed in this dataset. Since LFW learns the fine grained differences between the activities in assigning the weights, the results of both ETKNN and FKNN are improved compared to using all features without weighting. LFW + FKNN achieves the accuracy of 92.03, better than the LFW + ETKNN (91.82), and the rest. The F1scores of LFW + FKNN , LFW + ETKNN , FKNN, ETKNN and KNN approaches are 0.88 and 0.86, 0.85, 0.83 and 0.81, respectively. These results show that the LFW is able to perform better in the case of less inter-class variations.",

The dataset contains similar activities (with different labels), such as'R1 prepare breakfast' and 'R2 prepare breakfast', representing less inter-class as well as high intra-class variations. The inclusion of intra-class feature importance in the weighting process of LFW (3) results in the superior performance of LFW in the case when high intra-class variations also exist along with the less inter-class variations. Both LFW + FKNN and LFW + ETKNN show better results compared to the approaches without LFW, where LFW + FKNN achieves the highest F1score of 0.75 and accuracy of 78. It can be observed that FKNN shows an overall better performance compared to the other approaches on all three datasets. FKNN counts of the number of neighbors of a particular class as in KNN, moreover, FKNN combines the counts with their distances from the instance of interest to generate a membership score. Thus FKNN becomes less biased towards the classes with more number of instances, which makes it a better choice for the activity recognition problem. Table 3 ",

Figure 2 shows the activity level accuracy comparison of our best performing model, LFW + FKNN , with an existing approach, active learning for overlapping activities (AALO) (Hoque and Stankovic 2012) , on Kasteren. It can be noted that LFW + FKNN outperforms AALO in the case of most of the activities, while shows comparable results in the two activities: Prepare dinner and Sleep. Figure 3 shows F1score comparison of LFW + FKNN with another existing approach, activity recognition approach using segmental pattern mining AR-SPM (Avci and Passerini 2014) , on Kyoto7. In nine out of the fourteen activities LFW + FKNN obtains a higher F1score, while in 'R1 groom' shows the comparable results. In the remaining four activities 'R1 prepare breakfast', 'R1 work at dining room table', 'R2 prepare breakfast' and 'R2 groom', AR-SPM has the better performance. The above comparison shows that the proposed approach correctly recognizes the instances of activity classes in the case of less inter-class and high intra-class variations than the existing approaches. Table 4 shows the confusion matrix of activities in Kyoto1. In this dataset, the activities are well discriminative with high inter-class and low intra-class variations. The obtained results show that LFW + FKNN is able to classify most of the activity instances accurately. The Proposed and 'Wash hands' with 100% accuracy. Only the 'Eat' and 'Clean' activities share 4% of their instances with each other. It could be due to the reason of overlapping features, since these activities are carried out at the same location such as kitchen. Table 5 shows the confusion matrix of activities in Kasteren. It can be noted that the the activity instances in almost all the classes are correctly recognized. LFW + FKNN obtains more than 90% accuracy in six, and more than 80% in three. It shows comparatively less accuracy of 66% in 'Prepare dinner' (Pdnr) activity, whose 22% of instances are confused with the 'Get snack' (Gsnk) and 11% with the 'Prepare breakfast' (Pbf) activities. The less accuracy in Pdnr is due to its resemblance with Pbf and Gsnk, as these activities are homogeneous and involve the usage of similar features. Table 6 shows the confusion matrix of activities in Kyoto7. The obtained results show that most of the activities are correctly recognized except activities related to meal preparation such as 'R1 prepare breakfast', 'R2 prepare breakfast', 'R2 prepare dinner' and 'R2 prepare lunch'. Because of the execution of these activities at the same location, kitchen, similar sensors are used such as sensors attached to the water tab, fridge, stove or cupboard. The same case can be observed with the activity of 'R1 work at dinning room table', where 44% of its instances are incorrectly recognized as 'R1 work at computer' and 22% as 'R2 watch TV'. This may be due to the reason that work activity can also be performed at computer table or during the 'watching TV' activity.",

Next, we exploited variants of K-nearest neighbors such as ETKNN and FKNN for activity classification. Experimental evaluation using three smart home datasets from Kastern and CASAS projects demonstrates a superior classification performance of the proposed approach in comparison to the existing approaches. The comparison of nearest neighbors and its variants shows that the best performance is achieved by FKNN and followed by ETKNN with an accuracy of up to 77% in Kyoto7, while 93% and 97% in Kasteren and Kyoto1 smart home datasets, respectively. Future work includes the recognition of multi-resident activities performed concurrently in a smart home.",

Since Kyoto1 comprises of well-discriminative activities with high inter-class variations and less intra-class variations, all the three approaches show comparable results with high accuracies of 96.85, 97.44, and 97.5. However, in the case of the more challenging dataset, Kasteren, with less inter-class variations, LFW + FKNN and LFW + ETKNN outperform KFS (Tahir et al. 2019) with a large margin. The accuracy of LFW + FKNN and LFW + ETKNN are 92.03 and 91.82, which is much better compared toKFS (73.33). It can be observed that in the case of overlapping activities, the inclusion of inter-class variation in the proposed feature weighting process significantly improves the results.",
