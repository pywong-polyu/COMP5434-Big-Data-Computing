Mass casualty events can occur suddenly, as is the case with an earthquake, tornado, or terrorist bombing, or it may evolve over hours to days, as with a hurricane, flood, disease outbreak, or bioterror attack. Regardless of its rate of onset, the scope and complexity of events can severely challenge even highly experienced and well-equipped healthcare providers and systems. When immediately available resources are clearly insufficient to meet patients' needs at the level normally expected in a modern healthcare delivery system, healthcare systems must be prepared to implement contingency plans to deliver needed services. This requires shifting from the individual-centered approach, which is intended to deliver optimal care to each and every patient, to one that that seeks to do the most good for the most people with the resources at hand.",

A Chinese study modeled the best timing for physical distancing policies using data from the Wuhan community to maximize impact. A contact tracing study highlighted the high transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset and concluded that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic. An international analysis reported that incidence of COVID-19 was lower in countries that had implemented community-wide mask policies compared to countries without. The fifth study concluded that combinations of countermeasures aiming to reduce the demand for healthcare (e.g., travel restrictions) that had been implemented in China had improved control of the coronavirus outbreak.",

Of the biologic countermeasures, mass vaccination to contain pandemics was often found to be one of the most effective strategies. However, vaccines are not immediately available after an outbreak of a novel strain and the suggested strategies to best distribute a vaccine can only be executed once it is developed and available en mass. Simulations and exercises can inform, for example, when push or pull models or ring or random vaccination strategies are most effective [20 , 21] .",

We used a targeted search strategy and did not review the clinical trial literature as we were focused on responses to disasters rather than disaster preparedness and it should be noted that this update is not a full systematic review. In addition, the evidence base for COVID-19 is rapidly evolving and the review covered only research to May 2020. We applied relevant critical appraisal criteria for all included studies and focused the narrative synthesis on studies meeting a methodological threshold. However, the evidence base does not include robust study designs such as randomized controlled trials that allow strong evidence statements, and no formal strength of evidence assessment was undertaken. The higher quality studies represent tested strategies that can inform policymakers rather than strong evidence suggesting clear evidence-based solutions. Furthermore, there are practical such as supply line issues [45] as well as ethical and legal questions that this review does not address [2] . policymakers need to carefully weigh alternatives to ensure that patients receive the best possible care under challenging circumstances. More information is needed about the comparative effectiveness of the competing and sometimes mutually exclusive strategies that have been suggested to address scarce resources, and research should test promising strategies developed by simulation in practice.",
