However, previous studies suggest that the effects of MP were proportional to their involvement in the total lung function size. Therefore, MP normalized to the predicted body weight (norMP) should outperform the absolute MP value. The objective of this research is to determine the connection between norMP and mortality in critically ill patients who have been on invasive ventilation for at least 48 h.",

Variables, such as tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate (RR), and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), are set directly on the ventilator by the clinician [1] . Others, such as peak pressure (PIP) and plateau pressure, rely on the patient's respiratory system or their interaction with the ventilator. Up to now, all these factors have been assessed separately [8] ; however, VILI may be unified into a single variable as mechanical power (MP), which is energy per unit of time applied to the respiratory system by the ventilator [7, 9, 10] . Energy generated by the mechanical ventilator is related to Vt, RR, PEEP, plateau pressure, and flow [9] , demonstrating that MP can be calculated accurately through combining Vt, plateau pressure, PEEP, and RR [7] . The introduction of this \"power equation\" shows MP has a stronger modulating effect on VILI than individual ventilator settings owing to the incorporation of multiple aspects of mechanical ventilation [7, 9] .",

We hypothesized that the effect of MP relative to lung size can be calculated by MP normalized to the predicted body weight (norMP) [12] .

Therefore, mechanical ventilation strategies to reduce VILI have sought to Effect estimates and 95% confidence interval from the multivariable linear regression for VFD_28 and ICU_los. Effect estimate refers to the change in the outcome variable per quartile increase in norMP. norMP: mechanical power normalized to predicted body weight; VFD_28: Ventilator-free days at day 28; ICU: intensive care unit; LOS: length of stay Fig. 4 Subgroup analysis of the association between norMP and ICU mortality according to different tidal volumes and airway pressure levels. The odds ratio represents the odds of death per quartile increase in norMP. norMP: mechanical power normalized to predicted body weight; Vt: tidal volume; PIP: peak inspiratory pressure optimize all potential determinants including respiratory rate, tidal volume, and PEEP [17, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . While individual ventilator parameters have been extensively studied in previous research, few studies have considered these factors comprehensively. One study has shown that MP can be computed from its components: Vt, plateau pressure, flow, PEEP, and RR [7] . Since MP is a composite of these variables, it may be a candidate variable to improve prediction of clinical outcomes (such as mortality) [11] . The authors believe that norMP is superior to MP because the effects of MP were proportional to their involvement in total lung function size. Given similar mechanical power values, different energies will be delivered according to different ventilated lung surfaces. Hong et al. [30] have demonstrated that the effect size of MP differs across subgroups of acute respiratory failure (ARF) populations. The effect size of MP on mortality is the smallest in class 1 (baseline) and the largest in class 3 (refractory respiratory failure). The heterogeneity of patients with ARF supports the hypothesis that the effect of MP on VILI is dependent on the functional lung size. Additionally, a previous study [12] , normalizing the mechanical power to the predicted body weight as a proxy for lung size, demonstrated that norMP had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic among all ventilator parameters, and it had a more accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality. Similar to a previous study, the results of this analysis proved that norMP was a predictor of poor outcomes in ICU patients undergoing invasive ventilation.",

In line with our hypothesis, we discovered that high MP was correlated with ICU mortality, even when Vt was low. This suggested that norMP added more information aside from the volume. Our research also demonstrated that a high norMP was associated with ICU mortality in patients with low PIP only. We propose a possible explanation for this finding. Our results showed that PEEP levels were higher in the group of patients with high PIP levels than in their counterpart. Patients with high PIP levels may be more severely ill, as sicker patients may be default be receiving higher PEEP levels. This may explain why low norMP was not associated with decreased ICU mortality in patients with high PIP. The majority of mechanical power in patients with higher levels of PEEP may be secondary to the applied PEEP. This further emphasizes the need to consider the PEEP component in the analysis. We failed to do a simple sensitivity analysis taking out the PEEP (focused on patients without PEEP), because the sample became very small in this situation. However, we have performed an analysis to determine the relationship between norMP and ICU mortality according to the different level of PEEP. Considering this analysis complicated the results so much, we decided not to report. Therefore, further investigations (including clinical trials) are necessary to explore the relationship between norMP and mortality in patients without applied PEEP.",

Modifying a single parameter has little effect on the amount of energy transmitted to the lung tissue, and it does not always protect the lungs [31] . According to the concept of protective ventilation, a decrease in volume necessitates an increase in the respiratory rate to offset the loss of minute volume. A higher respiratory rate leads to higher norMP. Therefore, volume reduction does not result in profit, according to our current study and previous studies [32, 33] .

However, the current findings cannot be generalized for patients who were extubated or died within the first 48 h. Second, norMP was calculated only once and not during the ICU stay. Therefore, it did not accurately represent the temporal changes in norMP administered to the patient. Third, since the datasets used in this study were from publicly available data, the airway pressure may not have been collected under consistent standard conditions. Such is the case in patients without spontaneous breathing efforts. Finally, it was difficult to quantify functional lung size. In the present study, we indirectly described the functional lung size through PBW. However, other conditions leading to decreased functional lung size, such as ARF and ARDS, were not considered. In the future, further studies investigating normalizing MP to respiratory system compliance or lung volume determined using CT [34] are necessary in subgroup of patients with ARF or ARDS. In addition, it is hard to recognize ARF patients without lung injury and those with ventilation failure caused by neuromuscular dysfunction in MIMIC III. Thus, this issue was not analyzed in this study.",
