According to eq. 4, the number of deaths per week from 25.10.20 (i.e. 13 days later) is: 29 per million inhabitants x 83.7 million inhabitants x 2.6 % x 7 days = 441.

The numbers of new infections have dominated the headlines since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the positive rate should be supplemented as soon as possible by media and officials.
