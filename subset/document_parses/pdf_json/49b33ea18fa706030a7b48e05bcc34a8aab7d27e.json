            "text": "Background A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been responsible for a worldwide pandemic. Children typically have very mild, or no, symptoms of infection. This makes estimations of seroprevalence in children difficult. Research is therefore required to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children. The primary objective of this study is to report the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG antibodies in healthy children at baseline, 2 months and 6 months. This is the only longitudinal UK study of seroprevalence in an exclusively paediatric population. Determining the changing seroprevalence is of vital public health importance and can help inform decisions around the lifting of paediatric specific social distancing measures such as school closures and the cancellation of routine paediatric hospital services. Methods and analysis 1000 healthy children of healthcare workers aged between 2 and 15 years will be recruited from five UK sites (Belfast, Cardiff, Glasgow, London and Manchester). The children will undergo phlebotomy at baseline, 2 months and 6 months to measure IgM and/or IgG positivity to SARS-CoV-2. A sample size of 675 patients is required to detect a 5% change in seroprevalence at each time point assuming an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.2. Adjusted probabilities for the presence of IgG and/or IgM antibodies and of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be reported using logistic regression models where appropriate.",

The majority of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild-to-moderate symptoms, but a proportion develop rapidly progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. 5 6 In February 2020, the WHO named the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus as COVID-19. 7 Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection typically have a milder clinical course than adults",

It is unclear if this is a novel condition or Kawasaki disease initiated by infection with SARS-CoV-2. 13 While rare, PIMS-TS is of concern as some children have required admission to intensive care units. 14 It is unclear, currently, what proportion of children have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the UK. As already described, children have been relatively spared during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and overall they only account for 1.7% of reported cases in the USA, 15 1% of reported cases in the Netherlands 16 and 2% of reported cases in the UK. 17 These reported confirmed cases are unlikely to reflect the total number of exposed children due to the mild nature of COVID-19 in children. Infection survey pilots in the UK have shown no disparity in community cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection between adults and children (0.24% whole population and 0.30% under the age of 19). 18 A prospective seroprevalence study is therefore required to determine what proportion of children in the UK have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, how long antibodies persist for and the symptoms associated with COVID-19 in healthy children.",

The study is potentially limited ias it is not powered to detect very small changes in seroprevalence (less than 5%). The results may not be generalisable to the entire population as the included participants are all children of healthcare workers. Children of healthcare workers were however chosen because the consent processes and preparation for phlebotomy will be easier among healthcare workers than the general population. The current social distancing restrictions make face-to-face consent discussions and the use of play therapists difficult. By recruiting children of healthcare workers those consent discussions are likely to be easier, due to a greater prior knowledge. Healthcare workers are also more likely to have a better insight into the study procedures and how to prepare children for phlebotomy.",
