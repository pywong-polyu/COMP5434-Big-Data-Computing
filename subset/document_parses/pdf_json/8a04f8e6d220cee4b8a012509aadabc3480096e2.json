Research has shown both an increase in EMS calls for opioid overdose and a significant increase in the number of patients who were treated on scene and refused transport during the pandemic. 7 A concerning pattern in the police record management system of Chittenden County found that 88% of overdose fatalities were attributed to using opioids in isolation. 8 Statewide opioid-related fatalities in Vermont increased by 63.4% during the pandemic period.",

Although overall ED visits decreased during the initial months of the pandemic, the percentage of patients presenting with opioid use disorder or overdose-related visits remained constant, yet there was a significant 86.2% decrease in the number of patients enrolling in ED-initiated medication for opioid use disorder. Allocation of healthcare resources and strategies devised to mitigate harm and maintain treatment options must be implemented for those struggling with opioid use disorder during the ongoing pandemic.",

Vertical line represents the beginning of the pandemic period. ED, emergency department; OUD, opioid use disorder; STAR, Start Treatment and Recover; UVMMC, University of Vermont Medical Center4 DISCUSSIONAlthough the overall number of patients presenting to the UVMMC ED during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased dramatically, the percentage of patients screening positive for opioid use disorder did not change. Moreover, the number of overdose visits remained the same, leading to overdose visits as a percentage of the monthly ED census almost doubling. Despite these conditions, there was a significant 86.2% reduction in STAR enrollment. This suggests that although the need for treatment was unchanged, fewer patients were enrolled in STAR. This decrease may have been attributed to a reluctance from patients or may reflect an impediment on the ED to provide this service. COVID-19 has created additional barriers to care and has led to an environment with increased risks for patients with opioid use disorder. The most omnipresent barrier during the pandemic has been fear of contracting COVID-19. Public messaging during this time was to \"Stay Home and Stay Safe,\" which may have influenced patients to defer or confidence interval; ED, emergency department; STAR, Start Treatment and Recover. refuse emergency care and account for a decrease in ED census.

Moreover, the transition away from in-person visits have led to problems in the distribution of harm-reduction materials. This includes naloxone, fentanyl testing strips, and other safe injection supplies. A lack of access to naloxone and fentanyl testing strips may also have contributed to the increase in fatal and non-fatal overdoses.9 Patients who do present to the ED during the pandemic may arrive with higher acuity and more severe disease. A case report illustrated this detailing a patient who, because of fear of COVID-19, did not seek care for persistent chest pain for 2 days resulting in \"catastrophic complications\" related to their ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.10 The impact of delaying care in patients with opioid use disorder may mean that people with opioid use disorder are not seeking emergency care until they are being transported to the ED after an overdose or have developed more severe complications associated with opioid use disorder. Once patients are in the ED, they face additional barriers to enrolling in STAR. Research assistants have had to operate remotely during the pandemic, complicating the logistics of",
