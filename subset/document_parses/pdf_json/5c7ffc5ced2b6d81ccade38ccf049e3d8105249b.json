Deep learning and, in particular, convolution-based approaches are the current state-of-the-art classification models. However, in the presence of noisy hyperspectral datasets, these deep convolutional neural networks underperform. In this paper, we proposed a feature augmentation approach to increase noise resistance in imbalanced hyperspectral classification. Our method calculates context-based features, and it uses a deep convolutional neuronet (DCN). We tested our proposed approach on the Pavia datasets and compared three models, DCN, PCA + DCN, and our context-based DCN, using the original datasets and the datasets plus noise. Our experimental results show that DCN and PCA + DCN perform well on the original datasets but not on the noisy datasets. Our robust context-based DCN was able to outperform others in the presence of noise and was able to maintain a comparable classification accuracy on clean hyperspectral images.",

To obtain a speed improvement, many practical applications are forced to settle for approximation approaches, in which they do not return exact answers. In practice, numerical optimizations and fast approximation saturate the spectrum of algorithms and research.

Moreover, the authors in [49] proposed another tensor-based representation to better preserve the spatial and spectral information and capture the local and global structures of hyperspectral images. Yet these models do not focus on imbalanced datasets nor try to solve the denoising problem. Recently, in the field of optical coherence tomography (OCT) [50] has introduced a tensor-based learning model, which tackles the denoising problem on high resolution OCT medical images with great results. However, it is unclear how well tensorbased models would represent the structure of imbalance datasets and will remain outside the scope of our work.",

However, our experimental results showed that in the presence of noisy hyperspectral datasets, these expert-level models underperform. To address this shortcoming, this paper presented a context-based feature augmentation approach to increase noise resistance in highly-imbalanced hyperspectral classification. On noisy datasets, our robust approach outperformed a basic deep learning model and outclassed a combination of PCA and DCN approach. In addition, on highly-imbalanced noisy data, our context-based DCN approach suffered significant loss in terms of classification accuracy (less than 10%), whereas DCN and PCA + DCN suffered from an alarming 25% and 50% cuts in classification accuracy respectively.",

In this Cartesian plane graph, the x-axis denotes the Recall and the y-axis denotes the Precision. us, PR curves depict Recall vs. Precision, where we have the following: (i) Recall is equal to True Positives (TP) divided by the addition of True Positives (TP) and False Negatives (FN), that is, TP/(TP + FN) (ii) Precision is equal to True Positives (TP) divided by the addition of True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP), that is, TP/(TP + FP) Finally, to compare the performance of each model dataset side by side, we compile a table using the ROC Area under Curve (AUC) Score for each model dataset. To this end, we used the following metrics: (i) Accuracy is equal to the quotation between the addition of True Positives and True Negatives divided by the Total Population, that is, (TP + TN)/ (TP + TN + FP + FN) (ii) F1-score is equal to two times Precision (P) times Recall (R) divided by the addition of Precision (P) and Recall (R), that is, 2PR/(P + R) 5.2.
