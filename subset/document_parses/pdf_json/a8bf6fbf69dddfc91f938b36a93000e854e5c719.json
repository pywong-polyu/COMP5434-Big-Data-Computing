A diagnosis of diabetes type 2 was made, and the primary care provider prescribed oral medications. Rita did not receive any patient education or referrals. About a month later, the exhaustion had not lessened, and she seemed to have unclear thoughts. Rita received a glucometer, and blood glucose results were consistently over 600 mg/dL.

Due to COVID-19 restrictions in the hospital, no visitors were allowed in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Intensive care unit (ICU) beds were also unavailable due to COVID-19 patients, leading to an extended stay in the PACU (4 days). She frequently was unable to get her nurse's attention due to the PACU not being equipped to handle this type of patient. Limited communication was shared with Nancy's husband, who the surgeon only called immediately after surgery. Her husband had limited information by texting Nancy, who infrequently responded due to pain, IVs, medications, and general exhaustion. Nancy's husband was finally allowed to visit her when she was transferred from the PACU but was still not kept informed about her status by nurses, physicians, or other providers but only via Nancy herself who was not at her cognitive baseline.",

As nursing professors, Rita and Nancy understand the health care system. Most people do not have this advantage, and incorrect, delayed, or absent communication as seen in these scenarios may cause anxiety, frustration, and panic. The pandemic highlights the urgency for practical, focused ways to communicate with patients and families (1). Patients have unique concerns, and nurses should personalize communication to their individualized needs (5) . The health care team must offer clear, targeted information with key points repeated for understanding (5) . Information should be delivered by methods that the patient and family prefer (5) . Technology such as text messages, voice mail, email, and telehealth can be leveraged to support patient and family connectedness. Empathetic, active listening can impact effective therapeutic communication with patients and families (6) . Listening and hearing what is said is fundamental to nursing and caring for patients (7) . Listening involves more than just asking questions. Nurses should be interested, mindful, and flexible while listening. Focusing on the person answering the questions sometimes offers information of which the nurses weren't aware (8) . The ability to fully hear issues of concern without judgment allows true tailoring of care interventions (7) . It is empowering for patients to decide what is best for their care.",
