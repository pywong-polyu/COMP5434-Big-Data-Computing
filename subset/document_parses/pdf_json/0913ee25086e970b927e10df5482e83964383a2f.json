Resident physicians appear to be more exposed due to the higher workload, prolonged exposure and the first contact with patients. To compare the incidence of burnout syndrome before and during the COVID 19 pandemic in cardiology residents. A prospective study was carried out. The Maslach questionnaire was implemented in cardiology residents of an institution of the City of Buenos Aires, in the month of September 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the results were compared with those prospectively collected in the same population during September of 2019. The survey was anonymous. The questionnaire was responded by 39 residents (2019: 16; 2020: 23). Burnout was observed in 30% (n = 7) in 2019, and in 39% (9%) residents during the COVID-19 pandemic (P= 0.77). The median score for emotional exhaustion was 38 (IQR 29-43) for the 2020s group, and 34 (IQR 27-42) for the 2019 (P = 0.32). The median score for depersonalization was 12 (IQR [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] and 15 (IQR 11-18) for 2020 and 2019 respectively Introduction & T he Burnout syndrome (BOS), which describes a state of mental and physical exhaustion, product of chronic work stress manifested by negative attitudes and feelings towards the individuals with whom one works and towards the professional role itself, was introduced by Freudenberger in the mid-seventies to give an explanation to the negative process that personnel undergo in their work performance. 1 It is about the feeling of being emotionally exhausted, a response that occurs more frequently in health professionals. This syndrome is associated not only with a decrease in work productivity and worse patients treatment, but also with physical effects such as sleep disturbances, increased cardiovascular risk, and higher suicide rates. 2 Nowadays, it is impossible to about the exhaustion of health personnel, specifically resident doctors, without thinking about the impact of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.",

First, the survey was conducted in a monovalent institution specialized in cardiology, for that reason the number of patients suffering from COVID-19 disease were significantly lower in comparison to general hospitals. Also, as it is a high complexity sanatory, residents are used to high work stress level. The changes in the work schedule were residents are on duty for 15 days, followed by 15 days at home as backup in case any of their colleagues got infected functioned as resting days, as we had a low number of infections in hospital staff. Finally, due to the compulsory population isolation imposed by the national government, the number of medical consultations and programmed procedures were significantly reduced, resulting in a lower workload during the firsts months of the pandemic.",
