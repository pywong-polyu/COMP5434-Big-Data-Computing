We examined the effects of PA and SB on cardiopulmonary exercise performance in children, adolescents and young adults both with and without underling cardiac disease, and hypothesized that there will be a change in aerobic and physical working capacity during the pandemic. This was a single-center retrospective longitudinal cohort study in patients age 6-22 years who underwent serial maximal cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Metabolic variables were obtained; PA and SB data were extracted from clinic notes. A total of 122 patients (60% male) underwent serial exercise testing with a median age of 14 years at the first CPET. Predicted peak aerobic capacity significantly decreased among both females and males during the pandemic, even after adjusting for changes in somatic growth. There was no significant change in physical working capacity during the pandemic. Patients who were more aerobically fit experienced a greater decrease in aerobic capacity during the pandemic compared to those less fit. In conclusion, cardiopulmonary exercise performance, notably aerobic activity, decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in children, adolescents and young adults compared to pre-pandemic values. This decline was most notable in those with the highest pre-pandemic aerobic capacity values and was independent of somatic growth or changes in BMI. This study has public health implications and demonstrates the importance of PA on overall cardiovascular health.",

Shortly thereafter, social distancing practices were enacted, and lockdowns were put into effect [1] . Beginning mid-March 2020 in the United States, one of the measures taken in all 50 states was closure of primary and secondary schools, with most of these closures extending through the end of the 2019-2020 school year [2] . Additionally, many schools reopened for the 2020-2021 school year as entirely virtual or with a hybrid approach [3] . Most sports teams cancelled practices and competitions, exercise classes and gyms shut down, and in many areas, public parks were closed to the public. While these were necessary for mitigating the spread of COVID-19, the effects on physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in children could be profound.",

SB is defined as a behavior while awake that has an energy expenditure of \u2264 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) while sitting or reclining [5] . This may include watching television, playing video games, and using the computer. PA is important not just for cardiovascular health but also for mental health and physical well-being. This is true for both healthy children as well as for those with congenital heart disease [6] . Given that COVID-19 is a new and ongoing pandemic, there are limited data on PA and SB during this time in children and adolescents. Recent studies of self-reported survey data and device-based measures have shown a decrease in PA and an increase in SB during the COVID-19 pandemic in children [7, 8] . To our knowledge, no studies have looked at the effect of these changes on cardiopulmonary exercise performance. Additionally, there are no studies to date evaluating the impact that the pandemic has had on exercise performance in the pediatric population. We hypothesize that there will be a decrease in exercise performance in children, adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic values.",

A maximal test was defined as achieving a maximal respiratory exchange ratio (RER) greater than or equal to 1.10. The protocol consisted of three minutes of pedaling in an unloaded state (zero watts), followed by a ramp increase in work rate to maximal exercise capacity and peak work rate [10] . The steepness of the ramp protocol was designed to achieve a peak work rate of 3 watts/kg in females and preadolescent males and 3.5 watts/kg in adolescent males in 10 to 12 min of cycling time, with the ramp speed increase ranging from 10 to 20 watts per minute based on subject weight. Subjects were encouraged to maintain a pedaling cadence (revolutions per minute) between 60 and 90 revolutions per minute throughout the study with average 60 to 70 revolutions per minute maintained until the last minute of exercise where subjects were encouraged to increase their peddling speed to achieve maximal work rate. This range was within the specified parameters of the cycle ergometer to maintain an accurate work rate. The patients were able to view their cadence on a meter located in the center of the bicycle handlebars. A clinical exercise physiologist and staff pediatric cardiologist trained to provide age-appropriate encouragement to achieve maximal exercise performance were present during the exercise stress testing.",

VAT was measured manually by both the exercise physiologist and the supervising cardiologist using the V-slope and ventilatory equivalents methods. All data were averaged over 10 s intervals for measurements at VAT and maximal exercise.

These changes occurred independent of changes in somatic growth and BMI. School structure as a surrogate for SB was not associated with changes in exercise performance, although the accuracy of this finding may be explained by missing data regarding school structure in clinic notes reviewed.

During the early days of the pandemic (March-April 2020), a Canadian study of children with congenital heart disease evaluated PA and found that step counts were significantly lower during this time compared to pre-pandemic step counts. A cross-sectional survey of 1000 children and adolescents evaluated selfreported PA, screen time, and mental health during October-November 2020 in the COVID-19 pandemic [11] . The study found that in the younger 6-10-year age group, 23.3% (n = 119) children performed 60 min/day of activity while an even smaller amount of children and adolescents in the older 11-17 year old age group achieved this (n = 76, 13.5%).

Furthermore, the greatest decrease in exercise performance was among those who were the most aerobically fit pre-pandemic. One explanation could be that these subjects were likely participating in competitive, structured sports, with practices and/or games multiple times per week pre-pandemic. For much of the study period, sports practices were cancelled leaving these subjects without their usual form of PA available, resulting in a more significant decrease in PA from baseline compared to those less aerobically fit. Another explanation is that detraining results in a rapid decrease in maximal VO 2 during the first month of detraining, and an approximate 16% decline over 12 weeks of physical deconditioning [17] . While the subjects with greater fitness pre-pandemic may still have a higher VO 2 during the pandemic, they likely had a greater percentage decrease compared to the less fit patient.",

This was a single-center study with a relatively small sample size, although the sample size is robust for this patient population. As this was a retrospective longitudinal chart review study, some patient data may have been unavailable, notably regarding school structure. Another limitation is the variation in clinical practice regarding the use of metabolic testing during the CPET that is an inherent limitation due to the retrospective observational nature of this study design. However, most subjects who had metabolic testing performed received metabolic testing on both CPET and thus can use the longitudinal data from serial testing to perform the statistical analyses on the metabolic data. Due to the small sample size, if the study was limited to only those who had metabolic testing, we would have had inadequate power to detect statistical differences. In addition, recall bias may have been introduced when the subjects described their amount of PA both pre-and during the pandemic. Another possible bias is the type of subjects evaluated, as one-third had congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to the general population.",

This decline was most notable in those with the highest pre-pandemic aerobic capacity values and was independent of somatic growth or changes in BMI. PA decreases helped explain the changes in aerobic capacity. Future studies should examine if exercise performance returns to pre-pandemic values once schools and activities have returned to pre-pandemic levels. This study has public health implications for our youth and demonstrates the importance of PA on overall cardiovascular health.",
