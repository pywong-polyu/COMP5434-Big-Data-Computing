She was intubated immediately and after initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation, referred to our emergency on manual positive pressure ventilation. No symptoms were noticed by parents preceding this episode. There was no setting of early onset bacterial infection. At arrival she had severe bradycardia and no respiratory efforts. She could not be resuscitated and declared dead at 78 h of life. The post mortem nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 RT-PCR was positive and the ORF gene CT was 28 and RdRp gene CT was 21 (BGI kit).
