We have developed an HSV-1 mutant virus that is gE+/gI+/FcyR-and capable of normal cell-to-cell spread in an animal model. On the basis of linker scanning data, a recombinant HSV-1 was constructed (NS-gE,,,) carrying an insertion at gE amino acid position 339, such that the gE/gI complex is still formed, but inactive for FcyR Plaque size was normal in human epidermal keratinocyte cells, which indicated that cell-to-cell spread of the mutant virus remained intact.36 This recombinant proved useful for in vivo studies to address the role of the FcyR in immune evasion independent of the function of gE/gI in cell-to-cell spread.

            "text": "in binding non-immune IgG,27*28 more recent studies from our laboratory addressed whether the HSV-1 FcyR preferentially binds the Fc domain of immune IgG,29 thereby inhibiting antiviral effector functions including complement activation and ADCC. We demonstrated that anti-HSV IgG binds to its target antigen by its Fab end and to the HSV FcyR by its Fc end, a process called antibody bipolar bridging.\" (Figure 2) Bipolar bridging was proposed since efficient binding of IgG to the FcyR depends on two conditions: (1) the IgG must be from a species whose Fc domain is capable of binding to the HSV FcyR and (2) antibodies must bind by their Fab domain to HSV antigens. The former condition was demonstrated by comparing the efficacy of various antibodies in blocking rosetting of IgG-coated erythrocytes to the HSV-1 infected cells.29 Whereas human anti-gD MAb and rabbit anti-gC IgG efficiently blocked rosetting, murine anti-gD MAb did not block FcyR activity2' because the Fc domain of murine IgG does not bind to the HSV-1 F c~R .~' The latter condition was demonstrated by two observations. JgDz HSV-1 virus or infected cell Model of antibody bipolar bridging: an IgG molecule (centre) binds by its Fab domain to its target antigen, shown here as HSV-1 glycoprotein gD (gray), and the Fc domain of the same IgG molecule binds to the HSV-1 FcyR which consists of glycoproteins gE and gI (black, 'U-shaped' structure). The FcyR blocks activities mediated by the Fc domain of IgG.",
