Those patients usually underwent a stage of excessive inflammation before developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this study, we test the hypothesis that short-term, low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids would benefit patients when used in the early phase of excessive inflammation, namely, the therapeutic window. Among a Shanghai cohort and a validation cohort, we enrolled COVID-19 patients showing marked radiographic progression. Short-term, low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids were considered for them. After identifying the possible markers for the therapeutic window, we then divided the patients, based on whether they were treated with corticosteroids within the therapeutic window, into the early-start group and control group. We identified that the therapeutic window for corticosteroids was characterized by a marked radiographic progression and lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) less than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The Shanghai cohort comprised of 68 patients, including 47 in the early-start group and 21 in the control group. The proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation was significantly lower in the early-start group than in the control group (10.6% vs. 33.3%, difference, 22.7%, 95% confidence interval 2.6-44.8%). Among the validation cohort of 51 patients, similar difference of the primary outcome was observed (45.0% vs. 74.2%, P = 0.035). Among COVID-19 patients with marked radiologic progression, short-term, low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids benefits patients with LDH levels of less than two times the ULN, who may be in the early phase of excessive inflammation.",

Despite the fact that COVID-19 patients have mild symptoms and signs in their early stage, about 8-30% of patients would eventually develop severe illness. Furthermore, the 28-day mortality rate of critically ill patients is over 60% [2] .

Challenging analytical issues with these studies include the selection bias and confounders as physicians tend to use corticosteroids in more severe patients [3, 5] . The study population of previous studies might not identify the subjects who could benefit from corticosteroids. According to the currently known molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza patients, critically ill patients usually undergo the following stages: virus invasion, immune activation, excessive inflammatory response, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and, in the end, possible recovery or death [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Although corticosteroids can suppress the inflammatory response, using it too early may suppress the immune activation, thus weaken the viral clearance, while using it too late, the patient is probably too ill to be rescued, as excessive inflammation has progressed, causing ARDS as a result ( Figure 1 ). The therapeutic window of the corticosteroids was presumed to be the early phase of excessive inflammation which varies from person to person and may change dynamically.",

Stably mild patients were given systemic supportive therapy and corticosteroid was not introduced because of potential risks. Patients were considered eligible for corticosteroids once chest radiology examinations suggested they were at risk of progression to ARDS. Therapeutic treatment usually consisted of 40-80 mg/d (0.75-1.5 mg/kg/d) of methylprednisolone for 3 days, then was tapered to 20 mg/d, with a total treatment period of less than 7 days.

Thus, we needed a dynamic indicator that could reflect the patient's phase of excessive inflammation, whether early or late. We evaluated all the laboratory parameters that we monitored closely, determining the association between variates and diseases severity, trying to find a certain indicator that on par with the disease progression. Based on this, eligible patients would be divided into two groups according to the timing of corticosteroids therapy: the early-start group, as patients were treated with corticosteroids at the early phase of excessive inflammation, and the control group, as patients were treated with corticosteroids at the late phase of excessive inflammation, later as rescue treatment, or did not take corticosteroids.",

By identifying the therapeutic window in the Shanghai cohort and confirming our theory in the validation cohort, we demonstrated that patients in the early phase of excessive inflammation could benefit from the short-term, lowto-moderate-dose corticosteroids therapy. The timing applying corticosteroids is critical. Based on molecular mechanisms and physiologic data, dysregulated inflammation has played a significant role in the progression of ARDS [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Theoretically, corticosteroids should be able to suppress inflammation. However, corticosteroids are obviously not panacea. We should not expect corticosteroids to work in the late phase of excessive inflammatory response, while huge amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines have formed. Nor shall we expect corticosteroids to revive the damage caused by extensive inflammation, especially when developing into ARDS, which is incurable for the time being [15] . We consider this as the reason that many studies reached negative conclusions on the use of corticosteroids in the intensive care unit (ICU) or critically ill patients [5, [16] [17] [18] . These patients were probably having an advanced stage of disease too late to be rescued by corticosteroids. On the other hand, for mild patients, we think it is inappropriate to use corticosteroids with no evidence of disease progression. Most patients' immune system was activated in a proper way that would never produce excessive cytokines and they would recover from the infection without further intervention ( Figure 5 ). Therefore, a therapeutic window for corticosteroids should be established.",

However, how to determine the beginning and end of this therapeutic window is the tricky part. A constant marker, such as 72 h after symptom onset [19] or the day of ICU admission [16] , may not be a good choice as clinical conditions are constantly changing and vary individually. An ideal indicator should be able to dynamically reflect the patient's condition, and its value should be completely parallel to the disease progression. Thus, we focused on the laboratory parameters for their objectivity, changeability, and scalability. For those who have high-risk host factors, we are likely to obtain a narrower therapeutic window, hence, closely monitoring against time is urgent for their early intervention ( Figure 5 ).",

However, the mean age between patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation shows no difference, suggesting that age was not related to the outcome in our study. This finding inspired us to assume that, younger patients may have a wider therapeutic window, resulting a higher possibly of receiving corticosteroids in time. While older patients are more vulnerable to hypoxia or other injuries, their LDH is more likely to exceeds 2 times the ULN. The risk of advanced age during the course of the disease is ultimately reflected in LDH levels.",

The results from RECOVERY study identified another therapeutic window of dexamethasone, which was similar but wider than that of our study. Both RECOVERY study and our study emphasized that corticosteroids could not benefit all COVID-19 patients and the therapeutic window of corticosteroids should be established. The value of both studies is to identify the subgroup of patients within the therapeutic window where the benefit of corticosteroid outweighs its risk. In this study, the therapeutic window of corticosteroids was characterized by marked radiographic progress with LDH levels of less than 2ULN, which merits further investigation. Marked radiographic progression is usually a sign of disease deterioration according to clinical experience, but it is probably delayed when taking the theoretical beginning of the excessive inflammation into account, for imaging itself can be seen as a part of the consequence of excessive inflammation. Although LDH was the best indicator of disease status among all the indicators we are able to evaluate, our methods could be optimized further. It should be noted that imaging and LDH levels combined is just one of the ways to identify the therapeutic window. By combining other indicators, such as lymphocyte count, CD4 cell count, D-dimer, and even genetic susceptibility typing in the future, we believe that the patients subgroup who could benefit from corticosteroids therapy will be targeted more accurately.",

Even The intervention window (pink) of the disease is the interval from when the patient needs medical intervention to when the patient cannot be rescued by any available measures. Theoretically, different treatments have different therapeutic windows. For corticosteroids, its therapeutic window should be the early phase of excessive inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Whether initiating the corticosteroids therapy should base on the relationship between the patient condition (blue line) and the therapeutic window (green). For mild patients, the level of patient condition would be stably lower than the therapeutic window for corticosteroids, who may even never require any medical interventions. For the patients with high-risk factors such as advanced age, the area in brown would be larger and the level of blue line rose correspondingly, resulting in a narrower space to the intervention window and greater possibility of exceeding the therapeutic window for corticosteroids. An Ideal indictor is what exactly reflects the patient condition just as the buoy (orange icon) on the river. so, corticosteroids are still the first-line treatment for many other diseases. For these diseases, the benefits of corticosteroids far outweigh the risks and adverse reactions. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the benefit-risk ratio while consider applying corticosteroids. The benefits can be further fortified after finding a corticosteroids-suitable population, as we have demonstrated; while the risk of adverse reactions can be reduced by decreasing the dose and duration of corticosteroids. For the early intervention group, our starting dose of corticosteroids was methylprednisolone 40-80 mg/d (0.75-1.5 mg/kg/d). Generally, the dosage was reduced after 3 days of treatment, and the total course of treatment did not exceed 7 days. Adverse reactions to corticosteroids in the early-start group were no more than in the control group. The data on adverse reactions in our study further supports the strategy of the early usage of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids in high-risk patients.",

Nelson Lee et al. [21] conducted a randomized controlled trial of 16 patients with SARS; the median time for SARS-CoV to become undetectable in plasma was 12 days (11-20 days) in the hydrocortisone group versus 8 days (8-15 days) in controls. It should be noted, however, that this cohort only included non-severe patients with symptom onset less than 5 days, while excluding patients with comorbidities or with oxygen saturation < 90% without supplemental oxygen therapy. As a result, the proportion of patients who would develop severe illness is very low in this cohort. Data on the effects of corticosteroids on viral clearance in this group of patients were very valuable; however, it is inappropriate to evaluate the benefit-risk ratio of corticosteroids in this cohort. Potentially delayed viral clearance should not mitigate the benefits of corticosteroids on preventing disease progression. The relationship between virus clearance time, viral load, and prognosis is unclear in COVID-19 patients.",
