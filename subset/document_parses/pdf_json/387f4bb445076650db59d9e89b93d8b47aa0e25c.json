            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to highly pathogenic diseases in humans, from common colds to acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death [1] . Because of its rapid spreading and high fatality, COVID-19 has become a big threat to human health [2] . Thus far, no effective treatment has been developed for this severe disease. Many researches explored the molecular details of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 by genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics technologies [3] . Previous studies have shown that although the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to SARS-CoV-1, there are some differences in their 3 0 ORFs (open-reading frames): ORF3b and ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2 are absent in SARS-CoV-1 [4] , indicating the unique functional possibility of these two ORFs. ORF10 encodes a putative 38amino acid viral protein, and systematical protein-protein interaction studies confirmed the interaction between ORF10 protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human ZYG11B [5] . ZYG11B, as a substrate receptor of Cullin 2-RING E3 Ubiquitin ligase (CRL2), is able to specifically recognize N-terminal degradation signal starting with glycine in protein, termed Gly/N-degron, for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by 26S proteasome [6] . Unexpectedly, Mena et al. found that ORF10 has no relevance to the E3 activity of ZYG11B and the interaction between them has no effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro [5] . Although it seems ORF10 has no essential functions [7] , there are still some clues for us to reevaluate the significance of ORF10 function. Studies in HeLa cells found ORF10 binds and degrades mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) by inducing mitophagy, leading to the inhibition of antiviral innate immune response [8] . Several mutations located at ORF10 may confer increasing pathogenesis and transmissibility to these mutant strains [9e12] . So the exact function of ORF10 may still need to be explored [13] , and elaboration of ORF10-ZYG11B interaction could provide new ideas for the development of therapies for COVID-19.",

            "text": "ZYG11B, together with ZER1, serve as substrate receptors in the recently identified Gly/N-degron pathway [6] . Previously, we have elucidated the recognition mechanism of Gly/N-degron by ZYG11B and ZER1, and also uncovered the preference of the residues following the N-terminal glycine [14] , verified that a bulky or aromatic residue following glycine is preferred by ZYG11B [6] . As the amino acids following the initiator methionine are glycine and tyrosine in ORF10, and initiator methionine followed by a small residue is constitutively cleaved by methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) [15] , making the N-terminus of ORF10 a perfect Gly/Ndegron that can be efficiently recognized by ZYG11B, which is in agreement with previous studies. Here we report the crystal structure of ZYG11B bound to N-terminal peptide of ORF10. Our work not only unveils the recognition mechanism of ORF10 by ZYG11B, but may also shed light on further investigating the functional potential of ORF10-ZYG11B interaction as well as developing novel treatment for COVID-19.",

In previous studies, we have already shown ARM (armadillo) repeats of ARM3-8 in ZYG11B are responsible for binding with Gly/N-degrons [14] . And ZYG11B has been shown to specifically recognize the N-terminus of ORF10 [5] . To explore this binding mechanism by determining the complex structure, we adopted the same technique as we used to solve the complex structures of ZYG11B bound to Gly/N-degrons [14] . We fused the N-terminal peptide of ORF10 (GYINVG) to the N-terminus of ZYG11B 485-728 , and TEV protease cleavage exposes the glycine in the N-terminus of the fusion protein (Fig. 1B) . During the purification process of the fusion protein, we found it was eluted between thyroglobulin (Mr, 67 kDa) and b-lactoglobulin (Mr, 35 kDa) in SEC (size exclusion chromatography), indicating this fusion protein exists as a dimer in solution (Fig. S1 ). Then, we successfully obtained crystals of this fusion protein, and determined the crystal structure at a 2.6 \u00c5 resolution (Table 1) . Consistent with the SEC result, there are two protein molecules in one asymmetric unit forming a dimer by binding with the N-terminus of each other (Fig. 1C) .",

Most of ZYG11B residues and all ORF10 residues are visible in the structure. The overall structure of ZYG11B 485-728 bound to ORF10 peptide is similar to that of the other degron-bound ones, which exhibits an arch-shaped conformation consisting of six ARM repeats (ARM3-8) with ORF10 peptide located in the center (Fig. 1D) . A canonical ARM repeat contains three helices (H1, H2, and H3). H2 and H3 pack against one another in an antiparallel form and H1 usually lies perpendicular to the hairpin formed by the two longer helices of H2 and H3 [20] .The conformation variation of ARM6-H3 helix and ARM7-H1 helix of ZYG11B to an elongated loop in this structure is also identical to other degron-bound ZYG11B structures.

The a-carbonyl group of G1 forms two hydrogen bonds with Asn567 and Trp522 of ZYG11B. As a result, G1 forms five conserved hydrogen bonds with ZYG11B making it determinant for ORF10 recognition. Y2 forms T-shaped p-p and backbone-p stacking interaction with the indole group of Trp522 in ZYG11B. Moreover, Y2 also forms two main chain hydrogen bonds with Ala647 in ZYG11B. I3 is hydrogen bonded to Asn523 in ZYG11B with its backbone amide, and makes hydrophobic interaction with Trp522 in ZYG11B.

            "text": "N-degron pathway is the first identified pathway for short-lived proteins targeted by proteasomal degradation [21] . But it took a long time for people to discover Gly/N-degron pathway, because metazoan proteomes lack Gly/N-degron to avoid targeting by ZYG11B and ZER1, so as to maintain proteome stability [6] . So Gly/ N-degrons usually present after proteolytic cleavage or in protozoan proteomes. Gly/N-degron pathway may participate in apoptosis through degradation of caspase-cleaved products [6] . The autoinhibitory NLRP1 N-terminal fragment can also be targeted by Gly/N-degron pathway after enteroviral 3C protease cleavage, thus activating the human NLRP1 inflammasome in airway epithelia [22] , suggesting ZYG11B and ZER1 may be essential in immune response. SARS-CoV-2 as a protozoan, its genome encodes a putative protein ORF10 which shows a strong interaction with ZYG11B. ORF10 is relevant to the inhibition of antiviral innate immune response [8] , and may contribute to pathogenesis and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 [9e12], indicating its interaction with ZYG11B could probably modulate immune response, thus varying the pathogenesis and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our work not only elucidates the recognition mechanism of ORF10 by ZYG11B, but may also inspire further investigation on the functional potential of ORF10-ZYG11B interaction and facilitate the development of novel therapies for COVID-19.",
