Additionally, public transit agencies are facing challenges of reduced vehicle capacity due to social distancing requirements, additional costs of cleaning and protective equipment, and increased downtime for vehicle cleaning. Due to these constraints on resources and budgets, many transit agencies have adopted essential service plans with reduced service hours, number of routes, or frequencies. This paper studies the resiliency during a pandemic of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS), a new generation of transit systems that combine a network of high-frequency trains and buses with on-demand shuttles to serve the first and last miles and act as feeders to the fixed network. It presents a case study for the city of Atlanta and evaluates ODMTS for multiple scenarios of depressed demand and social distancing representing various stages of the pandemic.",

In Boston, the MBTA has tried to preserve as much of the weekday trips as possible for essential workers, but is now looking at dramatic budget cuts due to a deficit of close to $600M. (Goldbaum and Wright, 2020) . At the time of writing, the MBTA is considering cutting their ferry routes and weekend commuter rail services. In Atlanta, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) faced similar challenges. In April, MARTA reduced the frequency of the rail network from every 12 min to every 20 min and its essential service plan reduced the number of bus lines from 110 to 41 (Wickert, 2020b) . Even as transit planners and operators try to mitigate the effects of these service cuts, many essential workers and community members are still impacted in terms of accessibility and convenience. In Atlanta, many individuals rely on public transit for access to jobs, groceries, education, and healthcare, and are now forced to find alternative forms of transit (Wickert, 2020a) . Ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft are often prohibitively expensive, which makes it crucial that transit services return to normal as soon as possible.",

            "text": "This paper studies the resiliency of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS) (Mah\u00e9o et al., 2019 ) during a pandemic. ODMTS is a new generation of transit systems that consist of a network of high-frequency trains and/or buses combined with on-demand shuttles to serve the first and the last miles. In this paper, the resiliency of an ODMTS is defined as the measure in which the system is able to provide accessible public transit with a high level of service, within an appropriate budget, when a pandemic results in significantly lower ridership and additional safety requirements. ODMTS can respond to such a decrease in ridership by scaling down the number of on-demand shuttles and/or high-frequency buses. On-demand shuttles keep serving passengers close to where they are, such that access to the system is not compromised. By design, trains and buses are only used to serve busy corridors, which would still see traffic during a pandemic. Fig. 1 illustrates the design of an ODMTS and how it operates. This ODMTS features fixed rail and rapid bus transit routes, as well as on-demand shuttles. While the trains and buses operate on a fixed schedule, the shuttles are routed dynamically in real time. The example path through the ODMTS involves a shuttle leg to pick up the rider, a rail leg, a bus leg, and a final shuttle leg to bring the rider to her destination. All these legs are synchronized: for instance, the shuttle serving the last leg is waiting at the bus stop to bring the rider to her final destination. This video describes this process in more detail (Socially Aware Mobility Lab, 2020).",

Van Hentenryck (2020, 2021) and Auad and Van Hentenryck (2021) study the Ann-Arbor/Ypsilanti region in Michigan, which currently consists of 1267 bus stops, and the case studies consider about 3000 up to 7000 passengers at a time. Dalmeijer and Van Hentenryck (2020) present results for 7167 riders of the MARTA system in Atlanta, which currently consists of 5563 bus stops and 38 rail stations.

In particular, the models impose a constraint on the number of passenger transfers, and a new network design model is introduced to avoid the computational burden imposed by this constraint. 2. The paper provides a comprehensive case study for the city of Atlanta to assess the resiliency of ODMTS under various scenarios of pandemic response, which include loss of revenue due to depressed demand and reduced vehicle capacity due to social distancing requirements. High-fidelity simulations show that, by scaling down the number of shuttles appropriately, an ODMTS provides a similar level of service with a cost savings that compensates for revenue losses. The case study also shows that an ODMTS can operate successfully under more restrictive budgets, at the cost of increasing waiting times during the busiest times of the day.",

(2020) provide a systematic analysis of 113 public transit systems across the U.S., using data from the Transit App to study the unprecedented decline of public transit during this pandemic. They explored how social distancing, self-quarantine, and working from home recommendations from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) impacted ridership, even before the local spread of COVID-19. Tirachini and Cats (2020) discuss factors that influence the contagion risk of COVID-19 in public transit, including vehicle and station occupancy, exposure time, mask use, and hygiene. COVID-19 has led to new challenges for the transportation community, and different examples are given in the survey by Agatz et al. (2021) . Gkiotsalitis and Cats (2021b) study the impact of COVID-19 on public transit, and survey methods for public transit planning that can be used to address the changes in demand patterns and reductions in capacity. These include methods to set service frequencies, modify timetables, and to prevent crowding. Changing the service frequencies depending on the social distancing requirements has been studied by Gkiotsalitis and Cats (2021a) . The authors develop a mixed-integer quadratic programming model, which is used to conduct a case study for the Washington D.C. metro network.",

After establishing the individual legs, the legs are chained into trips, and trip destinations are estimated when data is unavailable. This occurs because the transactions (obtained from the Breeze Cards) report tap-in and tap-out data for the trains, but only tap-in data for the buses. However, since the ridership mostly consists of commuters, it is generally possible to infer the bus destination for a morning trip by using the corresponding bus boarding of the evening trip (and vice versa). The remaining destinations can be estimated by using the APC data and ensuring that the distributions match under some reasonable assumptions.

The shuttle arcs \u2208 capture that passengers are transported from ( ) to ( ) by shuttles, but the network design model does not specify how the shuttles perform this task. Shuttle routes will be created dynamically as part of the simulation by the real-time shuttle dispatcher (Section 4.4) to ensure a realistic evaluation of the system. This paper assumes that the rail network is fixed and that shuttle connections can always be used, such that rail and shuttle arcs are always opened. More precisely, the arc set is constructed as follows. Note that is a multigraph, and allows for parallel arcs corresponding to different modes and frequencies. Rail arcs are added with a fixed frequency between every pair of stations that is connected by a rail line, and it is assumed that all rail stations are in . Shuttle connections are added for every trip: from the origin to the hubs, from the hubs to the destination, and directly from the origin to the destination. Bus arcs are added for all frequencies in between all bus-only hubs (hubs that are not rail stations) and between each bus-only hub and the three nearest rail stations. The set of all bus arcs is denoted by . What remains to decide is which bus connections to provide and at which frequencies.",

The average utilization of buses and rail stays under 32% over the time horizon. The line chart in Fig. 12 shows the fraction of active shuttles over the time horizon. Almost all shuttles are active during the busiest period from 7am to 8am, but the waiting times show that the system is not overwhelmed. The same figure presents the total mileage for a given shuttle occupancy. It shows that riders can be offered individual shuttle rides most of the time, and that the amount of sharing increases when more shuttles are busy. The low occupancy suggests that reducing shuttle capacity in a pandemic is feasible. In total, the shuttles drive 105,127 miles between 6am and 10am, which amounts to 96 miles per shuttle on average. Trains are never at capacity, and only 0.7% of bus passengers incur a delay due to buses being full. Fig. 13 provides additional details. mainly local shuttle trips. The shuttle trips impose little traffic pressure on the main roads, which are served by a relatively small number of buses. Hence, by providing a convenient and accessible alternative to driving a car, ODMTS can also help to reduce congestion. For comparison, Fig. 15 visualizes the road usage when the same travelers would drive their personal vehicles. The figure suggests that if more people would switch from car to ODMTS, this could significantly reduce traffic, and especially relieve congestion on the main roads, which are most affected. Some roads (for instance) close to the College Park train station may seem to have additional traffic. Fig. 16 provides a close-up of this region. In fact, the ODMTS generates at most an average of 3.5 cars per minute more (red roads). The ODMTS also reduces the number of cars by up to 12.1 cars per minute compared to personal vehicles (blue roads).",

The estimated cost for buses in the morning peak is $134k per day for the current system. For the baseline ODMTS, it is only $127k for buses and shuttles together. These costs are calculated based on the hourly vehicle costs. Lower costs stem from the relatively low cost of operating shuttles compared to buses: The ODMTS only uses buses for busy corridors, where high-capacity vehicles are most efficient. For rail-only passengers, there is no significant difference between the systems obviously, but it is not known how these riders travel to the rail station. For current bus users, the ODMTS seems strongly preferred, as the trip duration is 19 min shorter on average. Other advantages of the ODMTS include better access to the public transit system, and less time for riders to get to a stop, as the on-demand shuttles can pick them up close to their origins.",

This is complemented by an evaluation that redesigns the network to take into account the change in demand and additional cleaning costs. Keeping the baseline ODMTS simplifies operations but a redesign may yield additional cost savings.

This section also studies how service levels change when this percentage increases. Table 4 summarizes the scenarios used in the case study. The first scenario is the baseline, and the other three are pandemic scenarios with depressed demand and reduced vehicle capacities to allow for social distancing. Fleet sizes are provided by the ridesharing and fleet-sizing algorithms. The ''Fixed design'' column assumes that the baseline network design is kept in place for all scenarios, except for the strict late pandemic scenario, which removes the bus subsystem (see Fig. 17 ). For the ''Redesign'' column, the network is redesigned based on the scenario, and the fleet size is determined for the redesigned network (Section 6.3).",

Sampling is used because the trips observed during the pandemic are shaped by the essential service plan, and do not necessarily represent the actual demand. The early pandemic scenario is based on the ridership level around March 18th, 2020, with 70k bus and 60k rail transactions per day. The late pandemic scenarios use the April 2020 level with 40k bus and 35k rail transactions. Due to the lack of bus transaction data for April, the proportion of bus to rail trips is kept the same for April and scaled down based on number of rail trips. The bus and rail capacities are indicated as percentages of the total baseline capacity. A 50% capacity allows for only using every other seat for social distancing. As social distancing is difficult in a shuttle, only one passenger is allowed during the pandemic. The strict late pandemic scenario imposes even stricter measures: Buses are considered not safe, and the system operates with only single passenger shuttles and trains at 25% capacity. One interesting observation is that for all pandemic scenarios, the number of shuttles is smaller than that for the baseline scenario. It is not obvious that this would be the case, and it demonstrates that ridership decreases sufficiently to allow for both a reduction in capacity and a reduction in the number of shuttles. It follows that the baseline fleet is sufficiently large to operate the system during a pandemic, and no additional vehicles are necessary.",

These results are also valid for individual trips. Table 6 shows that, for the early and late pandemic scenarios, the wait times are comparable to the baseline in distribution. In the strict late pandemic scenario, waiting times for the shuttles go up, as a result of removing the buses. Fig. 18 displays the waiting times over time for the strict late pandemic scenario. The pattern is similar to the baseline, except that the shuttle waiting times are slightly larger. But, even during the peak, the average waiting time for a shuttle leg is at an acceptable 6.5 min.

The cleaning cost is estimated at $3.37 per hour for buses, and $1.69 per hour for shuttles (see the Appendix).

            "text": "To compare the cost of the current system to that of an ODMTS, it is necessary to estimate the cost of operating a bus compared to operating an on-demand shuttle. MARTA reports that the operating expenses for buses are $104.10 per vehicle revenue hour. However, this number includes expenses for general administration and facility maintenance, and excludes depreciation of the vehicles. To present a fair comparison, it is assumed that buses and shuttles only differ in labor cost, vehicle maintenance cost, and vehicle depreciation. In particular, the cost of fuel and lubricants is ignored, as this is a relatively small component of the cost. If it were to be included, this would favor shuttles due to their better fuel efficiency.The cost of one person-hour of operating a bus is $23.52 in salaries and wages, to which $16.03 (68%) is added in fringe benefits (Federal Transit Administration, 2018). It is assumed that one vehicle revenue hour requires one person-hour of labor, which results in a conservative labor cost estimate. The maintenance cost is estimated at $19.17 per vehicle revenue hour. This number results from adding up salaries and wages, fringe benefits, and materials in the 'vehicle maintenance' category, and dividing by the number of vehicle revenue hours. The majority of the MARTA fleet consists of 40-foot compressed natural gas buses with a current purchase price of $625k (Federal Transit Administration, 2018; Dickens, 2020) . These buses have a useful life benchmark of 12 years, and are used for 3878 vehicle revenue hours per year on average. This corresponds to a $13.43 depreciation per revenue hour.For the purpose of comparing buses to shuttles, this brings the cost of a bus to $72.15 per hour. MARTA operates 465 buses in maximum service (Federal Transit Administration, 2018), which corresponds to $134k during the morning peak.It is assumed that shuttle drivers are paid the average wage of a bus driver in Atlanta and that they receive the same 68% of fringe benefits. This amounts to $14.42 per hour in wages (Glassdoor, 2020) and $9.83 in fringe benefits, for a total labor cost of $24.25 per hour. The maintenance cost is estimated at $0.09 per mile for a medium sedan (American Automobile Association, 2019), which results in $1.13 per hour, assuming that shuttles and buses are used for the same number of hours per day and have the same daily mileage on average. For the depreciation cost, it is assumed that shuttles have a purchase price of $30k and are replaced every four years, which is after 191k miles. This leads to a $1.93 depreciation cost per hour. Adding up these numbers, the comparable total cost of a shuttle is $27.31 per vehicle revenue hour.From an economic perspective, the public transit agencies may aim to recruit ridesharing drivers instead of bus drivers for operating the shuttles. According to the Ridester's Driver Earnings Survey, the average Uber driver in the US earns $19.36 per hour (Helling, 2020) . The car is the driver's property, and the driver is responsible for the associated costs. Based on the maintenance and depreciation costs as above, this results in an effective hourly wage of under $16.30, which is low compared to $24.25 for a bus driver.The additional cost for sanitizing and disinfecting vehicles during COVID-19 is estimated from data provided by Gwinnett County Transit, the public transit system in the neighboring county of Gwinnett. The data spans March to November 2020. The average cost per operating hour is calculated by dividing the total cost of fleet sanitation by the number of bus operating hours, which results in a cost of $3.37 per hour. This paper assumes that cleaning significantly smaller on-demand shuttles is possible for half that cost, that is, $1.69 per hour.",
