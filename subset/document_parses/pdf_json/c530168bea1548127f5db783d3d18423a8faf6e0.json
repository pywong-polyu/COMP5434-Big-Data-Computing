In short, these Latino cohorts were recruited initially as mother-child birth cohorts at UCSF Benioff and Zuckerberg San Francisco General (ZSFG) hospitals to evaluate early life risk factors for childhood obesity. Details about these cohorts has been previously described including methods of recruitment and demographics (Wojcicki et al., 2011; Ville et al., 2017) . The HEN and LEAD cohorts consist primarily of foreign born mothers (from Mexico and Central American countries) and were recruited primarily from ZSFG whereas TAB includes a more heterogenous mix of Latino families recruited primarily from UCSF Benioff. We re-contacted these cohorts telephonically in 2020 during an early period in the pandemic (May to September 2020) to assess food insecurity, housing conditions and risk for COVID-19 infection (Escobar et al., 2021; Mendez et al., in press ).",

Demographic factors including age, household size and household density and employment status as well as past vaccination history were assessed in relationship to self-disclosed COVID-19 vaccination nonintent for self and/or child. We also assessed differences in influences on COVID-19 vaccination intent between those who intended or had already vaccinated and those who were not planning to be vaccinated using chisquared tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

Thirty-five point two percent of TAB participants and 27.8% of HEN/LEAD stated COVID vaccination nonintent for themselves or their children. The most significant reasons for not wanting a COVID-19 vaccine for self or children were 1) the idea that the vaccine had not been around for long enough and/or 2) concern about side effects associated with the vaccine (Table 2 ). Concern about side effects were in general greater for children than adults (Table 2 ).

Previous surveys have found that higher socioeconomic status individuals are more likely to vaccinate using metrics focused on education, income and insurance status (Allen et al., 2021) or income alone (Reiter et al., 2020) . In our low-income cohorts of primarily foreign-born Latina women (HEN/LEAD), we did not find any association with educational status or employment but rather household density was more predictive of vaccination nonintent. Similarly, among the more economically heterogeneous TAB cohort, we also did not find any associations with education or income but crowding indices were also associated with vaccination intent. Paradoxically, increased housing density elevates risk for COVID-19 infection (Mendez et al., in press) , and our findings suggest that these same high-risk individuals may be less likely to get access to COVID-19 vaccination. Crowding indices may reflect immigration status, which was not collected in our survey, as previous studies have found that undocumented immigrants live in more crowded and less secure housing situations (Hall and Greenman, 2013) . In TAB, the more socioeconomically heterogenous of the two cohorts, Spanish language use was higher among those not intending to vaccinate, particularly for adult vaccination compared with English language speakers. There was no difference in language use for HEN/LEAD as the population was relatively homogenous linguistically with 93.5% reporting primary Spanish language use.",

A large nationally representative Kaiser Family Foundation study found that family and friends were instrumental in persuading individuals to get COVID-19 vaccination after initial nonintent (Kirzinger et al., 2021) . Another study with adult women found that exposure to social media may play a positive role in encouraging vaccine uptake (Berenson et al., 2021) and news media exposure may differentially impact Republican versus Democrat-aligned individuals (Fridman et al., 2021) . To our knowledge, this is the first study focused exclusively on the Latino population in California and suggests the importance of social networks and connections to change COVID-19 nonintent to intent to vaccinate.",

Key community stakeholders and clinics need to be involved at the grassroots level to dispel myths concerning vaccination and as our study has shown concern, in particular, surrounding the side effects of vaccination. The US Surgeon general has made a similar recommendation that local \"trusted messengers\" a key to COVID-19 vaccination (NPR, 2021). As described below, since the collection of data for this study, there have been increased efforts to publicize the notion that immigrant status will not play into access to vaccination or enforcement. Community clinics need to better circulate this message as well to ensure that local stakeholders can disseminate this information widely.",

While our study's demographics provide insight into reasons for vaccination nonintent among the Latino community, our sample may not be representative of the individual beliefs, values, and behaviors of all United States Latinos. Furthermore, developments in 2021 may have altered some perceptions concerning vaccinations. Over the time period that our study was conducted the United States government and the United States Department of Homeland Security made clear that vaccines will be available free of charge to all individuals in the United States and the immigrant status will not play into vaccination nor will enforcement be conducted near clinic sites or sites of vaccination distribution (United States Department of Homeland Security, 2021). Furthermore, the Biden administration has made a greater effort to facilitate partnership with Community Health Centers to promote equal access to vaccines among minority population groups (Corallo and Tolbert, 2021) . These political changes may have altered attitudes and intent concerning COVID-19 vaccination.",
