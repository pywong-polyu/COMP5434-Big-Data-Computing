The capacity to mount immune responses against new antigens is particularly affected in this population. However, its precise determinants are not fully understood. We aimed here at establishing the influence of persistent viral infections on the naive T-cell compartment and primary immune responsiveness in older adults.",

Advanced age is accompanied by the increase in acute and chronic diseases, resulting in an important decline in quality of life. In turn, this is associated with the need to care for elderly individuals with poor health. In particular, elderly people suffer more often and more severely from infections than young individuals. 1\u00c03 The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a particularly relevant example of the issues that can be encountered in this context. 4, 5 It highlights the importance of understanding better the evolution of the immune system with ageing, which is key in the vulnerability of old people to many diseases including COVID- 19 . Moreover the response of older people to vaccination is considered generally suboptimal. 6 A recent study shows that the immunogenicity to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 is indeed reduced in the elderly. 7 The need for in-depth knowledge on immune responsiveness to emerging infections and primary vaccinations in the elderly has never been greater.",

These studies have revealed differential responses upon vaccination in elderly populations. Some vaccines provided an adequate boosting of immunological memory while others presented a waning capacity to maintain strong and protective responses. 13 In contrast, available data sets from studies on yellow fever, 14, 15 hepatitis B, 16 or Japanese encephalitis virus 17 vaccines, indicate that primary responses in older individuals are mostly compromised.

Improving our understanding of immune aging has broad implications in disease prevention and optimization of vaccine immunogenicity with advanced age. While recall responses to pathogens encountered earlier in life are usually uncompromised, there is an established paradigm that the ability to mount primary cellular immune responses from naive T cells is waning in older people. For instance, reduced immunogenicity to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has recently been demonstrated in elderly people. However, the factors that can impact the naive T-cell compartment and primary immune responsiveness in older adults are not fully understood. The potential influence of persistent viral infections, known to continuously stimulate and consume immune resources, remains controversial due to conflicting evidence.",

            "text": "Whether common chronic and latent viral infections impact immune responsiveness, e.g against emerging viruses or vaccines, is an important issue in this context. Persistent viruses, such as those of the herpesvirus family, are highly prevalent in the human population and, although classically benign in immunocompetent individuals, exert a long-term stress on host's immune cells. From a biological point of view, the herpesvirus family represents the most classic model of viruses that establish a latent infection, a strategy that allows them to remain in the host for the duration of its life. After primary acute infection, herpesviruses induce a persistent infection characterized by successive cycles of reactivation and authentic virological latency, established only in particular cell types and anatomical sites, different for each herpesvirus. Latent infection constitutes a reduced immunogenic stimulus for the infected host, while the reactivation phase is characterized by the initiation of the lytic viral cycle, the rapid destruction of target cells and the induction of inflammatory and virusspecific immune responses. The prevalence of these infections increases proportionally with age, and their role in age-related immune decline remains a matter of debate. One persistent virus has been mainly studied in this context: cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is a b-herpesvirus, whose prevalence is high in the human population and increases with age. Despite a strong immune response, CMV is not eliminated and remains as a latent infection. This virus is known to leave a major imprint on our immune system, in particular reflected by the accumulation of CD27 \u00c0 CD28 \u00c0 CCR7 \u00c0 CD45RA + CD57 + T cells, identified as late differentiated effector memory (EM) T cells which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. 23 CMV infection has also been associated with changes of naive T-cell frequencies, though not in all studies, 24 and with consistently increased levels of systemic inflammatory cytokines. 23 Its impact on vaccine responsiveness has been controversial. It has been mostly studied in the context of vaccination against influenza, 25\u00c028 with some studies reporting suboptimal influenza vaccine responses in CMV-infected patients, and other studies showing no effect or even an enhancement of vaccine humoral and cellular immune responses or heterologous immunity by CMV. 29\u00c031 Lack of consensus may be related to the variability of the parameters investigated in different studies, including: CD8 + versus CD4 + T cells, T-cell frequencies versus absolute counts, young versus old subjects, primary versus recall vaccine responses. Therefore the influence on adaptive immunity by latent infection with CMV and other persistent viruses remains an open question with several unresolved issues.",

Persistent infections with these viruses may induce sustained inflammatory responses in their host. To verify this hypothesis, we measured by digital ELISA circulating cytokines (IFN-a, IL-6, TNF and IL-10) commonly associated with inflammatory manifestations. We observed an age-dependent increase in all four inflammatory markers, also associated with increasing numbers of herpesvirus infections ( Figure 1 and Table S2 ). However, the cumulative effect of latent infections on inflammatory cytokines could only be found in the long term, i.e. in older adults (above 75 years old), while younger subjects stratified by number of infections displayed similar cytokine levels ( Figure S1a ). This rise in inflammatory cytokine levels in older people was strongly associated with CMV infection, except for IL-6 levels, which presented a modest increase in CMV-negative older donors ( Figure S1b ). Of note, apart from IL-6, the increase in inflammatory cytokines with ageing was barely noticeable in the absence of infections ( Figure S1b ). These data indicate that herpesvirus infections, especially CMV, exacerbate the inflammatory profile of adults only in the long term, i.e. in older people. These common herpesviruses, in particular CMV, are known to induce strong T-cell responses through the activation of naive T cells and differentiation into effector memory (EM) T cells. Total CD4 + and CD8 + Tcell counts were unaffected by age while only the number of CD8 + T cells was increased by the presence of multiple infections ( Figure S2 ). In line with the inflammatory cytokine profile, an increase in both CD4 + and CD8 + EM T cells (defined as CD3 + CD27 \u00c0 CD45RA +/-CCR7 \u00c0 ) was observed overtime with herpesvirus infections (Figure 2a , Table S2 and Figs. S3 and S4a). This rise, which was mainly driven by CD45RA + EM among CD8 + T cells and CD45RA \u00c0 EM among CD4 + T cells ( Figure S5 ), could be attributed again almost-exclusively to CMV, especially in the CD8 compartment, as it was not observed in CMV uninfected donors ( Figure S6a ). Of note, this infection-driven accumulation of EM T cells was statistically significant in both old and young age ( Figure S6b ). Increased expression of CD57, a marker of late T cell differentiation, on CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was also associated with CMV seropositivity, but not age ( Figure S6c ). These data add to and confirm the multiple lines of evidence that CMV is the main cause of a disturbed EM T-cell compartment and inflation of this subset, which is observable at both younger and older ages.",

Naive T cells were defined here as CD3 + CD27 + CD45RA + CCR7 + CD95 \u00c0 , thus excluding so-called CD95 + \"stem cell memory T cells\". Interestingly, the evolution of the naive T-cell pool did not mirror that of the EM T-cell pool, and there was a clear difference between the evolution of CD8 + and CD4 + naive T-cell counts with ageing and herpesvirus infections. The loss of the naive CD8 + T-cell compartment was profound in older subjects (reaching numbers below 10 cells/mm 3 of blood in oldest individuals), irrespective of infection number or CMV serostatus (Figure 2b , Table S2 and Figs. S4b and S7a). In contrast, the reduction in naive CD4 + T-cell counts with ageing was more moderate and associated with herpesvirus infections (Figures 2c and S4b and S7b). While CMV had the strongest association with reduced naive CD4 + T cells, CMV-negative donors presented nonetheless a modest but statistically significant reduction (R = -0.48, p = 0.049, Spearman's rank correlation) of these cells if infected with two other herpesviruses ( Figure S7b ). Altogether, these data highlight a differential influence of ageing and persistent viral infections on the naive CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell compartments, and raise two questions: the first one related to the basis of these differences, and the second one related to the eventual impact of common herpesvirus infections on the capacity of older people to mount T-cell responses against previously unencountered antigens.",

This is in line with the preservation of the CD4 + naive T-cell pool in healthy individuals of 20\u00c069 years of age comparatively to naive CD8 + T cells. 24 This is also consistent with a higher thymic output of CD4 + T cells in the adult age-range 45 and in elderly individuals, 46 although in these previous studies the impact of infections was not considered. Here, production of new naive T cells or thymic output, as measured by T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) levels in total PBMCs, was strongly associated with ageing and was profoundly reduced in older individuals, independently of the number of herpesvirus infections (Figure 3b and Table S2 ). This pattern was similar to the decline of naive CD8 + Tcell counts (Figure 2b ), which suggests a strong dependency of naive CD8 + T-cell maintenance on thymic production. The naive CD8 + T-cell compartment seems to contract as the thymus involutes and thymopoiesis wanes with ageing. The lack of influence of CMV or EBV seropositivity on the thymic production of new T cells per se was documented in a large-scale population study of healthy adults. 39 As the maintenance of naive CD4 + T cells showed a different dynamic to that of naive CD8 + T cells, we hypothesized that they are less dependent on thymic output, but more linked to homeostatic proliferation. To examine this possibility, we measured TREC levels directly in naive T cells, using sensitive digital PCR assays on FACS-sorted cells. We observed reduced TREC levels in naive T cells from old donors. This reveals a dilution of TRECs in the naive cells through cell division, likely reflecting higher homeostatic proliferation in older compared to younger subjects ( Figure 3c and Table S3 ). Interestingly, the reduction in TREC levels was more pronounced in the CD4 + than the CD8 + pool. Moreover, higher levels of the proliferation marker Ki67 were found in naive CD4 + T cells compared to naive CD8 + T cells, in particular from older individuals (Figure 3d and Table S3 ). Together, these data indicate that the pool of naive CD8 + T cells contracts with ageing due to reduced thymic production, while the pool of naive CD4 + T cells is maintained to some extent through robust homeostatic proliferation. The naive CD4 + T-cell pool is nonetheless affected by infections with persistent viruses, in particular CMV, but also other herpesviruses.",

To answer this question, we performed high throughput sequencing of TCRa and TCRb regions using target specific RNASeq, on FACS-sorted naive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from younger (n = 4) and older donors (n = 4), and calculated observed diversity and inverse Simpson index (Figure 4a ). This analysis did not reveal any evident difference in naive CD4 + T-cell TCR repertoire diversity between young and old subjects, although this observation should be mitigated due to the limited number of donors studied. In contrast, there is an obvious loss in TCR repertoire diversity within the naive CD8 + T-cell compartment of older individuals, in line with its profound contraction with advanced age, unlike the naive CD4 + T cell pool. TCR repertoire alterations of the naive CD8 + T cells did not present a direct association with the number of infections (Figure 4b) , in line with a virus infection independent contraction of this compartment with ageing. However, the small number of subjects studied limits our conclusions on a potential effect of herpesvirus infections on naive T-cell TCR repertoire. Overall, these data inform on the basis of the differential evolutions between naive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells with increasing age. ",

Healthy elderly individuals (n = 137, named \"cohort 2\", Table 1 ) were recruited in a clinical trial to receive for the first time a vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) using the recommended prime-boost regimen with three injections (at week 0, 4 and 24). The individuals selected for this study had no serum anti-TBE virus (TBEv) antibodies prior to vaccination, indicating that they had never been exposed to nor vaccinated against TBEv. In line with the cohort 1 studied above, CMV-seropositive subjects presented lower CD4 + (but not CD8 + ) naive T-cell counts than CMV-seropositive subjects, confirming the association between CMV infection and lower naive CD4 + T-cell counts with old age ( Figure S8b ). De novo cellular immune responses to TBE vaccination were monitored at week 26 post-first immunization (2 weeks after the last boost), and compared to baseline values, using IFNg ELISpot with pools of overlapping peptides against all structural proteins of TBEv. Total TBEv-specific T-cell responses were statistically significantly lower in CMV + compared to CMV \u00c0 elderly individuals (Figure 5a and Table S4 ). The frequency of TBEv-specific T cells induced upon vaccination correlated with the counts in naive CD4 + T cells prior to vaccination (Figure 5b ), but not naive CD8 + T cells (data not shown). This indicates a reliance of the capacity to mount de novo vaccine T-cell responses on the pool of naive CD4 + T cells, and suggests that CMV infection may therefore impact this capacity due to its effect on the naive CD4 + T-cell pool.",

CMV seropositivity had no impact on TBEv-specific CD8 + T-cell levels, in line with the in vitro CD8 + T-cell priming data. However, it was associated with lower TBEv-specific CD4 + Tcell responses (Figure 5c and Table S4 ), consistent with the impact of CMV on the naive CD4 + , but not CD8 + , Tcell compartment in older donors. For comparison, we assessed the influence of CMV on memory T-cell reactivity. In contrast to TBEv-specific de novo responses, VZV-specific memory CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell levels were equivalent regardless of the CMV serostatus ( Figure 5d and Table S4 ). Of note, we observed a higher number of IFNg producing CD8 + and CD4 + T cells upon stimulation with Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) in CMV + donors ( Figure 5e and Table S4 ), reflecting higher levels of effector memory (thus IFNg producing) cells in CMV + donors, that can be activated with this superantigen. These results support a reduced CD4 + T-cell responsiveness to neoantigens in CMVinfected older adults.",

Infection with persistent viruses, which represent a substantial and long-lasting burden for our immune system, have been suspected to play a role in this decline. Through chronic activation and mobilization of immune resources, herpesviruses, in particular CMV, result in continuous naive T-cell activation and inflation of EM T cells 23 . However, we observed here that the associations of naive and EM T-cell numbers with ageing and chronic infections did not mirror each other and that the contraction or maintenance of the naive T-cell pool depends on multiple factors. In a context of limited or even absent T-cell renewal capacity, the naive T-cell compartment can be particularly affected, as shown by studies in young adults thymectomized during early childhood. In this model of T-cell ageing independent of chronological age, the combination of reduced thymic output (i.e. due to thymectomy) and chronic immune activation (i.e. due to infection with a persistent virus like CMV) resulted in the alteration of naive T-cell frequencies and homeostasis. 47, 48 With ageing, thymic involution and long-term immunity against persistent viruses may combine to exhaust immune resources.",

In contrast, the naive CD4 + T-cell pool is maintained more by homeostatic proliferation, allowing for the long-term effects of persistent viral infections to be observed. Previous studies suggest that CD8 + and CD4 + naive T-cell repertoires are altered in old people. 50, 51 The different rates of decline between CD8 + and CD4 + naive T-cell compartments likely translates into a major loss of TCR repertoire diversity for the CD8 + naive T cells, in contrast to CD4 + naive T cells, with advanced age. Overall, the strong contraction of the naive CD8 + Tcell repertoire likely results in an important reduction of naive CD8 + T-cell responsiveness to new antigens in elderly human populations, explaining our previous findings. 21, 52 On the same line, diminished yellow fever vaccine-specific CD8 + T-cell responses were found to be correlated with baseline naive T-cell frequencies. 15 Older individuals may thus become more vulnerable to diseases for which the induction of CD8 + T-cell immunity plays a protective role, such as against emerging viruses and tumors.",

Considering that the frequency of naive cell precursors specific for a given antigen are typically very low, ranging approximately between one cell in 10 5 to 10 6 T lymphocytes in adults, 53,54 this quantitative reduction in naive cells, including potentially unique antigen-reactive ones, may affect the mounting of neoantigen-specific immune responses. Indeed, we found that CMV seropositivity was associated with a reduction in CD4 + T-cell responsiveness to neoantigens (i.e. TBEv antigens), but not to recall antigens (VZV antigens), in older people. With advanced age, de novo CD4 + T-cell responses appear to be affected by a persistent virus like CMV, in line with the impact on naive CD4 + T-cell counts.",

For example, the naive CD8 + T-cell decline and IL-6 level increase are inversely related (p < 0.0001, not shown), mostly dependent on ageing but not latent infections. Ageing-related increased levels of IL-6, which is known to contribute to thymic atrophy, 55,56 may thus play an important role in the contraction of the naive CD8 + T cells by inhibiting their production in the thymus. On the other hand, the inflation of EM CD8 + T cells and increased levels of inflammation associated cytokines such as TNF, IFNa and IL-10 in older individuals followed a similar pattern, and both were clearly associated with CMV infection. Strikingly, in healthy older subjects, the increase in systemic inflammatory cytokines was strongly associated with CMV serostatus. CMV by itself has therefore a central part in the increased inflammatory status characteristic of the elderly subjects. However, the fact that all recruited donors were healthy volunteers of French or Swiss nationality might render these findings not completely generalizable. We cannot ascertain whether the phenomena described in this manuscript are similar in subjects with major comorbidities or co-infections.",

            "text": "Previous studies have found conflicting evidence concerning the influence of latent CMV-infection on influenza vaccine immunogenicity in different populations. Some showed decreased vaccine immunogenicity in CMV-seropositive elderly, 25,27 while others did not show any substantial influence. 29, 57 A beneficial effect of CMV infection on influenza vaccine immunogenicity was even reported in younger individuals. 30 By using influenza vaccine immunogenicity as a readout these studies mainly analyzed the influence of latent CMV on recall or memory responses. Using TBE vaccine in TBEv-naive elderly we were able to assess the influence of latent CMV infection on a true neoantigen, and we found a delay and reduction in TBE-vaccine induced humoral immunity in CMV-infected older subjects. As previously proposed, 58 CMV-related increased inflammation, possibly mediated by the action of TNF on Bcells, might be a mechanism through which CMV impacts the humoral response and antibody production upon vaccination. Moreover, CMV infection might indirectly affect germinal center and antibody formation through defective generation of follicular T helper (Tfh) cells due to lower naive T-cell numbers in CMV-seropositive subjects. Although it would have been interesting to evaluate antigen specific Tfh CD4 + T cells directly, our study was limited to TBEv-specific IFNg producing, i.e. Th1, CD4 + T cells. Previous studies suggest nonetheless that Tfh cells are even more dampened than Th1 cells in older individuals, affecting the related humoral response. 59\u00c061 In elderly adults, the reduced quality of Tfh cells and ability to provide help to B cells were reported to be partly responsible for declined influenza specific antibody titers upon vaccination. 62\u00c066 From these studies, we may infer that the induction of TBEvspecific Tfh cells should be lower upon vaccination in older people, in particular if they are CMV seropositive, resulting in impaired humoral immune responses. It will be important to decipher the exact role of CMV in the impaired humoral responsiveness with ageing.",

Related to the contraction of the naive T-cell compartment, older CMV positive individuals may indeed present blunted adaptive immune responses to new antigens, such as those of SARS-CoV-2, possibly affecting their capacity to control viral replication. This is in line with a recent report of a favorable impact of thymic rebound during COVID lymphopenia. 67 The observation that CMV infection plays an important role in the establishment of a systemic inflammatory status in elderly subjects might even add to its hypothetical role in COVID-19 severity. 68, 69 Future studies will be necessary to establish if serology to herpesviruses, in particular CMV, may inform on the capacity to mount a good immune response against SARS-CoV-2, and if it may help to identify patients more at risk to develop severe disease. Our results are also relevant in the context of vaccination campaigns focused on elderly populations. Vaccine immunogenicity may be blunted in CMV infected individuals, resulting in a lower induction of vaccine-specific antibodies. Of note though, CMV serology was not found to be associated with lower vaccine immunogenicity in a study of elderly people vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2. 7 Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical efficacy appears overall as effective in young and older people. These apparently discordant findings highlight the complexity of the issue and the need for specific studies to test the exact impact of CMV on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines immunogenicity and efficacy. An active role of CMV infection in depleting host immune resources, that may affect immune response efficacy, would support strategies to limit CMV infection in the general population. ",
