The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score (16.15 \u00b1 4.41 vs. 14.88 \u00b1 4.57, p 0.042) decreased significantly on the seventh day after systemic corticosteroid treatment. Interestingly, the serum IL-18 decreased significantly (304.52 \u00b1 286.00 vs. 85.85 \u00b1 97.22, p < 0.0001), whereas the improvement of PaO 2 / FiO 2 (24.78 \u00b1 35.03 vs. 97.17 \u00b1 44.82, p < 0.001) was inconspicuous after systemic corticosteroid treatment for non-survival patients, compared with survival patients. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model revealed, when equivalent methylprednisolone usage was 146.5 mg/d, it had the best sensitivity and specificity to predict the death of ARDS. Survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier curves presented the higher 45-day mortality in high-dose corticosteroid treatment group (logrank test p < 0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that serum IL-18 level, APACHE II score, D-dimer, and high-dose corticosteroid treatment were associated with the death of ARDS.",

Previous studies have characterized ARDS as a process of ongoing inflammation, parenchymal-cell proliferation, and disordered collagen deposition (Ware and Matthay, 2000; Ranieri et al., 2012; Matthay et al., 2019) . Nevertheless, ARDS remains difficult to define, it is relatively underreported by clinicians, and its therapeutic options remain controversial (Ferguson et al., 2005; Hernu et al., 2013; Neto et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2018) . Previous studies have reported that the hospital mortality of ARDS ranged from 34.9 to 46.1% (Rubenfeld et al., 2005; Villar et al., 2011; Bellani et al., 2016) . However, declining mortality was observed over the past decades due to many efforts in the management of ARDS, such as advances in the application of mechanical ventilation and the use of adjunctive interventions in routine clinical practice (Zhang et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "ARDS is a complicated response to pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses involving neutrophil activation, alveolar epithelial, and vascular endothelial injury, leading to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and atelectasis (Choi et al., 2014) . Systemic corticosteroids have been considered as a potential therapy for ARDS due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The improvement in oxygenation and reduction of the duration of mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients followed by corticosteroids administration have been reported in previous randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), but there was no conclusive evidence of lower mortality in these patients (Meduri et al., 1998; Steinberg et al., 2006; Meduri et al., 2007) . Published meta-analyses on the use of corticosteroid treatment for ARDS also demonstrated inconsistent conclusions (Tang et al., 2009; Ruan et al., 2014; Meduri et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017) . In addition, the role of corticosteroids in ARDS induced by COVID-19 is controversial Liu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Horby et al., 2021; Tomazini et al., 2020) . Recently, a published RCT has revealed that early administration of dexamethasone could reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and overall mortality of moderate-tosevere ARDS patients (Villar et al., 2020) . However, the dose, duration, and timing of corticosteroid administration for ARDS patients remain controversial, which has prompted us to do further research. IL-18 was crucial for ARDS pathogenesis in previous studies (Dolinay et al., 2012; Makabe et al., 2012; Rogers et al., 2019) . We aimed to determine the effects of varying doses of corticosteroids on IL-18 and explore the correlation between the different doses of corticosteroid administration and the prognosis of ARDS patients. This relationship is expected to have a certain guiding effect on clinical practice regarding determining the corticosteroid doses when treating patients with ARDS.",

All tests of significance were two-tailed and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the accuracy of corticosteroid application predicted mortality. When the area under curve (AUC) is more than 0.7, it indicates that corticosteroid application has better prediction accuracy for mortality. The sensitivity and specificity of various doses of corticosteroid application to predict mortality were analyzed to define the cut-off value of dosage of corticosteroid used. Independent factors affecting patient survival were determined using univariable analysis and multivariate Cox regression models. The adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of the variables incorporated into the model and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated when HR > 1 indicated a higher probability of death.

            "text": "Inflammation was known to exert an important role in the development of ARDS and had an impact on the prognosis of ARDS. Cox regression analysis in our study presented that serum IL-18 level at baseline was an independent risk factor for the mortality of ARDS patients. It was consistent with previous studies where IL-18 was crucial in the pathogenesis and prognosis of patients with ARDS (Dolinay et al., 2012; Makabe et al., 2012; Rogers et al., 2019) . Intriguingly, we found that systemic corticosteroid treatment significantly decreased the level of serum IL-18. This finding may provide evidence for corticosteroid usage for ARDS patients. However, further research demonstrated that the decrease of serum IL-18 was more obvious in the non-survival group than in the survival group. Similarly, the decrease of IL-18 was more pronounced when treated with high-dose corticosteroid. The larger the dose of corticosteroid, the more obvious the inhibition of inflammatory response. When highdose systemic corticosteroid administration produced an excessive suppression of the inflammatory response, a worse prognosis is predicted, leading to the dramatic reduction of the IL-18 level. Moreover, we found that systemic corticosteroid treatment improved oxygenation for ARDS patients. However, subgroup analysis showed that systemic corticosteroid treatment did not significantly improve the oxygenation of ARDS patients in the non-survival group. The improvements in oxygenation were more pronounced in the low-dose corticosteroid treatment group than that in the high-dose corticosteroid treatment group. These indicate that the improvement of oxygenation can predict the prognosis of ARDS patients and guide the dosage of corticosteroid usage. Excessive release of cytokines and chemokines caused by neutrophil infiltration mediates the pathogenesis of ARDS, which may be associated with cytotoxicity, vascular stasis, and breaking the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions. Studies have described the dual role of neutrophils in ARDS (Grudzinska and Sapey, 2018; Bl\u00e1zquez-Prieto et al., 2018) . Moreover, when a large number of neutrophils were mobilized and activated and neutrophil-associated elastases were greatly released in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), it was significantly associated with the severity and prognosis of ARDS (Summers et al., 2014; Bai et al., 2015) . The timing of targeting neutrophils is suggested to be critical for improving the outcomes of ARDS. Moreover, several studies have reported the correlation between the N/L and the severity of the clinical course for ICU patients, suggesting that N/L should be considered a prognostic biomarker for ICU patients (Rich\u00e9 et al., 2015; Hwang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018) . Song and colleagues have reported that N/L > 14 was associated with shorter overall survival of ARDS patients and it was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (Wang et al., 2018) . It prompted us to explore the treatment effect of corticosteroids on N/L of ARDS. Interestingly, our results have demonstrated that corticosteroid treatment significantly increased N/L in peripheral blood of ARDS patients. Further analysis has revealed that N/L increased significantly in the non-survival and the high-dose corticosteroid treatment groups, which was associated with the severity and poorer outcomes of patients. It may be a potential predictive prognostic biomarker for corticosteroid therapy in ARDS patients.",

They were responsible for the higher dose of corticosteroids used and more patients receiving mechanical ventilation; the longer length of mechanical ventilation duration was observed in the non-survival group. In addition, higher doses of corticosteroids were probably allocated to severe ARDS patients, and it was difficult to overcome this bias during the clinical practice completely. There is no strict guideline on the dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for ARDS patients worldwide. Similarly, corticosteroid treatment for COVID-19-induced ARDS remains controversial and without guidelines. Chen et al. have reported that administration of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19-related ARDS increased 28-day mortality and delayed SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance (Liu et al., 2020) . However, RECOVERY research and Song et al. have reported that corticosteroid use for ARDS patients with COVID-19 resulted in lower mortality (Wu et al., 2020; Horby et al., 2021) . Currently, the main controversies are concerning the timing, dosage, and duration of corticosteroid treatment for ARDS. Moreover, two RCTs on corticosteroid therapy for ARDS on the seventh day have reported opposite conclusions (Meduri et al., 1998; Steinberg et al., 2006; ) . More studies were concerned with the early corticosteroid administration for ARDS patients (Meduri et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2020; Villar et al., 2020) . Recently, one RCT study has revealed that early corticosteroid treatment reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation and overall mortality for moderate-to-severe ARDS patients (Villar et al., 2020) . However, some studies have reported the opposite conclusion. They revealed that early initiation (\u22643 days from hospitalization or ICU admission) of corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19-induced ARDS was associated with higher 28-day mortality Liu et al., 2020) . So far, there have been no RCTs on the dosage of corticosteroid therapy for ARDS. Takaki et al. have reported that initial high-dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg/d) with a tapering regimen had a negative effect on ARDS patients in a retrospective propensitymatched cohort study (Takaki et al., 2017) . Our results have Corticosteroid treatment improved PaO 2 /FiO 2 (C). Changes of PaO 2 /FiO 2 after corticosteroid treatment (D). Corticosteroid treatment increased the neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio (E). APACHE II score at day 1, day 3, and day 7 (F). revealed that when the methylprednisolone equivalent dose was more than 146.5 mg/d, it was an independent risk factor of death and had the higher mortality of ARDS patients, which was consistent with the results of Chen et al.'s study. Their subgroup analysis demonstrated that high-dose (>200 mg equivalent hydrocortisone per day) corticosteroid therapy was associated with higher 28-day mortality rate of ARDS patients induced by COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020) . Of course, this phenomenon could be attributed to the fact that the used corticosteroid dosage was related to the severity of the disease; the more serious the disease is, the greater the dosage is. The common adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy seem to be hyperglycemia and superinfection. However, the occurrence of corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia was similar in the nonsurvival and survival groups. More superinfection was observed in the non-survival group, which reminded clinicians to be cautious about using large doses of corticosteroid therapy for severe ARDS patients.",

In this study, corticosteroid treatment was evaluated in ARDS patients with severe pulmonary infection and intense inflammation. Therefore, we caution against extrapolating our findings to all types of ARDS patients. Secondly, there were few patients with ARDS who did not receive corticosteroid treatment during the study; thus, matching with the patients who received corticosteroid therapy was challenging. Therefore, a control group of no steroid treatment group was absent. Thirdly, there is no strict guideline on the dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for ARDS patients. Therapeutic strategies may differ among patients, whose treatment policies were decided according to their individual situations. Lastly, higher doses of corticosteroids were probably allocated to more severe patients, which led to some selection bias, although Cox regression analyses were performed to adjust for confounding factors. It was difficult to completely overcome during the clinical practice.",

The appropriate dose of corticosteroids improved the oxygenation of patients and alleviated IL-18-associated inflammation and the severity of ARDS, whereas high-dose corticosteroid was associated with higher mortality, because the influence of selection bias on the disease severity cannot be ruled out. Sufficiently powered RCT studies with rigorous control group to evaluate the effects of different doses of corticosteroid on ARDS are urgently warranted in the near future.",
