Yet every year, around 2.5 million children die from diseases that can be prevented by currently available or new vaccines. Vaccines have the potential to erase some of the most glaring global health inequities which currently shape the lives of millions. Often the most vulnerable -women, children, and adolescents in even the poorest countries, could be protected against life-threatening and debilitating disease within a generation. This chapter presents a historical perspective on the emergence of vaccines as a means of disease control and prevention over the past two centuries. Beginning with discov- Inequity in access to vaccines between rich and poor countries and the underpinning factors are discussed, including lack of safety and quality assurance systems in poor countries, focus of research and development on rich nations' priorities, and the diversion of scarce resources to other emerging global health priorities. Various innovative options for financing wider access to new and underused vaccines in poor countries are explored, including the role of the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm), the Advanced Market Commitment (AMCs), the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCI) and Multilateral Debt Relief (MDRI) initiatives, and the Debt Buy-Down program of the World Bank.

Jenner later found that the boy was ''secure'' to smallpox virus (Andre 2003) . Louis Pasteur later coined the term vaccine in reference to the Latin word for cow: vacca. Records of a similar medical approach can be found in Chinese literature dating back to the eleventh century and linked with the fight against the smallpox virus (Plotkin 2005) . According to the National Library of Medicine (U.S. National Library of Medicine 2002), the practice of variolation, where small scabs of tissue containing smallpox were inhaled causing the individual to contract the disease in a mild form, reduced the mortality rate among those exposed to the disease to 1-2% as opposed to 30% when individuals contracted the disease naturally. By 1700, the practice of variolation as a response to smallpox had expanded to India, Africa, and throughout the Ottoman Empire. Variolation was first practiced in Europe by 1717 and, by 1721, in the American colonies (U.S. National Library of Medicine 2002).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 230, "end": 242, "text": "Andre (2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 245, "end": 259, "text": "Plotkin (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 366, "end": 378, "text": "(Andre 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 634, "end": 648, "text": "(Plotkin 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 95, "end": 104, "text": "(Table 23", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The immunization field grew in the 19th and 20th centuries, with major breakthroughs in the mid-to late 20th century through discovery of vaccines that protect against such diseases as influenza, polio, and yellow fever (Table 23.1) .

The period of 1974-2000 can be considered a second phase in the history of immunization. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in 1974, expanding the smallpox eradication effort which was focused on one single vaccine into an infant program of six vaccines (against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, and tuberculosis). At the time, less than 5% of the world's children were immunized against these six diseases.

This is based on the intent by the GAVI alliance partners to ensure that GAVI financial support is seen by all stakeholders as time limited and to ensure that countries move to a fuller ownership of their immunization program, including the introduction of new vaccines. Co-financing therefore aims at supporting and stimulating evidence-based priority-setting within the immunization program and within the health sector more generally. Financial commitments, however small, also generally require a higher level of government engagement. Through this approach, which will be evaluated in 2010, GAVI Alliance partners are working to help countries to be on a trajectory of eventual independence from GAVI support, acknowledging, however, that, for most of the GAVI-eligible countries this is likely to require a very long time Over the next decade, the ability of developing countries to achieve sustainable introduction of new technologies will be largely dependent on how donor funds are provided, particularly whether there is a shift toward long-term, predictable aid and if innovative financing instruments are appropriately aligned and taken to scale. The other key determinant will be sustained political support for health and for vaccines by developing country governments. Guyana is an example of a country that has been highly successful in achieving high immunization coverage and is the first GAVI-supported country to fully finance the purchase of pentavalent vaccine from its national budget (United Nations 2007). Guyana's continuing success is in part due to a very strong political commitment at the highest levels to finance the national immunization program, including efforts to protect it from economic shocks and shifts in donor priorities. More broadly, there has been a remarkable growth in the health budget from US $6.5 per capita in 1991 to US $61 in 2006 (excluding overseas development assistance). This accounts for 10% of national expenditure, while the government's goal is to reach 15% (Ministry of Health, Guyana 2002; Editorial, PharmacoEconomics and Outcomes News, 2007) .

This success is, however, highlighting another problem which the health sector is facing, that of the handling of contaminated medical waste. In the case of immunization, this is mainly related to the disposal of used syringes and needles (these syringes represent between 5 and 10% of all injections given in the health sector but nevertheless the push to introduce AD syringes is increasing the pressure on immunization programs to tackle this challenge). Sharps are rarely disposed of at the point of use. Since sharps are transported to the point of destruction, the risk of infection from accidental exposure to sharps must be minimized. Four different technologies are being explored for this purpose: corrosive disinfectants, thermoprocessing, needle destruction, and plastic melting (Lloyd 2000) . However, none of these options is currently sufficiently developed to be put into use in the field. (ii) Monodose pre-filled devices: Vaccine wastage constitutes a considerable cost to immunization programs. Monodose presentations eliminate wastage and the risk of contamination. When the monodose is pre-filled into an injection device, it increases quality and safety at the point of use. UniJect1 is one such device that has been tested with HepB and tetanus toxoid (TT) (Lloyd 2000) . Village health workers can administer it. Currently, major obstacles reside in the cost of the device and the need for additional cold storage space when multidose presentation is exchanged for monodose, but ultimately, the objective would be to provide an increasing number of immunizations with monodose preparations that would not require increased cold chain capacity. (iii) Needle-free injections: Needle-free injectors deliver vaccine at high velocity into the skin without penetration of a needle, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of blood-borne pathogens (WHO 2007c) . Technologies are being developed for both mono-and multidose presentations. Multidose injectors available have not been found safe and new models are under development. There are several monodose models available; however, they are not feasible for large-scale programs because of regulatory obstacles and high cost (WHO 2000) . (iv) Thermostable vaccine: Vaccine distribution and storage without a cold chain would considerably simplify the delivery system, reduce cost, and allow for integrated supply mechanisms. Removal of vaccines from the cold chain should be the highest priority for technology research. Sugar glass drying is one such technology that has shown great promise (Lloyd 2000) . It can be used to produce multivalent vaccines that are completely heat stable, except under extreme climatic conditions. The high cost of regulation/licensing and the uncertainty about market prospects in industrialized countries have so far impeded the development and use of this technology.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 338, "end": 350, "text": "(Lloyd 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1156, "text": "(Lloyd 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1645, "text": "(Lloyd 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2231, "text": "(WHO 2007c)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2560, "text": "(WHO 2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2917, "end": 2929, "text": "(Lloyd 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "New Immunization Technologies"}, {"text": "Vaccines are delicate products that are easily destroyed if handled incorrectly.

All of these areas would benefit significantly from research efforts to find alternative and innovative approaches. For instance, the heavy reliance on the cold chain remains a major economic and logistical burden on programs. The possibility of taking greater advantage of the real thermostability of vaccines and the increasing use of the Vaccine Vial Monitor by taking vaccines ''out of the cold chain'' is a field which has only begun but could potentially revolutionize immunization delivery (Table 23. 4) . Vaccine Vial Monitors are heat-sensitive circular labels, no wider than a centimeter, that change color as vaccines are exposed to heat. They are time-temperature indicators used to (i) ensure that the vaccines have not been damaged by excessive exposure to heat, (ii) identify weaknesses in the cold chain, and (iii) take vaccines beyond the cold chain to reach out to children who have no access to fixed health facilities. Health workers can use the Vaccine Vial Monitor color to tell if the vaccine has been overexposed to heat and whether or not it is safe for immunization.
