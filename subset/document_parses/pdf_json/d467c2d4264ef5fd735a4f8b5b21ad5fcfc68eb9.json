            "text": "Background. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) has been reported to significantly correlate with poor survival and postoperative complications in patients with various diseases, but its relationship with mortality in COVID-19 patients has not been addressed. Method. A multicenter retrospective study involving patients with severe COVID-19 was conducted to investigate whether malnutrition and other clinical characteristics could be used to stratify the patients based on risk. Results. A total of 395 patients were included in our study, with 236 patients in the training cohort, 59 patients in the internal validation cohort, and 100 patients in the external validation cohort. During hospitalization, 63/236 (26.69%) and 14/59 (23.73%) patients died in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. PNI had the strongest relationships with the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level but was less strongly correlated with the CURB65, APACHE II, and SOFA scores. The baseline PNI score, platelet (PLT) count, LDH level, and PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) ratio were independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. A nomogram incorporating these four predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in the derivation and validation cohorts. A PNI score less than 33.405 was associated with a higher risk of mortality in severe COVID-19 patients in the Cox regression analysis. Conclusion. These findings have implications for predicting the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients at the time of admission and provide the first direct evidence that a lower PNI is related to a worse prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients.",

Previously, the PNI was reported to correlate significantly with poor survival and postoperative complications in patients with various malignant digestive system tumors [10, 11] . A previous study indicated that a lower PNI in patients with a decreased left atrial ejection fraction tended to be associated with a higher risk of mortality in a retrospective study [12] . Once they have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), patients, particularly elderly patients, often develop cardiovascular dysfunction due to the widespread expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the heart and blood vessels [13] . Therefore, the prognostic value of the PNI in patients with COVID-19 is worth further investigation. However, to date, the relevant studies have mainly focused on crude analyses rather than establishing a systematic, quantified model; hence, the application value of the present PNI is extremely limited [14, 15] .",

The nomogram based on these risk factors showed good calibration and discrimination in the training and validation cohorts. With the rapid increase in newly confirmed and severe cases, the management of patients with severe cases has become a challenging issue during the COVID-19 outbreak.

This might be because we enrolled patients with COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic in Wuhan City, China. In addition, we found that nonsurviving patients were more likely to be older and Journal of Immunology Research have underlying hypertension than surviving patients, which is in agreement with recent reports, which have suggested that age and hypertension may be risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 [22, 23] . In our study, the patients with severe COVID-19 who died had lower baseline platelet counts, PNI scores, and P/F ratios and higher LDH levels, and these variables were independent risk factors for mortality. Previous studies showed that thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients was not a significant predictor of disease progression or adverse outcomes [24, 25] . Studies in consecutive patients with COVID-19 have reported that only approximately 5% of patients present with a platelet count less than 100 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L. Mild thrombocytopenia (a platelet count < 150 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L) is identified in 70-95% of patients with severe COVID-19 [20] . The P/F ratio, which directly reflects lung oxygenation, represents the severity of ARDS in COVID-19 patients. In our study, the P/F ratio in nonsurviving patients was twofold lower than that in surviving patients, which was similar to the findings in Arentz et al.'s study [21] . Furthermore, in our previous study, the area under the curve (AUC = 0:878) implied that a serum LDH level greater than 344.5 U/L was strongly predictive of severe COVID-19, with high specificity (96.9%) and sensitivity (68.8%), further confirming that the LDH level is a strong predictive factor that can be used for the early detection of lung injury and severe COVID-19 cases [26] .",
