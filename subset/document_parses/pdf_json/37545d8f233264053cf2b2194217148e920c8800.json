Since Taiwan has the highest incidence and prevalence of treated end-stage kidney disease worldwide, it is crucial to act in advance to prevent a potential disaster. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implement proactive infection control measures to prevent it from spreading without sacrificing the dialysis care quality. In this article, we focused on hemodialysis vascular access (HVA) care in particular. As a life-line of hemodialysis (HD) patients, HVA care has a profound impact on the patient's quality of dialysis and life. Specifically, in our facility, the working and office areas of the HD units are separated to reduce cross-infection. All elective procedures for HVA are postponed, and operating rooms equipped with a negative-pressure anteroom are used for the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Herein, we share how we modified our HVA care policy not only to prevent our patients from COVID-19 infection but also to maintain the quality of HVA care.",

Every open entrance was installed a thermal camera scanner with the automatic alarm function (Table 1) . After temperature checks, the people flow separates into an express lane for hospital staffs with ID and an access control lane for visitors. For the access control lane, there is visitor number limit (i.e., one companion maximum for one outpatient; one visitor maximum for one inpatient), and documentation of the Travel/Occupation/ Contact/Clustering (TOCC) history at the register counter is mandatory for every visitor. 8 Besides, another measure to limit the people flow is to restrict the inpatient visiting hours, which is limited to 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. unless the inpatient encounters a medical emergency.",

Although randomized controlled trial evidence is lacking, some data suggest that in terms of blocking droplet transmission, cloth masks may be only marginally (15%) less effective than surgical masks and fivefold more effective than not wearing masks. 14 Therefore, face mask-wearing by the general public (either cloth or surgical masks) could have a substantial impact on transmission with a relatively small impact on social and economic life.

At each HDU checkpoint, we installed a thermal camera scanner, which alarms if the body temperature is higher than normal. Besides, our staffs take shifts to stay at each HDU checkpoint to record the body temperature for each visitor using a forehead thermometer. Because the ear thermometer is time-consuming for the probe cover replacement, we use an infrared forehead thermometer instead, but the fever threshold is 0.5\u00baC lower (fever criteria: \u226537.5\u00baC for a forehead thermometer; \u226538.0\u00baC for an ear thermometer).

We would like to emphasize that the purpose of obligatory mask-wearing at all times is to reduce respiratory droplet transmission. 12, 13 Taiwan government boosts the production of surgical masks since January 2020 and disperses two surgical masks per HD session to every HD patient. 18 Meanwhile, because contact transmission can be effectively prevented by hand washing, 19 chlorhexidine (0.5%) dispensers are available at all checkpoints, all doors (both sides), all rooms, and all beds throughout the hospital for consistent hand hygiene. All hospital staff, patients, and visitors are encouraged to use chlorhexidine dispensers. In addition, chairs in the public area are marked to be seated separately for social distancing. With the measures conducted above, we continue the quarterly intradialytic access flow monitoring and the Doppler ultrasound of HVA to ensure that every HD patient is under the proper surveillance of HVA health. Table 2 , we postpone all elective angiography and surgery for HVA, as guidelines suggested. [20] [21] [22] For urgent angiography or surgery for HVA, the aforementioned general infection control measures have complied. However, when there is a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient who requires an immediate angiography or surgery for his/ her HVA complication, an operating room with a negativepressure anteroom is used. When the postoperative care and observation are needed, the patient is transferred to a negative-pressure recovery room after the surgery. Because the angiographic rooms in our hospital are not equipped with a negative-pressure anteroom, any suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient who needs an urgent angiography is managed in the operating room instead.",

In this article, we present the primary infection prevention measures for COVID-19 in an HVA care unit of the tertiary-care referral hospital, including obligatory mask-wearing at all times, body temperature measurement, visitor number limit, inpatient visiting hours restriction, and visitor's TOCC history registry. We would like to highlight two easy yet effective measures, obligatory mask-wearing and consistent hand hygiene, to reduce respiratory droplet and contact transmission risks. Although in most parts of the world where stocks of surgical masks are quite limited for now, evidence suggests that cloth masks may be only Review Article. (2020) 83:7 J Chin Med Assoc marginally less effective than surgical masks and fivefold more effective than not wearing masks in blocking droplet transmission. Therefore, the cloth mask for hospital visitors is likely to be a good alternative in areas having a shortage of surgical masks and is better than wearing no mask at all. In our facility, the working and office areas of the HD units are separated to reduce cross-infection. With the implementation of proactive infection control measures, we continue the quarterly intradialytic access flow monitoring and the Doppler ultrasound of HVA to ensure that every HD patient is under the proper surveillance of HVA health. All elective procedures for HVA are postponed, and operating rooms equipped with a negative-pressure anteroom are used for the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. By modifying our HVA care policy, we not only prevent our patients from getting infected with COVID-19 till now but also maintain HVA care quality. to remove the surgical masks during the HD procedure, and to keep their masks for transport to and from the HDU.",
