As our study concerns a single consortium, we do not make this claim. Instead, we present this as an exploratory study. Confirmability refers to researcher neutrality. This study was provided as part of a larger report to oK, thus making it available to a professional audience that was familiar with oK but not a direct data source. We triangulated on each category of participant by asking interview partners about not only their own experiences, but also about other members of the ecosystem. Dependeability is about ensuring the consistency of results. We created an audit trail by preserving three phases of the code system (see Fig. 1 ), namely open coding, thematic networks, and the final code system. The code system can be found in the Appendix.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1110, "end": 1116, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Limitations"}, {"text": "The findings of this research concerning economic conflicts in the software ecosystem are general. The main conflict that was identified is evolving around business model change to break vendor lock-in. This is not a new insight because this conflict was essentially willingly established by the user consortium oK in the first place. However, this source of conflict is not commonplace in vendor-led foundations [37] , suggesting that user-led foundations are somewhat different.

The primary economic conflict comes from the change of business model. The consortium was founded to change the balance of power in the ecosystem by offering an alternative platform and standardized interfaces. This has the potential to break vendor lock-in by allowing more competition. However, it also provides small software vendors the opportunity to specialize. Software vendors who are established do not like the idea of losing bargaining power.
