However, the required durations are not known absolutely, and certainly depend on the type of surface. 1-5 Some clothing types, for instance, are very capable of retaining moisture and consequently, this affects the survival of virus contained therein. The general consensus is that viruses can survive up to a few days in clothing. It is reasonable to expect a similar survival duration for viruses on/in protective face masks. That is, contaminated masks can be treated by merely setting them aside for some required duration until the viruses die. But to our best knowledge, there is no scientific study on the required duration, and any required duration would depend on the materials that form the mask. For instance, woven fibers differ from non-woven polymeric filter media. Mask users can apply sanitizing chemicals (such as alcohol) but it is not clear whether this type of sanitizing would adversely affect the porous structure of masks and thereby make them less effective over time. Similarly, there is no current advice available for the use of heat to destroy SARS-",

The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.\". 6 But despite official statements such as the above, there is, in fact, some literature on the temperature and exposure durations that are required to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. In the following, a list of temperature/duration/inactivation rates is provided for coronavirus pathogens. In the listing, we report log reductions in viral load obtained from the references. In some studies, the heating protocol was such that no viral presence was detected afterwards. We have substituted an equivalent log reduction of 7 for these cases. Of course, the actual log reduction would be based on the sensitivity of the measurement instruments; however, for practical purposes, we consider a viral reduction of 7 or greater to be at or near total sterilization.",

Extensive research has confirmed that at least for living cells, the sensitivity of thermal destruction is very strongly linked to temperature. That is, small increases in temperature cause large increases in the death rate. As an example, for mammalian cells and other pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and protozoa) the death rate rises rapidly as temperature increases. 7, 8 Another reason for using a safety factor is that the temperatures experienced by the virus during heating will not necessarily equal the temperature of the applied heat. Thermal inertia causes a heating lag that depends, in part, on the media being heated.",
