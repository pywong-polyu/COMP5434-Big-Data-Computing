These networks can contain a variety of information types and represent different aspects of a system. However, the process for selecting which information to include is not always straightforward. Using data on 2 agonistic behaviors in a captive population of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), we developed a framework for investigating how pooling or splitting behaviors at the scale of dyadic relationships (between 2 individuals) affects individual-and group-level social properties. We designed 2 reference models to test whether randomizing the number of interactions across behavior types results in similar structural patterns as the observed data. Although the behaviors were correlated, the first reference model suggests that the 2 behaviors convey different information about some social properties and should therefore not be pooled. However, once we controlled for data sparsity, we found that the observed measures corresponded with those from the second reference model. Hence, our initial result may have been due to the unequal frequencies of each behavior. Overall, our findings support pooling the 2 behaviors. Awareness of how selected measurements can be affected by data properties is warranted, but nonetheless our framework disentangles these efforts and as a result can be used for myriad types of behaviors and questions. This framework will help researchers make informed and data-driven decisions about which behaviors to pool or separate, prior to using the data in subsequent multilayer network analyses.",

When using multilayer network approaches, researchers must carefully consider how the network layers are assembled. Social network layers are built from associations or interactions among dyads (pairs of individuals). Determining what the layers should represent, and how to construct them, is a critical step in the formation of any single or multilayer network. In some cases, this determination is more obvious, especially when the 2 network layers are very different from one another (e.g., genetic relatedness and social associations, Evans et al. 2020) . In other cases, decisions about what behaviors to include, exclude, or treat as equivalent can be much less straightforward.",

Pooling observations of different behaviors into a single network layer can reduce data sparsity problems for some interaction types, resulting in more comprehensive networks. These pooled layers can result in better models of the real social structure which allow for better quantification of sociality. Pooling can also be used to simplify multilayer network analyses by focusing on fewer network types and reducing the number of layers used in the analysis, reducing nonindependence problems and decreasing the risk of committing Type 1 errors (Silk et al. 2013) .",

Different behaviors may each convey important information when considered separately, and these differences may be lost if behaviors are pooled (Beisner et al. 2015 (Beisner et al. , 2020 . The combination of 2 nonequivalent behaviors into a single network layer could introduce unnecessary noise into a multilayer network analysis and reduce the ability of those analyses to reach clear conclusions. Combining nonequivalent behaviors that differ in how commonly or rarely they are observed could also strongly bias the resulting network layer toward the most common behavior (Silk et al. 2013) . These costs of pooling behaviors at the dyadic interaction level are especially important to consider in multilevel analyses where the focus is on detecting structure at different levels of social organization. Pooling seemingly similar dyadic interactions may differentially impact more macro-scale social properties, even in cases where behaviors appear similar at the dyadic level.",

            "text": "Decisions about pooling data are sometimes not well described. Details about the decision-making process of what behaviors are included in analyses, or how they may have been pooled or kept separate, are sometimes not explicitly reported in studies (e.g., Herberholz et al. 2003; Viblanc et al. 2016) . These choices may not be reported because weighing decisions about whether to pool or split behaviors occur at different points during a study. Decisions about network layers can be made at the time of data collection when observation protocols determine how data are coded. In these cases, it is typical for authors to report which behaviors they collected; it is less common for authors to provide a detailed description of all the behaviors that they could have collected, how those could have been subdivided into more specific categories, and why particular behaviors were categorized in certain ways. For example, in a study to identify the patterns of social ties within cichlid cooperative networks, the authors created affiliative and aggression networks and listed specific behaviors that qualified as either aggressive or affiliative; however, they did not further explain their reasoning for combining the behaviors (Sch\u00fc rch et al. 2010) . These decisions at the data collection stage can have downstream effects on later analyses, which may be constrained by the ways data were collected. To ensure flexibility in future analytical approaches, researchers often collect a suite of behavioral interaction and association data in several contexts, such as direct affiliative or aggressive interactions, and more passive tolerance, proximity, or group associations. It is important to note that although recording more detailed observations during data collection can allow for different ways of slicing, combining, or subsetting data for future analyses, detailed data like this can also be more difficult to collect reliably, especially in cases where there are only slight differences between 2 desired behavioral types. In cases where many types of behavioral data are collected and coded uniquely, decisions about which types to use to construct a specific network layer come at the analysis stage. As suggested by Ferreira et al. (2020) , it is important to give a detailed description of the study design as it may provide guidelines for further analyses in the same study or in other studies.",

            "text": "Decisions about pooling data can also be based on biological knowledge of the system. Researchers often rely on familiarity with the biology of the system to decide which behaviors \"qualify\" as sufficiently different to be coded separately or are similar enough to be included in the same network layer. This approach is especially common when researchers perceive 2 behaviors as qualitatively different types of interactions that both fall within the same social context. For example, some studies differentiate between low-and high-level aggressions based on assumptions about the energetic costs or potential for injury (Oczak et al. 2014; Pierard et al. 2019; Wey et al. 2019; Beisner et al. 2020) . Although the 2 behaviors may be coded as separate interaction types, they both fall within an agonistic social context. Researchers can also build on previous work with the same or closely related species to use knowledge of the system to make decisions about which behaviors to include or how to pool them (Munroe and Koprowski 2014; Beisner et al. 2020; Pereira et al. 2020 ). If the animals themselves perceive 2 types of behavioral interactions as socially equivalent, biologically, it would make sense to pool these 2 behaviors, and knowledge of the study system can be used as a rationale for making these decisions. A danger to this approach is that the study system may not be well enough understood to make these decisions in ways that align with the biological reality of how the animals themselves perceive the behaviors. In this case, pilot studies can be performed to obtain a priori knowledge about the study system, which can be helpful in the study design and analysis and may reduce the chances of making type 1 errors (Ferreira et al. 2020) .",

We developed a framework to examine the implications of splitting or pooling behaviors at the dyadic level before deciding on how to construct the layers of networks in a multilayer network analysis. This framework can also be applied to simpler single-layer network analysis. We propose a 3step process for investigating the general implications of pooling versus splitting behaviors: (1) perform exploratory analyses and use prior knowledge to determine whether the behaviors belong to the same behavioral context; (2) test whether behaviors can be considered \"interchangeable\"; and (3) test how data sparsity may affect the extent to which behaviors are interchangeable (see Figure 1 ). Our approach highlights how pooling or splitting behaviors may differentially affect measures of social structure across different levels of social organization (Hobson et al. 2019a) . We focus on how changes in relationships (formed via different types of interactions) may affect individual-and group-level social properties like strength and centrality, network properties, dominance hierarchy structure, and aggression strategies. We illustrate how this framework can be used by applying it to 2 types of aggressive behavior recorded in a group of monk parakeets Myiopsitta monachus. Our aim is to provide guidelines for other researchers to better evaluate these implications in their own study systems.",

Out-strength is calculated as the sum of the weight of outgoing edges and is a measure of the frequency of an individual's interactions (an individual's social activity). An individual with a high out-strength value is an individual responsible for many aggression events. Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which individuals are central for information flow in a network and is calculated as the number of times the node in question was included in all possible shortest paths between 2 nodes (Sosa et al. 2020 ). Eigenvector centrality is a measure of each individual's influence on the entire network, where the importance of an individual is dependent on the importance of other individuals in the network and is calculated by linearly transforming the adjacency matrix (Sosa et al. 2020) . Individuals have high eigenvector centrality scores when they are connected to other well-connected individuals.

Both measures provide insight into information transfer in a network. Average path length measures how interconnected a network is and is calculated as the average of the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the network. We measured average path length using the function \"mean_distance\" in the igraph package version 1.2.5 (Cs\u00e1 rdi and Nepusz 2006). Efficiency is a variation of effective information which is normalized to account for network size. Effective information reflects the noisiness or level of certainty of a system ) by subtracting the Shannon's entropy of a node's uncertainty (uncertainty of the edge out-weights) from the entropy of the network's uncertainty (distribution of uncertainty of the in-weights across the network) . A high value of effective information indicates that the relationships (e.g., interactions or associations) in a network are informative or are more certain . In our system, effective information (via its normalized form, efficiency) measures the noisiness in the patterns of aggression interactions among individuals. We used the package \"einet\" version 0.1.0 (Byrum et al. 2020 ) to calculate efficiency. Values of efficiency closer to 1 mean that future states can be explained by the current one (future states are the same as the current one), whereas values closer to 0 mean that future states can have a probability of 1/n (completely noisy or degenerate) (Hoel et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "Testing effects of pooling on dominance hierarchy structure We used 3 measures of dominance hierarchy structure: linearity, steepness, and triangle transitivity. Multiple measures may result in a better description of the dominance hierarchy structure as they measure different aspects and allow for intra-and inter-specific comparisons (Norscia and Palagi 2015) . Linearity is a measure of the consistency of dyadic aggression in a hierarchy: in a strictly linear hierarchy (h 0 \u00bc 1), dominant individuals beat all lower-ranked individuals in aggressive contests (Landau 1951) . We measured linearity using the \"h.index\" function with 1,000 randomizations in the R package EloRating version 0.46.11 (Neumann and Kulik 2020) . Steepness reflects the likelihood of winning a dominance encounter with adjacently ranked individuals. When a hierarchy is steep (D ij \u00bc close to 1), then more dominant individuals will always win against subordinate individuals, whereas when a hierarchy is van der Marel et al. \u00c1 Decision framework for pooling or splitting behaviors shallow, subordinates may win from time to time as well. Steepness is measured as the slope of the regression line between rank order and the normalized David's scores using the dyadic dominance index which we quantified using the \"getStp\" function in the R package steepness version 0.2-2 (Leiva and de Vries 2014). Triangle transitivity is another measure of the orderliness of hierarchies, but one that focuses on transitive relationships among groups of 3 individuals. Triangle transitivity calculates the proportion of orderly triads compared with the proportion that is disorderly (e.g., cyclic triads, where A wins over B, B over C, and C win over A) Mcdonald 2012, 2015) . Transitivity and linearity are similar when all dominance relationships are known but often some dyadic relationships are unknown (due to individuals avoiding interacting with specific individuals, sampling effort, etc.). Triangle transitivity is less sensitive to these null dyads than linearity. We measured triangle transitivity using the function \"transitivity,\" which calculates the scaled proportion of transitive triads (0 is the random expectation and 1 is maximum transitivity, no cycles) in the R package EloRating version 0.46.11 (Neumann and Kulik 2020) .",

Within directed dyads, crowds and displacements did not occur equally: a small number of directed dyads only crowded (5.9%), a larger proportion of directed dyads both crowded and displaced (35.5%), although the majority of agonistic dyads interacted only with displacements (58.6%). For directed dyads that interacted agonistically in some way, we observed 0.78 6 1.63 crowds per dyad (mean 6 standard deviation (SD), range 0-13) and 5.20 6 9.31 displacements per dyad (range 0-86); combined across crowds and displacements we observed 5.99 6 10.49 agonistic events per dyad (range 1-93).

The observed crowd and displacement networks were not correlated for betweenness centrality (r s \u00bc 0.08, P \u00bc 0.75; Figure 2 ): individuals that were important for information flow in the crowd network were not important in the displacement network. These results provide mixed evidence, but mostly provide support for pooling behaviors as 2 out of 3 social properties were correlated (individuals have the same functional role in both networks for the correlated measures). When we compared how these observed correlation strengths compared with those produced by our 2 reference models, we found that the observed values of the correlation strength between crowds and displacements of out-strength and eigenvector centrality fell within the distribution of both reference models (out-strength: Reference model 1, P \u00bc 0.42; Reference model 2, P \u00bc 0.25; and eigenvector centrality: Reference model 1, P \u00bc 0.27; Reference model 2, P \u00bc 0.07; Table 1 ).

However, there is no clear cut-off for when researchers should or should not pool the 2 behaviors if some, but not a majority of dyads use both behaviors (future work in our group will address this question more directly). We also found that the network of crowd interactions and the network of displacement interactions were strongly correlated, providing more evidence for pooling the 2. A simple test for the correlation strength between the occurrence of behaviors at the dyadic level can provide an indication of whether behaviors should be pooled or considered separately but our framework tests for the implications more directly at the network level and can help researchers better evaluate these decisions when the correct choice is not obvious. Finally, we found that the 2 behaviors did not occur at equal frequencies, which we addressed using 2 different reference models in Steps 2 and 3 of our framework.",
