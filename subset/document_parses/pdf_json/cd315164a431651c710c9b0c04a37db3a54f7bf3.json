Consequently evidence-based decision-making, data management guidelines, health resourcing for primary health care services and prevention strategies are lacking. This study aims to comprehensively describe the epidemiology, impact and outcomes of ARI in urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (hereafter referred to as Indigenous) in the greater Brisbane area. Methods/Design: An ongoing prospective cohort study of Indigenous children aged less than five years registered with a primary health care service in Northern Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Children are recruited at time of presentation to the service for any reason. Demographic, epidemiological, risk factor, microbiological, economic and clinical data are collected at enrolment. Enrolled children are followed for 12 months during which time ARI events, changes in child characteristics over time and monthly nasal swabs are collected. Children who develop an ARI with cough as a symptom during the study period are more intensely followed-up for 28 (\u00b13) days including weekly nasal swabs and parent completed cough diary cards. Children with persistent cough at day 28 post-ARI are reviewed by a paediatrician. Discussion: Our study will be one of the first to comprehensively evaluate the natural history, epidemiology, aetiology, economic impact and outcomes of ARIs in this population. The results will inform studies for the development of evidence-based guidelines to improve the early detection, prevention and management of chronic cough and setting of priorities in children during and after ARI.",

Nationally, diseases of the respiratory system, although ranked 4 th as the cause of death in Indigenous infants, are the commonest cause of preventable deaths [1] . Respiratory disease is the second most common reason for hospitalisation among Indigenous Australians (after renal dialysis) [1] . Lower acute RIs (ARI) account for the greatest number of hospitalisations in young Indigenous children aged under-5 years [1] . Also, the prevalence of serious chronic RIs such as non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis is high (one in 68 children) in Indigenous children living in remote regions [2] and this is associated with repeated episodes of hospitalised RIs [3] . Thus, Indigenous children bear a disproportionate burden of acute and chronic lower RIs [4, 5] .",

This is despite the fact that more Indigenous children live in urban Australia and socio-economic and health indices are consistently lower for urban Indigenous communities when compared to non-Indigenous populations [1] . Further, there are few studies that have examined differences in ARI incidence and predictors between urban Indigenous and non-Indigenous children at the community level, particularly in communities that are socio-economically and geographically similar. A community-based Australian study in west Sydney estimated that the reported rate of pneumonia in non-Indigenous children was 7.5/1000, compared to 12/1000 in Indigenous Children [10] . A survey in the Australian Capital Territory reported that Indigenous children had a higher prevalence of recent wheeze (21 %), wheeze with colds (36 %), dry cough at night (27 %) and parent-reported asthma (24 %) compared to 15 %, 23 %, 19 % and 15 % respectively in non-Indigenous Islander children [11] . Maternal factors and the external environment have been linked to infertility, early pregnancy loss, premature labour and low birthweight. Children with low birth weight are six times more likely to be hospitalised with ARI than children with normal birth weight [12, 13] .",

In non-Indigenous communities the only the Australian studies to investigate the cost associated with ARI have been conducted in cohorts of Melbourne pre-school aged children [14, 15] . In the first study of children aged 12 -71 months that focussed on influenza like illness, the average cost of community-managed episodes (without hospitalisation) was $241 (95 % CI $191 -$291). The key cost drivers were carer time away from usual activities caring for the ill child (70 % of costs), use of non-prescription medications (5.4 %), and general practice visits (5.0 %). The patient and family met 87 % of total costs. In a further study focussing on viral respiratory illnesses, the mean cost of ARIs was AU$309 (95 % CI $263 to $354). Influenza illnesses had a mean cost of AU$904 and RSV, AU$304. These studies were however conducted in a population with relatively high social and economic indices.

Even though some misclassification of cough may occur, Chang et al. [34] report that VCD diary cards have the highest correlation to cough frequency when measured objectively and hence, can be used in the absence of practical objective measures to evaluate cough severity and persistence. At specialist review (where required), both the parent and treating physician report on cough type allowing for the assessment of inter-rater reliability and the potential for derived bias Through employing a small team of study specific respiratory specialists from the same centre, the potential for bias derived from inconsistency of diagnosis at the time of specialist review will be minimised.",
