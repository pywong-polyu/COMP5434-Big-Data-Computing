Experiences of injustice are increasingly recognised as a key determinant of recovery outcomes in healthcare. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of perceived injustice on psychological outcomes amongst a group of cancer patients and survivors who received false-negative smear results under a National Cervical Cancer Screening Programme (CervicalCheck). Methods Women who received false-negative smear results who were involved in the CervicalCheck controversy in Ireland completed online measures of perceived injustice (IEQ), psychological distress (depression and anxiety as measured by the HADS), and satisfaction with care (PSCC) (n = 144). Results Rates of psychological distress in this sample were high, with 76% scoring in the clinical range for anxiety, 51% in the clinical range for depression, and 88% in the clinical range for perceived injustice. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that perceived injustice contributed unique variance to the prediction of depression and anxiety. Satisfaction with care significantly moderated the association between perceived injustice and depression. Conclusions Cancer patients who report high levels of perceived injustice are at greater risk for experiencing psychological distress. The relationship between perceived injustice and depression may vary as a function of satisfaction with care. Addressing issues of perceived injustice in the psychosocial and rehabilitative care of cancer patients may support the early identification of those at risk of significant psychological distress and enhance intervention success. Implications for policy and practice in healthcare are discussed.",

            "text": "A range of physical, social, psychological, and existential stressors are associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment. From a psychological perspective, the prevalence of depression and anxiety in cancer patients is high with rates of mood disorders reported in as many as 30-50% of cancer patients in hospital settings [1, 2] . The negative consequences of mood disorders in cancer patients and survivors is well documented and include reduced quality of life, maladaptive health behaviours, and poorer overall survival [3] [4] [5] , stressing the importance of psychosocial input across the spectrum of cancer care. However, two patients with very similar physical experiences may have completely different psychological responses, and similar psychological responses could arise from widely varying physical experiences [6] . This poses a challenge to those involved in the psychosocial and rehabilitative care of cancer patients. Such reported heterogeneity of the cancer experience highlights the need for studies to examine the mechanisms by which illnesses exert their influence on psychosocial outcomes. This may support health care professionals in the early identification of those at increased risk of chronic mental health difficulties and facilitate the development and delivery of more targeted, appropriate interventions in psychosocial and rehabilitative cancer care.",

Perceived injustice was originally explored in the pain and rehabilitation literature as a factor that influenced recovery outcomes in acute and chronic pain populations. More recently, its role has been evaluated in other clinical conditions including major depressive disorder, menstrual pain, and HIV [7] [8] [9] . Defined as a negative cognitive appraisal that reflects blame, unfairness, and the severity and irreparability of one's loss [10] , perceived injustice is now widely recognised as a risk factor for problematic recovery [11] . A growing body of evidence demonstrates significant associations with a variety of physical, psychological, and functional outcomes such as depression, anger, stress, more intense pain, higher levels of selfreported disability, and likelihood of returning to work [12, 13] . The impact of perceived injustice is notable in that it predicts poorer physical and psychosocial outcomes above and beyond demographic or injury-related factors [14] . An understanding of the link between perceived injustice and distress in an oncology population may provide researchers and clinicians in this field with valuable insight into an important and thus far unexplored determinant of mental health outcomes in cancer.",

When an individual is exposed to situations or events that are characterised by a violation of their rights, a transgression of status or a challenge to their perceived norms and beliefs, such fundamental assumptions about ourselves, others and the world around us are shattered and perceptions of injustice can arise with profound consequences for coping and adjustment. The potential sources of perceived injustice in one's experience of illness are varied and include healthcare providers, insurance providers, God, science, self, the government and family [15] . It is important to consider that perceptions of injustice are not merely mental constructions, and are often reflective of some degree of actual injustice in the environment. For example, hospitalised cancer patients have a 39% greater risk of experiencing an adverse event compared to other patients, due to longer stays in hospital and more complex surgical procedures [16] .",

More specifically, the National Cervical Cancer Screening Programme in Ireland (CervicalCheck) became the centre of much controversy in 2018 after smear tests of women who were subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer were selected for a quality review. Of over 1200 women included in this retrospective audit, it was found that for 221 women, the screening test should have provided a different result (see Appendix A for more detailed information) [17, 18] . While audits of this type are expected to reveal some missed abnormalities, an independent inquiry determined that across several cytology laboratories, many smears were read in a manner that was negligent and in breach of duty [19] . This resulted in a delay in diagnosis and deprived many women of the opportunity of timely treatment. Furthermore, at the time of the retrospective audit, false-negative smear results were not disclosed to women in 80% of cases [19] . A qualitative study carried out with several of the women who were impacted by the CervicalCheck controversy identified strong perceptions of injustice from their experience of perceived negligence and non-disclosure [20] . These interviews also identified dissatisfaction with quality of care for cervical cancer more broadly, and disappointment in the lack of openness and transparency from clinicians with regard to their original smear result [20] . Therefore, a secondary objective of this study was to determine whether patient satisfaction with care strengthened or ameliorated the impact of perceived injustice on psychological distress in this setting.",

The scale utilises a 5-point Likert response ranging from 0 (Never) to 4 (All the time), with higher scores indicating higher perceptions of injustice. Studies have identified a score of 30 as an established cut-off value for clinically relevant levels of perceived injustice [23] . Clinically relevant levels of perceived injustice relate to levels of perceived injustice that are high enough to have a palpable and noticeable effect on the daily life of the individual. Another study proposed that a total score above 19 may represent a barrier to return to work [24] . The IEQ demonstrated good internal consistency in this population sample (\u03b1 = 0.932).",

Little's MCAR test revealed that this data was missing at random (p = 0.881), therefore an Expectation-Maximisation (EM) procedure was considered appropriate to impute missing values. Sample characteristics were reported for all demographic and outcome variables. Outcome-related variables were tested for significant associations with perceived injustice using analyses of variance or bivariate correlations (non-parametric Spearman's Rho). Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to explore the unique associations between perceived injustice and psychological outcomes of depression and anxiety. Initial checks confirmed assumptions of normality, linearity, and heteroscedasticity using histograms and scatterplots. To avoid the issue of multicollinearity, the sociodemographic variable most highly correlated with the dependent variables (out of education status, employment status, and private or public healthcare status) was entered into the first block of each regression analysis (namely, employment status). CoViDrelated distress, pre-existing mental health and satisfaction with care were entered into the second and third blocks of the regression analyses, respectively (see Table 3 ). Participants' perceived injustice score was entered into the fourth and final block of all regression analyses. Results from the final models are reported. A moderator analysis using the PROCESS macro (Preacher and Hayes [26] ) examined whether the associations between perceived injustice and psychological distress were moderated by satisfaction with care. Moderation analyses were conducted by re-estimating the regression model and adding interaction terms between perceived injustice and satisfaction with care. Moderator effects were further explored through a simple slopes analysis. Study variables were standardised before performing the moderation analyses. Accordingly, all model parameters are presented as standardised (\u03b2) coefficients to allow comparison across paths.",

Perceived injustice showed moderate to strong positive correlations with depression (\u03c1 = 0.561) and anxiety (\u03c1 = 0.528). Satisfaction with care demonstrated a small to moderate positive correlation with depression (\u03c1 = 0.292), anxiety (\u03c1 = 0.266), and perceived injustice (\u03c1 = 0.266). An analysis of variance indicated no significant differences across psychological outcome variables between age groups. Respondents in part-time or full-time employment scored significantly lower on measures of depression [t (142) = -3.65, p < 0.001] and anxiety [t (142) = -2.36, p = 0.020] than respondents who were unemployed, retired, or seeking opportunities.

Notably, respondents who were treated within the public health system reported significantly higher levels of dissatisfaction with their cancer care (55.47 \u00b1 14.37) than respondents who accessed their care through the private health insurance system (47.56 \u00b1 13.08), t (142) = \u2212 3.28, p = 0.001.

The key findings of this study contribute novel insights to the fields of both perceived injustice and supportive cancer care. Firstly, over two-thirds of the sample report levels of perceived injustice that fall into the 'High' range (30 +) . The overall mean score on the IEQ in this sample (see Table 1 ) was found to meet the threshold for clinically relevant levels of perceived injustice and was notably higher than those reported in previous clinical samples [12] . This identifies perceived injustice as one of the underlying psychological processes that may be at play in this group's experience of receiving a false-negative result in cancer screening and the nondisclosure of same. Fifty-one percent of the sample fell in the clinical range for symptoms of depression, and 76% of the sample fell in the clinical range for symptoms of anxiety. It is difficult to directly compare these prevalence rates with other cancer survivors in support groups as such figures are not reported in the literature. However, these figures are notably higher than the prevalence of depression and anxiety in cancer survivors generally, which a meta-analysis of 43 studies estimates to be 12% and 18% respectively [27] . Secondly, perceptions of injustice were found to correlate with scores on outcome measures of depression and anxiety which is in line with pre-existing research in other patient groups [12] . Thirdly, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that perceptions of injustice contribute unique variance to the prediction of depression and anxiety after controlling for CoViD-related distress and pre-existing mental health, indicating that perceived injustice should be considered a relevant factor in contributing to psychological outcomes in non-pain-related samples. Finally, satisfaction with cancer care (which taps into informational, communicational, and interpersonal elements of care) was found to moderate the association between perceived injustice and depression. Specifically, low satisfaction with care was found to strengthen the relationship between perceived injustice and depression and high satisfaction with care was found to weaken the relationship.",

Clinicians in the field of oncology would benefit from being aware of the potential psychological sequalae of false-negative results in screening, and where applicable, may wish to integrate into assessment an exploration of the patient's involvement in and perceived experience of screening services. More broadly, clinicians in oncology need to be aware of the general relevance of perceived injustice in contributing to mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety. While negative cognitive biases have an identified role in depression [28] , and the cross-sectional nature of this study limits the extent to which any inferences regarding causality can be made, recent prospective research has offered further insight into the sequential relation between perceived injustice and distress [8, 29] , indicating that the relationship between these two variables is not bi-directional and reporting data to suggest that perceived injustice precedes depression, and not the other way around [8] . Given this, and given that symptoms of depression have important influences on health-related behaviours and functioning such as treatment engagement, compliance with rehabilitation and adherence to medication regimes [30] [31] [32] clinicians should consider exploring perceived injustice in standard assessment procedure in psycho-oncology practice. At a practical level, this may facilitate identification of patients who could be at greater risk of experiencing chronic psychological distress post-treatment and into their survivorship trajectory.",

Integrating perceived injustice into assessment may help the practitioner to understand whether injustice appraisal processes are underlying or contributing to depressive symptomatology, and in doing so can help the client to make sense of their experiences. This provides the basis for an intervention plan tailored to the client's specific needs. Perceived injustice can be included in assessment through the use of a validated measure such as the Injustice Experience Questionnaire (IEQ), or by simply integrating questions that explore appraisals of blame, unfairness and irreparable loss into the clinical interview. At a more nuanced level, our findings have implications for healthcare organisations and how they conduct themselves following an adverse event or when faced with an opportunity for open disclosure. The moderating role of satisfaction with care tentatively indicates that strategies such as an enhanced focus on bedside manner and open and honest communication may ameliorate the impact of perceived injustice on psychological distress in health-related settings. The value of open disclosure is largely supported by empirical research. Studies have reported that patients unequivocally want full disclosure of errors in their care, and that incomplete or ambiguous explanations of the error may increase distress [34] . From a systems perspective, the value of committing to open disclosure policies and procedures across the spectrum of healthcare (coupled with the required training and support for healthcare professionals) is worth considering in the context of the \u20ac832 million the Health Service Executive has paid out on medical negligence cases since 2014 alone [35] . Future research should aspire to track the implementation of open disclosure policies in Ireland, document patients' and clinicians' experience of this process and determine whether this has an impact on perceptions of injustice or intention to litigate.",

            "text": "The primary limitation of our findings concerns the cross-sectional nature of the analyses. As all variables were collected concurrently, inferences regarding causality of the relationship between injustice and distress cannot be made. While the response rate to the survey was objectively strong and adds to the generalisability of the findings to the wider group of women impacted by the CervicalCheck controversy, the unique nature of the group's experiences limits the generalisability of the research findings. To elaborate, they all received a false-negative result from an established cervical cancer screening programme; many are involved in complicated litigation against the state; they unwittingly became part of a national controversy with significant media attention, and they are current members of a support group who have successfully lobbied the government to a) offer an apology on behalf of the state and b) adapt laws related to open disclosure. It is therefore important to acknowledge that they have experienced a range of difficulties beyond that of a cervical cancer diagnosis and related treatment, which has natural implications for the generalisability of findings. The inclusion of a control group of general cervical cancer survivors would have allowed for cancerspecific distress and cancer-specific injustice to be controlled in analyses. However, some measures were taken to address this, and respondents were asked to complete items on the IEQ specifically in relation to their involvement in the screening failure, not their cancer diagnosis. Measures to account for the impact of confounding variables such as CoViD-related distress adds to the quality of this study's methodology. However, the impact of CoViDrelated distress should be interpreted with caution given that the variable was captured by a single-item question rather than a validated measure. Finally, participant's perceptions of their pre-existing mental health status were also captured by a single-item question and are naturally subject to memory bias.",
