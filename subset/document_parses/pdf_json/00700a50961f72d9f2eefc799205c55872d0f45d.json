Fact-checking outlets around the world have been actively counteracting false and misleading information surrounding the pandemic. In this article, we conceptualize fact checkers in terms of the \"interpretative power\" that journalism holds in processes of political performances (Alexander in Soc Theory 22(4): 527-573, 2004, in: The performance of politics. Obama's victory and the struggle for democratic power. Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York, 2010). Drawing on virus-related fact checks from Poynter's International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) database, we make two arguments. First, we argue that the new phenomenon of specialized \"fact checking\" might be considered as a further explicitly differentiated element of Alexander's model of cultural performance, which fulfills a double duty: trying to contribute to further \"de-fusion\" (separating audiences from actors when the latter lack authenticity and credibility) on the one hand, and working to overcome it on the other. Second, we explain how new fact-checking practices have become a reflexive supplement to the news media of the civil sphere that might be able to help the civil sphere's communicative institutions to defend truthfulness in a manner that contributes to democracy.",

Fact-checking outlets around the world-including independent media and fact checkers; public and civil entities; social media platforms; and tech giants such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, and YouTube-have been actively counteracting false and misleading information surrounding the pandemic. Independent journalism has been at the core of this common action of battling misinformation. According to a study published in April 2020 by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (hereafter RISJ) and the Oxford Internet Institute, the number of independent fact checkers increased dramatically between January and March 2020. Findings in this study show that the number of English-language fact checks produced by independent media and fact checkers rose more than 900 percent in these months. The false narratives about COVID-19 that have been identified have been of a dynamic and changing nature, adapting to the social and informative context and becoming increasingly politicized (Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn 2020). While misinformation about scientific issues (especially that related to the origin of the virus) was the focus of the most prominent false narrative at the beginning of the crisis, fake news on political and institutional measures became more relevant as the pandemic advanced. Fact checking's impressive growth has occurred in parallel with record-breaking months for news traffic and media subscriptions, even if print and online newspapers have continued to face dramatic losses in advertising revenues (Cerezo 2020; Financial Times, May 29, 2020; El Confidencial, April 20, 2020) . Interestingly, journalism's fight against misinformation has taken place in a context in which the news seems to connect with ordinary citizens more broadly, lessening inequalities between media audiences (Casero-Ripoll\u00e9s 2020).",

This cultural work is rooted in core values of journalism that frame social events and actors within the broader discourse of civil societies (Alexander 2006 (Alexander , 2010 Alexander et al. 2016) . In confronting the threat of COVID-19 mis-and disinformation, journalists have coded public claims within the civil binary of truthfulness versus falsehood. This binary also reflects the dividing line between sacred facts and mundane opinion, particularly in the cultural context of North American journalism. The cultural struggle over the meaning of \"truth\" not only positions professional journalism strongly within society but also \"cuts to the very core of the journalistic gaze's ability to hold power to account,\" as Kreiss has put it (2019, p. 29) .",

We do so based on a cultural-sociological perspective and on civil sphere theory. Our aim is to shed light on both this new phenomenon of fact checkers and the increasing thematization of misinformation and \"false facts,\" which the COVID-19 crisis has intensified. In particular, we focus on the impact of fact-checking journalism on alleged false claims from politicians and public authorities at peak times of the pandemic. Drawing on virus-related fact checks from Poynter's International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) database, 1 we looked at fact checks published between January 22, 2020, the date when COVID-19 misinformation started, and May 20, by which time the coronavirus had spread around the globe. The selected period included a wide range of fact checks based on turning points of political performances related to the coronavirus outbreak. We focused on fact checks produced by the Spanish and North American fact-checking organizations. In the IFCN database, the US and Spain, along with India, represent the countries with the highest fact-checking activity during the research period. Beyond quantitative criteria, both countries serve as paradigmatic examples of political polarization that the pandemic has not only unveiled but also aggravated. As we will observe later, according to Alexander's theory of social performance (2004), a context of social and political fragmentation poses a great challenge to political actors when they attempt to connect with audiences. After applying filtering to remove fact checks that did not relate to political performances and eliminating repeated reports, the final sample consisted of 162 checks.",

These were the principal questions that we asked as we began to work with our sample of fact checks, though as will be seen, our analysis ultimately yielded findings that go beyond them.

First, although misinformation surrounding COVID-19 has come in many varieties-from conspiracy theories and claims that inflate or downplay the numbers of coronavirus cases to fake cures and tests-much COVID-19 misinformation concerns the actions of public authorities and politicians (RISJ Factsheet, April 2020). To the extent that these claims often involve prominent public figures, they become, in turn, stimuli for public engagement and viral content to be disseminated quickly throughout social media. Second, as the RISJ factsheet shows, \"False information spread by politicians, celebrities, and other prominent public figures\" accounted for 69 percent of total engagement on social media, though their claims made up just 20 percent of those identified in the study. Finally, the preliminary data that we collected confirmed the significant extent to which these two types of misinformation claims have proliferated and spread. This confirmation prompted us to focus our analysis on factchecking activity undertaken in relation to politicized misinformation concerning COVID-19.",

            "text": "The rise of fact checkers evidences the widely documented analytical turn adopted by journalism institutions from the second half of the 20th century. By the 1960s, American journalism took a more skeptical and critical stance toward political power (Downie and Schudson 2009; Schudson 1978) . One of the main causes of this shift was the adoption of more sophisticated methodologies and perspectives from social sciences that proliferated within the field of journalism studies in US universities (Graves 2016) . Likewise, the increase in the resources available for research in newsrooms (access to official documents and specialized bibliography) gave journalists greater possibilities for engaging with output from scientific disciplines, in order to produce more in-depth, comprehensive, and critical reporting. This shift in journalism culture was driven by a greater demand from the public for critical content vis-\u00e0-vis political and economic elites. It was also professionally motivated by journalists' aspirational desire for authority and legitimacy in the public sphere. As Graves (2016, p. 65) observes, Analytical reporting allows more play for reporters' political, intellectual, and literary ambitions. It gives rise to areas of specialized expertise and training that help to legitimate reporters' claims to be news \"professionals\"-areas such as \"precision journalism\" in the 1970s or \"data journalism\" today. And it simultaneously fulfills and celebrates journalism's mission as a democratic watchdog, elevating the reporter vis-a-vis the public figures she reports on.",

Some are independent-for example, Maldita, which was founded in 2013, and Newtral, which was founded in 2018. Others are linked to existing news media organizations. La Chistera (2015) And EFE Verifica (2019) is linked to EFE, the state news agency. These predominantly digital projects are often characterized by their use of their founders' brand as a promotion strategy (Manfredi 2015) . As we observed in the American case, some of these initiatives are a regular presence in national media, especially in electoral periods, and so have achieved widespread visibility. The main difference between the Spanish context and the American one is the absence of relevant national events that contribute to building a movement or community with deep interactions and knowledge exchange among the different projects and actors. Currently, Maldita, Newtral, and EFE Verifica, which belong to the IFCN, are the most active Spanish fact checkers.",

In November 2016, Facebook confronted accusations of having promoted the spread of fake news in the US presidential election held months earlier. The social network signed an agreement with several fact checkers from different countries, including the US and Spain, to detect and label false content circulating on Facebook. The event helped to boost fact checkers' fight against false information internationally. One year before, in 2015, Poynter's IFCN was created to bring together fact checkers worldwide under the label of \"trust, transparency and accountability journalism\" (Poynter 2020) . The IFCN analyzes formats and trends in fact-checking practice around the world, promotes common basic standards through a code of principles, monitors the impact of fact-checking activity, convenes fact checkers in a yearly conference, and promotes collaborative efforts in international fact checking (Poynter 2020) .",

Fact checks integrate original sources and, according to V\u00e1zquez-Herrero et al.

Fact-checking journalists are supposed to have the skills required to work with specialized tools-for example, geo-location tools and software that detects manipulated videos. Unlike journalists at legacy and new media organization, fact checkers do not have an explicit editorial line. This does not make them immune to bias, however. On the contrary, they have been accused of it on many occasions. That said, they apply a different editorial culture to the types of claims they usually label as false. When this approach to fact checking is used by legacy media, it is always presented as a specialized practice.

They seem to have done so particularly from 2016, when the political campaigns that ended in victory for Donald Trump in the United States and for Brexit in the United Kingdom arguably served as catalysts for the disinformation phenomenon (McIntyre 2018) . That year, the Oxford Dictionary (2016) included the term post-truth, which the dictionary named as its word of the year. In a post-truth discursive context in which the importance of facts and scientific evidence is diminished to assert ideological positions, fact checkers have in our view become a new extension of independent fact-checking and accountability journalism. Fact checkers' work focuses on socially contentious, polarizing issues and is grounded in the use of digital-media technologies. From a performative perspective, we understand this professional extension of journalism into fact checking as a further distinguishing aspect of journalism's unique \"interpretive power\" (Alexander 2004 (Alexander , 2010 . Among Alexander's elements of performance (2004), \"social power\" is divided into \"material power\" and \"interpretive power.\" Alexander locates news media within the latter. By applying his model to political representation and, specifically, to the case of the Obama campaign in the US presidential elections of 2008, Alexander documents-from a sociological point of view-the professional differentiation of journalism. Alexander also looked even further back in time to track the evolution of journalism from the origins of the partisan press to a progressive \"media reflexivity\" (Alexander 2010, p. 290 ) that served as a vehicle for the interpretive power of contemporary independent journalism.",

They evaluate what citizens should consider acceptable in democratic life. Their legitimacy to play this role is based on the presentation of facts, expert knowledge, and reason-driven reporting. This function entails countless difficulties owing to the current context of disinformation and fake news. Although these phenomena have multi-dimensional roots (European Commission 2019; Aparici and Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn 2019), several scholars locate an essential part of the disinformation problem in the new sociotechnical reality derived from the digitalization of information (Han 2017; Lanier 2018; McIntyre 2018; Pariser 2011; D'Ancona 2017; Bartlett 2018; Berinsky 2015) . These scholars argue that a set of social and psychological factors leads subjects to believe and share false information. Fiske and Taylor (2013, p. 54 ) have argued that, in addition to the processes of cognitive dissonance (Festinger et al. 1956) and confirmation biases, \"the audience's cognitive misery prevents the public from making significant efforts to understand and interpret the information they consider non-essential.\" Individuals instead take mental shortcuts that are based on previous beliefs and experiences. These limitations add to the impact of feelings and emotions, especially when it comes to audience engagement with online information. It has been proven that emotional information is more attractive (Reis et al., 2015) and more rapidly shared on social networks (Zillmann 2009 ). Likewise, audiences find social gratification in disseminating breaking news, even if what they are sharing is inaccurate. Sharing information provides the subject with a sense of belonging to a community through his or her interacting collectively with the same stories with which a social group is engaged (Hoffner et al. 2009 ). On social networks, both the amount of information shared and the speed with which it is shared (regardless of its veracity) give the user prestige and status (Bowman and Cohen 2020) .",

Alexander observes that as societies become more complex and segmented, the elements of social performance remain de-fused or separated from one another. To be effective, performances must engage in a project of re-fusion. As Alexander (2004, p. 529) puts it, To the degree they achieve re-fusion, social performances become convincing and effective-more ritual-like.

When operating before the wider public, political actors have needed to combine accurate information with persuasive messages aimed at involving people in tackling the spread of the virus (Canel 2020) . In a context of social polarization, misinformation flows that directly question the words and actions and the overall legitimacy of public authorities become potent tools for preventing governments from re-fusing with audiences. Nevertheless, attempts to scrutinize potential misinformation could be viewed with suspicion when they are undertaken by the public authorities themselves. 2 As Brennen et al. ask in the RISJ study (April 7, 2020) , \"How many people will accept as credible a government trying to debunk or refute misinformation that casts that very same government in a negative light?\" Their answer is that \"independent fact checkers can provide authoritative analysis of misinformation while helping platforms identify misleading and problematic content, just as independent news media can report credibly on how governments and others are responding (with varying degrees of success) to the pandemic.\"",

We found that citizens rarely ask fact checkers to verify claims made by public figures. Instead, their attention focuses on the hoaxes generated by other individuals, which usually reach them horizontally, through instant messaging services such as WhatsApp. Donald Trump's claim about the poor quality of the tests provided by the WHO is an example of top-down narrative.

Most of the checks are linked to expert consultation, review and analysis of official documents, and interpretation of data. In short, actions in which technological resources assume a secondary function normally involve data visualization or reverse image searches to detect videos and pictures taken out of context. On many occasions, fact checkers are simply a transmitter of the denial from the institution or the politician subject to allegations; in such situations, their role is closer to that of simple spokesperson of the institution, and they do not take any investigative action. This is the case in most of the Spanish fact checks analyzed. Thus, a double dimension is established in the performance of fact checking: \"soft\" fact checking (based on communicating the denial) and \"hard\" fact checking (exhaustive research and documentation for demonstrative and explanatory purposes). Soft fact checking is prominent, above all, in bottom-up verifications (usually generated by users on social networks, by partisan digital media, and by websites that create hoaxes). It involves documents that incorporate logos or identifying elements of public institutions to spread false measures. The document's authenticity and the information contained in it are then denied by the institution concerned. In this case, fact checkers simply report the denial, without any investigation or recourse to external experts. When research is undertaken, it is limited to checking whether the name of Fig. 1 Fact checkers' contribution to performative processes of de-and re-fusion the impersonated institution is correct or elucidating some key aspects of a picture's editing that betrays the deception. Hard fact checking is connected to much more elaborate research methods where the analysis of different types of sources (institutional and journalistic) and consultation with experts constitute the raw material for reports that explain the reasons behind fact checkers' evaluations. The previously mentioned reports about Trump and Biden are representative examples of hard fact checking. In what follows, we first interpret fact checkers' responses to the performances of politicians and public authorities and then we examine fact checkers' selfreflective claims.",

In the Spanish case, there is a symbolic partisanship, building up from a political discourse that feeds on specific frameworks that favor one's ideological position when condemning the opposite stance. Fact-checking reports reflect a post-truth narrative. However, that narrative does not reach the level of aggressiveness and political radicalization of the political campaigns examined by Kreiss (2017) . For example, when the president of the Community of Madrid, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, from the conservative Partido Popular (PP), indicated (falsely) that Madrid had met the requirements to open establishments and resume commercial activity after the hardest phase of the coronavirus crisis had passed, 3 fact checkers echoed public discourses in Spain that associated Madrid's regional government with values such as freedom and economic openness. Conversely, these discourses link the current left-wing national government coalition with nationwide captivity and confinement. Public protests against the government called by the far-right VOX were also based on this pairing of opposite meanings (confinement versus freedom), and not on other types of values related to a crisis in public health and citizen security.",

There are also paradigmatic examples of such reactions in the United States. On March 30, PolitiFact verified a false claim by Trump in which the president denied having criticized some states' governors for making unjustified requests for respirators. That statement was made in an interview with Fox News. The PolitiFact story describes a PBS journalist asking Trump if it was true that he had made such a claim about the governors. Trump replied that it was not true. It could be said that, at this point, PolitiFact's journalists symbolically entered the scene to verify who was telling the truth: the journalist or the president. After a thorough analysis of the case, the fact checker concluded that Trump had brazenly lied shamelessly; the site gave his claim a Pants on Fire rating.",

            "text": "Explanations of the current post-truth era usually conclude that social media platforms generate most of the main dysfunctions derived from misinformation. These explanations are often connected to echo chambers and ideological bubbles that impoverish public debate (Ball 2017; Leetaru 2017; Lewandowsky et al. 2017) , the use of bots to spread disinformation and partisan content (Webb and Jirotka 2017) , and trolling, a practice that polarizes citizens and extends hate speech (Hannan 2018) . Under these perspectives, digital spaces seem to increase the \"irrationality\" of publics (Ward forthcoming), impeding civil discourse. Many authors place users in the position of retweeting and sharing the biased and false content that floods digital platforms. There is, therefore, a widely established line of thought in the academic field of media studies about the role of social media platforms as instruments that can easily be used as political tools for disseminating misleading information (Sismondo 2017) and polarizing audiences (Waisbord 2018) . In most of the fact checks analyzed, digital platforms become institutions with a positive value within the civil sphere. On the one hand, private instant messaging services such as WhatsApp, a platform often used to transmit hoaxes (Salaverr\u00eda et al. 2020 ), function as a \"connection method\" between the public and fact checkers so that ordinary citizens can denounce fake news and activate processes of de-fusion. On the other hand, traditional social networks such as Twitter and Facebook emerge as catalysts for these checks-that is, as powerful agents against fake news. Social media platforms are considered to be spaces that bring together the collaboration of different civil actors to detect and refute hoaxes. These civil actors can be both those affected by (false) news or well-informed citizens who have first-hand knowledge about the news stories and use social networks to dismantle them. This collaborative action between fact checkers and social media can be observed in the case of the Spanish photographer Ignacio Pereira, whose picture of Gran V\u00eda-one of the main streets in Madrid-was doctored by the Spanish Far Right party VOX so that the street was filled with coffins. The aim of VOX's doctored image was to criticize the government's management of the coronavirus health crisis. Several users (@JCDAtrasto: \"This is the real image by @ignaciopereira and I suppose that he MUST NOT be very happy\") and the creator of the image himself (\"This is not authorized and I will take appropriate legal action. Please RT,\" Ignacio Pereira on Twitter on April 6, 2020) made use of Twitter to share the original photo (without coffins) and denounce the misuse of the image.",

            "text": "Contrary to the crisis narrative, legacy media's role in the fact-checking process is highlighted by fact checkers in a particular manner. Traditional news media appear as relevant figures and are very present in the meta-discourse of fact checkers-that is, the way in which the latter legitimize their fact-checking activity. Journalistic organizations are presented as crucial trustworthy sources for verifying facts on an equal footing with respect to scientific experts or official documents. There are numerous US fact checks that show this centrality of legacy media both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the Spanish case, some fact checks reveal that some false claims that become viral on social networks are fabrications based on images and texts from legacy media. Through a careful reconstruction of the original news story, fact checks unmask the falsity of such manipulated content that appeared to be truthful because it included elements of journalism. For the same purpose, previous fact checks become key elements in subsequent ones. The fact checker assumes a dual role as investigative entity and creator of documentary evidence based on the original news reporting of leading journalistic organizations. On March 6, 2020, PolitiFact checked a claim in which Trump accused Obama of \"not having done anything\" to tackle the 2009 swine flu outbreak. This fact checker used an earlier verification (\"President Obama declared H1N1 a public health emergency before anyone in the United States died\" March 4, 2020) to demonstrate that Trump's claim is false. External references to legacy media are critical for the construction of this specific verifying story, but also for the general formation of fact checkers' discourse of truth. This discourse has a multi-layered dimension. Fact checkers not only determine which facts are true and which are false, but also which narratives of truth must be known and which of the many voices have enough credibility to determine the veracity of facts. The symbolic spaces of truth created by fact checkers pave the way for a process of re-fusion between trustworthy actors and publics. By referring to traditional media and to their own checks, fact-checking entities set a dividing line between two symbolic spaces (Carlson 2020) : the space associated with reason, scientific knowledge, and high-quality journalism on the one hand, and the space of irrationality and distortion on the other. In the work of building such a symbolic boundary of truth, fact checkers also focus their activities on the sources of disinformation. A common strategy is to explain the lack of legitimacy of the media entity or actor that generated the misinformation. These disinformation agents are unmasked through research into their background and reputation. Based on this investigation, fact checkers help to bring together quality journalism and audiences by distinguishing media that offer truly informative content from partisan publications. This separation between the two types of media alerts the public to possible future misinformation from sources that are symbolically labeled as unreliable. On March 19, 2020, LeadStories checked a story posted on the satirical website Oba-maWatcher.com. The story claimed that Obama's family escaped to a private island to protect themselves from the coronavirus. LeadStories describes the lack of legitimacy of this website and the questionable online activity of the site's owner, Christopher Blair:",

In reaction to this, he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry visible disclaimers everywhere. (LeadStories, March 19, 2020.) On the audience side, processes of de-fusion activated by fact checkers help audiences to acquire meaningful knowledge to deal with misinformation. Fact checkers show how the creators of false and misleading stories act, thus providing powerful tools so the public can detect this type of content. References to previous checks of similar stories reveal the rhetoric, themes, and common mechanisms deployed when false information is created, and they define a performance of lies that is very valuable in empowering citizens' media literacy. For example, in refuting the hoax about the mobilization of the US military to take the main cities of the United States and impose martial law, LeadStories (March, 25 2020) provided a list of previously performed checks within the same thematic framework, thereby helping to position this claim as open to doubt:",

Fact checkers' reflection on their authority is associated with professional journalism. To the extent that they first arose from civil organizations and then become professionalized via a close connection with traditional and new journalistic organizations, new fact-checking websites can be seen as an extension of professional-accountability journalism. More empirical work should be made to prove this connection. It is worth emphasizing that the analysis of the selected fact checks helps to delineate a discourse of truth that, organized around the symbolic binaries of true/false or fact/opinion, makes it possible to connect the new phenomenon of fact checking to journalism.

Checks and reports usually refer to such organizations as sources of \"facts\" and \"truths\" that reflect a science-driven narrative, along with scientific experts and institutions. Similarly, fact checkers' reports both highlight social media platforms' collaborative work to confront misinformation and point out misleading claims emanating from specific individuals via the same social media. By doing so, fact checkers not only purify the new media embraced by citizens but also symbolically locate reasonable publics within the boundaries of truth.",
