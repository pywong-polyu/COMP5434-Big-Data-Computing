The UK remains subject to EU law and continues to be part of the EU customs union and single market during the transition, but is no longer part of the EU's political bodies or institutions. No British commissioner sits in the current European Commission nor do representatives of the British government participate in common meetings, such as the meetings of the European Council. Starting on 1 February 2020 the number and distribution of seats in the European Parliament changed following the UK withdrawal.

Indeed, much of the process of EU integration has been institutional and the EU setup turned out to be an uncomfortable fit for the UK. Albion was strong and smart enough to obtain special status within the EU, the most important of which was its retention of the pound as its national currency. The UK also succeeded in slowing down the integration process in selective and sensitive areas, primarily finance, fiscal matters, international and military issues. The dominant role of the City of London in international finances was protected even in Eurozone finances (such as in the euroclearing market). 3 UK membership consequently was both welcome and challenging for the EU.",

It refuses to relinquish the pound, 4 and objects to the increase of the EU budget, the coordination of fiscal systems and capital market rules, even though it coordinates with the European Central Bank (ECB). Great Britain is politically and economically important and strong. At the time of the referendum its economy recovered better than the EU average from the crisis, was fairly balanced, and its finances and currency global players.

The economic fault between Northern countries and Southern countries continues to be significant, and political fault lines are deepening too between older member countries and the four Visegr\u00e1d countries (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary). These fault lines were invisible until the international crisis, thanks to the internal flow of private resources from financially strong countries to some of the unbalanced countries. The asymmetric financial shock of the crisis, austerity policies and internal devaluation forced upon distressed member countries in order to fix their fiscal and financial imbalances, caused a reversal of financial flows and put financial and political pressure on them. Their distance from the Union's resilient core increased rapidly. The adverse distancing was particularly evident in the case of Greece, but remarkable also in other Southern European countries and Ireland.",

Moreover, it also had the expertise and structures to succeed.

Overall, the strategy was successful, aided by its close alliance to the United States and its first-class role in globalization.

With time priority moved from production and trade integration for deterring armed conflicts to reduce transaction costs and strengthen scale and scope economies for improving enterprise competitiveness and increasing market size. All this also served to make the integrated economy more resilient to crises and improve Europe's standing in international markets. The monetary union subsequently sought additional micro and macroeconomic management efficiencies. This initial unitary vision and strategy, however politically ambitious, were technically feasible since member countries were in similar situations. The post-war reconstruction period, rapidly growing openness of economies in a globalizing international context and strong willingness to cooperate created opportunities for rapid growth free of major negative shocks. The original unitary vision led to the single market and the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). It yielded high initial dividends by focusing on Pareto superior common market building, allowing everyone to gain without compelling any member to lose. Widened rational utilitarian choice outweighed conflicts over monetary and fiscal policy and social values. There were two major events that jeopardized this harmonious progress: membership of Great Britain on 1 January 1973 and the financial crisis of 2008.",

However, in 1985, the UK ratified the Single European Act (SEA) which created, among others, the single market and in October 1990 joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) which pegged European currencies to cross-parities. UK membership in ERM lasted until September 1992 when international speculation against the overvalued pound compelled the country to leave ERM and refuse to reenter afterward. During the concomitant negotiations for the Maastricht Treaty, the UK successfully negotiated an opt-out that freed the UK from the need to join the monetary union.

The concept is compatible with strong, moderate, or weak supranational authority and can accommodate multiple degrees of participation if members desire. The core EU group (France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands), signatories to the Treaty of Rome (March 1957) have long favored increasing coordination and the gradual construction of supranationality (\"more Europe\") achieved by deepening the power of common supranational institutions and holding members to strict convergence criteria in order to ameliorate problems caused by the monetary union's incompleteness. The UK and some other members prefer softer central power in varying degrees including different classes of supranational participation. The debate on the merit of these alternatives has clarified some issues but has not settled matters because the merit of any institution depends fundamentally on its goals, not just its architecture.",

Pressure for \"more Europe\" and promotion of one-track integration reached its climax with the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 and the launch of the process of monetary union. However, intraunion disagreements and divergences were ever present (Brunnermeier et al. 2016; Mody 2018) . Brexit represents the culmination of conflicts of interests and divergent views and strategies within the process of European integration and raises the warning that the EU should start considering and implementing a reform capable of accommodating such differences in a constructive way. We contend that an orderly multispeed, multitrack, and multilevel (MSTL) order is sufficient to significantly mitigate strife and promote better outcomes in a Union made of countries with many institutional and structural differences and need to solve different problems (Dallago and Rosefielde 2020) .",

The suspension of the Stability and Growth Pact during the 2020 pandemic gave members additional degrees of freedom on an emergency basis. The 2010 European Semester, a series of regularly scheduled fora created to foster national fiscal policy coordination, structural reforms and macroeconomic imbalances discussions, based on commonly agreed treaties and standards, serves a similar eclectic purpose. The consultation process is not joint sovereignty and has a limited short-term perspective, but is a step in the right direction.
