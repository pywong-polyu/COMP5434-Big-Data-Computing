Despite the higher propensity of diabetic patients to other coronaviruses infections in previous epidemics, the prevalence of diabetes among COVID-19 patients seems to be similar to the general population [2] . It is currently unknown whether diabetes predisposes people to COVID-19. However, it makes patients more vulnerable to severe forms of the disease resulting in a higher proportion of intensive care unit admission besides more mortality [3, 4] . The higher mortality rate and poor prognosis among diabetic patients with COVID-19 have been reported in different studies [5, 6] . Findings from a study conducted in the USA indicated a four-fold higher in-hospital mortality rate among diabetic and uncontrolled hyperglycemic patients. Additionally, in a Chinese study, the mortality rate in diabetic patients was 7.3% vs 2.3% for COVID-19 patients overall [7] [8] [9] .",

Several studies showed that poor glycemic control in diabetic patients increases the risk of complications [10, 11] . Furthermore, the impacts of glucose-lowering medication on the severity and fatality of COVID-19 have been reported [6, 12] . Although there are limited studies on antibiotics and antiviral treatment and the interactions with diabetes medications and a unique guild line on this issue, recent studies pointed to the specific effects of treatments for COVID-19 in diabetic patients, e.g. hydroxychloroquine reduces plasma glucose level leading to improve glycemic control besides the higher risk of hypoglycemia which needs special considerations in patients with diabetes [13, 14] .",

To conclude, the exposure factors with a p value of less than 0.2 were entered in the multiple logistic regression model. Consequently, a backward stepwise selection method was used to build multiple models that contained the independent variable groups of comorbidities, signs, and symptoms, that were independently associated with mortality. Adjusted ORs with p values of less than 0.05 and 95% CIs were reported for significant variables that were associated with outcomes. Confounding bias was identified as a consequence of the change in OR before and after adjustment for the confounding variable. Adjustment variables were different in each model based on the logic of the confounding role of the variables in the model. Age, sex, ICU, ventilator assistance, and treatment were variables that were used for adjustment in the multiple regression model. Consequently, the treatment was divided into four groups, antibiotics, antiviral, and pneumonia antibiotics protocol by NICE [16] and hydroxychloroquine. Finally, univariate and multiple logistic analysis was performed for the above-mentioned. The level of significance was considered as p < 0.05. The analyses have been done using R version 3.5.2.",

Median age (5-95 interquartile range) for hospitalized, and COVID-19 positive cases were 66(40-86), and 64(40-85), respectively. Females were slightly more than males in both hospitalized and COVID-19 PCR positive patients. Only 36% of pregnant hospitalized patients were PCR positive. The most prevalent comorbidities were CVD, kidney disease, and COPD. The most prevalent signs and symptoms were dyspnea, coughs, and myalgia. These were similar in PCR positive cases. Of patients who were ICU admitted, only 41% were PCR positive. This raised to nearly 48% in ventilator assistance. About 15% of registered patients were deceased, 56% of patients were recovered and 29% were under treatment and about 16% had a severe condition. The mortality rate is higher in diabetic patients comparing to patients with no comorbidities, particularly in younger age groups (13.9% vs 4.5% in under 20 year old, 7.8% vs 3.1% in 20-40 years old, 11% vs 7% in 40-60 years old, and 22.9% vs 20.7% in over 60 years old).

            "text": "COPD with increased mucous production and obstacle of airways can lead to the development of hypoxemia. The inflammatory response, weak immunity, constant mucus production, use of respiratory corticosteroids, and structural damages of air paths are observed in COPD patients [21] which make the outcome of COVID worse when they are associated with diabetes. A study in China reported 50-52.3% of the total ICU admitted COVID-19 cases had COPD [21, 22] . The results of this study show a positive association between COPD and mortality in diabetic patients with COVID-19. Individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities tend to develop a more severe form of COVID-19 resulting in a higher mortality rate [23] . Greater prevalence of cardiovascular diseases among diabetic patients leads to a higher rate of death associated with diabetes. In this study, 43% of diabetic patients suffer from CVD. This comorbidity is significantly higher than the second common comorbidity, kidney disease, with 7.5% of diabetic patients. Underlying comorbidities contribute to worsening the outcome of diabetic patients infected by novel coronavirus COVID-19 and increasing the death rate. The role of some comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and chronic pulmonary disease is so important that the higher mortality rate among diabetic patients is attributed to these factors independently [3] . However, a study reported that the rate of death among diabetic patients remained higher than nondiabetic people after adjustment for cardiovascular comorbidities [8] . Patients with diabetic kidney diseases are more prone to infection complications due to chronic inflammation and subsequent immunosuppression. Also, renal impairment plays a role in developing cardiovascular diseases [24] . Moreover, the novel coronavirus COVID-19 can directly affect the kidneys by cellular injury or sepsis. This may lead to a cytokine storm, as well [25] . The prevalence of these comorbidities among diabetic patients is higher than the general population probably due to the nature of diabetes and consequent complications [19] . Thus, according to our results, more attention must be focused on diabetic patients with kidney disease.",

            "text": "Of note, amid the COVID pandemic, health care utilization has been reduced especially for patients with chronic medical conditions leading to more morbidity and mortality [27] which is parallel with the mortality rate in this study (22%). Diabetes is a complex disease that should be managed continually by health care providers and patients closely [28] which needs health care infrastructures to facilitate patients management during COVID pandemics. According to our results, the high mortality rate of diabetic patients with COVID-19 might raise concerns for policymakers in Iran to improve health care utilization for these patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many efforts have been made to find appropriate and cost-effective available treatments [29, 30] . Despite the higher mortality risk in patients with specific comorbidities, there is still a paucity of information on the potential effects of recommended treatments on the prognosis of COVID-19 in diabetic patients [29, 31] . Due to the anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-viral effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine especially on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, these drugs have been initially approved by the United States food and drug administration (FDA) in treating COVID-19 hospitalized patients [32] . However, subsequent analysis revealed that hydroxychloroquine has no beneficial effects on post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment in COVID-19 [33] . Moreover, several side effects have been reported for hydroxychloroquine e.g. cardiac toxicity including cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and rhythm disturbance, retinopathy, kidney injury, and liver problems [34] . Hydroxychloroquine may also cause hypoglycemia, particularly in patients on insulin or sulfonylureas [2] . Thus, this drug should be used with caution especially in diabetic patients. Despite the several side effects of this drug in diabetic patients as well as the lack of effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment, hydroxychloroquine is widely used in Iran. Our results show that about 30% of COVID-19 positive diabetic patients have been received hydroxychloroquine during their hospitalization. It seems that national COVID-19 treatment guidelines in Iran need to be frequently updated. Moreover, the results of this study reveal that antibiotics have no association with mortality in COVID patients. Also, we have a high-frequency use of high-cost antibiotics like imipenem and vancomycin. Studies reveal a wild range of antibiotic use in COVID patients worldwide [15, 35, 36] . Stewardship based on international guidelines and antibiogram performance [37] is needed to reduce antibiotic resistance in the age of COVID. Furthermore, this will support shrinking the economic burden of COVID-19 on individuals and governments. Although this is a crosssectional registry and the absolute effect of any drug needs setting up clinical trials, but this result could help to develop a hypothesis on antibiotic resistance neglected issues during the COVID pandemic.",

In addition, the registry data included comorbidities such as diabetes, based on self-report as a binary variable. Although, selfreport is acceptable in the field of research, but clinically, it may be responsible for some sort of residual bias which could not be avoided. Moreover, lab data on glycemic control of diabetic patients were not provided in the registry. Future population-based longitudinal studies are needed for resolving these issue.
