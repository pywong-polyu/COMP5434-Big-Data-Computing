Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at particularly high risk of both contracting the disease, and developing severe complications of the infection [2, 3] . In this observational study, we report our experience in managing patients with renal failure and COVID-19, along with the changes in clinical severity and patient outcomes that were observed over the course of the outbreak.",

Initial evaluation included a complete haemogram with neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a basic metabolic profile (including serum glucose, creatinine, sodium and potassium), and serum markers of inflammation [including C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)]. All patients who were assessed to be stable enough to be shifted for chest imaging, underwent computed tomography (CT) of the chest, which was reported as either being suggestive or not suggestive of COVID-19, based on the presence of subpleural groundglass opacities and consolidations. Among the films that were suggestive of COVID-19, the severity was graded based on the percentage of lung involvement (with Grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 corresponding to < 25%, 26-50%, 51-75% and > 75% lung involvement, respectively).",
