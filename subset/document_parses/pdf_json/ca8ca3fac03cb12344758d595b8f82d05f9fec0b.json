This is evident by the plethora of scientific approaches available in the literature that have carefully designed mechanisms to reveal different types of digital manipulations and traces that are expected to be generated during a given tampering process [10] . Producing robust tools for detecting and localizing a specific type of forgery has proven to be challenging, even when testing their effectiveness on benchmark datasets and controlled scenarios [19] and becomes even greater when dealing with real-world scenarios; images are being edited and manipulated in a variety of ways during a single forgery session in order to produce a convincing outcome, and are then forwarded and shared over the Internet, further undergoing transformations (e.g. cropping, re-sizing, re-compression). These uncontrolled factors inevitably force many of the standalone methods to suffer in terms of detection accuracy and localization robustness, presenting noisy outcomes and higher false positive rates when applied to new datasets [3, 9, 19] . Thus, researchers have come to realise that there is a true benefit in acquiring different reports from independent tools and evaluating the multiple clues in conjunction in the context of blind/passive image forensics (i.e. forensic analysis where prior knowledge regarding the original capturing circumstances, the manipulations or other post processing transformations is unknown) [7, 9, 12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 355, "end": 359, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 556, "end": 560, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1128, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1131, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1135, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1525, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1528, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1532, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Several fusion approaches have been proposed in the literature, aiming at a synergistic analysis that improves the overall robustness and reliability of the forensic report.

In parallel, the candidate methods are undergoing a set of evaluation experiments on diverse datasets so as to assess their effectiveness in terms of tampering detection, localization and output readability. For that matter, we utilized the large volume of experiments we conducted in [19] and in [8] as a guide for the selection of the most effective methods. In [19] we evaluated 14 established state-of-the-art methods for image splicing localization that cover the full spectrum of known tampering traces.

The experiments were performed on three publicly available datasets 1 , including both synthetic and real-world tampering cases while their performance robustness when input images are subjected to common post-processing operations was also investigated. Through these evaluations, summarised in Fig. 2 , we were able to assess, rank and correlate their classification ability and overall performance over a wide spectrum of cases and conditions.

The First IFS-TC Image Forensics Challenge training set [1], contains 450 usersubmitted forgeries and was designed to serve as a realistic benchmark. Focusing on splicing tampering localization, we excluded cases that were produced by copy-move operations resulting in a set of 306 forgery cases produced through spicing operations only. Tampered images in this dataset are accompanied by Ground Truth (GT) maps. The second dataset is the CASIA V2.0 dataset [2] that contains 5,123 realistically tampered color images of varying sizes. During the tampering process post-processing of spliced boundary regions is also considered. This dataset does not come with GT maps. In order for us to be able to perform localization tests, we manually produced 2, 195 reliable GT maps through semi-automated procedures involving image differencing, thresholding and morphological operations. In experiments that follow, when we refer to the CASIA2 dataset we only account for the 2,195 images for which we produced GT binary maps 2 . The overall localization quality and output readability is based on the pixelwise agreement between the reference mask (GT) and the produced tampering localization heat map and it is measured in terms of the achieved F-score (F1). This evaluation methodology requires the output maps to be thresholded prior to any evaluation. To this end, we first normalize all maps in the [0, 1] range and proceed by successively shifting the binarization threshold by 0.05 increments, calculating the achieved F1 score for every step. Figure 5 presents the mean F1 scores curves per binarizarion step over the Challenge and CASIA2 collection for the outputs of each individual method along with the fused output. The achieved localization is evaluated by the maximum mean F1 score for each method, at its respective best performing binarization threshold ( Table 2 ). Table 2 . Best mean F1 score and binarization range that allows F1 to remain high (> 70% of respective maximum F1 score) and reported detections for F1 score >= 0.7 at each method's best binarization threshold for Challenge and CASIA2 datasets. As an indicator of a method's output interpretability we consider the range of the binarization threshold values, where the achieved F1 remains high (>0.7 of the best reported score). A wide range suggests that the tampered and untampered image regions are characterized by significantly different values in the output maps making the respective heat map easy to interpret. Table 2 also reports the best localized detections achieved per method. The detection threshold was set to 0.7 and the search was performed for the best binarization step for each method. Unique Localizations corresponds to the number of detections exclusively achieved by that method. From the experimental results in both datasets we can see that the fused output heat maps achieve high F1 scores over a wide range of thresholds. This verifies that the method produces outputs that exhibit increased localization ability and interpretability. In the Challenge dataset, the next best method (NOI3) achieves similar localization scores but is somewhat worse in terms of interpretability, while all other methods achieve significantly lower F1 scores. In CASIA2, the fusion method is the second best performing method in terms of F1 scores, while it still presents the best interpretability with F1 scores remaining high for a wider range of binarization steps. DCT, which is the leading method in this dataset, is significantly outperforming the rest of the individual methods, which is probably due to the tampering process followed in this specific dataset. The fusion framework manages to produce outputs that generally localize tampering better than most of the individual methods ( Fig. 5(b) ) but, in its current state, does not take full advantage of the very good DCT localizations in building its final output. Instead, while trying to construct hybrid outputs with low risk by collectively examining the various outputs and not heavily relying on only one method, the good DCT localizations were undermined by the many unsuccessful localizations of other methods.
