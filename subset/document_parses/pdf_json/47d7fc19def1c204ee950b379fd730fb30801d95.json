Considering aerosol transmission, although some studies show the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols, with lower values in isolated negatively pressurized rooms with high air exchange rate, and higher values in small rooms without ventilation (e.g. patient's toilet) [9] , there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is spread by airborne route [10] . However, it is reported how some procedures produce aerosol with different risks of aerosolization [10] : bronchoscopy, percutaneous tracheostomy and cardiopulmonary resuscitation have an estimated extreme risk of aerosol generation; suctioning, and extubation have a high estimated risk of aerosol generation, while oxygen facemasks, high-flow cannula, non-invasive ventilation and nebulizers have a high to moderate risk [10] .",

            "text": "The different prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HW in the different countries may be explained by several factors. For example, by the different prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population, the different IPC procedures and positive tracking protocol used. Moreover, different seems to be the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HW compared to that observe during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) epidemics. In fact, HWs accounted for a large proportion of persons with SARS during the worldwide epidemic of early 2003, accounting for 21% of over 8000 known cases reported from 33 countries in 5 continents [31] . As regards MERS, the majority of cases were registered in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Republic of Korea [32] [33] [34] . In Saudi Arabia, 19 .1% of all cases of MERS reported from January 2013 to November 2019 were HWs [35] . As of 5 April 2020, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 241 COVID-19 cases in HWs, 101 infected at work, among a total of 10 062 COVID-19 cases, suggesting a less rate of COVID-19 infection in HWs comparing to that observed for MERS (2.4% vs 21%) [36] . They attribute this lower rate of infection despite an higher reproductive number (R 0 ) ranging from 2 to 5.7 for SARS-CoV-2 to < 1 for MERS, to a better management of suspected patients and the management of COVID-19, the widely use of PCR test, implementation of contact tracking, the implementation of epidemiological team, the training in good practices and the proper use of PPE including, the practice of wearing mask both in hospital staff and visitors [36] . However, the cases reported among healthcare professionals are not always the expression of occupational exposure. For example, in a study [37] carried out in the Netherlands in nine hospitals from 6 to 8 March 2020, a total of 1097 HWs without a known epidemiological link for professional COVID-19 exposure (close contact with confirmed case) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 45 (4.1%) were found positive. A Spanish study [38] conducted in a large public hospital in March 2020 found a rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 38% of HWs tested and 11.6% in all hospital workers; interestingly, no significant difference in the SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed between HWs from high-risk areas involved in close contact with COVID-19 patients and clerical, administrative or laboratory personnel without direct contact with patients. Similarly, the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust screened staff with compatible symptoms (i.e., new continuous cough or fever) and found no difference in SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates between non-clinical staff (e.g., clerical, administrative, information technology, secretarial, etc.) and frontline staff (e.g., nurses, doctors, allied healthcare professionals, porters, etc.) [39] . These results seem to suggest that several infections of HWs may be related to household or community contacts during the early phase of local spread and that the current isolation protocols and PPE appear sufficient to prevent high levels of nosocomial transmission to frontline staff [39] .",

A low-risk exposure was defined as a HW wearing the recommended PPE.

However, knowing the extent of viral environmental contamination in COVID-19 wards is critical for improving safety practices and risk assessment for medical staff. Guo et al. [40] in a study conducted in Wuhan, China, analyzed air and surface samples of intensive care units (ICU) and general wards (GW). The authors found the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity much higher for the ICU than for the GW (43.5% vs 7.9%); in particular, the rate of positivity was relatively high for floor swab samples (70% vs 15.4%), suggesting that medical staff should perform stricter protective measures of infection control, such as disinfection of shoe soles before walking out of wards containing COVID-19 patients. The same authors assessed the risk for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 collecting air in the isolation ward of the ICU (12 air supplies and 16 air discharges per hour) and GW (8 air supplies and 12 air discharges per hour) and obtained positive test results for 35% of ICU samples and 12.5% of GW samples.",

Regarding this point, we underscore that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to a wide range of clinical presentations, from an asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic form, which may be present in up to 85%, to a severe acute respiratory syndrome [49] . In a study of COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in a skilled nursing facility in Washington, USA, more than half (56%) of the residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission [7] .

The advantages of serological tests are that they are not very expensive, have easy collection sampling, use widely used techniques for all serological tests and do not need infrastructure, with rapid results for rapid serological tests. Thus, the rapid serological tests may be considered in active surveillance of HWs as an adding value tool. However, antibody responses to infection take days to weeks to be reliably detectable [53] . Therefore, negative results would not exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly among those with recent exposure to the virus [54] . The sensitivity of the rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody test varies in different studies [55, 56] . Li Z et al. [55] collected blood samples from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at eight different clinical sites and found an overall testing sensitivity of 88.7% and specificity of 90.6%.

Surveillance is recommended for all HWs who are exposed to patients meeting the case definition for SARS-CoV-2, with the aim of identifying the occurrence of compatible symptoms and for infection control purposes to further limit in-hospital transmission clinical surveillance with fever/symptom assessment may lack information from asymptomatic/presymptomatic HWs. For this reason, it is reasonable that all exposed HWs are subjected, in addition to clinical monitoring, to microbiological surveillance using a swab or serological test, evaluating the pros and cons of the different methods according to the different settings.
