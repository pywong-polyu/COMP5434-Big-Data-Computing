Circularization of RNA has been demonstrated as a means to improve persistence, however simple and scalable approaches to achieve this are lacking. Utilizing autocatalytic RNA circularization, here we engineer in situ circularized RNAs (icRNAs). This approach enables icRNA delivery as simple linear RNA that is circularized upon delivery into the cell, thus making them compatible with routine synthesis, purification, and delivery formulations. We confirmed extensive protein translation from icRNAs both in vitro and in vivo and explored their utility in three contexts: first, we delivered the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike protein in vivo as icRNAs and showed corresponding induction of humoral immune responses; second, we demonstrated robust genome targeting via zinc finger nucleases delivered as icRNAs; and third, to enable compatibility between persistence of expression and immunogenicity, we developed a novel long range multiplexed (LORAX) protein engineering methodology to screen progressively deimmunized Cas9 proteins, and demonstrated efficient genome and epigenome targeting via their delivery as icRNAs.",

The primary approach for generating these was via delivery of encoding DNA molecules where the guide RNAs were expressed using pol-III promoters, and thereby were both generated and circularized in cells. However, we also made the observation that in vitro transcribed RNAs delivered in linear form could successfully circularize in situ in cells upon entry and were similarly functional as guide RNAs. Motivated by the extreme simplicity of this latter approach, and its compatibility with routine in vitro synthesis and purification processes, we explored if this framework could also be used to generate circular messenger RNAs. Indeed, we show below that thus engineered in situ circularized RNAs (icRNAs) enable extensive protein translation, and we demonstrate their versatility via a range of in vitro and in vivo applications spanning from RNA vaccines to genome and epigenome targeting.",

Although for some applications, such as vaccines, robust immune responses to the therapeutic are desirable, for other applications such as genome and epigenome targeting, immune responses can instead inhibit therapeutic effect. Inducing immune responses through RNA delivery has been extensively 2 researched in vaccine development and proven through the success of COVID vaccines based on this technology (16) (17) (18) (19) . However, despite substantial engineering efforts, deimmunization remains a tougher problem to crack. Thus, to facilitate compatibility between persistence of expression and immunogenicity especially when delivering non-human payloads via icRNAs, we also concurrently developed a long-range multiplexed (LORAX) protein engineering methodology based on high-throughput screening of combinatorially deimmunized protein variants. We applied it to identify a Cas9 variant with seven key HLA-restricted epitopes simultaneously immunosilenced after a single round of screening, and showed that icRNA mediated delivery of the same enabled robust genome targeting.",

We observed similar amounts of GFP RNA at 6 hours (Figure 1b, left panel) , confirming that approximately equal quantities of icRNA and icdRNA were delivered to cells. However, GFP RNA with functional circularization was significantly higher at days 1, 2, and 3 than icdRNA, indicating improved RNA persistence via circularization (Figure 1b, middle   panel) . This improved RNA persistence also correlated with increased GFP translation after 3 days (Figure 1b, right panel) . To confirm icRNAs were covalently circularized in cells upon delivery in vitro, we performed via RT-PCR by designing outward facing primers that selectively amplified only the circularized RNA molecules. Indeed, we only 3 observed a PCR product for icRNAs, confirming circularization (Figure 1c) . Next, to extend these results in vivo, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (22, 23) containing circular icRNA and linear icdRNA were generated. No difference in LNP size was observed between icRNA and icdRNA (Supplementary Figure 1a) . 10 \u00b5g of LNPs were retro-orbitally injected into C57BL/6 mice, livers were isolated 3 and 7 days later, and RNA was extracted. RT-PCR confirmed circularization of icRNA in vivo, with persistence extending to at least 7 days (Supplementary Figure 1b) . Finally, we screened a panel of IRES sequences, ligation stems, and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) to optimize protein translation (Supplementary Figure 1c ) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) .

As deimmunizing protein engineering seeks to alter the amino acid sequence of a protein without disrupting functionality, it is extremely useful to narrow down mutations to those less likely to result in non-functional variants. To identify these mutants we generated large alignments of Cas9 orthologs from publicly available data to identify low-frequency SNPs that have been observed in natural environments. Such variants are likely to have limited effect on protein function, as highly deleterious alleles would tend to be quickly selected out of natural populations (if Cas9 activity is under purifying selection) and therefore not appear in sequencing data (38) . To further subset these candidate mutations, we evaluated for immunogenicity in silico using the netMHC epitope prediction software (39, 40) , in order to determine to what degree the candidate mutations are likely to result in the deimmunization of the most immunogenic epitopes in 5 which they appear. This is a critical step as many mutations may have little effect on overall immunogenicity. Screening for decreased peptide-MHC class I binding filters out amino acid substitutions which are likely immune-neutral, substantially increasing the likelihood of functional hits with enough epitope variation to evade immune induction (41, 42) .",

This circumvents the limit of short target regions and obviates the need for barcodes altogether by single-molecule sequencing of the entire target gene, enabling library design strategies which can explore any region of the protein in combination with any other region without any complicated cloning procedures required to facilitate barcoding. To date, the adoption of nanopore sequencing has been limited by its high error rate, around 95% accuracy per DNA base (43) , as compared to established short read techniques which are multiple orders of magnitude more accurate. To address this challenge, we designed our libraries such that each variant we engineered would have multiple nucleotide changes for each single target amino acid change, effectively increasing the sensitivity of nanopore based readouts with increasing numbers of nucleotide changes per library member. The large majority of amino acid substitutions are amenable to a library design paradigm in which each substitution is encoded by two, rather than one, nucleotide changes, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code and the highly permissive third \"wobble\" position of codons.",

We then predicted the overall effect of mutating the top epitopes in several Cas9 orthologs (Supplementary Figure 2a) . As might be expected, this analysis suggests that single-epitope strategies are woefully inadequate to deimmunize a whole protein for multiple HLA types, and also that there are diminishing returns as more and more epitopes are deimmunized. Our analysis suggests that it may require on the order of tens of deimmunized epitopes to make a significant impact on overall, population-wide protein immunogenicity. The scale of engineering demanded by these immunological facts has previously been intractable, but by applying LORAX we conjectured one could now make substantial steps, several mutations at a time, through the mutational landscape of the Cas9 protein.",

To do this we hypothesized that the fitness landscape of the screen mutants is likely to be smooth, i.e. variants that contain similar mutations are more likely to have similar fitnesses in terms of editing efficiency compared to randomly selected pairs (47) . We confirmed this by computing a predicted screen score for each variant based on a weighted regression of its nearest neighbors in the screen. This metric correlates well with the actual screen scores and approaches the screen scores even more closely as read coverage increases. This provides good evidence that the fitness landscape is indeed somewhat smooth (Supplementary Figure 3a) . Next, we reasoned that because the fitness landscape is smooth, real hits should reside in broad fitness peaks which include many neighbors that also show high screen scores, whereas hits that are less supported by near neighbors are more likely to be spurious as they represent non-smooth fitness peaks. Formalizing this logic, we performed a network analysis to differentiate noise-driven hits from bona fide hits by looking at the degree of connectivity with other hits (Figure 2d ).",

Interestingly, we discovered another deimmunizing mutation within the same epitope, L622Q, which similarly retains Cas9 functionality, but appears to be more epistatically permissive, as many of our multi-mutation hits combine this mutation with other deimmunized epitopes. From these multi-mutation hits we chose V4, which demonstrated high editing capability while still bearing simultaneous mutations across seven distinct epitopes, as well as family members V3, a variant bearing two mutations, and V5, a variant bearing the seven changes from V4 plus one additional mutation.

Naturally, library design is of critical importance. Here we have leveraged several features such as Cas9 evolutionary diversity, MHC-binding predictions, HLA allele frequencies, and calculated immunogenicity scores to generate a useful library of variants to test. Other approaches may bring in more sources of information from places like protein structure (59) Looking ahead, in addition to its core utility in applications entailing transgene delivery, we anticipate that icRNAs will be particularly useful in scenarios where a longer duration pulse of protein production is required. These include, for instance, epigenome engineering and cellular reprogramming, as well as transient healing and rejuvenation applications.

Alleles with greater than 0.001% frequency in the global population, or those with greater than 0.01% in any region, were included for further analysis and predictions. 29 Immunogenicity scores: The vector of predicted nM affinities output by netMHC were first normalized across alleles to account for the fact that some alleles have higher affinity across all peptides, and to allow for the relatively equivalent contribution of all alleles. These values were then transformed using the 1-log(affinity) transformation also borrowed from netMHC such that lower nM affinities will result in larger resulting values.",

Combining these in all possible combinations yields a library of 1,492,992 unique elements. With this design, we then constructed the library in a stepwise process. First, the full-length gene was broken up into short blocks of no more than 1000 bp, which overlap by 30 bp on each end. Each block is designed such that it contains no more than 4 target epitopes to mutagenize. With few epitopes per block and few variant mutations per epitope, it becomes feasible to chemically synthesize each combination of mutations for each block. Each of these combinations was then synthesized and mixed at equal ratios to make a degenerate block mix. This was repeated for each of the blocks necessary to complete the full-length protein sequence. Oxford Nanopore (ONT) MinION sequencing confirmed the majority of the pre-screened library consists of Cas9 sequences with significant numbers of mutations, with most falling into a broad peak between 6 and 14 mutations per sequence, each of which knocking out a key immunogenic epitope(Supplementary Figure 2c).To identify functional variants still capable of editing DNA, we next designed and carried out a positive selection screen targeting the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) gene(45). In the context of the screen, HPRT1 converts 6-thioguanine (6TG), an analogue of the DNA base guanine, into 6-thioguanine nucleotides that are cytotoxic to cells via incorporation into the DNA during S-phase(46). Thus, only cells containing functional Cas9 variants capable of disrupting the HPRT1 gene can survive in 6TG-containing cell culture media. To first identify the optimal 6TG concentration, HeLa cells were transduced with lentivirus particles containing wild-type Cas9 and either a HPRT1-targeting guide RNA (gRNA) or a non-targeting guide. After selection with puromycin, cells were treated with 6TG concentrations ranging from 0-14 \u00b5g/mL for oneweek. Cells were stained with crystal violet at the end of the experiment and imaged. 6 \u00b5g/mL was selected as all cells containing non-targeting guide had died while cells containing the HPRT1 guide remained viable(Supplementary Figure 2b).To perform the screen, replicate populations of HeLa cells were transduced with lentiviral particles containing the variant SpCas9 library along with the HPRT1-targeting gRNA at 0.3 MOI and at greater than 75-fold coverage of the library elements. Cells were selected using puromycin after two days and 6TG was added once cells reached 75% confluency. After two weeks, genomic DNA was extracted from remaining cells and full-length Cas9 amplicons were nanopore sequenced on the MinION platform.",

CRISPRoff represents one of the newest additions to the CRISPR toolbox with the exciting capability to permanently silence gene expression upon transient expression(50). We conjectured that wtCas9 and CRISPRoff would represent exciting applications of icRNAs for hit-and-run genome and epigenome targeting, as the prolonged persistence could potentially boost targeting, while the use of partially deimmunized Cas9 proteins would enable greater safety in therapeutic contexts.
