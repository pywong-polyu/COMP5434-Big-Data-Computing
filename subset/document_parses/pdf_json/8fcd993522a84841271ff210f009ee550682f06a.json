            "text": "Major stressors often challenge emotional well-being-increasing negative emotions and decreasing positive emotions. But how long do these emotional hits last? Prior theory and research contain conflicting views. Some research suggests that most individuals' emotional well-being will return to, or even surpass, baseline levels relatively quickly. Others have challenged this view, arguing that this type of resilient response is uncommon. The present research provides a strong test of resilience theory by examining emotional trajectories over the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In two pre-registered longitudinal studies (total N =1147), we examined average emotional trajectories and predictors of individual differences in emotional trajectories across 13 waves of data from February through September 2020. The pandemic had immediate detrimental effects on average emotional well-being. Across the next 6 months, average negative emotions returned to baseline levels with the greatest improvements occurring almost immediately. Yet, positive emotions remained depleted relative to baseline levels, illustrating the limits of typical resilience. Individuals differed substantially around these average emotional trajectories and these individual differences were predicted by socio-demographic characteristics and stressor exposure. We discuss theoretical implications of these findings that we hope will contribute to more nuanced approaches to studying, understanding, and improving emotional well-being following major stressors.",

If these emotional hits are shortlived, they are unlikely to cause lasting harm. However, sustained periods of high negative emotion and low positive emotion are likely to harm health, putting individuals at risk for mental health problems and physical illness (for reviews, see Boehm, 2018; Kring & Bachorowski, 1999) . This leads to the question: is fast and complete emotional recovery following a major stressor the exception or the norm? Some resilience theorists suggest that adaptation is nearly universal, arguing that the most common outcome following major stressors is a stable trajectory of healthy functioning (Bonanno et al., 2011) . However, findings supporting this view depend heavily on data analytic decisions and stringent statistical assumptions (e.g., how variance is modeled within and across resilience trajectories) (Infurna & Luthar, 2016 , 2018 , leaving open questions about average emotional responses to major stressors. Regardless of the average response, there are likely substantial individual differences in how people's emotions respond following major stressors. For example, some individuals may demonstrate resilience, with many others experiencing sustained periods of high negative emotions and low positive emotions.",

To investigate average emotional responses to this global stressor, we examined change in emotions at the onset of the pandemic and how quickly and completely emotions recovered across 6 months. To investigate individual differences in emotional responses, we examined sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, racial and ethnic identity) and exposure to specific stressors (e.g., financial stress, frontline worker status) as predictors of individual differences in emotional trajectories.

The concept of resilience originated in developmental literature, following the observation that some children adjusted unexpectedly well despite experiencing significant adversity (see Luthar, 2006 for a review). In the past 20 years, resilience in adults has been investigated in the context of bereavement (Bonanno et al., 2005) , major life events such as divorce and job loss (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2011) , physical disease (e.g., Johnston et al., 2015) , and traumatic events such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters (Bonanno et al., 2006; Reich, 2006) . Resilience has been observed in response to many different types of stressful events, but also for various kinds of health and well-being outcomes, including emotional well-being. Much of this prior research suggests that resilience following major stressors is common (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2011) ; however, this finding has been shown to depend heavily on data analytic decisions (Infurna & Luthar, 2016 , 2018 , highlighting the need for additional research on average responses to stress.",

For example, research shows substantial individual differences in the degree and rate of change in well-being following major life events (Fujita & Diener, 2005; Lucas et al., 2003) . Identifying predictors of these individual differences can inform who is in greatest need of societal support, as well as the specific risk and protective factors that may be useful targets of interventions to promote emotional well-being. Research on such risk and protective factors suggests that responses to stress are multiply determined by a combination of person-level and societallevel factors (Bonanno, 2004; Hart et al., 2016; Zautra et al., 2008) . Here, we focus on socio-demographic and stressor exposure predictors of emotional responses, rather than individual-level factors such as personality and emotion regulation. Given the broad scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that the former set of factors affords the greatest opportunity to increase support for the most impacted groups and to reduce the most impactful stressor exposures to promote resilience on a large scale.",

Meta-analytic estimates suggest that these characteristics are protective factors for post-traumatic stress disorder following loss and trauma (Brewin et al., 2000) . Consistent with these metaanalytic findings, these same socio-demographic characteristics predicted resilience (i.e., few or no symptoms of psychopathology) in New Yorkers following the 9/11 terrorist attacks (Bonanno et al., 2007) and Floridians following the 2004 Florida hurricanes (Acierno et al., 2006) . Gender and age are also associated with mood disorder prevalence more generally (Christensen et al., 1999; Girgus & Yang, 2015) and may predispose individuals to lower emotional well-being in response to stressful events. Additionally, social class may influence whether individuals have the resources necessary to respond to major stressors, and in turn, maintain emotional well-being (Murrell & Norris, 1983) . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, racial and ethnic identity and political affiliation may also impact resilience, given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic minority individuals and communities (Millett et al., 2020; Tessler et al., 2020) and different responses to the pandemic across political parties (Collins et al., 2020) .",

Consistent with these concerns, initial declines in mental health and emotional well-being were observed at the beginning of the pandemic (Twenge & Joiner, 2020; Xiong et al., 2020) . Initial evidence suggests older adults, men, and employed individuals tended to report better mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other groups (Xiong et al., 2020) .

However, initial reports from a large-scale longitudinal study spanning multiple countries suggest that \"distress\" was lower 3 months into the pandemic compared to the beginning of the pandemic (Slatcher, 2020) . These findings may be explained by differences in the samples used and outcomes assessed, but they may also be due to differences in initial emotional responses to the pandemic relative to patterns of recovery across time. To distinguish between initial changes in emotional well-being and rates of decline or recovery across time, it is necessary to compare negative and positive emotions before the pandemic (i.e., baseline levels) to negative and positive emotions during the pandemic across multiple timepoints spanning at least several months.",

We adopted a continuous and descriptive approach to quantifying individual differences in emotional responses, rather than categorizing individuals as \"resilient\" or \"not resilient.\" The results of such categorical approaches are heavily dependent on specific data analytics decisions and do not take into account important nuances in individuals' responses to stressors (Infurna & Luthar, 2016) . For example, individuals may experience relatively faster or slower rates of recovery across time or may experience resilience for one outcome (e.g., negative emotions), but not for another outcome (e.g., positive emotions) (Hart et al., 2016; Infurna & Luthar, 2018) . Next, we examined socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, social class, racial and ethnic identity, and political affiliation) and the experience of specific stressors (i.e., financial stress, frontline worker status, loss of childcare, COVID-19-related restrictions) as predictors of individual differences in emotional responses. Together, findings from the present research will address debates about whether resilience is the exception or the norm and will inform interventions to improve emotional well-being in the face of exposure to major stressors.",

If we used an uncorrected alpha level of .05, we would expect approximately 20 false positive findings, making it difficult to differentiate true effects from false positives. At the same time, we also wanted to limit the number of false negatives, given the risks associated with missing important risk and protective factors. To address both issues, we preregistered that we would use False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction to interpret statistical significance (Benjamini & Liu, 1999) . FDR correction compares the largest p value to the set alpha level (i.e., .05) and then compares each descending p value to an increasingly smaller alpha level. FDR correction applies a less stringent Type 1 (false positive) control than family-wise error controls (such as Bonferroni corrections) by limiting the total number of Type 1 errors relative to significant effects, rather than limiting the probability of at least one Type 1 error. We selected the critical p value from each test (e.g., the effect of time squared in quadratic models; the interaction term in moderation models) and applied FDR correction to the 18 p values within each sample in Aim 1 and the 180 p values within each sample in Aim 2. The p values from sensitivity analyses were not included in the correction procedure. In addition, we report uncorrected p values and 95% confidence intervals for all results. Effects that do not reach statistical significance but have uncorrected p values under the traditional alpha level of .05 (95% CIs that do not contain 0) are considered suggestive and warrant further study.",

A better question might be: Is resilience the exception or the norm for a given outcome of interest in a given context? On average, people demonstrated resilience when considering negative, but not positive, emotions in general. After an initial increase in negative emotions in general, negative emotions decreased across 6 months with the greatest improvements happening almost immediately. Interestingly, this initial period of elevated negative emotion occurred during the period of time in which the U.S. issued nationwide guidance to stay at home to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (mid-March, 2020 through April 30, 2020 . This suggests that the initial elevation in negative emotion may have been relieved upon the lifting of the stay-at-home guidance.

This pattern was driven by a greater initial decrease in positive emotions at the onset of the pandemic; the rate of recovery for average negative and positive emotions was comparable. In other words, on average, individuals simply lost more positive emotions and in turn, had more positive emotions to recover in order to return to baseline levels. This initial steep decline in average positive emotions may have been driven in part by a steep drop-off in close social contact, a common source of positive emotion, as individuals were encouraged to maintain social distance from anyone outside of their household (CDC, 2020). The observed asymmetrical pattern of results for negative compared to positive emotion is consistent with prior work in other stressful contexts. For example, prior research considering the bereavement context has found that negative versus positive emotion are differentially predicted (Moskowitz et al., 1996) , further suggesting that negative and positive emotions do not simply reflect opposite ends of a single dimension in the context of recovery from major stressors. This asymmetry is also consistent with a recent review of resilience research which found that when multiple outcomes were assessed, patterns of resilience tended to differ across those outcomes (Infurna & Luthar, 2018) .",

In the present research, we examined two important aspects of stress responses, positive and negative emotions about COVID-19, as well as two important aspects of well-being, positive and negative emotions in general, providing a tractable starting point. Future research should directly compare patterns of resilience for other important outcomes, such as life satisfaction, psychological well-being, mental health symptomatology, and relational and occupational functioning.

In particular, the range and magnitude of individual differences in emotional responses to stress suggests that broad claims that resilience is \"ubiquitous\" or \"rare\" may not be useful.

In the present investigation, we used random effect growth curve models. This approach disentangles individual differences in level of the outcome variable (i.e., random intercepts) from individual differences in the direction and rate of change in the outcome variable (i.e., random slopes). Alternatively, growth mixture models provide a means of categorizing individuals into one of several groups that differ according to level and direction and rate of change in the outcome variable. This latter approach allows for succinct summaries of individual differences, but at the cost of over-simplifying the continuous nature of individual differences in resilience. Results of such categorical approaches are highly dependent on data analytic decisions and assumptions (Infurna & Luthar, 2016) and often result in illusory subgroups that do not reflect natural subgroups or do not replicate (Bauer, 2007) . Thus, resilience research would benefit from new approaches to characterizing individual differences that appreciate their continuous nature, consider the myriad of ways that individuals can differ (see points a-e in the previous paragraph), and allow for meaningful and easily interpretable summaries. Idiographic approaches may be particularly wellsuited, given that they do not impose group-level assumptions and instead allow individuals to differ on all characteristics of their trajectories (see Conner et al., 2009 ).",

Societal contexts influence who is exposed to particular stressors and who has access to resources to deal with that stressor exposure, both of which are likely to influence responses to stress. In turn, these aspects of the societal context reflect actionable targets for interventions to promote resilience at a large scale. For example, in the present research, individual differences in emotional responses were predicted by specific types of stressor exposure and socio-demographic characteristics. When considering specific types of stressor exposure, individuals who experienced financial stress tended to report higher levels of negative emotion and lower levels of positive emotion. Inequities in the types of jobs that were lost during the pandemic (Parker et al., 2020) influence who experiences financial stressors and in turn, who experiences declines in emotional well-being. Moreover, pre-existing economic inequalities influence the resources that individuals have to deal with financial stressors, and in turn, have the potential to influence patterns of emotional responses.",

In the present research, African and African American individuals, women, and individuals who identify as lower social class tended to report worse emotional well-being during the pandemic, even when adjusting for baseline levels. The lower levels of average emotional wellbeing observed for these groups are likely driven in part by the exacerbation of existing inequities (Bowleg, 2020; Warren & Bordoloi, 2020) , as well as the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 for particular groups, such as Black and African American individuals (Millett et al., 2020) , women (Madgavkar et al., 2020) , and women of color in particular (Madgavkar et al., 2020) . Interventions to increase resilience should focus on addressing these inequities, rather than simply influencing individuals' responses to them. This can be achieved and strengthened with a social justice approach, as described by Hart et al. (2016) .",

First, we used two samples from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) that were recruited to be diverse with respect to racial and ethnic identity (Sample A) and political affiliation (Sample B). This sampling approach allowed for time-sensitive data collection, beginning before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, and to have large enough group sizes to test for the effects of racial and ethnic identity and political affiliation, among other socio-demographic characteristics. However, this sampling approach means that the present samples were not nationally representative and were limited to MTurk users, who are representative of the general population for many but not all psychosocial characteristics (McCredie & Morey, 2019) .",

Several aspects of this context and time period should be considered when drawing conclusions from the present results. Specifically, the pandemic persisted across the study period and as a result, the specific characteristics of the stressor also evolved across the study period. Although we partially addressed this in our analyses by including timevarying predictors for local pandemic-related restrictions, we were not able to fully account for changing features of the pandemic context. In addition to the evolving pandemic context, the present study cannot fully disentangle pandemic effects from effects of other events during the same time period. The pandemic context also differs from previous investigations of resilience in important ways, and these differences should be considered when comparing the present results to these prior studies. Specifically, everyone in the population was exposed to the pandemic at least to some extent, whereas most prior investigations of resilience have focused on subsets of individuals within the population who were exposed to a specific unshared stressor.",

We believe that findings from the present research offer important insights about emotional responses to stress that can be generalized beyond the pandemic context. First, emotional resilience was observed on average for negative emotions but not for positive emotions, suggesting that resilience for one outcome does not necessarily imply resilience for all outcomes. Second, individual differences in emotional responses to stress were large and complex, suggesting that broad claims that resilience is either \"ubiquitous\" or \"rare\" may be overstated. Third, individual differences in emotional responses to stress were multiply determined and should be considered within the larger societal contexts in which they are embedded. We hope that these insights contribute to more nuanced approaches to studying, understanding, and improving emotional well-being following major stressors.",

At T1 in Sample B, participants rated their emotions in general during the past two, rather than four, weeks. 2. At T1 in Sample B, response options ranged from 1 to 7 instead of 0-6. One was subtracted from each composite score so that the resulting variable was on the same 0-6 scale as the other timepoints. 3. Social positive emotions (i.e., \"love, closeness, trust,\" \"inspired, uplifted, elevated,\" and \"grateful, appreciative, thankful\") were introduced beginning at T1b in Sample A and beginning at T2 in Sample B. Because social positive emotions were not assessed at baseline (T1), we examined them separately from general positive emotions and report results in the Supplementary Online Materials. 4. We also tested quadratic effects of age, based on a reviewer's recommendation. There were no statistically significant quadratic effects of age on emotion levels or change, ps > .202. 5. This analysis was not pre-registered. 6. The random effect of quadratic time was dropped from one trajectory model to achieve convergence. 7. In addition to testing effects of stressor exposure variables on emotion levels, we also tested lagged effects of stressor exposure variables at one timepoint predicting emotions at the next timepoint, based on a reviewer's recommendation. For each type of stressor exposure, we included person-mean stressor exposure and lagged person-centered stressor exposure into a random-intercept random-slope multilevel model predicting emotions. We dropped the random slope from several models to achieve model convergence. We did not observe any replicable lagged effects. In Sample A, living under a shelter-in-place order predicted higher positive emotions about COVID-19 at the next timepoint (b = 0.26, p = .005) and lower negative emotions about COVID-19 at the next timepoint (b = -0.20, p = .013); Also in Sample A, more restrictions predicted higher positive emotions about COVID-19 at the next timepoint (b = 0.06, p = .012). In Sample B, loss of childcare predicted higher positive emotions in general at the next timepoint (b = 0.31, p = .001).",
