Optical properties used in Monte Carlo simulations are extracted from previous work 47, 53 Analyses of the performance of commercial systems and functionality of arterial PPG must account for factors of skin tone and physiological changes with the development of obesity 26-28 .

This is a single slice in the three-dimensional geometry at a single location of the pulse waves. Figure 4C shows an example of PPG waveform generated for the non-obese case. The returned signal is comprised of an AC and a DC baseline signal, where the AC signal represents the pulsatility of the vasculature. A comparison of the AC to DC signal ratio of each waveform shows the degradation of the signal with increasing BMI. Different PPG signals are generated through varying four different physiological changes observed with obesity. These changes can be seen in Table 2 . Preliminary experimental data using the PPG sensor ( Figure 5) shows features similar to that seen in simulation curve. The PPG of three different individuals was captured experimentally ( Figure 5A ). There is significant variation between individuals ( Figure 5A green, red, blue), however the features of the shape can be identified in all three cases. The PPG data is adjusted from pulse shape in time to PPG with respect to pulse position ( Figure 5B, 5C ). This is done by matching the start and end point of the two sets as well as the primary peak and overlay on top of each other. Figure 6 shows changes AC/DC signal from four different changes attributed to obesity across different BMI levels. Figure 6A shows a 14.0% total signal decline associated with changes to trans-epidermal water loss between normal to highest BMI level. Figure 6B shows an 18.0% change with dermal blood content. Figure 6C shows total percentage change between smallest and largest dermal thickness is 41.4%. In Figure 6D , percentage change between shallowest and deepest arterial depth is 32.1%. Similar trends of signal degradation are seen across the four different changes which occur with obesity: trans-epidermal water loss, blood perfusion, dermal thickness, and radial artery depth. Each scenario shows changes isolated to each feature of obesity. Figure 7 highlights changes seen at four different skin tones classified by epidermal melanin concentration. Total AC to DC signal ratio change is seen at 17.1% between 3% epidermal melanin concentration and 42% epidermal melanin concentration. Waveforms for different levels of obesity are generated through varying the combined dermal thickness and arterial depth to indicate corresponding physiological changes. Figure 8 shows generated waveforms at non-obese, obese 1, obese 2 and obese 3 at two different photon counts. Changes to BMI and obesity level is presented through the increase of dermal thickness from 1.0mm to 2.5mm and arterial depth from 2.5mm to 4.5mm. A comparison of the waveform shows the degradation of the baseline signal as well as changes to the wave shape itself. Across each level of obesity, at both 100 million and one billion photon counts, there is a significant diminishing of the amplitude of the signal. Figure 9A shows the four different signals superimposed on top of each other on the same curve. Baseline signal change between each obesity level and non-obese is shown in Table 2 . The baseline change ranges from 12.7% to 54.5%. Similar changes are seen in both the 100 million photons set as well as the one billion photons set as to be expected. The advantage of using lower number of photons is the computational time for each simulation in exchange for a higher standard deviation at each point. The non-obese BMI of 25kg/m 2 , the AC/DC signal ratio is 8.1% and at the maximum level calculated the ratio is 4.66%. This accumulates to the total percentage change of 43% between the Non-Obese waveform and Obese 3 waveform. The degradation of the return signal gives an indication to the decrease in quality of the signal that will be received by the PPG device. A loss in signal quality is shown to increase as BMI and obesity level increase with changes in dermal thickness and arterial depth. PPG devices designed to periodically or continuously probe arterial blood pressure as a wearable device at the wrist must be designed to be mindful of the significant effects of obesity on optical performance. The advantage of the development of synthetic waveform is understanding these changes and the significance of their impact.
