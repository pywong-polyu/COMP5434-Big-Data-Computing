Using a comprehensive data set that observes over 15,000 firms in 27 countries, including several developing countries, shortly before and after the pandemic, we document that pre-crisis innovation affected firm's survival odds and performance thereafter. The results show that innovative firms are less likely to close and perform better than non-innovators during the pandemic crisis. Innovative firms are also more optimistic about the future than non-innovators. Our results further indicate that firm's adaptability mediates the relationship between innovation and survival outcomes. The study finding shows that innovative firms are more likely to introduce new products, remote work arrangements, increase delivery, pivoting, and online activities than non-innovators during the pandemic crisis.",

Previous research has extensively studied the link between innovativeness and firm survival (Cefis, 2005; Marsili, 2006, 2019; Fontana and Nesta, 2009; Sidorkin and Srholec, 2014; Zhang et al., 2018; Ugur and Vivarelli, 2021) . However, with a few exceptions, our understanding of this relationship is framed mainly in the absence of a major economic crisis. Given the important and multifaceted role of innovation, it is interesting to investigate whether or how innovation is linked with firm survival during the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This article aims to fill this gap in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the first to demonstrate that innovative firms are more resilient to the economic downturn of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective of the present investigation is to examine whether innovative firms are more likely to outperform non-innovators during the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of survival and other performance indicators. The study's secondary goal is to investigate whether firm adaptability capability is a potential mechanism for innovators to affect their odds of survival.",

During extreme recessions, the innovation-survival relationship remains valid, with innovators having a better probability of surviving than non-innovators owing to their greater ability to adapt and adjust to the changes in the external environment (Cefis and Marsili, 2019; Cefis et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Gupta, 2020; Li et al., 2020) . We empirically tested this proposition and found that when firms were taken by surprise by the COVID-19 crisis, innovative firms quickly responded and adjusted to the new environment by introducing new work arrangements, products, enhancing online activity and readjusting their production, services, and delivery services. Third, to our knowledge, we consider the largest set of \"survival outcomes, \" such as the firm exit of market, performance, and future expectations amid crisis-like situations. Fourth, most of the accumulating evidence on firm characteristics and survival is based on single country settings or small sample sizes. However, our study uses a large, representative sample of 15,451 firms from 27 economies, enabling us to generalize our results.",

However, as with product innovation, process innovation is an important dynamic of competition in an industry. In bad times, firms could reduce marginal cost through process innovation and consequently lower selling prices to attract a large customer base (Gupta, 2020) .

(2011) carry out a systematic review on the relationship between firm innovation and performance in small and medium-sized enterprises. Their study concludes that indeed innovation is positively and significantly linked with firm performance. The meta-analysis by Song et al.

Their analysis found that over two-thirds of the empirical studies they review have a positive relationship between innovation and performance. However, both of these studies also reported that the link between innovation-performance might be context-dependent and relationship strength may decrease when input innovation measures are used in the analysis instead of output innovation. More recently, Ugur and Vivarelli (2021) builds on the existing reviews until 2020 and updates the evidence synthesis. Drawing on meta-analysis tools, they establish positive implications of innovation for firm survival and productivity. Fiorentino et al. (2020) investigates the systematic differences in growth between innovative and non-innovative start-ups. Data from more than 34,000 firms located in Italy are analyzed Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org by regression modeling and propensity score matching. The results show that differences in growth can be explained by the different levels of innovation. Moreover, the results show that input innovation is more beneficial than output innovation for firm growth. Y\u0131ld\u0131z et al.

The study used a hazard or duration model where the dependent variable is the survival spell between plant entry and exit. The study findings support the innovation-survival link. Moreover, they note that risk plays a significant role in determining the innovation-survival relationship. For instance, the odds of survival were higher for plants with diversified sources of revenue, multi-product innovations, and lower market risks. In a series of research papers, (Cefis, 2005; Cefis and Marsili, 2006 investigated the impact of innovation on firm survival in a sample of Dutch manufacturing firms. Using community innovation surveys, they found strong evidence that innovation is significantly and positively related to firm survival prospects. More recent work by Zhang et al. (2018) explored the relationship in a sample of Chinese high-tech firms. As gauged by patents and innovation efficiency, authors conclude that innovation improves survival odds in Chinese high-tech firms. Colombelli et al. (2013) examined how aspects of a firm's patent stock influence survival. The study uses a sample of 85,070 French manufacturing firms covering a time span ranging from 2001 to 2011. Findings revealed that innovation increases firm survival prospects. Further support is given by Esteve-P\u00e9rez and Ma\u00f1ez-Castillejo (2008) study that use a sample of manufacturing firms to test hypothesis derived from the resource-based theory of the firm. These researchers assert that the development of firm capabilities via R&D enhances survival chances. Wagner and Cockburn (2010) use a representative sample of Internet-related firms that made an initial public offering on the NASDAQ to examine the impact of patenting on survival prospects. They find that patenting is positively related to firm survival. Coad and Guenther (2013) use data for German machine tool manufacturers in the post-war era to examine the relationship between age and diversification patterns measured by introducing new products in familiar and new markets. Among other things, they note that innovation reduces the risk of firm exit. Dai et al. (2020a) investigate the impacts of innovation on firm survival in the export market. The study employs panel data from 2000 to 2010 of Chinese firms to explore the relationship. These authors report a statistically significant and positive impact of innovation on firm export survival. Helmers and Rogers (2010) examines the impact of innovation on survival of new firms. The evidence suggests that innovation is negatively related to failure rate of sampled firms.",

Using a data set from a survey with 259 Saudi Arabian SME's, the authors note that innovation is significantly positively related to firm performance and likelihood of business survival. Cefis et al.

They reported that innovative firms have a higher likelihood of surviving the crisis than non-innovators. Moreover, a firm's financial constraints do not eliminate the survival premium, even though they mitigate it. Gupta (2020) investigated whether innovation helped Spanish manufacturing firm to shield from the adverse shocks of 2008 financial crisis. His findings showed that innovative firms were more resilient to the downside impacts of the crisis compared to non-innovators. The author elucidated that innovative firms have a higher capability to adjust to rapid changes in the external environment. Li et al.

            "text": "Drawing insights from creative destruction theory, a range of theoretical arguments also point to a positive relationship between innovation and subsequent survival. In addition to making entry possible, innovation increases firm's market power, improve their ability to escape competition, reduce their production costs, improve dynamic capabilities, and lead to enhanced absorptive capacity (Schumpeter, 1943; Porter, 1980; Cohen and Klepper, 1996a,b; Teece et al., 1997; Zahra and George, 2002) . There is evidence that having introduced an innovation enhances the probability of firm survival persistently over time, years after the innovation has taken place (Cefis and Marsili, 2006) . Innovation is a valuable and appropriable resource that generates a sustained positional advantage for the firm in a competitive context (Barney, 1991) . Innovation is also a capability because firms learn how to recognize and exploit commercially novel opportunities and how to solve problems, as they engage in the process of introducing novel products, processes, or practices (Nelson and Winter, 1982) . This cumulatively built knowledge, which includes skills, competences, and practices is stored in routines (Nelson and Winter, 1982) and generates persistence in innovative capabilities and outcomes (Cefis, 2003) . Such a learning process enhances organization flexibility and adaptability to future changes, either internal or external to the firm. Hence, innovation as a resource and a capability contributes to create both a \"positional advantage, \" because innovative firms are rewarded through market selection in view of asymmetries in some dimension of performance (or fitness), and an \"adaptive advantage, \" because firms with superior innovative capabilities can change their relative position in the distribution of performance, through learning and the exploration of new opportunities. While the overall importance of innovation for survival is well established in the literature, little is known about the distinctive contribution of positional and adaptive mechanisms of survival. Given these theoretical and empirical antecedents, we propose following hypothesis (Figure 1 ): H1: Firm innovation has a significant positive impact on firm survival outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.",

The first data set is obtained from the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES), covering 1,69,938 firms in 146 countries. The WBES data set uses standardized monitoring instruments to assess the business environment of each economy and its effect on business operation and performance. The data set includes firms from both services and manufacturing sectors and conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic from 2006 to 2020. Therefore, our pre-crisis firm-level innovation variables and control variables come from the WBES data base. The second data set is the World Bank COVID-19 enterprise follow-up surveys (CEFS). The CEFS is also a survey-based data collected from firms included under the sample frame of the recently conducted WBES for the same countries. The CEFS investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected global businesses, particularly SMEs, in developed and developing economies. The CEFS looks into the impact of COVID-19 on businesses and the subsequent changes they make as a result, such as sales, growth, jobs, financial access, government assistance, and expectations resulting from the pandemic. We use the CEFS database to construct our dependent variables of the study. For data on stringency lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, we rely on Our World in Data. 2 After obtaining the most updated and recently available data from sources, we combine the WBES data set with the observation of the same firm in CEFS by their unique identification \"idstd. \" WBES cover a large number of countries, but the follow-up COVID-19 surveys are conducted only in 36 of them. Thus, the initial sample size and country coverage are dictated by the CEFS. For some countries covered in the CEFS, follow-up surveys are conducted in two waves, of which the first took place in June/July 2020 and the second in September/December 2020. Our analysis includes only the latest available COVID-19 enterprise surveys for these countries, reducing our initial sample size from 27,686 to 19,209 firms in 36 countries. We further decided to limit the sample to the WBES surveys concluded in 2019 and onwards. Therefore, our final sample gives a glimpse of the firm condition just before and after the onset of the pandemic (approximately 6 months to 1.5 years apart). The final sample of the study consists of 15,451 firms in 27 countries.",

We use the (log of) labor productivity, measured by the ratio of real sales to the total workforce, as a proxy for productivity, expressed in 2005 USD. Firms facing an obstacle to access finance (Finobs) are more likely to exit the market during the crisis. We control for access to finance by the degree of financial obstacle during the pre-crisis period.

The variable takes the value of one if \"firm had an internationally recognized quality certification, for example, ISO 9,000, 9,002 or 14,000\" otherwise zero. Age is measured by the natural logarithm of firm age. Managerial experience is proxied by the natural logarithm of the \"top manager number of years of experience working in this sector. \" Website is a dummy variable represented by the value of 1 if \"establishment has its own website\" Website is generally used to communicate with customers and suppliers, which captures external communication capability mediated by the INTERNET. Therefore, feeds the idea of Lundvall (1988) that reducing the information asymmetry between customers and producers is vital to innovation.

We believe that reverse causality and simultaneity are unlikely to influence the regression outcomes in our sample for two reasons. First, the COVID-19 pandemic was an entirely unexpected event, which was not possible to predict prior to the outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020. The dependent variables in our study are the outcomes of this exogenous event. Second, the dependent variables are taken from the COVID-19 follow-up surveys conducted after the onset of the pandemic, while the innovation and other control variables are taken from the pre-crisis WBES. We try our best to minimize the effect of omitted variables in our data. Our regressions involve 13 firm-level control variables and region-industry fixed effects in addition to our core variable innovation. As a result, we expect the omitted-variable problem to be less of a concern in our case. Table 1 provides a brief overview and description of the variables used in our regression analysis. It shows that from 2 to 14.1% of firms permanently closed during the pandemic, based on three closure measures. The table also reports that 66.4% of firms experienced a decrease in liquidity since the COVID-19 pandemic started and a decline of 23.12% in monthly sales on average. The large differences in sales ranging from \u2212100 to 300% indicate that some firms benefitted from the crisis. Moreover, firms were asked about their perception of future prospects. The statistics show that 1.5% of firms were uncertain about future recovery in terms of workforce. If sales stopped, firms might survive for another 5.62 weeks on average.",

For instance, 38.6% of firms adjusted their product and services in response to the crisis; 26.9% of firms started or increased online activity; remote work arrangements (about 33% of firms); delivery of goods/services (about 23.8% of firms), introduced products/services (about 18%). In terms of firm characteristics, 44.3% of the firms are small, remaining are medium-sized firms (33.5%) and large-sized firms (22.2%). The bottom part of the table also provides descriptive statistics of other firm characteristics that we controlled in this empirical analysis along with the stringency of lockdown, which is a country-level indicator.

Based on various categories of survival variables, this question is further divided into three parts. Are innovative firms less likely to close than non-innovators during the COVID-19 crisis? Are innovative firms performing better than non-innovators during the COVID-19 crisis? Are innovative firms more pessimistic about the future than non-innovators during the COVID-19 crisis? The study uses pre-crisis firm-level innovation (product/process) as the main independent variable to address these questions. Further, we are also curious about the channels through which innovation may affect survival. Therefore, we examined whether innovative firms are more likely to adapt than non-innovators in response to the COVID-19 crisis. We selected five variables: pivoting, increased online activity, remote work arrangements, delivery, and introduction of new products as the firm's adaptation response to the COVID-19 crisis. The empirical analysis uses the ordinary least square (OLS) method for the continuous dependent variables and the probit regression approach for the binary dependent variables. The analysis begins by estimating a baseline regression where we regress survival variables with only pre-crisis firm-level product innovation (as in columns 1 to 7 of Table 2 ). Next, we re-estimate our results by including a range of firm-specific control variables and stringency of lockdown (as in columns 8 to 14 of Table 2 ). All regressions include industry and region fixed effects (coefficient estimates are not reported). We make several interesting observations based on estimated results presented in Table 2 . First, we find that innovative firms are less likely to close permanently than non-innovation during the crisis. The relationship between pre-crisis product innovation and firm closure variables are negative and statistically significant across all estimated models except for \"Close19\" in column 10 which is statistically insignificant but carried a correct sign. From a performance perspective, we note that innovative firms have a lower likelihood of experiencing cash flow shortages and perform better than non-innovators in terms of sales during the COVID-19 induced crisis. Once again, these results are statistically significant and carried correct signs when we use baseline regression and all control variables. Further, we find that innovative firms may survive for a longer time when sales stop; and more optimistic about returning to normal level than non-innovators. However, the statistical significance weakens when we employ firm-level control variables and stringency of lockdown in the regression analysis. Overall, the coefficients carry a correct sign and provide support to our innovation-survival relationship hypothesis.",

They include managers, employees, consumers, and suppliers (Bercovitz and Mitchell, 2007) . However, firms' survival is endangered during times of crisis (Bosio et al., 2020) . Crises have a detrimental impact on the growth of businesses and their projects because the negative impact of crisis extends to all elements of the external business environment (Dhochak and Sharma, 2015) . Firms have limited funding options and a greater probability of failures due to poor capital market performance during a crisis, lack of sufficient information, and component defects throughout the economy (Chundakkadan et al., 2020; Gormsen and Koijen, 2020; McKibbin and Fernando, 2021) . During this recent COVID-19 crisis, firms faced difficulties in performing their operational activities, severe liquidity constraints, and, ultimately, risk of failure (Apedo-Amah et al., 2020; Bartik et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020b) . The rapidly growing literature on COVID-19 sheds initial light on firm-specific characteristics that have enabled firms to cope with and survive the shock (Ding et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Grover and Karplus, 2021) but thus far none has focused on innovation practices. Therefore, consistent with this stream of literature, the main purpose of our study is to highlight the importance of innovation practices as a response to the COVID-19 crisis and its effect on business performance and the likelihood of their survival.",

This is also supported by evidence that innovative firms performed better than non-innovators during the crisis and were also optimistic about future economic conditions. Our study's most striking finding is that the innovation relationship to survival outcomes runs strongly and primarily through adaptability. We provide strong evidence that innovative firms are more likely to adapt to new changes in the external environment, thus increasing their survival prospects. Our research shows that innovators not only fare better through crises just because they are innovators but also because they can better adapt to new developments, which increases the likelihood of survival for innovators. The study's findings have significant managerial and policy implications. To begin, crises typically affect an organization's sales, production capabilities, and financial conditions; therefore, managers should continue to develop and support innovation in relation to all business activities to meet the challenges imposed by the pandemic. Second, managers should stay up-to-date on knowledge and information solutions that will assist them in making sound decisions and getting through the crisis successfully. It is also crucial that managers update their plans and strategies regularly to achieve the flexibility required to respond to the new conditions in the external environment. Further, the post-pandemic state of businesses will be very different from that of pre-pandemic businesses, therefore, managers should develop a strategy to deal with the crisis' negative effects on their businesses after the pandemic to ensure continuity and survival.",
