However, permanent and meaningful effects on obstetric decision-making await reports of clinically important school-age outcomes in an Australian context, which we will obtain with this study. Empowering obstetricians with the knowledge of whether adverse outcomes in the MLP group persist into school age will enable better decision-making regarding the risks and benefits of delivering a baby 'just a bit early'. Knowledge of developmental trajectories for children born MLP, as well as risk factors for poor outcomes at this age, will provide the evidence base for long-term MLP developmental and health surveillance guidelines. Furthermore, an improved understanding of school-age outcomes for children born MLP will have the potential to inform tailored interventions to suit children's specific needs, information that is not available from assessments in the first few years of development.",

Currently, it is recommended that very preterm (<32 weeks' gestation) children have regular developmental and health follow-up throughout childhood. 11 However, similar guidelines are lacking for MLP children, presumably because the few studies describing outcomes during critical periods of development, such as at school age, have not characterised which developmental domains may be affected compared with children born at term. Without this vital information, we cannot design and implement effective interventions to improve outcomes for this population. Moreover, little is known of the risk factors to alert parents and health practitioners to MLP children at greatest risk and who might benefit most from surveillance. This 9-year follow-up of a pre-existing MLP cohort and term-born controls will allow us to identify specific domains affected by MLP birth, as well as enable us to identify risk factors for poor outcomes, which in turn will inform the design and implementation of effective early interventions to improve outcomes for these vulnerable children.",

While community transmission of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia, remains a concern, participants will be offered one of two assessment formats: 1. A face-to-face assessment, with physical distancing measures and hygiene procedures in place to minimise risk of viral transmission. 2. In the case of restrictions prohibiting face-to-face assessments for research purposes, a remote assessment will be offered, in which parts of the cognitive and motor components will be conducted via the video conferencing platform, with the participants in their own home. When these restrictions are lifted, these participants may be offered the opportunity to complete the remaining components of the assessments, including brain MRI and lung function, if possible. The option of remote assessment may also be offered outside the context of such restrictions to reduce the total time spent onsite or to participants who do not wish to attend the hospital at all due to concerns about viral transmission, or to regional, interstate or international participants who are unable to travel. Further details about adapted assessment procedures are provided in online supplemental material 1.",

Motor function will be assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition, 26 a gold standard for assessing motor impairment in children 3-16 years of age. The assessment is divided into three subscales: manual dexterity, aiming and catching and balance. b. Cerebral palsy will be diagnosed based on a neurological examination including loss of motor function, abnormal tone and tendon reflexes, or recorded if the child has previously received a diagnosis. The five-level Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) will be used to further classify motor function for children with cerebral palsy. The GMFCS is a reliable and widely used scale that classifies children's gross motor function based on self-initiated movement. 27 c. Physical activity levels will be assessed with a highresolution (13-bit), water resistant to 1.5 m ankle mounted triaxial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle on Tyne, UK) worn for seven consecutive days (including a full weekend) for 24 hours/day. The key outcome measure is mean steps per day, with additional measures including time spent inactive and the time spent at different exercise intensities per day. Ankle-mounted accelerometers have been used previously to assess activity in children with motor impairments, 28 and the ankle is well established in research as the optimal position for stepping movements across a range of devices. 29 The monitor will be given to children at the follow-up assessment and returned by post. d. Physical activity participation will be measured using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C). 30 This questionnaire will be completed by the child during the assessment, with assistance from the assessor, if necessary, using an online survey linked to a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. 31 The PAQ-C is a self-report 7-day recall questionnaire which was developed for children aged 8-14 years and includes a checklist of common sporting and leisure activities, as well as questions about physical activity levels during the school day, after school and on weekends. 30 The sporting and leisure activity list was updated for the current study to include common activities undertaken by Australian children, with permission from the authors of the outcome measure. The reliability and validity of the PAQ-C have been investigated in several different geographical regions, and studies have demonstrated good reliability and fairmoderate validity with accelerometers. 32 In addition to the PAQ-C, two brief questions assessing participation in sedentary screen behaviours will be administered. The questions are adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017 Middle School Youth Risk Behaviour Survey and are as follows: 1. 'On an average school day, how many hours do you watch TV?' 2. On an average school day, how many hours do you play video or computer games or use a computer for something that is not school work? (Count time spent on things such as Xbox, PlayStation, an iPad or other tablet, a smartphone, texting, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other social media.) 33 e. Grip strength will be measured using a hand-held dynamometer. Strength (force in kilogram) will be measured with the child in a seated position, with their elbow flexed at 90\u00b0, shoulder adducted into their body and their forearm parallel to the floor. Each child will be given a practice trial, followed by three subsequent trials for each of (1) the child's preferred hand; (2) the child's non-preferred hand; and (3) bimanual, from which the maximum for each condition will be taken. Grip strength is an inexpensive and easily implemented assessment which, in adulthood, can be an indicator of health as poorer grip strength has been associated with functional impairment, 34 cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. 35 f. Anthropometric measures include height, weight, waist circumference, chest circumference, head circumference, mid-arm circumference and lower limb length, and will be measured according to standard guidelines. In addition, blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and heart rate will be taken at rest using an automated device.",

Based on our past experience of assessing many similar age cohorts, we conservatively estimate an overall follow-up rate of 90% at the 9-year assessment; this will result in 180 MLP and 180 controls. There are 27 pairs of twins in the MLP group (27% of participants) and none in the term control group. Assuming an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.6 between outcomes for twins and that 27% of those who attend the follow-up are twins (n=48), we will have an effective sample size of 155 MLP (based on a design effect of 1.16). Samples of 155 MLP and 180 controls will enable us to detect differences between the groups as small as 0.31 SD with 80% power (based on a two-sided test with \u03b1=0.05). For most outcomes that are measured continuously, a difference of 0.31 SD between groups would be clinically important and is a difference that we could potentially observe. For proportions, if the event rate is 50% in the controls, we will have 80% power to detect differences of \u00b116%. As the event rate moves away from 50%, we will be able to detect smaller absolute differences between the two groups with 80% power, which are again clinically important differences, and differences that we could potentially observe.",
