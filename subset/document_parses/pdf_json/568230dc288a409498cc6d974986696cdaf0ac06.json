Following a case-control study design in a rural Ecuadorian village that was severely struck by the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by real-time PCR in swabs obtained from inner and upper walls in 24/48 randomly selected latrines from casehouses and in 12/48 flushing toilets from paired control-houses (P = 0.014; McNemar's test). This association persisted in a conditional logistic regression model adjusted for relevant covariates (OR: 4.82; 95% CI: 1.38-16.8; P = 0.014). In addition, SARS-CoV-2-seropositive subjects were more often identified among those living in houses with a latrine (P = 0.002). Latrines have almost five times the odds of containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA than their paired flushing toilets. Latrines are reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and it cannot be ruled out that latrines could contribute to viral transmission in rural settings. Frequent disinfection of latrines should be recommended to reduce the likelihood of fecal contamination.",

            "text": "This study shows that latrines have almost five times the odds of containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA than their paired flushing toilets, and provide support for their potential role as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection is also suggested by this study, disclosing a higher number of seropositive subjects among those living in houses with latrines. The opposite, that is, that latrines had more often SARS-CoV-2 RNA than flushing toilets because more infected people used the former, cannot be totally ruled out. However, there was no other apparent reason explaining the higher prevalence of seropositive individuals in houses with a latrine when compared with those with a flushing toilet. On the other hand, the assumption that latrines are a surrogate of poverty and household crowding-favoring SARS-CoV-2 transmission-may not apply to the study population, inasmuch as income status of families living in case-and control-houses were similar, and both were inhabited by roughly the same number of persons. Cultural factors and lack of basic home facilities may account for the continued use of latrines in some houses. As mentioned earlier, handwashing facilities (sinks) were available only at households with flush toilets, whereas houses with latrines have only one faucet at their backyards, which is mostly used to collect water in buckets or jars. The lack of handwashing facilities in houses with latrines may discourage people to wash hands after defecation, which in turn may possibly contribute to enhance transmission if viable SARS-CoV-2 is present. Poor maintenance of latrines also enhances their possibility to be potential foci of contamination from infective stools.",

            "text": "As previously mentioned, some studies have demonstrated persistence of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in feces. [7] [8] [9] Whether these viral particles are viable and how long they will be infective in latrine walls is not known, but it has been suggested that, under specific circumstances-such as dark environments and in nonporous materials-SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable in fomites for several weeks, 11 In addition, disposal of toilet paper in open waste bins or on the floor of the cabin may increase the risk of fecal transmission of the virus. 12 In this view, a recent study from rural China suggested that the use of pit latrines may be a source of fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, either by direct contagion of humans with contaminated feces or through intermediate animal hosts, that is, bats. 13 In this study, a sizable proportion of flushing toilets (12/48) also had SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Flushing toilets can generate fecal aerosols that spread SARS-CoV-2 RNA to the air and internal plumbing, and some of them may even remain adhered to their walls. 14, 15 However, incorporated pipe water sinks in bathrooms motivate people to wash their hands after defecation. This practice may reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the infection, as suggested by the lower number of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive individuals among those living in houses with flushing toilets.",

These findings open new avenues of research for evaluating the actual role of latrines in human contagion at different settings. Obviously, transmission of the virus through respiratory droplets is the principal source of contagion, but fecal-oral contagion cannot be ruled out. Preventive measures have focused on the use of face masks and social distancing, and little attention has been paid to a potential fecal route of transmission that requires other measures. Frequent disinfection of latrines (and flushing toilets) as well as compulsory handwashing should be recommended to reduce the potential likelihood of fecal contamination. 16 Also, given the frequency in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found, latrines could serve as sentinel places for surveillance of transmission levels.",

By contrast, latrines do not have incorporated pipe water sinks and are under poor hygienic conditions, toilet papers are accumulated on open bags or all over the floor, and there is macroscopic evidence of fecal material in some of their inner walls.
