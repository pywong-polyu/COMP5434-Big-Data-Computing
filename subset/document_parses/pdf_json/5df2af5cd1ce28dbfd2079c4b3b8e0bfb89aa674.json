The competition has extended to the new field of values since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The escalating strategic competition will presumably evolve into a new Cold War between the two powers. The realization of a new Cold War will undoubtedly take a toll on not only the domestic development of the two countries, but also on the entire international society. Thus, it is of special significance to reexamine the origins and the tragic consequences of the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union. In view of the reams of narratives on the history of the Cold War, this paper focuses on how reexamining the Cold War can promote better understanding and management of today's China-US relations.",

A Cold War includes three essential features: first, there must be two well-matched power poles in the international system; it is difficult for unbalanced power poles or more than two power poles to give rise to a Cold War. Second, the two major power poles must mainly be competitors, not partners. Specifically, the competitive relationship must be reflected in diplomatic confrontation through alliances, mutual military deterrence and arms races, economic closure and isolation, and ideological attacks. Third, there must not be direct military conflict between the two polar powers. A common form of conflict in a Cold War is proxy war, which is the main form of competition between two polar powers. These three basic features, with the first describing power structure and the other two describing the state of the polar relationship, constituted the basic characteristics of the international system amid the US-Soviet confrontation.",

The strategic distrust was a kind of political sentiment that was prone to arise after their common enemy disappeared. This tendency conforms to the general law of political science, because great fear triggered by security pressure is apt to induce sensitivity and suspicion in human nature. The preservation of the super armament power of the two nations brought new fear after the defeat of the US' and the Soviet Union's mutual enemy, Germany. Truman, the new US president, and Stalin, the aging leader of the Soviet Union, lost the confidence and patience to continue to communicate with each other. The two top leaders never met again after the Potsdam Conference. The physical separation of the decision makers from both sides contributed to the deterioration of mutual distrust.",

Take the Korean War as an example. Many countries, including China, suffered major miscalculations. The Soviet Union and North Korea launched the war against the South Korea recklessly, because they misjudged a speech made by Dean Acheson, the US Secretary of State, in the early 1950s in which he excluded South Korea from the US's Pacific \"defensive perimeter\" (Gaddis 2011, 93). The US' misjudgment of China's resolve to send troops into North Korea led it to indulge in the commander of US Army forces in the Far East Gen. Douglas MacArthur's reckless crossing of the 38th Parallel into the north. At that time, China's top leaders also misjudged the strength and determination of the US military, leading Chinese troops to boldly cross the 38th parallel to the south. This is part of the reason why the Korean War continued, lasting for 3 years. The repeated strategic miscalculations made by China, the US, and the Soviet Union during the Korean War were disastrous. The Korean War was the most ruthless fight between the two camps led, respectively, by US and Soviet Union during the Cold War, which intensified the sharpness of the Cold War confrontation.",

In addition to power confrontation, another important part of the Cold War was the ideological rivalry between the two power poles. The Cold War started largely with ideological attacks, with each side treating the other as an enemy. On February 9, 1946, Stalin placed special emphasis on Lenin's theory of capitalism and the inevitability of war at the Supreme Soviet conference, which caused great concern in the Western world. A few days later, George Kennan sent back the renowned \"X Report\" from Moscow, highlighting the ideological threat from the Soviet Union. Soon after, McCarthyism rose in the US. Fierce ideological conflict worsened the confrontation between the two power poles. In sum, the ideological conflict between capitalism and communism constituted an important part of the Cold War.",

In 1944, Molotov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, participated in the US-led Bretton Woods Conference, where he expressed his desire to cooperate with the US in the post-war reconstruction of the world economic order. However, after the war, the Soviet Union took an increasingly negative attitude toward participating in the American reconstruction plan and refused to join in the Marshall Plan, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank. Instead, it set up the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, as Harry Dexter White, the \"Father of the IMF\" and an important designer of the Bretton Woods System, was exposed as a suspected Soviet spy. In addition, the US took further economic action by establishing the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), which aimed at sanctions against communist countries. With the beginning of an economic cold war between the two sides, two parallel markets formed in the two camps, and the international economic system was artificially bisected. As an important part of the US-Soviet Cold War, the economic Cold War directly reduced social contact between the two sides, preventing the sharp political collision between the two sides from being offset.",

Although the US and the Soviet Union were the initiators and main competitors of the Cold War, the Cold War was not limited to only the two powers, but instead involved many countries. In view of this, the Cold War was not \"individual combat\", but rather involved battles among many countries whose foreign policies were shaped by the strategic patterns of the Cold War. In this sense, the Cold War resembled a huge machine that, once fully started, was difficult to stop due to the inertia caused by each bearing's rotation in line with an established direction and rhythm.",

The US-Soviet confrontation evolved into one between NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization. Under such huge structural pressure, alliance members consciously or unconsciously submitted to the needs of the struggle by taking sides in areas such as politics, economics, and ideology, and hardly had a third choice.

Combined, the economies of the US and China account for 40% of the world's total, with the US comprising about 25% and China about 15%. If the EU is not regarded as a unified economy, a bipolar economic structure between China and the US is surfacing, and the gap between the two nations in economic aggregate terms may be further narrowed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are also increasing apparent differences between the two sides in ideology and value system. China has been a unique civilization since ancient times. Since the Communist Party of China came into power, China has combined its traditional culture with Marxism in terms of ideology and value system. The differences in thoughts and values between China and the US were once suppressed and overshadowed by functional needs, as China's main approach since its reform and opening up was the massive absorption of modern market economy customs. But as it has made remarkable economic achievements, China has become more confident and has increasingly emphasized China's path and Chinese thinking.

This choice does not put pressure on other member states to take sides, and thus helps to avoid the rapid evolution of China-US strategic competition into a confrontation between the two closed groups. China has initiated the establishment of some international institutions and organizations in recent years, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (which China has always welcomed the US to join), the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) mechanism, and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism, all of which are based on functional cooperation-unlike alliance systems, which have specific strategic targets.",

In addition, it brought catastrophe to many Third World countries, such as the two countries on the Korean Peninsula. However, it was a complete tragedy for the Soviet Union, the loser of the war. If China and the US fight a \"New Cold War\", it will bring very serious consequences, not only endangering the normal development of the two countries, but also destroying the liberal international order that has been in place since the 1990s. First, a \"New Cold War\" between China and the US may destroy the global industrial chain and reduce the efficiency of the world economy, as it may aggravate the economic nationalism of both sides and interfere with each other's openness to the outside world. The development of free trade, open finance, and global industrial division are all highly dependent on a peaceful and benign international environment. If the US imposes long-term increased import tariffs on China and China responds tit-for-tat in a spiraling trade war, the two countries' major markets will gradually decouple. With the development of a fierce technology war between the two countries, there will be a significant decoupling trend in high-tech industries. The economic interdependence between the two countries is the result of the logic of economic efficiency, whereas economic decoupling is a process dominated by the logic of security. If decoupling happens, the entire free international economic order will suffer enormous burdens.",

This violates the intentions of both China and the US. As the famous political economist Alexander Gerschenkron said a long time ago, late-developing countries are more likely to adopt economic development strategies through state intervention due to more severe external environments (Gerschenkron 1962) . The development of the external environment of the new Cold War will encourage the Chinese government to play a greater role in guiding the market. Faced with the severe external pressure of a new Cold War, and in view of its less sound market system and weaker market power, China, unlike the US, can draw resources from society through market forces to engage in international strategic competition. Conversely, China may be compelled to strengthen its \"visible hand\" to control resources, including the extraction, distribution, and investment of resources. This would inevitably aggravate China's state-led economic system rather than promote market-oriented reform. This, in turn, would further widen the differences between the two countries' economic systems.",

Apart from that, America's allies have helped share American military spending. China does not have these two advantages. Therefore, the grave financial and economic pressure that the arms race will bring to China will force the Chinese government to reduce its other expenditures, especially public expenditures, and will also weaken China's motivation and willingness to reduce taxes on a large scale. This will intensify social contradictions and curb economic growth. In sum, even though the US hold some advantages, the new wave of arms race is never the well-being of the two countries.
