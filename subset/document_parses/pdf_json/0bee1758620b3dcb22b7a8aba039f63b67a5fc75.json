At the beginning of the outbreak, finding even just an additional positive case is important to adopt suitable early containment policies in order to slow the outbreak. Moreover, having as much as possible a precise picture of the total number of people actually infected is key to develop mathematical models (see [1] [2] [3] for some early results) to understand the disease evolution and when the peak of infection will happen.

From this respect, we remark that the Italian health care system is federal-like, even if the national authority still plays an important control role. We focus on the decision problem of the central authority that, aiming at effectively monitoring the evolution of the disease outbreak, wishes the regions to perform a suitable number of diagnostic tests. Clearly, diagnostic tests are a limited resource because of their cost in terms of money and time, but also given the finite capacity of the central national authority to check the tests results. Hence, the need for optimization techniques to address this critical decision problem emerges.",

In this paper we consider the case of a central unit aiming at assigning to the regional units an optimal number of diagnostic tests such that the number of infected people that are detected (i.e. the positivity rate) is maximized. We assume that the following data are publicly available for each region i at some time during the outbreak: d i \u2208 R + is the total number of deaths from the disease (cumulated from the beginning of the outbreak to the time considered); c i \u2208 R + is the total number of cases, that is the total number of people diagnosed with the disease (cumulated from the beginning of the outbreak to the time considered); p i \u2208 R + is the size of the population; \u03c3 i \u2208 [0, 1] is the positivity rate for the diagnostic test (observed at the time considered): if, for example, in a day/week, the region i performs t i tests and the observed number of the diagnosed cases is r i , then \u03c3 i = r i /t i .",

The (negative) correction quadratic term is introduced based on the idea that, if a number of diagnostic tests x i = undetected i /\u03c3 i is performed, then ideally all the undetected people have been checked, and the marginal utility of an additional test should be zero (see Fig. 1 ). As a result, we get a concave quadratic utility function; this is clearly advantageous from a numerical point of view, see [7] . Clearly, the choices of the central unit are subject to some constraints. In particular, it is natural to assume the total number of diagnostic tests to be upper-bounded by some available budget b \u2208 R + , and the number of diagnostic tests assigned to each region i to be lower-and upper-bounded by some quantities l i , u i \u2208 R + , respectively.

In particular, we focus on the five regions that, during the week we focus on, are the most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak: Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Marche and Piemonte. All data can be found at the Italian Ministry of Health webpage http://www.salute.gov.it/nuovocoronavirus. For every i, one can download from the latter webpage parameters d i and c i ; the daily value for the positivity rate \u03c3 i can be obtained by dividing the daily number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 by the total number of diagnostic tests that are performed during the day in region i (which are available on the same webpage). For our numerical experience we use the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) estimated in March 2020 as proxy for the IFR: we set \u03d5 = 0.034, see [6] . In fact, ''to measure IFR accurately, a complete picture of the number of infections of, and of deaths caused by, the disease must be known.

By considering the new estimate \u03d5 = 0.01, although the value of undetected i increases significantly (see Table 7 ), the performances of our approach do not seem to change so much (see Table 8 compared to Tables 5 and 6 ). Moreover, in order to test our method without the presence of the upper bounds u i , one can simply take u i = b for every i. The results in Table 9 point out that, when \u03b1 is set to 0, the lack of upper bounds might lead to undesired testing policies that turn out to be unbalanced among the regions. This phenomenon does not happen if \u03b1 = 1.",

An important feature of our approach is its simplicity: data we resort to are easy to obtain and the model enjoys nice mathematical properties so that one can rely on simple standard optimization softwares to treat numerically the problem. The results we obtain when applying our method to the Italian case seem promising. Also, we believe that our model is sufficiently flexible to be applied to other federal-like health care systems such as e.g. USA or Germany. We remark that in this work we provide a very preliminar analysis. Of course, the model we present here can be further generalized and enhanced by including additional features, such as, e.g., some degree of correlation among the regions' utility functions, and population densities in the definition of each \u00b5 i .",
