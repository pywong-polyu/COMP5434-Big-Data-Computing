            "text": "The NF-\u03baB pathway is an essential signalling cascade in the defence against viral infections, including African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection. ASFV encodes more than 151 proteins via its own transcription machinery and possesses a great capacity to evade or subvert antiviral innate immune responses. Although some of these viral proteins have been reported, many remain unknown. Here, we show that pD345L, an ASFV-encoded lambda-like exonuclease, acts as an inhibitor of cGAS/STING-mediated NF-\u03baB signalling by blocking the IkappaB kinase (IKK\u03b1/\u03b2) activity. Specifically, we showed that overexpression of pD345L suppresses cGAS/STING-induced IFN\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB activation, resulting in decreased transcription of IFN\u03b2 and several proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF\u03b1. In addition, we showed that pD345L acts at or downstream of IKK and upstream of p65. Importantly, we found that pD345L associates with the KD and HLH domains of IKK\u03b1 and the LZ domain of IKK\u03b2 and thus interrupts their kinase activity towards the downstream substrate I\u03baB\u03b1. Finally, we showed that pD345L-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB signalling was independent of its exonuclease activity. Considering these results collectively, we concluded that pD345L blocks IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 kinase activity via protein-protein interactions and thus disrupts cGAS/STING-mediated NF-\u03baB signalling.",

Since first reported in Kenya in 1921, ASFV genotype I and genotype II have escaped from Africa to Europe, South America, the Caucasus, and the Russian Federation [1] . ASFV genotype I was successfully eradicated in all countries outside Africa except Sardinia. In August 2018, ASFV genotype II was introduced into China and rapidly spread to almost all Chinese provinces as well as more than ten Asian countries [2] . As a result, millions of pigs were culled, and the pig inventory in these countries was significantly decreased. ASFV not only largely threatens the swine industry and heparin supply worldwide but also causes tremendous social and economic impacts [3] . However, there are no effective vaccines or antivirals available yet. Therefore, it is of great importance to better understand ASFV and its host interactions to gain new insight for its control and for vaccine development.",

ASFV has a double-stranded DNA genome of 170-190 kbp that contains over 151 open reading frames (ORFs) [6] encoding structural proteins and a variety of proteins involved in gene transcription, replication, nucleotide metabolism, DNA repair and immune regulation [7] . ASFV primarily targets host monocyte-macrophage lineage cells but only replicates with a very low efficiency and often alters its immunogenicity in immortalized cell lines. As innate immune cells, macrophages have a comparably harsh intracellular environment for engulfed microorganisms. Therefore, ASFV employs a delicate mechanism to modulate the intracellular environment to improve viral replication conditions. For example, macrophages produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to viral infection, which not only generates oxidative DNA lesions destroying viral genome integrity [8, 9] but also inhibits viral capsid assembly and maturation [10] . The base excision repair (BER) pathway is the primary repair system activated in response to ROS-induced DNA damage. Interestingly, ASFV encodes all BER pathway enzymes except DNA glycosylase, including AP endonuclease (pE296R), PCNA-like (pE301R); DNA polymerase X-like (pO174L); Lambda-like exonuclease (pD345L); and DNA ligase (pNP419L). It was reported that pE296R is required for ASFV growth in macrophages but not in Vero cells [11] and that pD345L is indispensable for ASFV propagation [12] , suggesting an essential role of the DNA repair system in ASFV replication.",

Once activated, STING translocates from the ER to the Golgi, where it phosphorylates the TANK-binding kinase 1(TBK1) and the IkappaB kinase (IKK) to initiate either the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-or NF-\u03baB-mediated innate immune responses. The IKK complex contains two catalytic subunits, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, and one regulatory subunit, IKK\u03b3 (NEMO). Generally, IKK acts as a key regulator in the NF-\u03baB-mediated antiviral response, and activation of the IKK complex is a common step in activating NF-kB signalling through canonical and noncanonical pathways [13] . Therefore, IKK is an important target for viral immune evasion.",

For example, A238L, an I\u03baB homologue, is able to either prevent the binding of NF-\u03baB with its response elements in target gene promoters [14] or suppress the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB by interacting with p300/CBP [15] . Both I329L, a viral Toll-like receptor (TLR) homologue, and A528R inhibit IRF3 and NF-\u03baB activation [16] . In addition, DP96R was discovered to inhibit the cGAS-STING signalling pathway by targeting TBK1 and IKK\u03b2 through an unknown mechanism [17] . Recently, MGF-505-7R has been shown to suppress the cGAS-STING pathway by promoting autophagy-mediated STING degradation and targeting IRF3 and the IKK complex to inhibit IL-1\u03b2 and type I IFN production [18, 19] . Moreover, viruses with multigene family 360/530 (MGF360/530) deletion show attenuated virulence and enhanced type I IFN production [20, 21] . The chronic/persistent infection caused by live attenuated viruses indicates that additional ASFV proteins modulating the host immune response remain to be identified.",

To identify ASFV proteins that regulate the cGAS/STINGmediated immune response, a number of ASFVencoded proteins were screened using a dual-luciferase reporter assay by transfection of each viral protein with the INF\u03b2, NF-\u03baB or IRF3 luciferase reporter (designated INF\u03b2-Luc, NF-\u03baB-Luc, and IRF3-Luc, respectively), along with co-transfection or treatment with innate immune stimulators. From the results, pD345L was identified. To confirm this, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted with co-transfection of IFN\u03b2-Luc along with cGAS, STING and/or D345L expression vectors, and the results showed that pD345L obviously decreased cGAS/STING-induced activation of the IFN\u03b2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 1A and B) , which was different from the recently published MGF-505-7R protein that inhibits the cGAS/ STING pathway ( Figure 1C ). Next, to further determine whether the NF-\u03baB or IRF3 pathway is targeted by pD345L, the effect of pD345L on NF-\u03baB and IRF3 promoter activation was analysed. The results showed that pD345L suppressed cGAS/STING-induced NF-\u03baB-Luc activity ( Figure 1D ) but not IRF3-Luc activity (Figure 1E) . Similarly, pD345L also inhibited NF-\u03baB-Luc activity induced by TNF\u03b1, which activates IKK/NF-\u03baB signalling ( Figure 1F ). These findings suggest that pD345L inhibits the cGAS/STING-mediated NF-\u03baB signalling pathway.",

The results showed that upregulation of IFN\u03b2 mRNA induced by cGAS/STING was significantly reduced in the presence of pD345L ( Figure 2A ). As a key transcription factor controlling the proinflammatory signalling pathway [24] , NF-\u03baB controls the expression of a set of proinflammatory cytokines, including I-L1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1. Therefore, if pD345L regulates NF-\u03baB activity, it should also modulate the transcription of NF-\u03baB downstream targets in addition to IFN\u03b2. To test this hypothesis, the mRNA levels of IFN\u03b2 as well as four proinflammatory cytokines were examined in WSL cells, an immortalized wild boar lung fibroblast line, and PK15 cells, a porcine kidney cell line, that were left untreated or treated with 2\u20323'-cGAMP. The results showed that pD345L decreased the mRNA levels of not only IFN\u03b2 in both cell lines with or without 2\u20323'-cGAMP stimulation but also of IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1 (Figures 2B  and C) .

To characterize the specific target of pD345L, several factors, including TRAF6, TAK1/TAB1, TBK1, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 that activate NF-\u03baB at different steps of the signalling cascade were tested. The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that pD345L was able to abolish NF-\u03baB-Luc activity induced by TRAF6 ( Figure 3A ) and TAK1/TAB1 ( Figure 3B ) or significantly suppress NF-\u03baB-Luc activity induced by TBK1 ( Figure 3C ), IKK\u03b1 ( Figure 3D ) or IKK\u03b2 (Figure 3E) . However, pD345L did not inhibit NF-\u03baB-Luc activity induced by p65 overexpression ( Figure 3F ).

According to the above results, we further explored whether pD345L directly targets IKK to inhibit I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation. A coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed to analyse the protein-protein interaction between pD345L and IKK by co-transfection of Flag-tagged D345L and HA-tagged IKK\u03b1 or IKK\u03b2 in 293 T cells. The results showed the presence of HA-IKK\u03b1 ( Figure 4A ) or HA-IKK\u03b2 ( Figure 4C ) in the anti-Flag antibody-immunoprecipitated pD345L protein complex, and conversely, the presence of Flag-pD345L in the HA antibody-immunoprecipitated IKK\u03b1 ( Figure 4B ) or IKK\u03b2 ( Figure 4D ) protein complex. Next, a coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed to further confirm the interactions between pD345L and IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 in ASFV-infected PAM cells. The results showed that endogenous IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 was detected in the pD345L-immunoprecipitated complex ( Figure 4E ). The IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 subunits share 52% amino acid sequence identity and have similar primary structures that contain an N-terminal kinase domain (KD), a leucine zipper (LZ) domain and a C-terminal helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain ( Figures 4F and G) . To determine which domain of IKK\u03b1 or IKK\u03b2 interacts with pD345L, several Flag-tagged truncation mutants containing the KD, LZ or HLH domain of each subunit were constructed as previously described [28] ( Figure 4F and G). A coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed and showed that HA-tagged pD345L was detected in anti-Flag antibody-precipitated KD or HLH domain of IKK\u03b1 ( Figure 4H ) and LZ domain of IKK\u03b2 ( Figure 4I ), which suggested that pD345L might target IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 to suppress NF-\u03baB signalling. While the expression level of the IKK\u03b1 (371-500) truncation mutant was quite low, we cannot rule out the possibility that the IKK\u03b1 (371-500) truncation mutant could also interact with pD345L.",

            "text": "KD, LZ and HLH defective mutants of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 retain little or no I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation activity, and either IKK\u03b1 or IKK\u03b2 alone is able to mediate I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation [29] . Since pD345L interacts with the KD and HLH domains of IKK\u03b1 and the LZ domain of IKK\u03b2, we suspected that pD345L may directly target IKK to suppress its kinase activity towards I\u03baB\u03b1. To address this possibility, the kinase assay was performed with purified pD345L, I\u03baB\u03b1, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 obtained by immunoprecipitation with or without ATP that provides a phosphate group necessary for the phosphorylation reaction to determine the newly formed p-I\u03baB\u03b1. The results showed that in the absence of ATP, almost no p-I\u03baB\u03b1 was detected, while in the presence of ATP, p-I\u03baB\u03b1 was obviously increased when reacting with IKK\u03b1 or IKK\u03b2, but the increase in p-I\u03baB\u03b1 was prohibited by pD345L ( Figure 5A ). In addition, upon treatment with an increasing concentration of pD345L, IKK\u03b1\u2212 or IKK\u03b2-activated p-I\u03baB\u03b1 was gradually decreased ( Figure 5B ). To further confirm these results, a D345L expression vector or empty vector was transfected into WSL cells followed by TNF\u03b1 stimulation at the indicated time points. Immunoblotting results showed that p-I\u03baB\u03b1 was decreased at 0 and 30 min post-TNF\u03b1 treatment, and conversely, the total I\u03baB\u03b1 level was increased at 0 and 60 min post-TNF\u03b1 treatment ( Figure 5C ). This suggests that pD345L overexpression inhibited TNF\u03b1-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, and thus, the total I\u03baB\u03b1 level was recovered, which would prevent NF-\u03baB release from I\u03baB\u03b1. Consistent with these findings, ASFV infection-stimulated NF-\u03baB activation (I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation) was attenuated along with pD345L expression in PAM cells (Figure 5D ). Next, p65 translocation was examined in WSL cells with or without pD345L expression. The results showed that p65 translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after TNF\u03b1 treatment; however, it remained in the cytoplasm of cells expressing pD345L ( Figure 5E ). The percentage of intranuclear p65 in pD345L-positive cells was significantly decreased compared with that in pD345L-negative cells ( Figure 5F ). Therefore, these findings indicate that pD345L directly inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation through association with IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, further suppressing p65 nuclear translocation.",

To investigate whether the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity relies on pD345L exonuclease activity, a D345L catalytic mutant (D345L-CM) was constructed ( Figure 6A ). In D345L-CM, aspartic acid 108 (D108), glutamic acid 144 (E144), and lysine 146 (K146) were replaced with alanine (A) based on the residues in the lambda phage exonuclease catalytic centre [30] . A dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted on cells transfected with of D345L or D345L-CM along with cGAS/STING or TBK1 and showed that pD345L-CM was still able to suppress the activation of the IFN\u03b2 promoter ( Figures 6B and C) and NF-\u03baB-Luc ( Figure 6D ). Consistent with these findings, stimulation of IFN\u03b2 mRNA expression by 2\u20323'cGAMP was attenuated by both pD345L and pD345L-CM in WSL cells ( Figure 6E ). To confirm these results, D345L N-or C-terminal truncation mutants with or without the exonuclease domain (D345L-N and D345L-C) were constructed. Unfortunately, D345L-N could not be expressed in 293 T cells. Therefore, D345L-C was used for the NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter assay and RT-PCR. The results showed that pD345L-C was still capable of inhibiting NF-\u03baB signalling ( Figure 6F ) and IFN\u03b2 production ( Figure 6G ). Finally, a coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed to detect the interaction between pD345L-C and IKK. The results showed that HA-IKK\u03b1 and HA-IKK\u03b2 were detected in anti-Flag antibody-precipitated pD345L or pD345L-C ( Figures 6H and I) .",

However, the development of an effective vaccine is largely hindered due to the limited knowledge of protective antigens and the interaction between ASFV and host immune responses. NF-\u03baB signalling plays a critical role in the innate immune system by controlling the transcription of antiviral genes, including IFNs, cytokines, chemokines and their modulators and immunoreceptors, and genes involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis and stress response. Therefore, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to disrupt the NF-\u03baB signalling cascade to guarantee efficient replication. The kinase activity of the IKK protein complex (IKK\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3) is essential for NF-\u03baB activation and has thus become a common target of many viruses. For example, the influenza A virus NS1 protein targets the kinase domain (KD) of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, blocking IKK\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in the canonical pathway and IKK\u03b1mediated processing of the precursor protein p100 to p52 in the noncanonical pathway [31] . In addition, the vaccinia virus (VACV) B14 protein inhibits IKK\u03b2 activation by binding to its KD and its scaffold and dimerization domain (SDD) [32] [33] [34] . Moreover, the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) MC160 protein is capable of inhibiting IKK complex formation [35] .",

Importantly, we demonstrated that along the NF-\u03baB signalling cascade, pD345L specifically targets the IKK complex by interacting with the KD and HLH domains of IKK\u03b1 ( Figure 4H ) and the LZ domain of IKK\u03b2 ( Figure 4I ). Although the structures of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 are similar, the conformations of the IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 truncation mutants may not be identical. Each protein has a distinct binding preference. IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 share only 52% amino acid similarity, which may cause IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 differential binding to pD345L. Previous reports showed that the LZ domain is required for proper formation of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 homodimers or heterodimers, and the LZ domain or HLH motif defective mutants of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 block their kinase activities [29, 36, 37] . Interestingly, we found that in the presence of pD345L, I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation by IKK was decreased ( Figures 5A  and B) . To our knowledge, this is the first time that any ASFV protein was able to block IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 kinase activity through protein-protein interactions.",

For example, IKK\u03b2 promotes the transcription of antiapoptotic genes in the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway; in contrast, IKK inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylating the proapoptotic proteins PUMA at serine 10 and Bad at serine 26 [39, 40] . In addition, active IKK subunits stimulate autophagy, and knockout of IKK\u03b2 inhibits the activation of autophagy in mice [41] . The autophagyrelated proteins ATG16L1 (autophagy-related 16-like 1) and AMBRA1 (autophagy and beclin-1 regulator 1) were identified as IKK substrates [42, 43] . It has been shown that precise manipulation of host cell apoptosis by ASFV is critical to accomplish different infection stages of its life cycle [44] [45] [46] . However, autophagy is not required for ASFV replication, and autophagosome formation is inhibited upon ASFV infection [47] . Therefore, by modulating IKK activity, pD345L possibly regulates multiple biological pathways. Whether pD345L suppresses the kinase activity of IKK towards PUMA, Bad or other substrates to regulate apoptosis or autophagy in ASFV-infected cells needs to be further explored.",

Conventional vaccine development approaches have been shown to be inapplicable to ASFV [50, 51] . Neither subunit nor DNA vaccine provides efficient protection [52] . Genedeleted live-attenuated vaccine (LAV) candidates render adequate protection by eliciting both humoral and cellular immunity, but the establishment of chronic or persistent infection in vaccinated animals and the risk of recombination with field strains are unsolved key issues. Here, we showed that D345L is not only an essential gene for ASFV replication but also inhibits the host immune response, which may explain why LAVs maintain immune evasion ability but to a lesser extent. To overcome LAV-induced persistent infection, one potential strategy is to generate replication-defective viruses, thus limiting or abrogating viral replication in animals by targeting replication-essential viral genes. Given the dual role of pD345L in viral replication and immune evasion, it may constitute a potential target for the development of replication-defective viral vaccines.",
