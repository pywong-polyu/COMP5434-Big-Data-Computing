            "text": "This chapter will use the framework of institutional change outlined in the previous chapter and apply it to a case study of US labor institutions. Firstly, we will research the institutions in their formal, informal, and avoidable iterations. In short, the USA is a political-economic system which traditionally hinges on market-based institutional solutions to social and economic issues. As shown in Chapter 3, this is a trait it shares with other developed countries with a Common Law tradition (i.e. Canada, Ireland, UK, Australia, and New Zealand). In terms of labor institutions this suggests the absence of strong unions, low peak levels of collective bargaining, flexible labor laws, etc. In terms of formal institutions, this traditional orientation of the USA was softened in the 1930s through the labor components of the New Deal (Wagner Act and FLSA) which guaranteed some federal level labor rights including the right to collective bargaining and strike unfettered by federal courts. Many of these rights have been reduced in subsequent decades, and the USA is today the developed country with the least protected labor markets. In terms of informal institutions, the collective bargaining structure is decentralized and both bargaining coverage and union density, never high to begin with, are consistently dropping. In terms of avoidable institutions, it seems that many employers are able to habitually ignore even the modest regulation in place. Also, a potential result is a very high-income inequality, with no strong union presence to cause similar wages. Secondly, this chapter will examine the possible drivers of change. Institutional change in the case of the US labor institutions 1980-2019 seems to point to a continued deregulation of an already relatively deregulated system. Most importantly, this chapter will argue for the role that the systemic cycle and the extensive developmental strategy played in causing this type of stable change.",

In the context of the labor market, these correspond to: formal institutions (Labor Law and other laws governing labor organization and collective bargaining), informal institutions (uncodified practices in collective bargaining which may be under strong influence of power relations, and the degree of centralization of negotiations) and avoidable institutions (selectively applied regulation or practice that does not follow the law). We will survey these in turn.",

Table 6 .1 brings the formal landmark events which have contributed to the modern labor institutions. Some of them fall far beyond our timeframe, but they are either still in force, or contribute to the context of change of labor institutions in the USA. As we can see from Table 6 .1, the drama of formal institutional change has largely played out by the post-1980 timeframe that interests us. The crucial period of labor organization was the New Deal which brought American labor the Wagner Act which institutionalized collective bargaining and strikes. Already in 1947, many formal stipulations of the Wagner Act were repudiated by the Taft-Hartley Act, banning strikes for federal employees and closed shops (plants/factory floors which only employ union members) and closely regulating union shops (shops which accept non-members provided they become members Commonwealth v Hunt A court decision legalizing trade unions-before they would have been seen as a conspiracy to raise wages 1890",

This was clearly a set of anti-labor-oriented regulations in the sense of curbing associational power of labor (i.e. the power of unions). However, the following decades brought numerous improvements to labor standards and worker rights (Civil Rights Act in 1965 for anti-discrimination, OSHA in 1970 for workplace safety, ERISA in 1974 for the pensions system, FMLA in 1993 for family leave, and Affordable Care Act in 2010 for the health system). These improvements did not change the general framework for labor organizing, apart from the FLRA in 1978 which guaranteed collective bargaining rights to federal employees. 1 In this sense, there were no substantial changes to report in the post-1980 period. In fact, what is conspicuous is the absence of a labor re-regulation. In 1978, the Carter administration narrowly failed to enact legislation intended to promote labor organization as the business community successfully outspent and out-lobbied organized labor in influencing the US Congress. The effort passed the House of Representatives but was successfully filibustered in the Senate (Hacker and Pierson 2010: 127-132) . The Clinton administration failed to pass its Worker Fairness Acts in 1993. It would have protected the striking workers from being permanently replaced but was likewise defeated by a Republican filibuster (Early 2013: 82) . Finally, another hypothetical pro-labor piece of legislation was the Employee Free Choice Act, which could have enabled easier organization of Unions by supplanting the restricting secret ballot in place since 1959 with a simpler card check. The possible effort to pass EFCA was essentially avoided during the Obama administration. We can also benefit by observing comparative instruments which can help us compare the US system to those found elsewhere. Consistently with our analysis, such data shows that the USA has had a consistently deregulated labor market, without any substantial change in the observed period. OECD publishes the EPL index for regular and temporary employment. The index for regular employment weighs items like the difficulty of dismissal, length of mandatory notice period, and size of severance pay to gauge the levels of legal protection of the labor market. In the USA, these index for individual dismissal of individual workers is the lowest measured by the OECD at the index value of 0.09 (possible values are 0-6). This is due to the fact that workers (excepting public sector or union members) are employed according to the at-will principle, which does not foresee the possibility of an unfair dismissal, barring discrimination according to creed, sex, race, impairments, etc. There are no federally mandated notification procedures 2 (with some state jurisdictions requiring service letters be issued explaining the reasons for the dismissal) and no legal regulations covering the right to a notice period at dismissal (OECD 2020).",

In this index, the USA is also at the bottom of comparative rankings of protection. Among stable results, it is tied for the least protected market with Canada, UK, and Ireland at the index value of 0.25 (with possible values also at 0-6) as there are no limits to duration or successive numbers of contracts. Both of these indices remain unchanged during the entire duration of the OECD time series in the 1985-2019 period (OECD 2020). Another index is published by the Heritage Foundation yearly as the labor freedom index. Heritage is a free-market-oriented policy-advocacy group, and its conception of free labor is essentially oriented toward labor flexibility, i.e. the absence of labor protection. The items weighed to construct the labor freedom index are \"Ratio of minimum wage to the average value-added per worker, Hindrance to hiring additional workers, Rigidity of hours, Difficulty of firing redundant employees, Legally mandated notice period, and Mandatory severance pay\" (Heritage 2020a ). According to this index, the USA has one of the most free labor markets in 2020 (87.9/100 with the global average at 59.6), trailing only Singapore, Brunei, and Hong Kong (Heritage 2020b) . This is in itself a slight drop since 2015-the index was first calculated in 2005, with values in most years of its first decade fluctuating around 95% (Heritage 2020c) . Such fluctuations are possible as the index includes legal categories (slow to change, and as seen by the EPL index unchanged since 1985) as well as economic ones (average value-added per worker, which may change rapidly).",

As shown in Table 6 .1, the conduct of collective bargaining has been legal and encouraged in the private sector since 1935 and in the public sector since 1978-although such encouragement was less enthusiastic than in Europe. In theory, the 1930s changes in formal institutions created a framework of \"soft corporatism\" for informal institutions, but it turned to be \"largely a mirage\" (Godard 2009: 92) , as union density increased only from 13% in 1936 to 36% in 1945 which was to prove to be the historical peak (ibid.: 91). The level at which collective bargaining takes place is also indicative of the coordination in the institutional system. As we will see in the next chapter, CME countries tend to have more centralized levels of collective bargaining, which is conducted at the cross-industry level or more commonly in recent years on the level of the entire sector or industry. The cause may be a high union density (or share of the workforce represented by unions) which lends necessary legitimacy to unions, and the effect is a high bargaining coverage for both members and non-members of unions. In the USA, the appropriate level of collective bargaining is determined by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which seems to favor a very decentralized structure with bargaining most often taking place at the level of the enterprise. In fact, the ICTWSS database invariably classifies the predominant level of collective bargaining in the USA as the enterprise level through the entire duration of the series 1960-2018 (Visser 2019).",

The result is that a typical NLRB union election (determining the union which is to conduct bargaining) will take place in the context of employer intimidation and various delays caused by expensive litigation (Brudney 2005: 108) . This could essentially be described as class warfare directed at diminishing the associational power of labor. If the unions are present, they may well be seen merely as drags on profitability by the employers, and obstacles to overall market efficiency of the firm. This view is in stark contrast to those found in CMEs as we will see in the next chapter.",

However, it is also visible in the inability of unions to postpone or prevent adverse change in institutionalized practices like the shift from temporary to permanent layoff as prevalent policy in the 1980s (Jung 2017) . This system of low-strength unions combined with the militant anti-union stance of the employers to produce a large low-wage sector. OECD defines low wages as a proportion of workers earning less than two-thirds of median earnings. In the observed post-1980 period, the lowest proportion of low-wage work was in 1983 when it stood at an already high 20.4% and it gradually grew to 25.2% in 2012 after which it fell to 24.1% in 2018 and 23.4% in 2019 (OECD 2020).

            "text": "The third Northian aspect of institutions are the avoidable ones. This is a particularly important element to bear in mind in the context of the US system. Elsewhere, strong unions, present work councils, and rigid laws offer various types of protection of workers who have been treated unfairly. In the USA, the mistreated worker (i.e. a worker whose employer has avoided a labor regulation) often has the expensive court system as the only recourse. This means that a low-wage earner will not be able to react if labor rights or contractual obligations are not honored by the employer. It should therefore not be surprising that many lowwage workers report violations of their labor rights. A fairly large 2008 study surveyed 4387 workers in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York on conditions in the week prior to questioning and found that 26% report minimum wage violations, 76% of overtime workers report overtime violations, and 70% report meal break violations. A substantial 68% of all workers have reported at least one pay-related violation in the past week. This study suggests that even the low level of labor regulation in the USA is easily avoided among the low-wage earners. In fact, workers often did not even attempt to fight for their rights: 50% of those who informed their employers of a workplace injury suffered an illegal reaction (the employer fired the worker for filing the claim or instructed the worker not to file it). As a result, only 8% of the injured workers filed a compensation claim. When the workers attempted to form a union or made complaints to their employer or a governmental body, 43% of them experienced an illegal reaction with employer firing, suspending, reducing worker hours or pay (Bernhardt et al. 2009 ; see also Thelen 2014: 45) . The worker groups most likely to experience the pay-related violations were women and foreign-born workers, and the authors estimate the average loss at 15% of earnings (Bernhardt et al. 2009: 5) . Another important area is the absence of discrimination, and the discrimination against women is a very visible and easily verifiable area. While there are many legal protections of pay equality, these are obviously avoidable to some extent. The World Economic Forum attempts to measure the gender wage gaps comparatively with its \"The Global Gender Gap Index.\" This index examines the gender gap in several areas: \"Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival and Political Empowerment\" (WEF 2016a). This index ranked the USA 45th in its 2016 index (compared to German 13th and Chinese 99th rank), fairing particularly poorly in political empowerment. In the survey rate of wage equality for similar work in which the USA ranked 66th globally with index score of 0.653 (WEF 2016b).",

            "text": "The first channel of institutional change identified in Chapter 3 is path dependence as determined by institutional starting positions. Most of the definitions of institutions covered by Chapter 3 stress the stability of institutions. In other words, the best indicator of the future state of institutions would be the previous state of institutions. One of the channels of institutional stability is the power-based path dependence stressed by Pierson (2015) . According to this perspective, power tends to accumulate as those with power have the resources to influence policy outcomes which allow them to accrue more power. In this sense, the USA always had relatively low union power and lacked strong coordinating capacities in industrial relations. The trajectory of liberalization in recent decades saw a collapse of existing unions and collective bargaining and erosion of real values of statutory minimum wages and benefits (Thelen 2014: 37-47) . This is precisely why it was repeatedly classified as a liberal market in various typologies (LME, Atlantic capitalism, liberal welfare state). This institutional starting position was the prerequisite of a pronounced and continued deregulation. Had the unions been stronger, they could strive to prevent this departure from an organized labor market. As they were already weak, the various drivers of economic change which pointed to a decrease in coordination could not be prevented. This interpretation suggests that a strong path-dependent element is at play with LME structures pronouncedly vulnerable to direct deregulatory and/or decoordinatory tendencies. This is the reason why Thelen considers displacement as a typical process conveying pure deregulation or a direct attack on the existing institutional arrangements, largely descriptive of US liberalization (Thelen 2014: 13) . Considering this finding in the light of relative power of interested parties, it becomes clear that institutions are displaced if the defenders of status quo are considerably weaker than its attackers. Labor organization in the USA was already weak and this enabled the swift disassembly of labor institutions once it was triggered (see drivers below). It is this dual determination that creates a conceptual confusion: starting institutions have their winners in those actors that accrue power through the institutional solutions. In order to enact pressure toward change or preservation of these institutions, policy advocates must have power. This point would drive us toward the conclusion that institutions are inherently stable-as those who are benefited by the present institutions are abler to drive change that those who are not. This point has been well taken by both old and new institutionalism, and the essential result is the dependence on exogenous change (i.e. critical junctures creating punctuated equilibria as shown in Chapter 3). We must move beyond this view and recognize path dependence in its proper context. The next segment broadens the lens in order to notice and endogenize further, Arrighian drivers of change.",

The USA is a paradigmatic LME structure, which has very low labor resources and a history of decentralized bargaining. Such a system accrues political power of the employers rather than trade unions and the ability to influence institutional change is therefore concentrated beyond the reach of organized labor to begin with. (b) Phase of the systemic cycle: the lack of focus on labor protection and the importance of industry have enabled a shift into finance expansion to take place without much resilience from the productive/manufacturing sector of the economy, which was neglected in terms of power which organized labor could muster, embedded as it was within it. (c) Developmental strategy: the USA did not have a notable shift in its developmental strategy since 1980. The growth model was always consumption driven and labor has always been relatively deregulated, and the systemic cycle has already shifted to a finance expansion. The result is a severe drag on GDP growth, as production was in the aggregate kept neither for domestic nor for foreign markets and trade deficits soared. (d) The result of institutional change: path dependence tends to produce institutional end-results similar to starting positions. This was the case in the USA as the deregulating path was undertaken in an already relatively deregulated context, essentially continuing and exacerbating the free market LME tendencies in labor markets. Figure 6 .2 outlines the second channel of institutional change. The five drivers it incorporates are technological change (an exogenous factor providing a long-term context), three drivers constituting the systemic cycle-the phase of the systemic cycle, developmental strategies and trade relations-and the power relations as the balance of power resources. These interactions are explored in greater detail through the rest of this segment, organized by specific discussions of the five drivers in this channel.",

The first such driver is technological change. Chapter 5 explained the distinction between the cumulative and development aspects of technology. The cumulative aspects are a matter of technological innovations which enable a more efficient production and in effect, less labor used per same output. The developmental aspect is a matter of choosing the appropriate technology and implementing it. From the western perspective, the developmental aspect was a matter of continuous capital deepening which enabled shifts in sectoral composition of employment as shown in Fig. 6 .3. The US strategy of Taylorization (which Silver would treat as a technological fix) could be interpreted as one of the building blocks of the LME alternative (Thelen 2014: 38) . With a greater shop-floor division of labor, skill sets could be non-specific. This rationalization of space and movement created productivity gains which were not dependent on high union density, corporatist structures, or protective labor market regulation in order to function.",

We could claim the same for the effects of introduction of tractors on agricultural employment or the effects of the introduction of the Spinning Jenny machine on outdated weaving jobs. Frey and Osborne (2013) estimate that 47% of all occupations are at a high risk of replacement through computerization. These losses are dominated by administrative support, sale, and service jobs (ibid.: 37). If these jobs were not replaced by others, we may have a significant issue with what Keynes called \"technological unemployment\" (Keynes 1930 (Keynes /2009 , which we know today under the more familiar term of structural unemployment. But, in spite of his usual far-sightedness, he did not foresee large shifts in sectoral employment as his classical essay Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren (ibid.) was notoriously wrong on this point. The current short-term anxiety may also be at fault. More relevant for our purpose, these sectoral shifts have a power-related issue of attached union density which is related to skill specificity, and in this sense, we must turn to plotting the relationships of technology and labor power.",

(b) Developmental strategy: technological process innovations may create incentives for new development models, but this did not happen in the USA. The new labor-saving production methods including robotics and IT can be seen as a continuation of skilledlabor avoiding Taylorism which was omnipresent as a production strategy. The growth model was consumption-led at least since the end of World War II, but the shifts in productivity eventually made it uncompetitive in foreign markets causing a greater role for imports in satisfying this demand.

It would also describe the increasingly intricate behavior of global supply chains with the center of the world-economy moving elsewhere through globalization in the long-term aftermath of the signal crisis. This gives us an appreciation of the assumptions of the systemic cycle theory in that the manufacturing labor was not as necessary for the core reproduction processes of the US economy after 1973 (although the reduction of manufacture logically went hand in hand with the rising trade deficits and the rise of new global production centers). In being increasingly superfluous, the power of manufacturing labor to theoretically strike or organize became less of a threat, adding therefore to the decreasing power of labor visible in the declining union density rates.",

Thirdly, as already mentioned, the analysis of Greta Krippner (2005 Krippner ( , 2011 was a direct attempt to follow Arrighi and complement his theory with an empirical measurement of corporate profits from National Income and Product Accounts. Her findings show that in the 1950-2001 period the share of manufacturing profits dropped from around 50% to around 10%, and that the share of Finance, Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE) profits climbed from about 10% in 1950 to about 45% in 2001 (Krippner 2005: 179) . This shows empirically what Arrighi meant theoretically with the flight of capital into finance. The outcome is supposedly a deindustrialization (as financial resources are increasingly tied into non-productive investments). While deindustrialization is a result of numerous factors, the days of US material expansion are certainly long gone. Figures of manufacturing value-added as a percentage show a slow and steady drop from 16.1% in 1997 (time-series beginning) to 11.1% in 2017 (World Bank 2020). With market capitalization recovering since the drops of 2000-2002 and 2008 (and a far better performance of the stock markets compared to the real economy in 2020) and the deindustrialization continuing its slow pace, it seems that the US finance expansion is essentially continuing.",

Large deficits were mostly visible in the context of substantial real growth (mid-1980s and mid-2000s) , the tendency to diminishing the deficit was visible in the context of real GDP contractions (1991 and 2009) . Overall, the current account deficit expanded in the 1980s, briefly stabilized in 1991, and then substantially and consistently grew until 2006 (when it stood at \u2212 6% GDP) since when it readjusted to a lower level (mostly in the \u22122% to \u22123% range since 2009). To better grasp these trends, Fig. 6 .6 disaggregates this data on absolute figures of imports and exports in goods and services in current USD. This level of data shows the deficits of the mid-1980s and mid-2000s in absolute terms-and can also observe that the diminishing current account deficit was largely a matter of a growing GDP, as both imports and exports recovered very quickly after 2009. 5 The incentive structure for labor coordination and regulation under these conditions is the exacerbation of trends already described. In short, the fact that labor is not globally competitive leads to a trade deficit and a shift of domestic capital into finance. This means that a hypothetical strike of American manufacturing workers can no longer paralyze the economy. It can merely incentivize the employers to shift the production into a different location. This was the logic of the now somewhat anachronistic race-to-the-bottom hypothesis. Nevertheless, the power of the unions to act must in general be lower in countries with large trade deficits as these countries already have domestic labor which is replaceable by imports. So, this shift into deficits joined the other five drivers, all of which pointed in the direction of further commodification of US labor.",

A supply-side strategy hinges on low costs of labor and the export market, while a demand-side strategy hinges on the development of domestic markets and can therefore put a lower importance of low production costs. This shift from regimes to strategies allows us to move beyond simple determinism and see that the form in which the economic system reproduces itself, constricted by many drivers of change, but ultimately determined by none of them alone. The intensive strategy is synonymous with the Fordist regime of accumulation/Keynesian welfare state which typified the US economy until the 1970s, while the extensive strategy is the normative free market orientation since the 1970s, here explained as a consequence of the systemic cycle. Specifically, the development strategy takes place in the context of the phase of the systemic cycle: while the material expansion creates the dilemma between labor-compensation-as-cost and labor-compensationas-demand (as we will see in the next two chapters), the financial expansion faced by the USA is oriented toward profitability. This creates a situation in which labor is in a similar position to an extensive strategy in a material expansion, but the consumption is in a similar position to an intensive strategy in a material expansion. This is essentially the face of an extensive strategy during financial expansions. Figure 6 .7 shows the growing discrepancy between wage-related income and domestic consumption.",

The difference in the two curves is logically made up of any domestic spending that is derived from non-wage-related earnings (rents, interest, debt). We can see that the trend of the two lines is essentially divergence since 1970. In 1970 their difference was 9.1%, and in 2018 it was at 25%. In our interpretation, this is due to the intensive (Fordist/Keynesian) strategy favored the development of internal markets, while the extensive (Washington consensus) strategy favors the development of export capabilities at the detriment of labor costs and therefore of the domestic market. The discrepancy is made possible partially due to the explosion of household debt both in absolute terms and relative to GDP (as a GDP percentage, it more than doubled in the 1984-2008 period landing on 99% GDP in Q1 2008; Trading Economics 2018; FRED 2018) . 6 This comparison also hides the increasing divergence between the low wages of workers whom we could imagine seeking the protection of laws and unions and the increasingly high wages of top managers-with the aggregate consumption not necessarily reflecting the low-wage sector. We can confront issues of inequality in Sect. 6.4, but for now we are interested merely in the aggregates-i.e. in the relative motors of growth. Figure 6 .8 tracks the demand composition in the USA as a manifestation of the developmental strategy. We can observe that household expenditure is by far the largest in terms of demand. Changes in the composition worked to accentuate this trend with household demand increased by 7.9% in the 1981-2018 period, investment demand decreased by 4.1% from the peak level of 1984 to 2018 and the effect of net trade was consistently negative, at a modest \u22120.6% in 1992, gradually reached a low-point of \u22125.5% in 2006 and somewhat corrected since to \u22122.9% GDP by 2019. The growth model has therefore been led by domestic consumption in the entirety of the timeframe and more so over time. However, this was largely funded by growing levels of debt and has resulted in a large trade deficit.",

In terms of modes of change, this explanation of diminishing labor power as a mechanism of change in labor institutions is compatible with Thelen's idea of institutional change as displacement we accentuated in the context of the path-dependent channel of change. In the cyclical power relations channel we can achieve a slight zoom-in into the mechanics of the changing power relations beyond what interested Kathleen Thelen. However, the central point remains untouched-the institutions have a specific and unambiguous path of change provided there is a significant asymmetry of power.

The politics of USA are somewhat impervious to both transnational and unilateral domestic pressures, and this channel of institutional change is characterized by incremental reform. In terms of formal electoral and party politics, the USA are a democratic system with a first-past-the-post electoral system which favors a two-party system, as the smaller candidates (third parties) are mostly ruled out. The two modern parties are the Democratic Party which traditionally favored relatively more comprehensive regulation and social/labor rights and the Republican Party, which is relatively more free market oriented. On the federal level the formal US politics are conducted through the institutions of the President, the Senate, and the House of Representatives (which are the two Houses of the US Congress), with relatively high levels of political powers awarded to the President, making it a presidential system. In the Reagan Administration (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) , the Republican president faced a democratic majority in the House of Representatives but had a Republican majority in Senate for the first six years. In the George H. W. Bush Republican administration (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) the Democratic Party had majorities in both Houses.

These setbacks were made possible by the practice of filibustering, which is an obstruction mechanism, particularly effective in the US Senate where a minority can prevent legislation to be voted upon by exercising the unlimited right to hold the floor. To prevent the filibuster on legislation, the majority must have a supermajority of 60 out of 100 seats in the US Senate for a procedure known as cloture. This is not a typical situation and has not occurred in the Senate in the timeframe of interest to us here. This creates a situation in which even a party which dominates the legislative procedure often has to compromise and build a consensus over its proposals with at least some members of the opposite party. Large and controversial reforms are not a likely outcome in such a system, as they require substantial political resources even after a very successful election. Additionally, recent scholarship (Gilens 2012; Gilens and Page 2014; Page and Gilens 2020) suggests that the expectations of direct connection between parties and their constituencies (e.g. the connection between the Democratic Party and organized labor) may be somewhat na\u00efve in the US case. The authors analyze an impressively large database on policy preferences at different income groups and the policy outcomes and come to the conclusion that the political system is so much more responsive to the most wealthy group as to merit a description of economic elite domination rather than a majoritarian democracy (Gilens and Page 2014) . Likewise, labor unions are far more likely to encounter resistance in areas of their preferences than other interest groups (Gilens 2012: 158) , which certainly curbs their capabilities in lobbying. All of this helps us understand the lack of labor-friendly reforms in the period of interest.",

In a more direct sense, the transnational organization which is charged with promoting labor standards is the ILO (International Labor Organization) by the UN.

            "text": "This channel brings us to an interesting dilemma in terms of modes of change. While we have accepted Thelen's view of labor institutional change in the USA as displacement in the first two channels, we must now take into account an alternative conceptualization. Hacker and Pierson (2010) forward the notion of institutional change in US labor as a form of drift. The key to their finding is the fact that the formal political process found itself in a gridlock after 1978 in matters concerning labor, which allowed for the economic processes to eat away at the power of the unions and no federal action to manifest itself to prevent it. The government has left the arena and the world changed around the old and increasingly ineffective institutions (ibid.: 56-61). The key level for Hacker and Pierson is therefore the formal political level, covered here as the third channel of institutional change. At that level, they are correct-the conspicuous inability of a redesign of formal institutions on the federal level covered in segment 6.3.1. is a logical prerequisite for the effectiveness of path dependence and power shifts. However, the absence of a redesign of institutions that seems crucial to Hacker and Pierson (named channel 3 here) did not happen in a vacuum-but was itself a result of power relations (channel 2) within the existing set of institutions (channel 1). Also, labor institutions on national levels of large countries are far too complex for their change to be governed by a single mode of change. Thelen is right to point to displacement in describing the long-term shifts, while Hacker and Pierson are right to point to drift while describing the effects of the political process taking a shorter term to develop. This chapter has taken both into account within the broader logic supplying also a cyclical notion of labor power shifts. Overall, the three channels in the US case of labor institutions provided a ripe terrain for the path dependence dominance, inasmuch as it defined the power to influence institutional design and the starting position of power shifts. Figure 6 .10 summarizes these liberalizing tendencies.",

            "text": "One of the most common arguments in favor of flexible labor markets is the ostensibly lower unemployment rate caused by the fact that employing is easy and filled with less uncertainty. If a labor market is more heavily regulated, then dismissals are more complicated. Therefore, less regulation should cause the employers to more readily employ, as little cost is connected with a dismissal should the situation change. However, it also causes them to more easily terminate employment when demand is low (e.g. in a crisis). Figure 6 .11 shows these links in the case of the USA since 1980. Unemployment seems to closely respond to GDP growth in the case of the USA. There are four pronounced slowdowns or downturns of growth on the chart: 1982; 1991; 2001; and 2008/2009 . All four were accompanied by quick and sharp increases in unemployment, which is in accordance with the VofC theory as outlined in Chapter 3 and with state of labor institutions as identified in this chapter. The data for 2020 will not be available for several months at the time of writing, but the most recent IMF estimates place real growth at \u22124.3% and the unemployment rate at 8.9% (IMF 2020). Regardless of the distinct issues of the developing 2020 recession, it seems that the rapid increases of unemployment in response to downturns are to continue. Labor institutions can also have a pronounced impact on income inequality, as strong unions can exert pressure toward a more egalitarian distribution of production income or even a more progressive tax system. An absence of strong unions can easily translate into an insufficiently progressive taxation or lower labor compensation. In terms of the developmental strategies, an intensive strategy would suggest a more egalitarian income structure as the Marginal Propensity to Consume tends to be higher in lower income earners and therefore a higher ratio of additional income will be spent in the lower income groups, contributing to GDP growth. A higher ratio of additional income will be saved rather than consumed in higher income groups contributing to capital accumulation but not directly to GDP growth. An extensive strategy can afford to accept this outcome as it is export oriented. This is one of the reasons why an extensive strategy would involve higher inequality levels. The current US strategy is, however, not oriented on the material expansion (and therefore exports) as it occurs late in the systemic cycle, during a financial expansion. As we have seen, that locks the USA in a growth model which is consumption-led in the face of trade deficits. The rising inequality is here a consequence of the increasing importance of impatient capital and shareholder value orientation (displacement), unmitigated as it remains as deliberate reform remains out of reach (drift).",

            "text": "The most commonly used measurement of income inequality is the GINI index which measures the inequality on an interval of 0 (perfect equality-every person earns exactly the same amount) to 1 (perfect inequality, only one person in a society has any income). Alternatively, GINI indices can be expressed on an interval of 0-100. According to World Bank (2020) data, the GINI index in the USA was at 34.5 in 1979, 37.4 in 1986, 38 in 1991, 40 in 1994, 40.5 in 1997, 40.1 in 2000, 40.3 in 2004, 40.8 in 2007, 40 in 2010, 40.7 in 2013, and 41.1 in 2016. In other words, an unmistakable trend of increasing inequality which increased the levels from moderate to pronounced income inequality. 8 The SWIID database (Solt 2020 ) assembles various GINI measures to 8 Although the GINI indices suggest a slightly reduced income inequality as a result of the Great Recession, this aggregate measure may hide more complex effects. Visser (2018) finds evidence of greater wage polarization and downgrading job quality for male workers produce a continuous time series ensuring greater comparative capabilities among countries. It is an unusual database in that it uses imputation methods, meaning it extrapolates the missing values from existing ones. 9 While this enables unusually continuous coverage, it also may diminish the reliability of any given data point (particularly in countries with scarce coverage). It works well in those intervals and countries which are otherwise well covered and can be safely used for those in discerning general trends of inequality shifts. This makes it well suited for the purposes of these three illustrative chapters as they focus on comparative data and general patterns of change. Figure 6 .12 shows the SWIID central measures of market GINI (inequality of income before taxes and transfers) and disposable income GINI (after taxes and transfers). Both measures were on the rise since 1980, with the market index climbing from 43 in 1980 to 52.4 in 2018, while Nau and Soener (2019) find that income precarity has increased predominantly in working families. 9 For a comparison of available inequality databases see Ferreira et al. (2015) . and the disposable income index climbing from 31.6 in 1980 to 38.7 in 2018. While these figures seem to be lower than the World Bank estimates, the general trend of steadily rising inequality is even more recognizable. It is also interesting to note that the correction between the two indices (i.e. the effect of taxes and transfers) remains substantially the same since 1980 when the correction in index was \u221211.4, passing through \u221212.3 in 2000 and ending at \u221213.7 in 2017. GINI indices are, however, not enough to meaningfully show the differences between specific groups, as they remain imprecise. For that, we will need to compare pre-and post-tax income inequality between the richest and the lower strata.

Direct comparisons should be careful as the methodology in the two sets of data is not identical. Pre-tax data is for income equally split among adults at the household level (presumably ameliorating the situation somewhat), while post-tax data is individual. However, we can clearly compare the trends. We can see that the pre-tax income share of the bottom 50% steadily declined since 1970 (not shown on the graph is the increasing trend until 1970). The pre-tax income share of the top 1% was steady until 1980 and then began a sharp climb. The latest available data shows that the pre-tax income of the top 1% is almost 40% larger than the income of the bottom 50%. However, the USA has a progressive taxation system which tends to somewhat ameliorate the income differences (as we have seen comparing the pre-tax and post-tax GINI indices). The tax system has become riddled with various loopholes (see Steinmo 2010 ) and its progressive capacities have been significantly reduced in importance when compared to the 1950s, 10 but it is nevertheless a progressive system. To point at its effects, Fig. 6 .14 shows the post-tax income shares of top 1% and the bottom 50% in the 1970-2019 period.",

The top 1% has likewise remained stable until 1980 (again, not apparent from the graph is the pronounced overall decreasing trend in the preceding decades) followed by a sharp increase of share to the high point of 16.2% in 2012 (and most recently at 15.3% in 2019). In other words, the net incomes of bottom 50% have grown through the 1960s and 1970s and the net income of top 1% has grown in the 1980s and 1990s and 2000s to almost meet at a higher level in the 2010s, effectively contributing to a diminishing middle class. 11 In income shares we can also roughly observe the extent of redistribution as the pre-tax ratio for the top 1% increased by 8.4% since 1980 and the post-tax ratio increased by 6.3%, while the pre-tax ratio of the bottom 50% decreased by 6.6% and the post-tax ratio decreased by 2.3%. An additional way to frame these distributional issues is the comparison of wage and profits ratios, which have essentially followed the same patterns. The ratio of corporate profits to GDP has risen from 7.4% in Q2 1980 to 11.2% in Q3 2018, while the ratio of worker compensation has decreased from 57.1 to 52.8% in the same period (FRED 2019) . This data points to the structural distribution effects of the shifts in power resources discussed above as the continuous decrease in structural and associational power is consistent with a decreased capability of labor to influence income inequality.",

The three channels of institutional change intertwined in the case of the USA to produce a labor hostile institutional environment. The three channels are often at odds with one another as path dependence pushes in a different direction than politically induced reforms or changes in power resources. This was not the case in American labor institutions since 1980 as the primary role was played by a virtually unopposed path dependencepushing institutions in the direction of flexible and market-oriented labor. This continuation of labor deregulation was made possible by the formal political institutions which do not favor large and rapid reforms (disabling a countercurrent via the formal political channel) and by the inability of labor to defend its interests. This was a consequence of a diminishing associational and structural power of labor caused by the shift into postindustrial society, the financial expansion, and trade deficits. In terms of modes of change, this chapter has offered a logic overcoming the discrepancies between the Thelen view (displacement ) and Hacker /Pierson view (drift ) . The framework we utilize develops a process timeframe hierarchy in which it becomes apparent that both descriptions are plausible in their own timeframes, with displacement a long-term interpretation of the general pattern of change in US labor institutions and drift a short-term prerequisite for its development.",

Our approach to institutions helped us discern the reasons for the prevalence of such path dependence. However, decades of continued growth of other large economies and a restructuring of global economy may construct fundamentally different political realities for USA as well. We now turn to two possible rivals for the central position in the world-economy.",

Bush Republican administration, the Republican control of the Houses continued until 2007 (apart from a complex and shifting situation in the 2001-2003 Senate, i.e. the 107th Congress). The Democratic Party again dominated both houses for the 110th and 111th Congress(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011), which was a problem for the last two years of the Bush presidency and a boon for the first two years of the Democratic Obama administration(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017). In the 2011-2015 period Obama lost the control of Congress but kept Senate with a thin Democratic majority. In his last two years (2015-2017), Obama had to deal with a Republican Senate as well. The Republican Trump administration (2017-2021) presided over the 115th Congress with a double Republican majority. In the first approximation, one might expect to see real legislative-institutional change when these three institutions line up, neither restricting the others. Such windows of opportunity existed in the first two Clinton years, the middle four Bush years(2003-2007-108th and 109th Congress), the first two Obama years( -2011, and during Trump's first two years (2017-2019-115th Congress).
