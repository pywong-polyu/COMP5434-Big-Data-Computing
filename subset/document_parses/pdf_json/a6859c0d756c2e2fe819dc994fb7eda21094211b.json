            "text": "Changes to the structure and function of neural networks are thought to underlie the evolutionary adaptation of animal behaviours. Among the many developmental phenomena that generate change programmed cell death (PCD) appears to play a key role. We show that cell death occurs continuously throughout insect neurogenesis and happens soon after neurons are born. Mimicking an evolutionary role for increasing cell numbers, we artificially block PCD in the medial neuroblast lineage in Drosophila melanogaster, which results in the production of 'undead' neurons with complex arborisations and distinct neurotransmitter identities. Activation of these 'undead' neurons and recordings of neural activity in behaving animals demonstrate that they are functional. Focusing on two dipterans which have lost flight during evolution we reveal that reductions in populations of flight interneurons are likely caused by increased cell death during development. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary modulation of death-based patterning could generate novel network configurations.",

            "text": "Nervous systems are exquisitely adapted to the biomechanical and ecological environments in which they operate. How they evolve to be this way is largely unknown. Such changes can occur through modifications in receptor tuning, transmitter/receptor repertoires, neuronal excitability, neuromodulation, structural connectivity, or in the number of neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS). The differences seen in networks, over an evolutionary timescale, ultimately result from heritable changes in developmental processes (Horder, 1989) . Advancing our knowledge of the mechanisms of neural development using comparative approaches will help us understand how specific elements can be modified, how new 'circuits' and behaviours evolve, and will ultimately lead to a better understanding of how nervous systems function (Ramdya and Benton, 2010) . Studies comparing the nervous systems of mammalian species that occupy diverse ecological niches reveal clear differences in the number of cells within homologous brain regions (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014) . Such differences have occurred either through expansion or reduction of specific cell populations, through changes in proliferation or apoptotic programmed cell death (PCD) during development (Charvet et al., 2011) . Most studies of nervous system evolution have focused on stem cell identity and the role of differential proliferation dynamics (Biffar and Stollewerk, 2014; Rakic, 2009; Truman and Ball, 1998) . While one recent study has elegantly shown a role for PCD in the evolution of peripheral olfactory sensory neurons in drosophilids and mosquitoes (Prieto-Godino et al., 2020) , how changes in cell death can modify central circuits still remains an open question.",

            "text": "In the Drosophila embryo a first wave of neurogenesis generates the larval nervous system after which the majority of NBs become quiescent. Following reactivation from quiescence NBs produce neurons throughout larval life until the early pupal stages (Booker and Truman, 1987; Truman and Bate, 1988) . These postembryonic neurons -which make up most of the adult CNS -extend simple neuritic processes into the neuropil and stall until the pupal-adult transition when they grow complex arborisations, synapsing with their target cells (Truman, 1990) . In the VNC, NBs bud off a ganglion mother cell (GMC) which undergoes a terminal division to generate two neurons with distinctly different cell fates (an A cell and a B cell). As the A and B cells result from a single division, one cannot be produced without the other. After several rounds of GMC divisions, a lineage produced by a single NB is composed of two half-lineages: 'hemilineage A' made up of all the A cells and 'hemilineage B' made up of B cells ( Figure 1C ). Hemilineages act as functional units in adult flies (Harris et al., 2015; Lacin et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2010; Shepherd et al., 2016; Shepherd et al., 2019; Truman et al., 2010; Truman et al., 2004) . For example, in the MNB lineage, hemilineage A cells mature into GABAergic local interneurons while hemilineage B cells become efferent octopaminergic neurons. Our previous work showed that a common fate of postembryonic neurons is PCD affecting approximately 40% of VNC hemilineages (Figure 1D,E; Truman et al., 2010) , this is also seen in the brain (Bertet et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2010) . The pattern of PCD is stereotypical and targets the same hemilineages across individuals. Taken together, the breadth of PCD suggests it plays a major role in shaping the final makeup of the adult nervous system, while its stereotypy points towards a heritable genetic basis. We therefore propose that changes in neural circuits may result from heritable alterations in the extent and pattern of PCD in hemilineages. eLife digest Just like a sculptor chips away at a block of granite to make a statue, the nervous system reaches its mature state by eliminating neurons during development through a process known as programmed cell death.",

Rather, the majority of cell death takes place as soon as neurons are born throughout all larval stages, when most of the adult nervous system is built. To gain further insight into the role of this 'early' cell death, the neurons were stopped from dying, showing that these cells were able to reach maturity and function. Together, these results suggest that early cell death may be a mechanism fine-tuned by evolution to shape the many and varied nervous systems of insects.",

            "text": "To mimic such an evolutionary role for PCD, we use the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to block death in one doomed hemilineage. We chose to target the MNB lineage for the following reasons; Its easy-to-locate position made the MNB identifiable in all developing insects described from as early as 1891 by Wheeler, 1891 , and spanning all insect orders from wingless silverfish to locusts, beetles, moths and flies (Bate, 1976; Biffar and Stollewerk, 2014; Booker and Truman, 1987; Doe, 1992; Hartenstein and Campos-Ortega, 1984; Shepherd and Bate, 1990; Tamarelle et al., 1985; Truman and Ball, 1998; Truman and Bate, 1988) . The MNB gives rise to two distinct populations of neurons, one GABAergic and one octopaminergic, which are also homologous across insects (Campbell et al., 1995; Jia and Siegler, 2002; Figure 1 . Early neurogenesis in insects. (A) Cartoon of a young grasshopper embryo, here used as a depiction of a generic insect embryo (modified from Truman, 1996) . Thoracic territory where one segment-worth of neuroectoderm generates an array of neuroblasts (NB) (grey box). (B) Schematic of NB array showing bilaterally symmetric NBs organised in seven rows and six columns and a single median neuroblast (MNB) (modified from Truman, 1996) . (C) Schematic of a lineage derived from an NB. Every NB buds off a ganglion mother cell (GMC) which undergoes a terminal division to generate two neurons with distinct cell fates, an A cell (black) and a B cell (grey). As the A and B cells result from a single division, one cannot be produced without the other. After several rounds of GMC divisions, a lineage produced by a single NB is composed of two half-lineages: 'hemilineage A' made up of all the A cells and 'hemilineage B' made up of B cells. Arrow indicates relative age, with newly born cells located close to the NB. (D) Schematic of MNB during development with 'hemilineage A' cells (black) and 'hemilineage B' (grey). The first neurons in hemilineage B cells survive (they are the oldest). After this point, all hemilineage B cells are removed by PCD whereas 'hemilineage A' cells from the same GMC division are left intact. (E) Schematic representation of the pattern of hemilineage-specific cell death in one hemisegment in the mesothorax. Each circle represents one lineage produced by one NB. Numbers represent postembryonic lineage nomenclature established by Truman et al., 2004 . Shaded half circle refers to doomed hemilineage. Lineage 0 is the postembryonic name given to the MNB lineage. Asterisks mark lineages in which one hemilineage produces motor neurons and the other hemilineage generates glia (Enriquez et al., 2018; Lacin and Truman, 2016) . Lacin et al., 2019; Pfl\u00fcger and Stevenson, 2005; Rowell, 1976; Siegler and Pankhaniya, 1997; Siegler et al., 2001; Siegler et al., 1991; Stevenson and Sp\u00f6 rhase-Eichmann, 1995; Thompson and Siegler, 1991; Witten and Truman, 1998 ). There appears to be a relationship between cell number and function in these populations. Flying insects have greater numbers of octopaminergic neurons within segments that control wings (Stevenson and Sp\u00f6 rhase-Eichmann, 1995) , while grasshoppers have more GABAergic neurons in the fused metathoracic/abdominal ganglia, where they receive auditory input from the abdomen (Witten and Truman, 1998; Thompson and Siegler, 1991) . Alongside differences in numbers of the same cell type between segments and species, numbers of GABAergic and octopaminergic neurons found in one segment are never equal. This is especially intriguing as during development each GABAergic neuron is a sister cell to an octopaminergic neuron, arising from one cell division and are produced in equal number (see Figure 1C ). The greater number of GABAergic cells in each segment results from PCD targeting octopaminergic neurons in both grasshoppers (Jia and Siegler, 2002) and fruit flies (Truman et al., 2010 ) (see Figure 1D ). Pieced together, these data suggest that, at least in part, the evolution of some behaviours can be explained by variation in the number of octopaminergic neurons caused by PCD during MNB development.",

All octopaminergic neurons produce tyramine as well, the precursor of octopamine, and tyramine has also been shown to induce fictive walking and flight in a thoracic preparation in locusts (Rillich et al., 2013) . Throughout our work, we do not discriminate between the role of tyramine and octopamine release from hemilineage 0B and collectively refer to these neurons as octopaminergic. Consistent with its role in both (1) walking and (2) flight, we show that (1) blocking PCD in the octopaminergic hemilineage produced by the MNB in Drosophila melanogaster results in mature differentiated 'undead' neurons that survive into adulthood, elaborate complex arborisations and induce walking when activated; and (2) PCD may be responsible for reducing hemilineage 0B in the mesothorax of the flightless swift louse Crataerina pallida. Alongside, we propose that PCD may have caused reductions in flight hemilineages within thoracic networks in another true fly, Braula coeca (the bee louse), during the evolution of flightlessness. Additionally, using new tools in D. melanogaster, we demonstrate that PCD takes place in these neurons early, very soon after they are born. We find evidence of this early PCD in primitively wingless firebrats and hippoboscid louseflies suggesting that it is deployed widely. This 'early' death is categorically different to the neuronal death described in the majority of studies in insects, that focus on hormonally gated PCDs occurring at moults (Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2016) .",

The majority of studies on neuronal PCD in insects have focused on its role at metamorphic transitions, where death eliminates fully differentiated neurons either at puparium formation (Truman et al., 1994) or in adults post-eclosion (Draizen et al., 1999; Kimura and Truman, 1990) . Both of these remodelling events are gated by ecdysteroids. However, our previous observations in Drosophila (Truman et al., 2010) , together with studies in the fly brain (Nordlander and Edwards, 1968; Kumar et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2010; Lovick et al., 2017) , made us consider that hemilineage-specific PCD takes place early, in newly born neurons. So far, the dynamics of cell death has been difficult to evaluate on a cell-by-cell basis within a complex nervous system.",

SR4VH consists of a membrane-bound red fluorescent protein (Src::RFP) and a yellow fluorescent protein with a strong nuclear localisation signal from histone H2B (Venus::H2B) separated by four tandem repeats of the amino acid sequence DEVD. When effector caspases cleave the DEVD site, Venus accumulates in the nucleus while RFP remains bound to the cell membrane ( Figure 2B ). This reporter is similar in design to Apoliner (Bardet et al., 2008) , but has different subcellular localisation signals as well as four tandem caspase cleavage sites instead of one. We also found that tethering the probe to the membrane with the myristoylation signal from Src means that there is no excess signal accumulation in the Golgi apparatus (Mukherjee et al., in preparation) . The nuclear localisation signal from H2B allows for highly efficient sequestration of cleaved Venus in the nucleus even in late stages of apoptosis, when the nuclear membrane is likely compromised.",

The number of progeny we can detect at any one time using Worniu-GAL4 varies from 10 to 20, most likely as a result of differential proliferation rates across lineages. We confirmed that SR4VH is reliable as a reporter for cell death in larvae by analysing its expression pattern in all lineages of postembryonic neurons in the thoracic VNC and comparing it to our previous work on MARCM homozygous mutant clones of the initiator caspase Dronc (Truman et al., 2010;  Figure 2C ,D,E,F and Figure 2-figure supplement 1). We found dying cells associated with lineages in the brain and VNC throughout the whole of postembryonic neurogenesis ( Figure 2C ,D,E,F), which lasts for 3.5 days, from mid-2 nd instar (L2) to 12 hr after pupariation. As previously suggested (Truman et al., 2010) , the time course of PCD indicates that cells die earlyvery soon after they are born -often before they have even extended a neuritic process. This death appears to be unlike the 'trophic' PCD found in vertebrates, where a neuron extends a process, interacts with its target cell and dies in the absence of appropriate survival signals. In support of an early onset of PCD, we were able to see sequential stages of cell death, dependent on the distance from the NB ( Figure 2G ,H,I and Figure 2 -figure supplement 1B). Older cells located further away from the NB appear to be at a more advanced stage of PCD indicated by the complete translocation of Venus from the membrane to the nucleus (Cell three in Figure 2G ,H) and by the accumulation of RFP-positive dead cell membranes close to the lineage bundle (arrowheads in Figure 2E ,F).",

            "text": "To look at death specifically during the development of the MNB lineage (lineage 0) we imaged SR4VH in wandering L3 larvae and used molecular markers to identify members of hemilineage 0A and 0B. The transcription factors Engrailed/Invected (En/Inv) are known to be expressed in immature and fully differentiated interneurons of hemilineage A (Allen et al., 2020; Lacin et al., 2019; Lacin et al., 2014; Truman et al., 2004) . As previously reported, the mature differentiated octopaminergic neurons found in hemilineage B express the transcription factor Vestigial (Vg) (Landgraf et al., 2003) . Here, we find that a small number of immature postembryonic neurons (about 3-5) in close proximity to the MNB also express Vg ( Figure 2J ). Within these immature neurons the expression of Vg and En are mutually exclusive. Using Worniu-GAL4 to drive SR4VH we found that only the engrailed-negative cells are undergoing apoptosis ( Figure 2K ), i.e. the same small number of cells that express Vg. Their proximity to the MNB suggests that Vg-positive B cells (i.e. immature octopaminergic neurons) undergo an early death, very soon after they are born. After observing the extent of early PCD during development, we wondered if, by reducing PCD, we could generate novel functional expansions of a hemilineage. To explore this, we made use of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to block PCD in the MNB lineage to determine if 'undead' cells survive into adulthood, elaborate their neurites and acquire a distinctive neurotransmitter identity.",

For this purpose, we deployed the same MARCM-based technique detailed above which ensured that only postembryonic octopaminergic neurons expressed CD8::GFP and TrpA1. The stochastic nature of MARCM allowed for generating both controls and flies with undead neurons in one mating cross using the same genotype, rearing and heat-shock conditions, i.e. there would be animals that would have experienced the heat-shock but have no octopaminergic neurons labelled. This further meant that behavioural experiments were performed blindly and each fly was matched to its control or undead neuron group only following dissection and imaging of the VNC. As mentioned above, we excluded flies with MARCM clones containing bilaterally symmetric neurons from our analysis, as these may be wild-type (see All comparisons were performed using Pearson's chi-squared and p values were adjusted using a Bonferroni correction).

The extent of walking was greater in positive control flies than in the undead MARCM condition (compare panels in Figure 4C and Video 1). This is likely because, alongside activating thoracic octopaminergic neurons in the VNC, in the positive controls we also stimulate the severed axons of octopaminergic cells in the brain which send descending projections to the VNC.

The complexity of our calcium imaging experiment (see Figure 5A ), together with a rate of success for obtaining MARCM clones with undead neurons of 15%, prompted us to approach our question whether undead neurons are functional during natural walking by using H99/XR38 flies. Keeping in mind that, instead of bifurcating, undead neurons collectively take a turn (see Figure 3I ,J and Figure 3 -figure supplement 2B, C,D), we interpret activity from the thickest bundle in the bifurcation as belonging to both undead and wild-type neurons. In these animals we observed conspicuous increases in neural activity during air-puff-induced walking in both wild-type controls ( Figure 5-figure supplement 1) and in H99/ XR38 flies ( Figure 5C ,D,E and Videos 2, 3 and 4). Because undead neurons outnumber their wildtype counterparts by a ratio of 6.5 to 1 (see Figure 3A ,B,C,D), these results imply that both neuronal types are active in H99/XR38 flies. Supporting this, we observed an increase in GCaMP6s fluorescence across all subregions along the width of the thickest primary neurite bundle in the bifurcation, which contains all undead neurons together with three wild-type cells ( Figure 5-figure supplement  2 and Video 4). Taken together, these data reveal that 'undead' neurons in the adult fly are functional and can integrate into motor networks.",

Alongside walking, octopaminergic neurons in the MNB lineage have a well-known function in flight (Roeder, 2005) , and differences in neuron numbers correlate well with varying degrees of flight performance ( Figure 6 ). Proficient fliers such as locusts and most flies have more octopaminergic neurons in winged thoracic segments (highlighted in yellow in Figure 6 ), while clumsy fliers such as cockroaches and crickets have similar numbers of neurons across thoracic segments. Figure 6 reviews our current knowledge of the number of GABAergic (hemilineage A) and octopaminergic (hemilineage B) neurons in the MNB of insects compiled from multiple studies spanning decades of research (see references in Figure 6 ). The lack of data for one population or the other is indicated with a question mark. Alongside our own data from swift louseflies (see Figure 7) , here we also include our unpublished observations in the horse lousefly (for 0B) and the bee lousefly (for 0A). Having limited samples and antibody, we successfully labelled one preparation each and therefore resort to depicting these as a cartoon in Figure 6 .",

We labelled lousefly octopaminergic neurons from hemilineage 0B using antibodies for tyramine bhydroxylase (Monastirioti et al., 1996) and by comparing the ratio of octopaminergic cells in the mesothorax (winged segment) and the prothorax (lacks wings), we found that, unlike flying dipterans, the swift lousefly has lost segmentspecific variability of cell numbers (fruit fly [2.2 \u00b1 0.2, n = 7] versus swift lousefly [1.1 \u00b1 0.2, n = 3], p=0.012, Mann-Whitney U = 0, Mann-Whitney t-test) ( Figure 7B ,C,D,E,F). In the sister hemilineage 0A we found a considerably larger number of GABAergic neurons ( Figure 7F) , suggesting that PCD may be responsible for the selective elimination of the octopaminergic hemilineage.",

Adults only emerge the following spring, when swifts return from North Africa (Hagan, 1951; Bequaert, 1952) . To capture postembryonic development, we dissected both larvae from inside female abdomens and pupae staged from Day 0 onwards, indicating days passed since laying ( Figure 7G ). Similar to the tsetse fly (Truman, 1990) , neurodevelopment is significantly delayed compared to 'typical' dipteran flies -the nervous system only acquires dipteran larval-like features many days after pupariation ( Figure 7H ). Using EdU to label proliferating cells and immunostaining for active Dcp-1 ( Figure 7H ,I,J), we found dying cells located close to NBs throughout the 24 days of pupal neurogenesis (Pop et al., in preparation) . In the MNB lineage, which is easily identified by its medial position and projection pattern in the neuropil, we found cell death in thoracic segments at all time points examined, from Day 4 after pupariation to Day 23 ( Figure 7I,J) .",

Bee louseflies spend their entire adult life as kleptoparasites on the honeybee Apis mellifera (Imms, 1942; McAlister, 2018) . We specifically asked whether lineages known to function in flight circuitry might be modified in flightless insects. In Drosophila, a thorough anatomical study recently described the pattern of innervation for each lineage into known functional domains of the adult neuropil and categorised them accordingly as being involved in leg, wing and both leg and wing control (Shepherd et al., 2019) . In addition, the functional role of most hemilineages was previously assessed by thermogenetic activation in headless flies and those involved in flight-associated behaviours, such as wing wave, wing buzz or take-off, were identified (Harris et al., 2015) . Together, these studies provide an excellent starting point for anatomical comparisons of homologous hemilineages which may have served an ancestral role in flight.",

Comparing the Neuroglian-labelled axon bundle width of homologous hemilineages between flightless and flying species, we found that hemilineages 3B, 7B, 11B and 12A, which produce wing waving, wing buzzing or take-off in the fruit fly (Harris et al., 2015) , hemilineages 6A and 19B, which innervate the wing neuropil, and 5B, which innervates both leg and wing neuropils (Shepherd et al., 2019) , are reduced in bee louseflies, but not in swift louseflies ( Figure 9B,C,D) . Among the latter, hemilineages 5B and 6A are known to contribute to leg movements and changes in posture, while the role for 19B is yet to be determined (Harris et al., 2015) . Importantly, 3B, 6A, 11B, 12A and 19B belong to lineages in which both hemilineages survive in fruit flies (see schematic in Figure 1E) . A difference in axon bundle diameter between sister hemilineages could indicate a difference in cell number, possibly established by PCD during development. We chose to quantify the ratio of axon bundle diameters in lineage three because we expected a reduction in hemilineage 3B, which innervates the wing neuropil, but no change in hemilineage 3A, which projects into the leg neuropil (Shepherd et al., 2019) . The fibre tracts of 3A and 3B originate as a common bundle and split only in the intermediate neuropil.",

Although PCD has been reported as a fate within lineages in the embryo (Karcavich and Doe, 2005; Rogulja-Ortmann et al., 2007) , the impact of this 'early' and hemilineage-specific PCD on the construction of the adult network has yet to be fully appreciated. This type of PCD is responsible for removing almost half of all postembryonic neurons that are born in the fly (Truman et al., 2010) . Until now, the most frequently reported type of neuronal death described in insects has been the hormonally regulated PCD that removes mature neurons during the narrow developmental windows at the beginning of metamorphosis and within the first day after adult eclosion (Draizen et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2013) . We now know from our data that these make up only a small fraction, compared to the total number of neuronal deaths in the fly.",

Importantly, death happens before neurites have extended, https://elifesciences.org/articles/59566#video4 strongly suggesting that this PCD is not an analogue of neurotrophic death, found in vertebrateswhere neuron-target interactions play a major role in the decisions of cell survival (Dekkers and Barde, 2013) . In Thermobia domestica and Crataerina pallida, where the use of sophisticated genetic reporters such as SR4VH was not yet possible, EdU incorporation to mark dividing cells and immunolabelling for the active effector caspase Dcp-1 as a proxy for cell death revealed dying cells close to sites of division. Dying cells were found in the proximity of NBs (identifiable in all insects by their large size and position in the outermost layer of the CNS cortex) and far removed from mature neurons which congregate in the innermost layer of the cortex, adjacent to the neuropil.

Early PCD likely involves a combination of intrinsic patterning and cell-cell interactions between sibling neurons which ultimately deploy the activity of proapoptotic genes rpr, hid, grim and/or skl. Previously, patterning genes such as Ubx have been shown to contribute to the survival of hemilineages in the thoracic VNC in a parasegment-specific manner (Marin et al., 2012) , while the transcription factor Unc-4 has been recently demonstrated to provide neural identity to hemilineages involved in flight (Lacin et al., 2020) . Such spatial patterning is also required to establish NB identity which, in turn, can determine which hemilineage is maintained and which dies. In the developing optic lobe Bertet et al., 2014 have shown that the temporal sequence of transcription factors expressed in NBs (inherited by the GMC and newly born neurons) produces a switch in the selective survival of one hemilineage over the other. In this manner, the changes to NB identity which have been documented in other insects (Biffar and Stollewerk, 2014) , despite a conserved NB array and progeny, could in turn influence the pattern of PCD. Alongside, cell-cell interactions between newly born neurons could influence fate choices. The requirement of interactions between newly born siblings in determining asymmetric fates has been shown in the grasshopper VNC  . Shown are hemilineages 6A and 7B which are reduced in the bee lousefly in all three thoracic segments (T1, T2, T3). Scale bars, 50 mm. (E-G) 3A and 3B hemilineage fibre tracts labelled with Neuroglian in a fruit fly (top left) and a bee lousefly (top right). Shown are maximum intensity projections, chosen to best display hemilineages, from cross-section T1 (E), T2 (F) and frontal perspectives T3 (G). Quantifications of 3A/3B hemilineage bundle diameter ratios in fruit flies and bee louseflies are given below (****p < 0.0001 in T1, independent samples t-test, ***p = 0.0001 for T2, Welch's t-test, *p = 0.0044, Welch's t-test. n = 7 fruit flies each, n = 8 bee louseflies each).

Previous work has shown that octopamine can induce and maintain walking in locusts (Sombati and Hoyle, 1984) and decapitated fruit flies (Yellman et al., 1997) . Consistently, we find that our 'undead' hemilineage 0B cells can induce walking when activated thermogenetically in headless flies and show calcium activity during naturalistic bouts of locomotion. Thus, by blocking death, we have 'resurrected' functional neurons that are able to integrate into thoracic motor networks. Although this 'dialling up' of cell numbers, in our system, is artificial, it reveals how doomed neurons possess cryptic cellular phenotypes that can emerge when death is blocked, advocating for the evolvability of such a hemilineage-based system.",

            "text": "While these undead hemilineage 0B octopaminergic neurons share many conserved features with wild-type cells, the variations we see in their morphology could act as a substrate for evolutionary change. A recent study has linked structural changes in the VNC with changes in behaviour between strains of Drosophila melanogaster (Mellert et al., 2016) . Mellert et al., show that hemilineage 12A in the mesothorax has variable bundle morphologies and that these correlate well with the time of flight initiation. Flight is used as an escape response and can be instrumental for predator evasion, one of the major evolutionary forces which have selected for flight in insects in the first place (Dudley, 2002) . With this in mind, it seems plausible that changes in either neuron number and/or innovations in 'undead' neuron structure could affect adult behaviour and be ultimately adaptive. Recently it has been shown that undead sensory neurons that are functional, integrate and appear to be tuned to specific odours (Prieto-Godino et al., 2020) . Importantly, Prieto-Godino et al. also show that there is cell number variation in this neuronal population across drosophilids and that blocking PCD in melanogaster results in the survival of mosquito-like CO 2 -sensing neurons in the maxillary palps. This suggests that both the central and peripheral nervous system may use similar modes of early PCD to sculpt circuits during the evolution of true flies.",

As octopaminergic neurons are involved in flight-related behaviours (Brembs et al., 2007; Duch and Pfl\u00fcger, 1999; Roeder, 2005) , we suggest that PCD has been coopted in this lineage during the evolution of flightlessness in the swift louse. We believe that this PCD takes place early, in newly born neurons, as we have seen dying cells close to the MNB in all of our 20 pupae, from Day 4 to Day 23. Therefore, the decrease in octopaminergic cell number in the mesothoracic segment of swift louseflies is likely the result of increased hemilineage-specific PCD during evolution. Alternatively, an increase in the number of neurons in the non-flying prothorax and metathorax could lead to a uniform population size across thoracic segments in swift louseflies. This could be achieved either by additional MNB divisions, or by reduced PCD. If changes in MNB proliferation play a role remains to be determined.",

For example, flying insects have greater numbers of midline octopaminergic neurons within segments that control wings (Campbell et al., 1995; Eckert et al., 1992; Jia and Siegler, 2002; Konings et al., 1988; Monastirioti et al., 1995; Schlurmann and Hausen, 2003; Siegler and Pankhaniya, 1997; Siegler et al., 2001; Siegler et al., 1991; Sp\u00f6 rhase-Eichmann et al., 1992; Stevenson et al., 1992; Thompson and Siegler, 1993) , while grasshoppers have more GABAergic neurons in the metathoracic/abdominal ganglia, which receives auditory input (Witten and Truman, 1998; Thompson and Siegler, 1991) . These two midline neuronal populations are derived from the same NB, the MNB, which buds off multiple GMCs, each dividing once to generate a GABAergic (A cell) and an octopaminergic (B cell) neuron. Both A and B neurons are generated in equal numbers but, in all cases, the numbers of GABAergic ('hemilineage A') and octopaminergic ('hemilineage B') neurons within one segment are never the same. The greater numbers of GABAergic cells within each segment has been shown in grasshoppers (Jia and Siegler, 2002) and fruit flies (Truman et al., 2010) to be the result of removal by PCD of large numbers of cells from hemilineage B.",

Therefore, we refer here to the PCD found in the MNB lineage of grasshoppers as 'hemilineage-specific PCD'. Following our observations of PCD during development in other insects, together with a vast body of knowledge on homology in insect nervous systems (Kutsch and Breidbach, 1994; Thomas et al., 1984) , we suggest that variations in neural circuits between species is very likely set up by modifying hemilineages, with PCD playing a major role.",

It remains for us to determine if early PCD takes place in these specific bee lice lineages during development and causes the reduction in bundle diameter that we see in flight hemilineages. As with most parasitic insects, bee and swift louseflies are impossible to maintain in the laboratory in the absence of their hosts and procuring them is a challenge (e.g. bee louseflies are now only found on two islands in the UK, while collecting swift louseflies is restricted to the summer months due to Apus apus migrations). Nonetheless, our observations that PCD is widespread across insects complements our findings in bee louseflies, strongly suggesting that an extensive PCD in flight hemilineages may have accompanied the loss of flight during evolution. Interestingly, the reduction in fibre diameter we see in bee louseflies was not evident in swift louseflies. This difference is likely due to the more significant changes to body plan in bee louseflies, i.e. a complete loss of the flight apparatus during evolution. Swift louseflies however still maintain vestigial wings and halteres (Walker and Rotherham, 2010b) , whereas bee louseflies have a severely reduced thorax, completely lacking wings, halteres and flight muscles (McAlister, 2018) .",

We find that 'early' PCD is widespread during the development of the CNS of insects from the primitive firebrats, to most derived true flies. Early cell death appears to be a specific subtype of PCD present across animals. Understanding how early PCD is specified across species should help us elucidate how nervous systems are built and evolve. Our exploration of homologous lineages in flightless dipterans shows that changes in body plan may accompany changes in the extent and pattern of PCD. As the evolutionary changes seen in neural networks ultimately result from heritable differences in developmental processes, our future endeavours will be directed towards elucidating how genetic programs are deployed to establish the pattern of PCD. The cellular leitmotif of hemilineage-based cell death, we present here, provides us with something tangible that we can search for. Thus, we suggest that viewing the evolution of insect nervous systems through the lens of the 'hemilineage' will be critical for understanding how development brings about adaptive changes in neural network motifs.

A small number of wild-type octopaminergic neurons are born during postembryonic neurogenesis (one in T1 and T3, 4-5 in T2, see Figure 3 -figure supplement 1).

We used males as we found they are more responsive to octopamine release by thermogenetic activation than females (data not shown). The headless flies were brushed back into a food vial placed on its side and left to recover for at least 1 hr. To generate the heat ramp required to thermogenetically activate undead neurons, we used a 12V thermoelectric Peltier plate (model: TEC1-12706, size: 40 mm x 40 mm x 3.6 mm) connected to a DC power supply (HY3005D, Rapid Electronics) set at a constant current of 0.46A, with a variable voltage, calibrated using an infrared laser thermometer (N92FX, Maplin). These settings generated a temperature ramp which lasted 70 s from 22\u02daC to 34\u02daC. Videos were recorded at 25 fps using a Sony NEX-5N digital camera (kindly provided by Ian Wynne) mounted to a stereo microscope. A piece of graph paper was used for spatial calibration. To match the presence of undead neurons with behaviour, each decapitated fly used for thermogenetic activation was indexed and prepared for dissection and immunostaining.",
