            "text": "Background: Losing a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic is a potentially traumatic loss that may result in symptoms of persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. To date, grief-specific cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has mostly been delivered through individual face-to-face formats, while studies have shown that online treatment also yields promising results. Offering treatment online is now more than ever relevant during the pandemic and may offer important benefits compared with face-to-face CBT, such as lower costs and higher accessibility. Our expectation is that griefspecific online CBT is effective in reducing PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptoms. Objective: Our aim is to evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness of grief-specific online CBT in reducing PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptom-levels for adults who lost a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: This study consists of two parts. In part 1, a two-armed (unguided online CBT versus waitlist controls) randomized controlled trial will be conducted. In part 2, a two-armed (guided online CBT versus unguided online CBT) controlled trial will be conducted. Symptoms of PCBD, PTSD, and depression will be assessed via telephone interviews at pre-treatment/pre-waiting period, post-treatment/post-waiting period, and six months post-treatment. Potential participants are people who lost a loved one at least three months earlier during the COVID-19 pandemic with clinically relevant levels of PCBD, PTSD, and/or depression. Analysis of covariance and multilevel modelling will be performed. Discussion: This is one of the first studies examining the effectiveness of online grief-specific CBT. More research is needed before implementing online grief-specific CBT into clinical practice.",

The first death due to coronavirus disease 2019 in the Netherlands was registered in early March 2020. About one year later, over 16,500 Dutch people have died after being infected with COVID-19 (Coronadashboard Rijksoverheid, 2021) . The death of a loved one is one of the most common potentially traumatic events that people may experience (Benjet et al., 2016) . One out of ten people bereaved by a natural death (e.g. illness) develops persistent and severe grief symptoms, including persistent complex bereavement disorder 1 (PCBD) (Lundorff, Holmgren, Zachariae, Farver-Vestergaard, & O'Connor, 2017) . PCBD is entered in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) in the section 'Other specified trauma-and stressor-related disorders'. PCBD can be diagnosed if a person experiences persistent longing for the deceased, symptoms of reactive distress and social/identity disruption, after the death of a loved one at least 12 months earlier. Although PCBD is distinguishable from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression (Boelen, van de Schoot, van den Hout, de Keijser, & Van Den Bout, 2010; Djelantik, Smid, Kleber, & Boelen, 2017; Lenferink, de Keijser, Smid, Djelantik, & Boelen, 2017; Malgaroli, Maccallum, & Bonanno, 2018; O'Connor, Lasgaard, Shevlin, & Guldin, 2010) , a meta-analysis shows that PCBD in an estimated 49% and 63% of the cases co-occurs with PTSD and depression, respectively (Komischke-Konnerup, Zachariae, Johannsen, Nielsen, & O'Connor, 2021) . Losing a loved one due to an unnatural death, for instance an unexpected or violent death, increases the risk of developing clinically relevant PCBD up to nearly 50% (cf., Djelantik, Smid, Mroz, Kleber, & Boelen, 2020) . This elevated risk of developing symptoms after a traumatic loss can be partially explained by the disruption of daily life and the violation of assumptions that the world is safe, benign, and predictable (Boelen, de Keijser, & Smid, 2015; Janoff-Bulman, 1989) . The death of a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic is a potentially traumatic loss, likely leading to higher rates of PCBD, PTSD, and depression compared with the natural death of a loved one . A study by Eisma, Tamminga, Smid, and Boelen (2021) offers preliminary data supporting this claim. They found that COVID-19 bereavement resulted in higher acute grief levels compared to natural bereavement (but not compared to unnatural bereavement).",

            "text": "This elevated risk of psychopathology due to bereavement during the pandemic may be explained by at least five corona-related factors. First, because of the social distancing measures, it is difficult or even impossible to visit a loved one who is dying. Both grief rituals prior to death and grief rituals after death (e.g. attending a funeral) are, therefore, possibly hampered. Traditional grief rituals play an important role in processing the loss, e.g. by facilitating confrontation with the irreversibility of the death. Not being able to perform such rituals can block emotional processing (Boelen, van den Hout, & van den Bout, 2006) . Second, physical social support is not or hardly possible because of social-distancing and self-quarantine measures. Limitations in engaging in social activities can lead to social isolation exacerbating grief symptoms (Lobb et al., 2010) . Third, the COVID-19 pandemic leads to increased uncertainty (e.g. about losing one's employment), anxiety (e.g. about getting sick), loneliness, and stress in the general population (Brooks et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020) . These secondary stressors may fuel distress following the death of a loved one. Fourth, deaths due to the coronavirus are likely to occur in social groups, e.g. within families and groups of friends. People bereaved due to COVID-19 are often part of the infection cycle and are therefore likely to experience multiple losses during the pandemic. Experiencing multiple deaths in a relatively short period of time elevates the risk of stagnating in the grieving process (Hengst, Smid, & Laban, 2018) . Fifth, assumed (shared) responsibility for the death of a close person, for instance after a traffic accident of suicide, is a risk factor for elevated grief complaints (Erlangsen et al., 2017) . Because prevention of contamination is such a focal point in the current pandemic, bereaved people may think that they are responsible for having contaminated the deceased, causing guilt and self-blame, impairing recovery from the loss. The interaction between the increase in number of deaths on the one hand and the corona-related factors on the other hand will likely lead to an increase in the number of people in need of bereavement care Kokou-Kpolou, Fern\u00e1ndez-Alc\u00e1ntara, & C\u00e9nat, 2020) . Based on reviews (Boelen & Smid, 2017a; Doering & Eisma, 2016) , griefspecific cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is considered the most effective treatment with PCBD (Boelen, Lenferink, & Spuij, 2021; Boelen & van den Bout, 2017; Rosner, Bartl, Pfoh, Kotou\u010dov\u00e1, & Hagl, 2015; Shear, Frank, Houck, & Reynolds, 2005) . CBT addresses negative cognitions (e.g. about one's life or the world) and avoidance behaviours with exposure, cognitive restructuring, and behavioural activation. During the pandemic, psychological interventions are often delivered remotely, such as through the Internet . For instance, face-to-face interventions needed to switch to being delivered online. Consequently, it is likely that bereaved people searching for professional grief help look for support online. However, evidence-based online CBT for grief-related distress is not yet widely available. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance knowledge about the effectiveness of online grief-specific CBT in order to be able to offer bereaved people during the COVID-19 pandemic adequate mental health care.",

It is likely that waiting lists for face-to-face interventions in general will increase, because providing care remotely is not feasible for all patients (e.g. people suffering from severe psychiatric conditions). In addition, people may have postponed using mental health care services during the pandemic, because of COVID-19 restrictions or fear of contamination. This may further lengthen the waitlists. As a result, it is likely that it will be very challenging to receive face-to-face grief-specific CBT for bereaved people in need of support during and after the pandemic. Therefore, online grief-specific CBT could be a solution. Furthermore, this approach may bring other benefits too. Offering CBT via the Internet might decrease the barrier for seeking treatment, because it is independent of geographical location. This could counteract barriers to care reported by bereaved people, including problems with finding help, transportation difficulties or problems with planning sessions Lichtenthal et al., 2015) . Additionally, offering CBT online could lower treatment costs, thereby making treatment more easily accessible to people who need support .",

The effectiveness of online treatment depends on several factors, including the target group, content of treatment, and degree of therapeutic guidance (Andersson et al., 2009 ). The largest treatment effects have been found in online treatments that 1) are targeted at people with clinically relevant symptom-levels (vs. low or subclinical symptom-levels), 2) are extensive and comprehensive in the description of the content (instead of limited content), and 3) are guided by a therapist through email or telephone (compared to no or minimal guidance; Andersson et al., 2009 ). To our knowledge, online grief-specific CBT-based interventions have only been evaluated in four clinical trials (Eisma et al., 2015; Kersting et al., 2013; Litz et al., 2014; Wagner, Knaevelsrud, & Maercker, 2006) . However, these trials had some limitations. Specifically, they were solely focused on recently (Litz et al., 2014) or perinatally bereaved people (Kersting et al., 2013) , relied on relatively small samples (Eisma et al., 2015; Wagner et al., 2006) , or had considerable dropout rates (Eisma et al., 2015) . Furthermore, the comparability of the findings between the studies is restricted, because the content of the treatment varied greatly; different elements of CBT were offered, for instance exposure or behavioural activation only (Eisma et al., 2015) or the treatment only consisted of writing assignments (Kersting et al., 2013; Wagner et al., 2006) . Taken together, more research is needed before online griefspecific CBT can be implemented in clinical practice.",

The TGI-CA consists of 22 items, rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = never, through 5 = always. The instruction of the original questionnaire is altered from 'the death of your loved one' to 'the death of your loved one(s) during the corona pandemic'.",

Moreover, studies show that elevated grief, PTSD, and depression levels in the first six months after a loss strongly predict elevated grief, PTSD, and depression levels later in time , 2021 . In both part 1 and part 2 of the study, the treatment encompasses eight weekly sessions delivered in a period of maximum 12 weeks. Eight sessions have shown to be sufficient to generate moderate to large treatment effects (Van Denderen, de Keijser, Stewart, & Boelen, 2018) . For part 1 and part 2 of the study, the same online CBT treatment will be offered, in which the main target will be PCBD levels. The first session consists of psycho-education regarding possible emotional reactions to the death of a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic and processes that might facilitate or impede recovery. Additionally, participants are encouraged to invite a close person to the online treatment for support. When a close person has been connected to the programme, (s)he will receive information on possible emotional reactions to losing a loved one and will receive information about how (s)he can support the participant. Sessions 2, 3, and 4 are spent on exposure, in which participants will focus on the story of the loss and its circumstances. Participants are encouraged to confront stimuli they tend to avoid, for instance by structured writing assignments drawn from Wagner, Knaevelsrud, and Maercker (2005) and Wagner and Maercker (2007) . Sessions 5 and 6 contain cognitive restructuring assignments, in which participants are helped to identify and alter negative thought patterns about the self, life and the future by performing behavioural experiments and filling in thought diaries. Sessions 7 and 8 consist of behavioural activation assignments, focused on identifying valued activities and making plans to attain valued goals. Approximately two hours are spent on each session. During treatment, short pre-recorded video messages are shown in which a therapist provides information about treatment elements. These video messages can be read in text as well. At the beginning of the treatment, each participant can choose between either a male or female video therapist, presenting the same information.",

However, when considering a dropout rate of 19% (based on the mean dropout rate as reported in Currier, Holland, & Neimeyer, 2010 ), a total sample size of 62 (52 + 10) participants is needed. For part 2, our sample size calculation is based on testing Hypothesis 3 and Hypothesis 4. Considering prior research on therapist-guided vs. unguided online treatment for people with symptoms of depression and anxiety (Spek et al., 2007) , we expect a medium effect size in favour of the therapist-guided online CBT. To find a difference between groups (guided vs. unguided online CBT) with a power of 80%, a medium effect size (f = 0.25), an \u03b1 of 0.05 and a strong association (r = .50) between the pre-assessment, post-assessment and six months follow-up assessment, a total sample size of 86 participants is sufficient. Again, considering a dropout rate of 19%, a sample size of 102 (86 + 16) participants is needed. To test the hypotheses in part 2, multilevel analyses will be executed since our data are nested (i.e. repeated measures (level 1) within participants (level 2)). However, it is not feasible to perform a power calculation for multilevel analyses (Snijders & Bosker, 2012) . For this reason, our power calculation is based on a repeated measures analysis of variance.",

Therefore, therapy expectancy could be a potential risk of bias. Secondly, in part 2 of the study, it will be impossible to carry out a randomization procedure due to pragmatic reasons. In addition, the waitlist control group in part 1 of the study starts with the unguided online CBT after eight weeks of waiting. Therefore, we can only compare the unguided online CBT group to the waitlist control group at the post-treatment assessment and not at the six months post-treatment assessment. Furthermore, potential mediators (e.g. changes in negative cognitions, avoidance behaviour) will not be examined which would have been valuable for examining potential mechanisms of change. Finally, we will actively look for methods to recruit participants, which could restrict the generalizability of our findings to bereaved people who seek treatment themselves.",

For this reason, our expectation is that the results of the current study will be of high value for clinical practice. Insights from this study will improve knowledge about the short-term and long-term effectiveness of online CBT for bereaved people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results are expected to be highly relevant for future research as well, in which the effectiveness of online grief-specific CBT could be further examined, for instance by comparing the effects of guided online CBT (i.e. minimal therapeutic assistance) to guided online CBT with more extensive therapeutic assistance (i.e. therapeutic assistance via telephone or video calls). Notes 1. A diagnosis regarding severe and persistent griefrelated distress has also been introduced as 'prolonged grief disorder' in the eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11; WHO, 2018) and the forthcoming text-revision of the DSM-5 (DSM-5-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2020). However, in this study we will use the term PCBD, in accord with the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), since the DSM-5 is widely used by mental health care practitioners in the Netherlands at the time of conducting this study. 2. Given the upcoming change in the DSM-5-TR replacing PCBD with PGD, we will repeat the analyses for the primary outcome using the PGD DSM-5-TR items in the TGI-CA.",
