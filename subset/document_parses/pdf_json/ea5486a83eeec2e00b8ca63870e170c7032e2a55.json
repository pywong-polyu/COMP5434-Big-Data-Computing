            "text": "Background: This study explored how low-income women already distressed by reproductive challenges were affected during the initial lockdown conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mumbai, India. Methods: Women with reproductive challenges and living in established slums participated in a longitudinal mixed-methods study comparing their mental health over time, at pre-COVID-19 and at one and four-months into India's COVID-19 lockdown. Results: Participants (n = 98) who presented with elevated mental health symptoms at baseline had significantly reduced symptoms during the initial lockdown. Improvements were associated with income, socioeconomic status, perceived stress, social support, coping strategies, and life satisfaction. Life satisfaction explained 37% of the variance in mental health change, which was qualitatively linked with greater family time (social support) and less worry about necessities, which were subsidized by the government. Conclusions: As the pandemic continues and government support wanes, original mental health issues are likely to resurface and possibly worsen, if unaddressed. Our research points to the health benefits experienced by the poor in India when basic needs are at least partially met with government assistance. Moreover, our findings point to the critical role of social support for women suffering reproductive challenges, who often grieve alone. Future interventions to serve these women should take this into account.",

The state also reported 133,000 COVID-related deaths [3] despite strict lockdown measures instituted in mid-March, 2020 [4] . These lockdown measures continued [5] for months with constant uncertainty pertaining to severity and duration [6] . Although the national lockdown ended in May 2020, red zones, or high impact zones, cities such as Mumbai continued with subsequent lockdowns or restrictions [7] . Furthermore, a government-approved study comparing COVID-19 infection rates in slums and non-slum communities in Mumbai found markedly higher rates in the slums (54.1% vs. 16 .1% respectively). The density of slum communities (crowded residential areas built of substandard housing and typically lacking infrastructure for clean water, and sewage and waste disposal) renders social distancing nearly impossible and poor availability of facilities for hygiene likely further helps induce this disparity [8] .",

Some predicted that the lockdowns would trigger the first recession in India in the last 40 years. Devastating consequences of the global pandemic on maternal and child health have also been predicted, due to reductions in essential health services expected to contribute to increased maternal deaths, newborn deaths, and stillbirths [9] . In low-and middle-income country, reductions in maternal and child health services are estimated to range from 9.8 to 39.3% by setting, and hunger-related consequences (due to decreased food availability) are expected to increase between 10 to 50%, and result in increases in mortality and morbidity [10] .

Complicating this matter further is the dearth of mental health professionals in India, and longstanding stigmatization of mental health [1, 24] . In fact, negative attitudes towards mental health professionals in urban India were found to be most prevalent among young adults with lower education and strong religious beliefs-particularly among Hindus and Muslims [25] . Current reports of suicide and increased psychological distress during the pandemic have prompted recommendations for tele-mental health care, social media promotion of preventive measures, and dissemination of reliable information updates pertaining to the virus [1, 14, 23] . Most expect that the psychological distress present prior to the pandemic will significantly worsen in light of the increasing fear of contracting the virus, in addition to the multiple stressors related to the lockdown [1, 19, 21] . As a result of the importance placed on women's childbearing in India's traditionally patriarchal, pronatalist society, the loss of status, in addition to grief, puts women who have reproductive challenges (trouble conceiving and/or perinatal loss) at high risk for mental health sequelae, thus making them an especially vulnerable sub-group [26, 27] .",

We built on this assessment to monitor our participant's mental health via follow-up phone interviews during the initial COVID-19 lockdown. Using the conceptual framework of the transactional model of stress and coping [28] , we explored how this vulnerable group coped in the initial wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. The framework suggests that when stressors (infertility) impact personal goals (such as reproduction), anxiety and distress are likely. When one has little control over the situation, coping efforts are used to try to manage stress. Emotional regulation is the most adaptive coping strategy, but may be thwarted by pressure to meet social expectations, overwhelming obstacles, and lack of social support [29] . However, meaningbased coping, including positive reappraisal, is possible when events (such as subsequent pregnancy) or revised goals (e.g., personal or career growth) may result in emotional well-being, improved functional status, and health behaviors-in a word, resilience [28, 30] .",

One-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to longitudinally explore our mental health (HSCL) variable over time (baseline (before , and at two follow-ups during COVID-19). We created a mental health change variable by calculating change between the baseline HSCL and the first phone follow-up HSCL. To optimize power and for model-building purposes, we bi-variably explored (using Pearson's correlations) the independent variables that were significantly associated with mental health (HSCL-10 change).

Some families do offer emotional support to the mother immediately after stillbirth, but nevertheless expect the women to get pregnant again right away. In general, the participants said that the women in their community face enormous family pressure to reproduce and ignore family planning advice from medical professionals or ASHA workers. \"Some women has five months old child but three months pregnant already because of family pressure\". Sometimes this was felt to be because \"They are not happy with girl child alone\", alluding to son preference. This turned to frank discussion regarding the prevalence of son preference in their communities.

The larger study sample (n = 334) consisted of women 18 to 42 years old, residing in established slums of Mumbai. More than half (56.9%) lived in a joint family context rather than a nuclear family (42.1%), and identified themselves as daughter-in-law or wife (98.3%), having been married an average of 8.22 years (SD 5.82). Most were Hindu (53.4%) women, followed by Muslim (33.9%), Buddhist (9.3%), and other (3.4%) including Christians and Banjaris. Most had low education levels (only 19.5% having higher secondary education or above), and worked as unskilled workers or homemakers (89.4%), the majority had a monthly family income of less than INR 20,714 (approximately USD 274), and considered their families as lower middle class. In general, they deemed themselves as physically and mentally healthy (75.4% and 80.6% indicating no problems, respectively). The current study sample only included (n = 98) women that had indicated the desire to engage in a future self-care intervention based on their own assessment of need, and was compared to the larger study sample, with significant differences noted in terms of occupation, contraceptive use, health, and psychosocial problems. The current sample included more semi-skilled or semi-professional workers; women were more likely to have anemia or other health problems; were more likely to have anxiety, depression, or experience domestic violence; and were more likely to be using some form of contraception. Additionally, the women participating in the phone interviews were significantly more likely to indicate less social support, employ more wishful thinking as a coping style, and have greater autonomy, higher mental distress, and lower satisfaction with life, compared to the larger sample of the parent study (see Table 2 ). Table 3 describes changes over time due to the COVID-19 lockdown. At the first follow-up phone contact (5 weeks after COVID-19 lockdown began), participants noted multiple sources for COVID-19 information and updates, relying most heavily on news media (80.6%), with fairly high trust regarding the information received (M = 3.62, SD 0.92 on a 1-5 scale). The vast majority indicated that there were no cases in their community. At the second phone follow up (five months after baseline or four months after the initial COVID-19 lockdown), nearly 60% still did not know of any positive cases in their community, although friends and family members were identified as having COVID-19. Most participants lived in one to two room houses in crowded slum neighborhoods. The number of people living in the household (M = 5.64, SD 2.71) indicated tight living quarters, and less than half (42.9%) indicated the ability to maintain social distancing when allowed outside. On a scale of 1-5, most participants were initially quite worried about becoming infected (M = 3.64, SD 1.30), and that had not significantly changed by the time of the second phone interview (M = 3.55, SD 0.88). Lockdown conditions negatively affected monthly family income and food availability, but both improved at the second phone follow up (p < 0.004 and p < 0.001 respectively). Obtaining necessitates was negatively affected but did not significantly change over time. In the first phone interview, most women (74.5%) did not note increased tension/conflict in family relationships.",

To offset the economic peril of these draconian measures (which included strict shelter in place orders, with even shopping for food regulated and only allowed on certain days, according to one's residential area), the government offered subsidies and rations. Living in tight quarters, most of the women in our sample admitted they were unable to maintain social distancing and noted significantly more positive cases within their communities over time. Although these poor vulnerable women trusted the pandemic information received, and may have understood the necessity of lockdowns, they found the protections offered lacking, as noted in their responses to the negative effects on their monthly family income, availability of goods, and food.

However, within the first month of lockdown, the average HSCL score significantly reduced to 1.43-now within the normal range-and remained within the normal range at the time of the second phone follow-up. The relatively large effect size, repeated measures, and congruence of participants' short qualitative responses to the phone interviews increases our confidence that the improved HSCL scores are not an artifact. Further supporting these findings, resilience scores also significantly increased during the lockdown between the first and second phone interviews (M = 21.48, SD 5.33 and M = 23.76, SD 6.08 respectively, p = 0.01).",

Prior studies have shown social support to be paramount to the mental health of women dealing with stillbirth, infant death, or infertility [67] [68] [69] . As the lockdowns continued, our participants noted that they appreciated time with family members (and qualitatively reported that this was particularly true for the presence of their husbands), with nearly as many noting positive changes in relationships as those noting increased tension or conflict. When conflict was noted, it was characterized as not very serious, and did not significantly increase over time (p = 0.359).",

Clearly, for low-income women in a society that requires daily struggles to eat and survive, the unexpected subsidies and stipends provided a regular source of support they never previously received, which, in conjunction with having their families near them, mitigated the stress of the pandemic for them-at least in the early months of the pandemic. We do not anticipate these positive effects to continue and do not have the ability for further study with the women. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued much longer than anyone expected, government subsidies were not enough to meet demand and could not continue indefinitely [70] . There will likely be more mouths to feed due to interrupted family planning services [14] and as lockdown restrictions are progressively eased, there may or may not be jobs to return to [2] . These women and their families are mostly part of the informal work sector comprising 90% of India's working population, and will be disproportionally at risk for this high unemployment, which, without a continuing safety net, will result in dire outcomes, including hunger and loss of housing. As a result, they are progressively prone to resultant health disparities the longer the economic consequences of the pandemic continue [2, 71] .",

However, as our data covering the first four months of the lockdown show, despite the many negative aspects of the pandemic, our participants reportedly have consistently employed strategies to stay healthy through meditation, prayer or worship, productive use of time, and exercise, pointing to a strong innate resilience that was functional with very little investment by the government. Even eating a healthy diet significantly increased (p = 0.009), perhaps in response to the education provided at the end of the first phone interview, in addition to making use of government rations, which included legumes, rice, and grain [38] . The return to basic staples may have resulted in a healthier diet than that eaten pre-pandemic [72] . Furthermore, employing our educational options to optimize wellbeing in confinement (suggested self-help strategies for physical and mental health) seems to have been effective for them in handling the situation. At the end of the study, five months after baseline measures and four months into lockdown, their perceived stress scores were in the low range and had not increased over time (p = 0.922), initial improvement in mental health symptomology (HSCL) was maintained, and resilience increased. Again, we do not expect these positive trends to continue, especially as the financial stipends decreased when the pandemic lingered for longer than anticipated. However, this natural experiment showed that if slum-dwelling families have even a small amount of governmental support (however modest), which currently does not occur in India, health overall increases despite a stressful life-threatening pandemic.",

Although participants consented to participate in the phone interviews, given the privacy limitations of being in tight living quarters with family members constantly present, participants may not have reported negative responses, as much due to fear of being overheard and subsequent retribution. There is also a risk of positive response bias, as participants may have underreported their struggles to maintain social distancing, which is nearly impossible in the context of crowded urban slums [73] , although our data seems to reflect this reality quite accurately. Fear of stigma and blame around COVID-19 [70] may have also decreased participants' disclosure of known contacts within their families and communities. Fear may be amplified by drones being used to monitor lockdown compliance [70] and the looming threat of legal action [5] . Strengths of the paper include the intentional mixed-methods exploratory sequential design, which helped us contextualize the life experiences of our participants. Furthermore, we believe this resulted in our congruent, although unexpected, findings of improved mental health and resilience across multiple quantitative, well-validated measures, and our qualitative data. Although we cannot speak to how this may have changed further into the pandemic, it does indeed show that financial support matters, especially to the poorest in society. It also suggests that any future intervention (post COVID-19 lockdowns) for these women who suffer from poor mental health because of their reproductive challenges should, at least in part, focus on helping them find social support to address the isolation many experience because of the deeply shameful experience of not being able to bear children.",

For the present time, in combination with initial governmental measures of support during the lockdown, this support is associated with an improvement in the mental health distress they experience due to reproductive challenges. In a traditional, pronatalist context in which women's status is directly affected by producing children-particularly sons-reproductive challenges often result in significant mental health distress, especially as they are often judged by their family members about their reproductive capacity. The finding that positive changes in mental health were found in our participants suggests that, although forced, the increased family cohabitation improved family relationships and social support. Future research should also explore the degree to which the positive changes in mental health noted in the current study may be transient, and particularly to determine if these were solely tied to the unexpected financial support the families received from the government, or if the positive results had more to do with relatively few cases originally noted in the social environment of the women-which surely would have increased exponentially over time.",

With health systems already ill equipped to provide mental health services in this context, we are likely to see worsening mental health among those with mental health issues pre-COVID, suggesting the need for community-based non-stigmatizing wellness programs that will aid these vulnerable women to deal with past and emerging stresses.",
