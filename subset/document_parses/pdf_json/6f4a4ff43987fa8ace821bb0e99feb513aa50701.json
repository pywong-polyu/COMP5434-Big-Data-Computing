Descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA were used to assess people's psychological and behavioural responses. Hierarchical regression was conducted to investigate the predictive effects of psychological and behavioural variables on reports of social distancing and panic buying respectively. Results Respondents reported a low degree of risk perception and risk beliefs with regard to being outside, and had moderate psychological stress and positive safeguarding behaviours for being outside. Respondents reported high concern regarding COVID-19 and tended to keep social distancing during the epidemic. They would panic-purchase food and supplies. In addition, psychological stress emerged as a very strong predictor for reporting COVID-19 concerns and panic buying. Furthermore, reported concerns about COVID-19 information sharing had a significant predictive influence on panic buying of food. Safeguarding behaviours for being outside had a significant predictive effect on respondents reported social distancing of cancelling outings. Reported concerns about COVID-19 were stronger predictors for reported social distancing. Conclusion It is important to relieve people's psychological stress and manage information sharing to control panic buying. In addition, we should promote adoption of safeguarding behaviours for being outside and emphasise the concerns with regard to COVID-19 to encourage people keep social distancing. Measures should be implemented according to the characteristics of the population.",

On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 disease officially became a global pandemic (WHO Director-General 2020). By May 18, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had spread to 216 countries (areas or territories), and more than 4.6 million people were infected, with 312,009 confirmed deaths (updated by May 18, 2020, 08:00 GMT + 8) all over the world (WHO 2020). The first reports of the unusual pneumonia cases in China were reported in December 26, 2019; then, active cases were identified in Wuhan City from December 30, 2019 (Wu and McGoogan 2020) , followed by government interventions in many ways, such as travel restrictions (e.g., Wuhan City shut down on January 23, 2020, and another 15 cities shut down the next day). The major focus of the interventions was to minimize transmission of the virus in order to flatten the epidemic peak and lessen the impact on healthcare services (Lai et al. 2020) , enabling the most severe cases to be treated successfully and reduce overall mortality (Wise et al. 2020) .",

According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2020), social distancing, also called \"physical distancing,\" means keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home. Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (CDC 2020). Chen et al. (2020) introduced COVID-19 control in China during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday and emphasized the importance of social distancing measures to slow the rate of transmission. Prem et al. (2020) simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures and concluded that the physical distancing measures would be most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April in China. In addition, social distancing has been an essential component of the public health response in past disease epidemics, curbing human-to-human transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality (Gostin et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2020; Fong et al. 2020 ). However, these protective measures of social distancing rely largely on rapid changes in population behaviour (i.e., refusing visitors and cancelling outings), which are dependent on individuals' ability to perceive risks associated with the virus and adapt their behaviour accordingly (Xu and Peng 2015; Liao et al. 2019; Wise et al. 2020 ). Thus, this study assessed the effects of people's perceived risk of COVID-19, risk beliefs with regard to being outside, and safeguarding behaviours for being outside on their reported social distancing behaviours in China.",

Previous research has revealed a profound and wide range of psychosocial impacts on people at the individual level during infection outbreaks (Wang et al. 2020a ). Risk perception also has a significant correlation with an individual's behaviours (Taghrir et al. 2020) . Thus, it is important to investigate the influences of people's psychological stress and perceived risk of COVID-19 on their specific behaviours under the shock of an epidemic. Since the epidemic of COVID-19 has attracted attention from people all over the world, a considerable number of people were reasonably aware of the basic elements of the disease. As the global threat of COVID-19 continues, it is critical to improve knowledge of the epidemic (Bhagavathula et al. 2020) , which is associated with people's psychological parameters. Roy et al. (2020) concluded that the dissemination of health information on COVID-19 via radio was associated with higher anxiety and depression scores among participants. Therefore, we explored the effects of people's perceived risk of COVID-19 and psychological stress on reported concerning COVID-19. Furthermore, when anxiety affects a larger population, it may result in panic buying, leading to exhaustion of resources (Leung et al. 2020) . Roy et al. (2020) found that approximately one-third of participants had the urge to buy and stock things at home during the survey week. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the predictors for people's panic buying behaviours.",

Two items of the questionnaire related to feelings of panic and nervousness were designed to measure people's psychological stress under the shock of the epidemic. Then, four items were used to obtain people's risk beliefs with regard to being outside, and another two items were designed to measure people's safeguarding behaviours for being outside. Last, six items related to six behavioural variables were used to gather people's reported concerns about COVID-19 information acquisition, reported concerns about COVID-19 information sharing, reported social distancing by cancelling outings, reported social distancing by refusing visitors, panic buying of masks, and panic buying of food.

To ensure that the responses were reliable for testing the research aims of the current survey, the following empirical criteria were identified by pilot tests and the research team to select valid responses: (1) if all items were answered in less than 130 s or with the same score, the respondent was considered to not have read or answered the questions carefully, and all his or her responses were excluded, and (2) if the participant refused the informed consent form, the participant no longer had to fill out the questionnaire, and the response was empty. In total, responses from 189 respondents were used in this study (Table 1) ; 42.9% of them were male, and 57.1% were female. Random sampling was used in this study. Since minors were unable to complete the online survey independently, people aged under 18 years were not included in this study. Thus, the age of the respondents varied from 18 years to 60 years (M = 32.71, SD = 10.41). Since becoming 30 years old is a traditional watershed for Chinese people and the sample size was limited, this study divided the respondents into two age groups, 18-29 years old (54.5%) and 30-60 years old (45.5%). With regard to educational background, 37% were junior college or below, and 63% were bachelor or above. All respondents were from fifteen provinces in China, but the distribution was not balanced for this variable. Therefore, we only considered the three main demographic measures of gender, age group, and education in this study.",

By controlling for the influence of other variables, this approach allowed us to assess the predictive utility of each type of predictor. The results are summarized in Table 4 . In step 1, demographics explained less than 9.9% of the variance in reported concerns about COVID-19 information acquisition, reported concerns about COVID-19 information sharing, and panic buying of food, and the regression models were significant (F (3, 185) \u2264 6.812, p < 0.05). Age group and education emerged as stronger predictors for respondents' reported concerns about COVID-19 information acquiring, and education emerged as a stronger predictor for respondents' reported concerns about COVID-19 information sharing. Demographics only explained less than 2.3% of the variance in panic buying of masks and reported SD by refusing visitors, and the regression models were not significant (F (3, 185) \u2264 1.446, p > 0.05). In step 2, the variables of perceived risk of COVID-19 and psychological stress, when added to the regression equations, explained statistically significant increments of 5.3%-26.7% of the variance in reported concerns about COVID-19 information acquiring, concerns about COVID-19 information sharing, panic buying of masks, and panic buying of food (F change (2, 183) \u2265 5.759, p < 0.01). Psychological stress emerged as a stronger predictor, especially for panic-buying behaviours. Furthermore, perceived risk of COVID-19 had a significant predictive effect on panic buying of masks. Meanwhile, the variables of perceived risk of COVID-19 and psychological stress had no significant predictive effects on respondents' reported SD by refusing visitors. As shown in Table 3 , the variables of concern about COVID-19 information sharing and information acquisition were well correlated with reported social distancing by refusing visitors and cancelling outings respectively. Reported concerns about COVID-19 information sharing were significantly correlated with panic buying of food. To investigate the predictive influence of reported concerns about COVID-19 on panic buying and reported social distancing, a two-step hierarchical regression analysis was conducted. The variable of reported concern about COVID-19 information sharing was entered in step 1, and reported concern about COVID-19 information acquisition was added in step 2. The results showed (see Table 5 ) that in step 1, reported concern about COVID-19 information sharing was a stronger predictor for panic buying of food (R 2 = 0.031, F change (1, 187) = 5.971, p < 0.05). Reported concern about COVID-19 information sharing emerged as a stronger predictor for reported social distancing by refusing visitors (R 2 = 0.060, F change (1, 187) = 11.964, p < 0.01) and cancelled outings (R 2 = 0.105, F change (1, 187) = 21.974, p < 0.001), but the predictive effects were not significant when the variable of reported concern about COVID-19 information acquisition was added to the regression equations. Reported concern about COVID-19 information sharing had no significant predictive effect on panic buying of masks. In step 2, the variable of reported concern about COVID-19 information acquiring, when added to the regression equations, explained statistically significant increments of 17.6%-32.1% of the variance in reported social distancing by refusing visitors and cancelling outings (F change (1, 186) \u2265 42.818, p < 0.001). Meanwhile, reported concerns about COVID-19 information acquisition had no significant predictive effects on panic buying of masks or food.",

We designed simplified scales or questionnaires to measure these variables, and the scales had good reliability and validity. In general, respondents reported low degrees of risk perception of COVID-19 (M = 3.59), which is consistent with previous studies (Taghrir et al. 2020; Wise et al. 2020) , indicating that individuals are often poor at perceiving risk. In addition, we found that respondents reported moderate psychological stress (M = 4.67) . This is in accordance with results from previous research, which concluded that approximately one-third of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety during the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China (Wang et al. 2020a ). Respondents had a low degree of risk beliefs with regard to being outside (M = 1.57) and positive safeguarding behaviours for being outside (M = 6.63), which means that respondents are always willing to protect themselves outside during the outbreak (Roy et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020a) . With respect to the behavioural variables during the epidemic, respondents always continue to follow the trend of the epidemic, and their reported concern about COVID-19 information acquisition was high (M = 6.26). This finding corresponds to a previous study that found that approximately one-third (31.4%) of respondents spent more than 2 h per day viewing information about COVID-19 on media (Wang et al. 2020b) . Furthermore, respondents usually discussed the development of the epidemic with other people, and their reported concern about COVID-19 information sharing was relatively high (M = 5.41) . This is in accordance with results from previous research, which reported that 80% of participants repeatedly discussed the pandemic with their friends during this period (Roy et al. 2020) . Respondents tended to cancel outings (M = 6.41) and refuse visitors (M = 5.87) during the epidemic, which means that respondents tended to maintain social distancing from others. With regard to respondents' panic buying, when they saw or heard of a rise in the number of confirmed cases, they would not panic-purchase medical protective goods (M = 3.95) but would panicpurchase food and supplies (M = 4.58), which is consistent with previous studies Roy et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020b) .",

Younger respondents (aged between 18 and 29 years) had a higher risk perception of COVID-19 than older respondents (aged between 30 and 60 years), which showed the opposite trend to previous research (Leung et al. 2003) , and they were more likely to discuss the development of the epidemic with others. They were also more likely to stock up on food and supplies under the shock of the epidemic than older respondents. Respondents with higher education level had a higher risk perception of COVID-19 and a lower risk belief with regard to being outside. They were more likely to take self-safeguarding behaviours for being outside and maintained social distancing measures by cancelling outings. These findings correspond to a previous study that found that people who were more highly educated had a higher risk perception and were more likely to take precautionary measures against the infection (Leung et al. 2003 ).

However, this study reported that perceived risk of COVID-19 had no significant predictive effects on respondents' reported social distancing by refusing visitors, which may be due to differences between perceived personal risk and perceived risk of COVID-19. In addition, perceived risk of COVID-19 had no significant predictive effects on respondents' reported concerns about COVID-19 or panic buying of food but had a significant influence on panic buying of masks, disinfectants, and other protective equipment. With respect to the influence of psychological stress, it emerged as a significant predictor for explaining respondents' reported concerns about COVID-19 and panic buying, but it had no significant predictive effects on reported social distancing by refusing visitors, which is consistent with a previous study indicating that there were no associations between the degree of social distancing engagement and any indicator of mental health (Oosterhoff et al. 2020) . Regarding demographic parameters, the variable of education was a key determinant in predicting reported concerns about COVID-19, and age group had a significant predictive effect on reported concerns about COVID-19 information acquisition. Gender was not a significant predictor of reported concerns about COVID-19, panic buying, or reported social distancing by refusing visitors.",

This analysis attempted to explain what type of groups tended to cancel outings during the epidemic, which found that safeguarding behaviours for being outside had a significant predictive effect on reported social distancing by cancelling outings, meaning those who want to adopt protective measures for being outside (such as wearing a mask when going out or washing hands after going out) are more likely to cancel outings. Thus, during the outbreak, we should promote maskwearing and handwashing among people who are currently not willing to take such preventive measures. With respect to the influences of risk beliefs with regard to being outside, perceived risk of COVID-19, and psychological stress, each variable emerged as a nonsignificant predictor for explaining reported social distancing by cancelling outings, which means that respondents' risk beliefs, risk perceptions, and psychological stress have no effect on social distancing measures of cancelling outings. Consistent with a previous study indicating demographic differences in behaviour (Bish and Michie 2010) , the variables of gender and education were key determinants in predicting reported social distancing by cancelling outings in this study.",

The variable of reported concern about COVID-19 information acquisition had significant predictive effects on reported social distancing by refusing visitors and cancelling outings. These results mean that increasing concern about COVID-19 could promote cancelling of outings and refusals of visitors. In addition, reported concern about COVID-19 information sharing was a strong predictor for panic buying of food but had no significant predictive effect on panic buying of masks. Reported concerns about COVID-19 information acquisition had no significant predictive effects on panic buying of masks or food.

First, given the limited resources available and timesensitivity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the sample size of the study was relatively small. As a result, the conclusion was less generalizable to the entire population. It will be important to invite more people to verify the results of this study. Second, our data only reflect the views of those in China and may not be applicable to other cultures. It would be ideal to characterize psychological and behavioural responses across the globe during pandemics in order to implement positive nonpharmaceutical measures and control panic buying, which often are culturally specific. Notwithstanding the above limitations, our study provides invaluable information on people's psychological and behavioural responses during the first stage in the development of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which could be used as a historical reference. Most importantly, our findings contribute to the prediction of reported social distancing and panic buying behaviours, which were directly related to the application of nonpharmaceutical measures and social management during the epidemic.",
