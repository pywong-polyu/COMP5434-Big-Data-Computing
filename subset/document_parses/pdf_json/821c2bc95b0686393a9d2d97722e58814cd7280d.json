Up to April 2020, in the Emilia-Romagna region, as in many other Italian regions, death occurred in about 20% of cases, 5 6 with large differences by sex and age. 7 8 Although no treatment or vaccine has yet proven to be effective, progress has been made in understanding the pathological processes triggered by the virus and the body's response. 9 This has made it possible to identify populations at higher risk 8 10 11 and to introduce a number of drugs to manage COVID-19 patients that are currently being tested in many national and international trials. 12 With regard to controlling the spread of the disease, the contact tracing efforts of public health departments (PHD) and the social distancing measures progressively implemented by the Italian Government starting on 8 March 2020, have both played an important role. [13] [14] [15] Thanks to these measures, a reduction in the number of new cases was seen by the second half of April. Planning the start of Phase 2, which will entail a gradual reopening, has now begun. 16 During Phase 2, PHD containment activities will become even more crucial in preventing new outbreaks. These activities will take place alongside the follow-up of current cases. On 22 April 2020, there were more than 23 000 cases in the Emilia-Romagna region. 16 17 Until there is information on whether patients who are clinically recovered but still swab-positive are contagious, 18 and given the low sensitivity of viral tests, [19] [20] [21] patients must remain isolated until complete viral clearance is achieved as confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on two consecutive negative swabs. 22 As this will result in an enormous increase in the workload of national healthcare services, knowing as much as possible about the distribution of clearance timing and its determinants is fundamental to optimising the number of tests necessary to obtain viral clearance confirmation and thus to reducing the amount of time in unnecessary isolation of those patients who are clinically recovered. Given that relatively little time has passed since the epidemic began, this information is not yet available in the literature.",

These results describe a period of high viral load in the respiratory airways and, presumably, high transmissibility, starting about 3 days after symptom onset, 25 with a peak in viral load identified between the day before and 4 days after symptom onset and a decrease in load starting from day 8 after symptom onset.

Based on this, the WHO changed the recommendations to discontinue transmission-based precautions for COVID-19 patients. 36 However, virological and epidemiological evidence on the risk of transmission during the convalescent phase characterised by positive RT-PCR is weak, and current serological data have not provided any additional insight. 37 Furthermore, current epidemiological evidence of transmission has been influenced by how quarantine has been managed thus far.",

So that at least half of these tests are negative, testing should be done after more than 4 weeks once patients are symptom-free.

At the moment, paucisymptomatic subjects receive the recommendation to self-isolate during the symptomatic phase, but there are no clear indications on what to do once symptoms have disappeared. If these subjects have indeed been infected with SARS-2-CoV, all the evidence suggests that viral clearance even in them will not be achieved rapidly. To avoid generating secondary cases, either the isolation period should be longer (over 30 days from symptom onset) or at least one follow-up test should be done before ceasing isolation.",
