The purpose of this study was to explore how the new teaching approaches and requirements have impacted teachers' self-efficacy, specifically instructional and engagement efficacy. The current study included 361 participants from across the United States who completed the Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale (TSES) subsections of instruction and engagement. The results found the average teacher self-efficacy scores for both instruction and engagement were lower than TSES scores of instruction and engagement in previous studies. The results also indicated teachers who are teaching virtually had the lowest efficacy scores compared to teachers teaching in a hybrid or all in-person model. However, the results suggested no difference in efficacy score based on years of teaching experience, teacher location, previous accolades, or instruction level.",

School districts across the country took different approaches to return to school for the 2020e2021 school year, with some districts returning with face-to-face instruction with students socially distanced, while other districts returned with hybrid teaching (alternating face-to-face and virtual instruction), and 100% virtual instruction. No matter the instructional approach, teachers returned to the classroom facing drastically different environments, routines, and instructional approaches. These requirements included mandates from districts to learn new virtual instruction pedagogy and platforms and provide instruction to all students no matter the instructional approach. With all these changes and challenges teachers faced, teachers were still responsible for providing instruction through engaging lessons just as they have in past years, but teachers now had to alter this instruction due to COVID-19 policies. Up to this point, researchers have begun to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on teachers Hoang et al., 2020; Song, Wu, & Zhi, 2020; Vu et al., 2020) , but this article is the first to analyze and explore the potential impact of teachers in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic on teacher self-efficacy.",

These capabilities include symbolizing, forethought, vicarious, self-regulatory, and selfreflective. Through the environment, behaviors, and personal factors, these capabilities play a role in a person's views on their ability to complete a particular task. Specifically, Bandura refers to a person's views on their ability to achieve a particular outcome as selfefficacy (Bandura, 1997) . Information regarding a person's efficacy comes from previous success in the specific domain, observing others through vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion from others, and a person's physiological state (Bandura, 1986 (Bandura, , 1997 . When it comes to performance, a person's perceived self-efficacy may impact a person's competence and performance in that domain (Bandura, 1986 (Bandura, , 1997 . Within the context of teaching, teacher self-efficacy focuses on \"the teacher's belief in his or her capability to organize and execute a course of action required to accomplish a specific teaching task in a particular context\" (Tschannen-Moran, Hoy, & Hoy, 1998, p. 233 ).",

Furthermore, teachers with higher self-efficacy are more open to new teaching methods and more persistent when facing challenges (Pressley, Roehrig, & Turner, 2018; Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998) . Additionally, previous research has found teacher self-efficacy impacts student outcomes (Klassen et al., 2011) and instructional quality (Kunsting et al., 2016) . When it comes to student academic outcomes, teachers with high teacher self-efficacy often have more success because they are more comfortable scaffolding students through mistakes, building relationships with students (Hajovsky et al., 2020) , and increasing student engagement within the classroom (Good & Brophy, 2003; Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998) . Additionally, teachers with high self-efficacy are more likely to have high expectations of student academic achievement (Tournaki & Podell, 2005; Fackler & Malmberg, 2016) and have more success at raising student academic achievement (Anderson et al., 1988; Midgley et al., 1989) .",

At the school level, a school's physical location does not impact a teacher's self-efficacy; however, the school environment does play a role (Tschannen-Moran & Hoy, 2007) . School environments that have teachers with high, attainable goals and create a serious learning environment tend to have higher teacher selfefficacy (Hoy & Woolfolk, 1993; Wolters & Daugherty, 2007) . Within the environment, the principal and school community may impact teaching efficacy through resources of vicarious learning and verbal persuasion (Fackler & Malmberg, 2016) . The relationships teachers form within the school environment may impact teacher self-efficacy, with teachers who develop stronger relationships with other teachers tend to have higher efficacy than teachers with many weak relationships (Siciliano, 2016) .",

Though the researchers did not specifically focus on teacher selfefficacy, the focus of the study was on teacher sense of success and the variables that impacted their feeling of success. The researchers found through pre/post surveys that teachers struggled with balance between teaching and personal lives, learning new technology, and disengaged students. Kraft et al. (2020) found teachers with school and district leaders who communicated clearly and provided fair expectations had less dip in their sense of success. Additionally, teachers who received professional development that supported virtual instruction and had opportunities to collaborate with other teachers had a stronger sense of success (Kraft et al., 2020) .",

Specifically, Wolters and Daugherty (2007) found teachers instructional efficacy scores averaged 7.36 and engagement averaged 6.86 across 1000 teachers. They also saw slight differences when comparing school levels, with elementary having the highest instruction and engagement efficacy scores than middle and high school teachers. When focusing on years of experience, Wolters and Daugherty (2007) found instruction scores ranged from 6.88 to 7.59, with more experienced teachers reporting higher instruction efficacy. Engagement efficacy ranged from 6.86 to 6.95, with teachers with 6e10 years of experience reporting the highest efficacy score. It is important to note that Wolters and Daugherty (2007) evaluated teacher self-efficacy of teachers in one school district in Texas at a general level rather than a specific context or multiple districts, states, or countries. Additionally, the teachers included in the study had a variety of differences in teaching environments (e.g., number of students, student characteristics', and subject taught), which may influence teacher self-efficacy differently at each level.",

Specifically, we felt there would be differences between the instructional types. Due to the newness and challenges that come with teaching virtual (e.g., building relationships with students, limitations of instructional techniques, and use of manipulatives), we believed teachers who were teaching on an all-virtual approach would have lower efficacy scores compared to hybrid or face-toface teachers (Dolighan & Owen, 2021; Marshall et al., 2020; Honigsfeld & Nordmeyer, 2020) . We also predicted that teachers who taught in a suburban setting would have significantly higher efficacy scores than teachers teaching in rural or urban settings due to internet and technology access, which may lead to more difficulties with distance learning (Rabaglietti et al., 2021; Simmons, 2020) . Lastly, we predicted that teachers who had received previous accolades teacher of the Year (TOY)) would have higher efficacy due to past teaching success (Bandura, 1986 (Bandura, , 1997 Wolters & Daugherty, 2007) . We decided to use previous TOY to group teachers who have previous success in the classroom to identify potential differences in teacher self-efficacy (Palmer et al., 2005) .",

Additionally, there were differences between the instructional types; however, contrary to our predictions, both hybrid and all virtual teachers had lower efficacy than all in-person teachers. We also predicted that teachers with previous accolades (former TOY) would have higher instructional and engagement efficacy scores. To our surprise, there was no difference in instructional or engagement efficacy based on teacher accolades.

            "text": "The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of returning to teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic on teacher instructional and engagement efficacy. As one of the first empirical studies focused on the impact of COVID-19 on teacher self-efficacy, the current results suggest teachers had a lower efficacy during fall 2020. When it came to the average of instructional and engagement efficacy, both averages indicated teachers felt they had some influence on instruction and engagement (Tschannen-Moran & Hoy, 2001 ). In the current study, the average teacher self-efficacy scores for both instructional and engagement efficacy were lower than TSES scores of instruction and engagement in previous studies (Wolters & Daugherty, 2007; ) . Though we do not know if the difference is significant, we felt it was important to note the current efficacies averaged 1e2 points lower than previous averages. It is also worth noting that previous studies have found teacher selfefficacy scores associated with teaching experience (Hoy & Wollfok, 1993; Wolters & Daugherty, 2007) , but in the current study, this was not the case. Thus, leading the researchers to believe that teaching experience does not lead to high teacher self-efficacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. This difference may be due to the COVID-19 teaching requirements and teaching experiences, which are new for all teachers. These new teaching requirements, such as learning to teach virtually, learning new technology, and adapting lesson plans for virtual and hybrid instruction, may impact experienced teachers because they have not had previous mastery experiences teaching virtually or hybrid classes or experiences using the different virtual platforms. Teachers also may have been reassessing their teacher self-efficacy because of the new challenges they faced transitioning instruction to hybrid and virtual formats (Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998) or had a decrease due to an increase in stress and anxiety from teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic Bandura, 1997) . Compared to other studies completed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the current study found similar results concerning teacher self-efficacy Dolighan & Owen, 2021; Rabaglietti et al., 2021) . The initial studies on teacher self-efficacy during the pandemic indicate many teachers had a decrease in self efficacy, which was also connected to teacher stress (Rabaglietti et al., 2021) and burnout (Pellerone, 2021) . When comparing the current results to previous teacher self-efficacy studies, we believe the current study provides a glimpse of how United States teachers felt during one particular time of the year. We urge others to continue exploring the impact of teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to begin to generalize findings.",

Because this data collection occurred at the beginning of the school year, teachers may not have received feedback on lesson plans or had administrators observe virtual instruction yet.

Additionally, there was no significant difference between previous TOY and non-TOY. This result indicates previous success in the classroom did not influence teachers' instructional or engagement efficacy, which indicates that previous TOY did not connect teaching during fall 2020 with previous success in the classroom or previous TOY did not have mastery experiences with instruction provided during COVID-19 (Hoy & Woolfolk, 1993; Wolters & Daugherty, 2007) .

Teachers may feel overwhelmed with new policies requiring teachers to commit more time to develop lessons, administering assessments, and student attendance policies. By providing more flexibility in some of the required policies, districts can provide teachers more autonomy in their lessons and assignments, which may increase teacher self-efficacy as teachers can focus on teaching students rather than balancing multiple district policies. Districts should provide professional development opportunities in areas that teachers are struggling (Yoo, 2016) . Districts can survey teachers for specific topics that may be useful to their teaching to support teacher self-efficacy but might focus on specific topics such as engaging students online, developing lesson plans for online instruction, and communicating with parents. To support vicarious learning, a district can have PD run by teachers within the district as an opportunity for teachers to learn from other teachers. Districts can offer PD throughout the school year or over the summer to support teacher's self-efficacy during the year and help teachers prepare for future instruction (Dolighan & Owen, 2021; Kraft et al., 2021; Morris & Usher, 2011; Yoo, 2016) . Lastly, districts should explore other variables that may influence teacher's self-efficacy through verbal persuasion and mental state, such as teacher stress, parent communication, and anxiety while teaching during a pandemic Stipek, 2012; Tschannen-Moran & Hoy, 2007) .",

If schools or districts begin to see high levels of stress or anxiety, administrators might consider providing a mental health day for teachers on a day that students are not receiving instruction. Though these approaches may be common for schools and districts during a typical school year, the 2020e2021 school year is drastically different, and supporting teacher self-efficacy may not be the first concern at the moment with schools and districts working through growing pains of instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teachers can also focus on specific aspects at the individual level, which may help raise teacher self-efficacy. To support engagement efficacy, teachers can build in time to develop relationships with students. During a regular school year, teachers focus on building relationships with students throughout the year, but especially during the beginning of the year (Author, 2020; Beaty-O'Ferrall et al., 2015) . Teachers should continue to focus on relationship building no matter the instructional set-up. Teachers may have to alter the activities previously done to build relationships due to social-distancing guidelines or virtual format but should prioritize these activities throughout the school year. Furthermore, teachers can set daily and weekly goals for themselves. Setting goals may allow teachers to feel accomplished and may help teachers feel the multitude of tasks required for them is more manageable if broken up throughout the week. Lastly, teachers can reflect on their lessons and make necessary changes throughout the year to encourage student engagement and improve instruction (Author, 2020; Feiman-Nemser, 2003) .",

Teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic is new and challenging for all educational stakeholders. The current study is one of the first to explore the potential impact on teacher self-efficacy during fall 2020. However, the current study had some limitations that future studies should look to address. First, data collection occurred at one point in time during the fall 2020 academic school year; given the assumption that teacher self-efficacy changes based on experiences, a longitudinal study should examine the changes in efficacy throughout the school year. Also, a longitudinal study would allow researchers to track teacher self-efficacy changes as many districts look to move from all virtual instruction to a hybrid format. It would also be important to note any changes in efficacy if districts moved back to an all-virtual approach due to the spread of COVID-19 during the 2020e2021 school year and into future years. Second, the current study had a limited sample size of teachers. Future studies should include larger sample sizes and include larger and more diverse samples of teachers based on locations, instructional type, and level. Lastly, future studies should include quantitative and qualitative work investigating possible predictor variables for lower efficacy and other variables that may impact teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The results also suggested that teachers who are providing all virtual instruction had the lowest instruction and engagement efficacies of the three different instructional approaches. However, the results did not find significant differences in efficacy based on teacher location, previous accolades, or level. Future research should continue to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on teachers as they are essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
