Andrographis paniculata is an indigenous medicinal plant found in Malaysia and Thailand [1, 2, 4, 5] that has antioxidant properties to scavenge free radicals [6, 7] and stimulate the immune system [8, 9] against foreign matter entering the body, thereby inhibiting the growth of cancer cells [5, [10] [11] [12] . This plant is widely used for treating sore throats, flu and upper respiratory tract infections [5, 13] . Therefore, the use of pesticides increases the harvest of Andrographis paniculate [14] .",

These techniques can simultaneously determine carbaryl with other carbamate insecticides but they require highly skilled operators and are cost-consuming. Electrochemical analysis [28] [29] [30] [31] to investigate carbaryl content has advantages in terms of specific and low detection limits. However, this method requires skilled fabrication and modification of the working electrode. Fluorescence spectroscopy has also been used to determine carbaryl [32, 33] , providing advantages of selectivity detection, while spectrophotometric methods [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] are based on carbaryl hydrolysis to 1-naphthol, which is subsequently coupled with different reagents. Spectrophotometric procedures are considered to be appropriate as they involve commonly available laboratory instruments such as a spectrometer but they still need some specific requirements [39, 40] .",

Digital image acquisition devices such as a scanner, camera and smartphone built-in camera as cheap electronic components were employed to capture digital photo images [39] . Digital imaging analysis is an advanced technique to evaluate the color intensity of captured digital photo images using image processing software [41] . Pixels in red, green or blue channels with numerical values ranging from 0 to 255 can be utilized for analytical calibration [42] . Digital images provide data that can be used for fast and low-cost colorimetric detection of quantitative chemical analysis [43] . Smartphones are extensively employed in daily life as image acquisition tools because they are portable, with multiple data transmission functions and high storage capacity [44] . Digital image data acquired from image software can considerably enhance detection accuracy [45, 46] . Digital image analysis has been applied in various fields including environmental monitoring, food safety and clinical analysis due to its convenience, stability, low cost and flexibility [47, 48] . Digital image analysis has also been developed to determine liquid turbidity [42] and bacterial cell concentration in liquid media [49] .",
