            "text": "During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments instituted a series of measures to control the spread of the virus. The measures were widely believed to increase women's risk of violent victimization, most of which is by an intimate partner. We examined help-seeking during this period in a large U.S. city and used an interrupted time series analysis to assess the effects of three government interventions on domestic violence and sexual assault hotline calls and on \"911\" calls regarding domestic violence, assault, and rape. Declaration of an emergency appeared to reduce victim calls to the rape crisis hotline and the few \"911\" calls about rape. School closure was associated with a reduction in \"911\" calls about assault and rape and victim calls to the domestic violence hotline. Implementation of stay-athome orders was associated with a gradual increase in domestic violence hotline calls. Although \"911\" calls regarding assault fell by nearly half, calls to police for domestic violence were unchanged. In sum, there was a decrease in help-seeking for sexual assault and assault in general but not for domestic violence during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis underscores the importance of distinguishing between the violence itself, calls to police, and calls to helplines when claims are made about changes Journal of Interpersonal Violence 36(9-10) over time in violence against women. The opportunities and constraints for each can differ widely under usual circumstances, circumstances that were altered by public health interventions related to the pandemic.",

Job loss and firearm purchases provide two such examples. Record unemployment claims were filed and financial stressors increased in the population as stay-at-home policies and restrictions on inperson gatherings continued for months. These changes increased food insecurity, housing nonpayment, and utility nonpayment, which research indicates are associated with a higher likelihood of perpetrating multiple forms of physical violence against an intimate partner (e.g., Schwab-Reese et al., 2016) . In addition, firearm sales spiked during the pandemic; nine of the ten weeks with the most background checks have occurred since COVID-19 began (FBI, n.d.) . Firearms are the most common weapon intimate partners use to kill their partner (Fridel & Fox, 2019) , and the acquisition of a firearm is associated with women's higher risk of being murdered in the home (Wintemute et al., 1999) . Moreover, abusers use guns in ways that do not result in death, most commonly, to intimidate and coerce their partners (Sorenson, 2017) . Thus, some circumstances associated with the pandemic suggest that an increase in violence against women would be likely.",

Interventions to curb the pandemic could affect all three. For example, stay-at-home orders risk placing a motivated perpetrator more frequently in close proximity to an intimate partner, with children and other members of the household perhaps serving as obstacles or even additional targets. Impacts on household dynamics can differ in terms of the actual violence, calls to first responders, and calls to hotlines. As a result, patterns over time can differ, too. Thus, comprehensive claims about the pandemic's effects on violence should be met with some skepticism.",

It is important to note that law enforcement defines domestic violence broadly to include incidents \"characterized by intimacy, familial ties, or a shared household\" (Dempsey, 2006) . Previous analysis of \"911\" domestic violence calls in the city indicates that nearly 60% of the dispatch calls are screened out because they are unfounded or determined to be another type of call (Sorenson, 2017) . Of the remaining calls, responding officers considered 65.0% to be cases of intimate partner violence (Sorenson, 2017) . Thus, about one-fourth of all \"911\" calls for domestic violence are designated as incidents of intimate partner violence. There were 135 observations for the 135 days of calls to police.",

First popularized by Campbell and Stanley more than 50 years ago (1963) and considered a \"strong\" quasi-experimental design, it addresses abrupt causes that can sharply alter trends over time, unlike conventional before-after designs that include data at one point in time before an intervention and one point in time after. Before-after designs cannot properly represent time trends and are considered \"weak.\" By controlling for longitudinal confounders that change gradually, many competing causal explanations can be properly discarded with interrupted time series designs. Such designs also have the capacity to capture the impact of interventions in a dynamic form that allows for somewhat more gradual time trend changes even when the intervention is sudden. Furthermore, several effective diagnostic tools can help in the initial model specification and evaluations of the results.",

In our analyses, these difficulties were circumvented by specifying in advance a sensible time series model and not altering it throughout the analyses. This was possible because we knew the timing of the interventions, anticipated particular dynamic changes in the response variable, and used subject-matter insights to specify a seasonal ARIMA formulation for the residuals. The results of the specification were evaluated for each interrupted time series analysis undertaken (Box et al., 2016) . In each case, there was no evidence of misspecification of the mean function or of the variance function; the residuals were effectively white noise.",

As such, we surmise that rapid changes in household structure and routine activities (e.g., child care, food preparation, and home-schooling) impacted hotline utilization during the initial adjustment period. An additional conjecture, drawing on routine activities theory, is that partners were able to stay out of the home for work or other reasons, which initially led to a decrease in domestic violence itself when the children could not go to school.

Victim service providers surmised that the observed pattern of findings also might reflect a change in the population of help-seekers, specifically, college students. Rates of campus sexual assault are high and acquaintances are the most common perpetrator (Cantor et al., 2020) . Declaration of a disaster emergency corresponded closely to the start of spring break for the many colleges and universities in the Philadelphia region.

Safe housing is an especially important example. Reluctance to go to an emergency shelter is understandable in the context of what is known about the transmission of COVID-19. Existing policies and practices, such as providing temporary housing vouchers when shelters are full, could be expanded if private or government funding was made available.",

Vulnerable populations need to be taken into account when devising public health interventions. Restrictions on movement during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States largely ignored the needs of abused and assaulted women; stay-at-home orders increased exposure to an abusive partner without providing additional supports for victims. In addition, the findings highlight the importance of examining multiple data sources when addressing a seemingly simple question.",
