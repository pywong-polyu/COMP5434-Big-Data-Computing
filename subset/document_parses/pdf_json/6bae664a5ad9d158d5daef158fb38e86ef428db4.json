            "text": "Biogeographic patterns in microorganisms are poorly understood, despite the importance of microbial communities for a range of ecosystem processes. Our knowledge of microbial ecology and biogeography is particularly deficient in rare and threatened ecosystems. We tested for three ecological patterns in microbial community composition within ephemeral wetlands-vernal pools-located across Baja California (Mexico) and California (USA): (1) habitat filtering; (2) a latitudinal diversity gradient; and (3) distance decay in community composition. Paired water and soil samples were collected along a latitudinal transect of vernal pools, and bacterial and archaeal communities were characterized using 16S rDNA sequencing. We identified two main microbial communities, with one community present in the soil matrix that included archaeal and bacterial soil taxa, and another community present in the overlying water that was dominated by common freshwater bacterial taxa. Aquatic microbial communities were more diverse in the north, and displayed a significant but inverted latitudinal diversity pattern. Aquatic communities also exhibited a significant distance-decay pattern, with geographic proximity, and precipitation explaining part of the community variation. Collectively these results indicate greater sensitivity to spatial and environmental variation in vernal pool aquatic microbial communities than in soil microbial communities. We conclude that vernal pool aquatic microbial communities can display distribution patterns similar to those exhibited by larger organisms, but differ in some key aspects, such as the latitudinal gradient in diversity.",

Quantifying how microbial communities assemble and how microbial taxa are distributed across ecosystems is therefore important to our understanding of ecological equilibrium. As such, a central question in microbial ecology is the degree to which microbes follow ecological patterns displayed by \"macroorganisms\" [9, 16, 17, 26, 35, 50] . Traditionally, microorganisms were thought to be widely distributed in all ecosystems due to their small size and high dispersal rates, with the environment responsible for \"selecting\" microorganisms according to their metabolic attributes [1, 44] . Niche theory predicts community composition as a result of environmental filtering, and irrespective of geographic proximity [42] -for example, salinity, temperature variation, oxygen limitation, and other particular conditions can strongly influence microbial community assembly in natural habitats [22, 39, 45, 49] . However, it is equally clear that a combination of historical events and contemporary factors are important in determining diversity and community composition, and that microbial communities can display broad biogeographic patterns [12, 26, 50] . Ultimately, microbial communities distributed within and across different ecosystems may be shaped by different assembly processes to differing degrees, providing insight into microbial community assembly in comparison to larger organisms.",

Reflecting the climatic extremes typical of Mediterranean-climate ecosystems (moist and cold winters followed by hot and dry summers), vernal pools can form where water collects in shallow depressions with a high clay content and a deeper cemented layer (which prevents water percolation to the subsoil). Defined as temporary wetlands, and characterized by consecutive aquatic and terrestrial phases, vernal pools display seasonal transitions from completely flooded to totally desiccated soils [48] . During winters with sufficient precipitation, vernal pools fill with rainwater, creating water \"islands\" embedded in a surrounding terrestrial ecosystem. Vernal pools then progressively retract and eventually dry out in warmer months as evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation. Vernal pools therefore encompass both aquatic as well as soil habitats-which both vary strongly over the year, and may interact in various ways (e.g., via species that transition between the different environments, or via fluxes of carbon and nutrients). How microorganisms colonize these ecosystems, and tolerate the variations within them, directly addresses the roles of geography versus environment in affecting community assembly.",

Under one extreme, saturated soils often reach anoxic conditions that may affect the distribution of microorganisms [7] . On the other extreme, dry and hot conditions during Mediterranean-type summers may require adaptations-for example, desiccation-adapted microalgae may persist dormant on dry stream beds until water flow resumes [43] . During the rainy season, inundated vernal pools resemble permanent aquatic ecosystems, however, the strong seasonality of Mediterranean-climate vernal pools shares attributes with other ephemeral aquatic ecosystems like seasonally flooded deltas, wetlands (pitlands), or floodplains [27, 37] . Freshwater ecosystems are generally inhabited by similar microbial groups (i.e., \"typical freshwater bacteria\"; Zwart et al. [51] ) regardless of geographic location and characteristics, but with significant spatial and temporal variation within these groups [33] . These groups include typical freshwater Actinobacteria; alpha-, beta-, and gamma-proteobacteria; Cytophaga-Flavobateria-Bacteroides; and Verrucomicrobia [33, 51] . Whether similar freshwater bacterial groups colonize filled vernal pools-or whether they are inhabited by more specialized groups-is unknown. In either case, these communities may be used to examine biogeographic patterns in microorganisms. In particular, vernal pools can be considered habitable islands for microbes, and microbes may show geographical patterns in diversity and community composition [2, 14, 19, 32, 40] .",

However, whether such gradients result from a longer, more stable period of diversification in the tropics, higher speciation rates in the tropics, or lower extinction rates in comparison with temperate regions, still remains unresolved for larger organisms [29] . The presence and causes behind latitudinal patterns for microbes are even less clear. For example, Fuhrman et al. [15] detected a significant decrease in planktonic marine bacterial richness from the equator to the poles in the open ocean, but with notable variability in diversity at lower latitudes. Following a transect from mid-latitudes to the polar circles within lakes of South America and Antarctica, Schiaffino et al. [40] detected a decrease in evenness of microbial eukaryotes with decreasing latitude, but variations in richness were less clear. On land, Newsham et al. [32] detected a significant decrease in the richness of soil microfungi with increasing latitude along a 1650 km transect in Antarctica. These studies indicate that both aquatic and soil microbial communities may follow latitude-diversity gradients, but with notable differences in the shape and strength of these patterns-suggesting that additional research is needed. The distribution of vernal pools across the California province extends from 30 to 42\u00b0N (~ 2400 km), providing an opportunity to examine spatial patterns in diversity and community composition. Although this latitudinal range does not extend from the tropics to the poles, it provides a wide range of climatic conditions over which to test for the presence of diversity gradients.",

Distance-decay patterns can be explained by the neutral theory that predicts community composition as a result of geographic proximity, where community similarity is driven by spatially limited dispersal, independent from environmental differences between sites [20, 31] , on the other hand, environmental conditions play a key role by \"filtering\" some taxa, in that microbial communities that are closer together in space may experience similar environments. The degree to which distance-decay relationships are shaped by dispersal capabilities (spatial distance), environmental differences, or a combination of both, may differ among ecosystems. For example, community dissimilarity among microbial communities in alpine lakes can be partly explained by the distance between sites [19] , whereas temporary cave-pool microbial communities are explained by the sunlight exposure and environmental properties of the water [41] . For microbial communities in vernal pools of the California province, there is a lack of studies focusing on these ecological features.",

Niche theory [42] states that the environment is the strongest driver for species to persist or recruit; in this context, moist and drought conditions may play a role in structuring microbial communities. If this is true, we expect to observe different microbial communities in saturated versus unsaturated soils, according to the seasonal-environmental variation in vernal pools, with a third community type present in the overlying water column. (ii) Considering that vernal pools are distributed latitudinally, we hypothesized the existence of a gradual increase in diversity of microorganisms along a transect from southern sites in Mexico to northern sites in the USA. (iii) In parallel, considering that vernal pools act as scattered or clustered habitat \"islands\" [47] , we hypothesized that microbial communities will present spatial distribution patterns reflected in the community composition from each vernal pool. Thus, a distance-decay pattern is expected, where isolated vernal pools will have less similar microbial communities as a function of the space between pools. (iv) Finally, local environmental selection is likely to drive community composition as a result of the specific environmental properties across localities. We hypothesized that environmental variation in temperature and precipitation may be significant drivers of community similarity, explaining diversity between pools, sites, and regions, regardless of spatial proximity. Alternatively, dispersal capacity of microorganisms may be important in community assembly. If this is true, we expect to observe a relationship based mostly on spatial distances.",

We sampled each pool three times randomly from the center to the edge using a soil core, and homogenized the soil samples in sterile plastic bags. We collected one sample of 0.2 g of dry soil per pool in summer August 2016 for a total of 11 different pools. As a counterpart, we collected 0.2 g of \"wet soil\" from the same pools, but saturated with rainfall during the winter 2017, for a total of 11 pools. Unfortunately, four vernal pools were lost due to urbanization during our sampling period between summer and winter, and due to federal regulations, vernal pool soils were not possible to access in the USA, leaving three locations without soil and wet soil samples (Table 1 ). Both sample types were stored in 2 ml centrifuge tubes with dry ice before processing in the laboratory. In parallel, we also collected 100 ml of water per vernal pool during the winters of 2016 and 2017, for a total of 27 water samples analyzed in this study; some pools in Valle de las Palmas and Colonet regions were sampled twice during 2017 corresponding to different rain events. We filtered the microorganisms from the water samples using Waltham brand\u00ae filters of 0.23 \u03bcm pore size. After filtration, the filters were preserved in lysing tubes with a sucrose EDTA lysis solution and transported to the lab for DNA extractions [19] . Equipment was sterilized in between samples with 5% bleach, 100% ethanol, and rinsed with MilliQ water five times. Soil and filters were processed for DNA extractions with QIAGEN DNeasy \u24c7 extraction kits. Final DNA aliquots with 50 \u03bcl per vernal pool were diluted to a final concentration of 20 ng per \u03bcl for further amplification and sequencing.",

Vernal pools evidently represent isolated aquatic \"islands\" surrounded by completely terrestrial ecosystems. This raises interesting questions, such as where, when, and how freshwater microbes colonize vernal pools. Related to this, the geographical distribution of pools across Baja California and California was important for aquatic microbial community assembly, but not for soil microbial communities.

            "text": "We expected that vernal pool variability (desiccation to inundation) could potentially select for unique taxa, but we found that vernal pool microbial communities in water were dominated by \"typical\" freshwater bacterial taxa [21, 33, 34, 51] . These groups are commonly found across a wide range of freshwater ecosystems, and specifically include Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (Fig. 3) . For example, we found that eight of the most common ASVs in water (each > 1% of all sequences, with higher abundances in some individual pools) were 98.3-100% identical to database sequences found in other freshwater ecosystems (Table S1 ). This included sequences from a large-scale study of freshwater bacterioplankton [8] , as well as multiple whole genomes recovered from other freshwater ecosystems. Actinobacteria are also common in freshwater [33] , and were present (albeit less abundant overall) in vernal pools. Even within those samples with lower sequence reads (water sample VP025), these common freshwater taxa were dominant. These findings suggest that common freshwater microbes are able to colonize vernal pools each year in spite of the ephemeral nature of the pools. How exactly vernal pools are populated by common freshwater taxa, and whether vernal pools contain endemic archaeal and bacterial communities are interesting questions worthy of additional study and experimentation. Freshwater bacteria are notably widespread [51] , and the attributes of vernal pools may help provide insight into their broad geographic distribution and the connectivity between freshwater ecosystems via animals or air. For example, possible transport pathways could involve larger organisms that use the vernal pools as a place of rest and breeding, such as migratory birds. Amphibians breeding in stock ponds might also play a role as a vector for microbial taxa, transporting and connecting permanent freshwaters with vernal pools. Additionally, rain might play an important role in transporting microorganisms [11] . On the other hand, these Mediterranean-climate vernal pools have a cemented layer preventing interchangeable flows from subsoil to surface, which reduces the possibility of groundwater connectivity. Considering the impact of anthropogenic activities over the landscape-where some vernal pools have been transformed into stock ponds, and other human-made water reservoirs are located nearby-anthropogenic activities may also be relevant in the context of microbial distributions and their alterations [22] . Finally, some taxa may also disperse widely by wind, and environmental constraints between habitats might shape microbial communities [10] .",

We detected several patterns in microbial communities (e.g., a significant latitude-diversity gradient and distance decay)-but these patterns were only significant for aquatic communities. In the case of soil, our results indicate that conditions in vernal pool soils select for consistent microbial communities across distant locations, with the exception of one sample located at the southern edge of our region of study (soil sample 46-ColonetV, Fig. 2 outlier) . Several factors might have obscured our ability to detect significant patterns in soil, if present. One issue is the presence of relic DNA coming from extracellular or non-intact cells, which can account for 40 to 80% of prokaryotic DNA in soils, and can persist in soil for weeks to years [24] . Another possibility is that precipitation events have an impact on the microbial community by \"resetting\" a well-established microbial community. In combination with physicochemical properties (i.e., cation exchange capacity and pH), this could have a direct effect on the recovery of eDNA [6, 24] . Microbial adaptations to survive long periods of desiccation and the transition from flooding to desiccation could result in low variation from one phase to another [43] . Finally, our soil sampling was necessarily more spatially limited than our water sampling, and additional sampling could capture greater community variation. Including other molecular techniques such as metatranscriptomic sequencing may also help reveal additional patterns, especially within soil microbial communities.",

Some ecological explanations for such inverted gradients rely on specific interactions between taxa-for example, predation-and theories of energy around environmental systems [30] . We suggest that the most likely explanation for this relationship is related to precipitation, as much higher precipitation rates occur at higher latitudes along our sampling transect, previous studies have addressed a climate-latitudinal diversity gradient in other temporal freshwater bodies [23] . As a result, vernal pools in southern latitudes have shorter periods of inundation, and dispersal may be diminished due to the absence of nearby water bodies. This may result in more uneven communities. Based on the limited energy hypothesis behind latitudinal diversity-which states that sunlight is directly correlated with plant productivity and species biodiversity [30] -another possible explanation is that higher primary production in Northern California is a reflection of longer growth periods (due to greater precipitation rates), with inundated vernal pools lasting longer and favoring higher diversity. Moreover, the inverse prokaryotic diversity gradient observed among these study sites may be associated with eukaryotic diversity patterns, which we did not evaluate.",

The pattern we described in this study has been found in freshwater bodies, where the existing pattern of dissimilarity (community isolation) is a product of both environmental differences and the spatial distance between sites [19, 41] . Our results also partially explain the distance-decay pattern based on both climatic variation and dispersal capabilities, indicating that environmental selection and microbial dispersal are both important for vernal pool aquatic microbial community assembly. Further studies should directly address if surrounding freshwater bodies, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, or large organisms provide vernal pools with freshwater taxa. Related to this, interspecific interactions-such as predation or other symbiotic relationships-may also affect vernal pool microbial communities to varying degrees. Stochastic events and anthropogenic influences may also be important [22, 50] , for example, across our sampling gradients, pools at southern latitudes remain more pristine. Given their inherent attributes and significant distance decay in microbial community similarity, vernal pools appear to be an effective study system for studying microbial community assembly.",

            "text": "This research is the first formal attempt to characterize and quantify microbial communities in Mediterranean-climate vernal pools in North America, providing initial insight into the microbial ecology of these endangered ecosystems. Overall, our study indicates that environmental selection plays an important role in defining distinct vernal pool microbial communities in soil and water. Aquatic communities in vernal pools exhibit a non-traditional latitudinal diversity pattern, which may be partially explained by precipitation patterns. Dispersal limitation is important as well, as a combination of spatial and environmental variation shaping the assembly of vernal pool aquatic microbial communities. Whether such patterns are consistent over longer time periods, and what mechanisms are involved to assemble community differences observed here are important future research avenues. Vernal pools are well-known for being inhabited by organisms adapted to both aquatic and terrestrial conditions (e.g., plants), with life cycles modified in order to survive shifts of inundation and total desiccation in a short period of time. Occasionally this transition occurs quickly, with intermittent precipitation and evapotranspiration happening rapidly within days. Exploring these transitions at different temporal scales may provide insights about \"amphibious behavior\" in microorganisms inhabiting these ecosystemsi.e., the ability to survive in both soil and water. Finally, additional spatial, temporal, and biological (e.g., plant and animal hosts and vectors) sampling may reveal new biological discoveries in these endangered vernal pool ecosystems.",
