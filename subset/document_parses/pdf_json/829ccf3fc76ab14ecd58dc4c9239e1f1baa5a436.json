Electrochemical aptamer-based nanobiosensor with high sensitivity and selectivity for quantitative and qualitative measurement of HER2-ECD oncomarker was developed. In this study, the nanocomposite made by distinct materials included reduced graphene oxide nano-sheets (rGONs) and rhodium nanoparticles (Rh-NPs) on the graphite electrode (GE) surface. This structure resulted in amplified electrochemical activity, high surface area, stability, and bio-compatibility. Each of the steps of preparing nanomaterials and setting up biosensor were carefully examined by analytical and electrochemical techniques. Various modified electrodes were constructed and analyzed in terms of electrochemical performance, morphology, size, and shape of nanomaterials. The GE-based aptasensor had a noteworthy and conducive results against HER2-ECD with a wide dynamic range of 10.0-500.0 ng/mL, a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.667 ng/mL (significantly less than the clinical cut-off), and a low limit of quantification (LOQ) of 2.01 ng/mL. The benefits provided by this aptasensor such as broad dynamic range, high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and low cost suggest tremendous potential for non-invasive detection and monitoring of the HER2-ECD levels of BC care and clinical diagnosis.",

According to statistics reported in 2021, BC with a population of 2.26 million people has the highest number of cancer patients worldwide 2,3 . BC is a complex disease that causes the severe alterations in the levels of genes, proteins, and metabolites 4 . It is impossible to provide adequate and timely treatmentwithout a thorough diagnosis. Sensitive, selective, and rapid diagnostic testing methods not only pave the way for a more effective treatment, but also have a great impact on preventing a variety of cancers, especially BC 5 . Therefore, Medical screening and early detection of BC through quantitative oncomarker measurements are essential to timely follow-up, enhance survival rate, and reduce mortality 6 . Definitive procedures for diagnosing primary stages of BC include mastography, biopsy, ultrasound imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, techniques based on gene expression and quantitation such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) are used to diagnose BC in women 7-9 . However, most of these techniques face several limitations including high complexity, being too expensive, and a significant reduction in sensitivity and specificity 10-12 . For these reasons, researchers have prioritized the development of non-invasive, inexpensive, sensitive, and user-friendly diagnostic technologies to monitor BC at specific times for effective treatment 13 . As a result, novel analytical OPEN and humidity with 95% for 5 min to block the activated carboxyl functional groups on the surface of modified electrode that are not bonded with the amino functional groups of anti-HER2 aptamer.

Electrochemical biosensors have been utilized as a promising diagnostic tool to qualitatively and quantitatively determination of oncomarkers due to their fast reaction, ease of use, low cost, and low detection limit. In fabricating new electrochemical biosensors, it is crucial to select a flawless electrode matrix to optimize the electrochemical response [14] [15] [16] [17] . Identifying the oncomarkers used for early detection, recurrence, and monitoring of BC metastasis are necessary. HER2-ECD is one of these oncomarkers in the process of BC diagnosis and treatment through HER2-targeted therapy. The primary mechanism of HER2-ECD receptor overexpression is amplification of its oncogene found on chromosome 17q12. The presence of this oncomarker is essential for the growth and advancement of certain aggressive malignancies such as lung, ovarian, breast, gastric, and oral cancers 18 . HER2-ECD concentration in blood of healthy people and BC patients is in the range of 4.0 to 14 ng/ mL and 15 to 75 ng/mL, respectively. which can be used for diagnosis and active surveillance of patients at risk or in treatment 19 . HER2-ECD with higher-than-normal levels are called HER2-positive or HER2 + . People who are identified as HER2 + in BC diagnostic processes, enter the treatment protocol with Herceptin. Herceptin is a monoclonal antibody (Ab) specifically designed and approved to target HER2 receptors on the surface of BC cells and block them from receiving growth signals 20 .",

Due to their superior physical and chemical features, rGONs have been extensively used in flexible electronics, batteries, supercapacitors, sensors, and so on. However, rGONs have a propensity to agglomerate or restack through van der Waals forces and pi-pi stacking interactions. Stabilizers or chemical modifiers are usually exploited to enhance the dispersibility of rGONs, but these methods often diminish their analytical performance. Recently, various methods have been developed to prevail over rGONs agglomeration.

To produce multi-layers of GONs on the GE surface, electrochemical oxidation and exfoliation were performed for four sequential sweeps in PBS (pH 6.5) at anodic potentials ranging from 0.0 to + 3.0 V. As shown in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in Fig. 1a , electrochemical oxidation of graphite structure eventuated during the positive sweep at around + 1.4 V. During the electrochemical oxidation process, the van der waals and other cohesive forces in the midst of graphene sheets decreased and the layers separated and spaced apart with the help of gas evolution. Thus, intercalation and exfoliation of graphite to GONs occurred. Intercalating compounds comprising a diverse spectrum of hydrophilic oxygenated functional groups (i.e. hydroxyl, epoxy, carbonyl, carboxylic acid) were produced which the majority of them situated at the edges of basal planes 37, 38 . CV scanning in cathodic potentials ranging from 0.0 to \u2212 1.60 V for five sequential sweeps in PBS (pH 6.9) was used to electrochemically reduce the GONs to rGONs (Fig. 1b) . The curve in the first cyclic voltammogram of electrochemical reduction shows a significant and broad cathodic peak current at about \u2212 1.350 V. This significant peak is most likely due to reduction of oxygenated functional groups on the GONs-modified GE surface. This reduction can not be related to reduction of H 2 O molecules to hydrogen because it occurs at greater negative potentials. In the second CV, the reduction current peak decreases dramatically at negative potentials and almost disappears after the second scan. This finding suggests that a significant diminish in surface-oxygenated functional groups at GONs occurs and converts to rGONs irreversibly and rapidly. As a result, the exfoliated GONs can be reduced using electrochemical approach at negative potentials 39 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Accordingly, the number of voltammetric cycles, scan rate, pH, and temperature of the supporting electrolyte were among the characteristics effective in converting graphite to rGONs. This technique was more efficient when performed at middle scan rate (50 mV/s) and multiple voltammetric cycles to provide sufficient time for production of rGONs from graphite in two steps of electrochemical oxidation and reduction. At slightly acidic pH (6.5), the condition for oxidation process and formation of GONs were more favorable. However, it was better to have a slightly higher pH (6.9) during the reduction and conversion of GONs to rGONswhich reduces www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and eliminates the functional groups more easily and quickly. These experiments had the best results at ambient temperature (20 to 24 \u00b0C). Noble metal nanoparticles (NMNPs) are efficiently produced by reducing the equivalent metallic salt in water 41, 42 . Rh-NPs were synthesized using electrochemical reduction. In this procedure, Rh-NPs were grown on the surface under optimum conditions by applying CV technique in potentials between 0.0 and \u2212 800.0 mV for four successive sweeps 43 . As a result, the rGONs-modified GE was adorned with Rh-NPs (Rh-NPs/rGONs/GE). For the synthesis of NMNPs, the rGONs provide numorous nucleating sites. Consequently, different procedures for the synthesis of graphene hybrids with noble metals such as Au, Ag, Rh, Pd, and Pt have been developed and investigated for design of electrochemical biosensors, catalysis, fuel cells, and so on 44 . The 2D structure of nano-sheets of graphene in these hybrid nanocomposites not only provides a perfect framework for anchoring the metal nanostructures, but also improve the electrical conductivity and interfacial electron transport liberated by these adherent NPs, limiting nanoparticle aggregation 45 . Morphology and spectroscopy characterizations. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), EDS Mapping, and Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy were used to analyze the as-prepared nanomaterials. All results indicated that the nanomaterials were successfully synthesized.",

The characteristic peaks of O-H (3391 cm \u22121 ), C=O (1732 cm \u22121 ), C-O (1556 cm \u22121 ), C-OH (1317 cm \u22121 ), and C-O (1162 cm \u22121 ) are thought to be assigned for stretching hydroxyl group in carboxylic acid, carboxyl group, carboxylic acid, and carbonyl group, respectively. The presence of oxygen functional groups in FTIR-ATR of GONs spectra indicates that the flake graphite has been oxidized to GONs. These peaks do not appear in the graphite spectra, showing the existence of a significant number of oxygen functional groups (-COOH and C=O near the sheet edge, -OH and C-O groups in epoxy on the GONs sheet basal planes) added during the oxidation step. There is no noticeable peak after reducing and converting GONs to rGONs, indicating that the rGONs are fully reduced. Carbon-oxygen functional groups such as carboxyl groupsremain in the rGONs structure with faint peaks. Figure 3a ,b shows the FE-SEM images of Rh-NPs with spherical morphology extremely dispersed with nanoscale sizes that cover rGONs on the surface of graphite electrode. The elemental composition of the surface of Rh-NPs/rGONs/GE was also investigated by EDS mapping analysis, showingthat the modified electrode surface is coated with Rh-NPs (Fig. 3c) .

The predicted secondary structure of anti-HER2 aptameric strand shows that double stem-loops and a random sequence are in its primary stem-loop structure anticipated to be bound to the particular place of HER2-ECD. Transducer layer is extremely important for immobilization of the aptamer strand and stabilization of the formed G-quadruplex, affecting the sensitivity and selectivity of the aptasensor. It seems that nanomaterials are ideal platforms for immobilization of anti-HER2 aptamer strands due to their privileged bio-compatibility as well as extremely www.nature.com/scientificreports/ large surface area to volume ratio 51 . The interaction between HER2-ECD and aptameric strand leads to opening the anti-HER2 hairpin duplex and the formation of aptamer/HER2-ECD complex 52 . In this study a remarkable decrease in CV and DPV peak current measurements in aptasensor was seen. This is due to the fact thataptamers are insulating compounds that the phosphate groups in their structures would be ionized into plenty negative charges in aqueous solution that barricade the transfer of electron on the surface of electrode owing to the intense electrostatic repulsion with ferri-/ferro-cyanide ionic redox available in electrochemical probe 53 . The difference of electrochemical current density obtained by changing oncomarker concentration compared with BSA stabilization was usedas the measurement system displayed as \u0394j. Then, the effect of two important parameters i.e., anti-HER2 aptamer concentration and incubation binding time for HER2-ECD oncomarker was explored. First, the MPA/Rh-NPs/rGONs/GEs which have already been activated by EDC/NHS were submerged in different concentrations of anti-HER2 aptamer (5, 15, 30, 50, and 100 nM), dipped in 5% BSA solution, and incubated with 300 ng/mL of HER2-ECD. As clearly exhibited in Fig. 4f , an increase in the concentration of anti-HER2 aptamer up to 50 nM enhances the current density. However, no significant change is observed for aptamer concentration greater than 50 nM since the modified surface of electrode is thoroughly saturated with anti-HER2 aptamer 54 . Accordingly, a concentration of 50 nM anti-HER2 aptamer was selected as the optimal concentration. Second, to gain the best incubation binding time of the HER2-ECD, the aptasensor in concentration of 300 ng/ mL of was incubated for 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min. The intensity of current density (j) raised with increasing the incubation binding time and then stayed almost steady after 40 min incubation because the surface of electrode was saturated. For this reason, the most favorable incubation time was determined to be 40 min (Fig. 4g ). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ to surface of modified GE and immobilize the generated G-quadruplex was critical. Given their high bio-affinity and intrinsic bio-compatibility, rGONs and Rh-NPs could be used as a platform for immobilizing anti-HER2 aptamer strands, followed by HER2-ECD recognition via G-quadruplex formation between aptamer strands and HER2-ECD oncomarker. As a consequence, the aptasensor based on BSA/Apt/MPA/Rh-NPs/rGONs/GE was employed to evaluate each stage of the detection procedure of various oncomarkers.",

For this purpose, HER2-ECD oncomarker was tested at concentrations ranging from 0.010 to 500.0 ng/mL. Then, the interaction results were measured using the DPV technique (Fig. 5a) . As demonstrated in Fig. 5b , by rising the concentration of HER2-ECD, the current density increases. The electrochemical response of the aptasensor towards HER2- The LOD and LOQ calculated using this equation is 0.665 ng/mL and 2.01 ng/ mL, respectively. This aptasensor provides a satisfactory performance compared with the present HER2-ECD biosensors described in the literature ( Table 1 ). The significant stability of the aptasensor can be ascribed to the BSA/MPA/Rh-NPs/rGONs/GE and strong covalent binding of anti-HER2 aptamer to the modified electrode via MPA linker. Therefore, the results demonstrates good performance of aptasensor even at lower HER2-ECD oncomarker concentrations that can be employed to monitor small changes in oncomarker concentration in many forms of cancer during the primary stage of disease. The selectivity of electrochemical aptasensor was also investigated using different interfering agents such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and Human Serum Albumin (HSA). The results show that PSA and CEA have a slight change in current density (Fig. 5c) whereas the HER2-ECD oncomarker has a significant change. Four electrodes were made to evaluate reproducibility (Fig. 5d) . These findings show that the aptasensor is exceedingly selective and stable for direct detection of the HER2-ECD oncomarker. The long-term stability is an important parameter in clinical applications. As shown in Fig. 5e , the signal changes after 14 days are minimal and this indicates that the aptasensor has maintained its detection performance and stability compared with the first day with relative standard deviation (RSD) 4.3%. Therefore, the developed aptasensor has a high level of reliability and efficiency.",

The collaborative effect of rGONs and Rh-NPs can boost electrochemical signal and sensitivity by increasing conductivity and specific surface area. Furtheremore, the stability of the formed G-quadruplex increased through strong covalent interactions between the aptameric strand and the oncomarker. Accordingly, a low value of LOD was obtained equal to 0.667 ng/mL. The results of this study confirmed the successful performance of the constructed aptasensor. This promising electrochemical aptasensor could be feasibly applied as a platform for diagnosis and monitoring of a wide variety of oncomarkers in different cancers.",

In order to prepare the electrode used in aptasensor, the Rh-NPs/rGONs modified GE was suspended in 20 mM MPA solution dissolved in ethanol/water (3:1 V/V) at pH 6.8 under shaking (75 rpm) at room temperature for 18 h. Thus, MPA/Rh-NPs/rGONs/GE was rinsed with double-distilled water. The optimal concentration of the MPA was used as a linker to bind modified electrode to the bio-recognition agent (anti-HER2 aptamer). The carboxyl-functionalized MPA can strengthen the binding of amino-functionalized strands of aptamer as well as enhance electrochemical activity of the aptasensor 66 . The MPA/Rh-NPs/rGONs/GE was incubated in PBS containing 0.05 M NHS and 0.20 M EDC for 1 h at 8 \u00b0C in order to activate its surface. For covalent conjugation of activated surface with amine group (-NH2) of functionalized anti-HER2 aptamer, the modified electrode was dipped in PBS buffer containing 50 nM anti-HER2 aptamer at room temperature for 1 h, for amide bond formation. Furthermore, Apt/MPA/Rh-NPs/rGONs/GE was immersed in BSA solution with concentration of 5% at the temperature of 37 \u00baC under 5% CO 2 atmosphere ",
