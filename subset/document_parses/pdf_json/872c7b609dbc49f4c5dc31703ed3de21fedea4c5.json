Furthermore, even those approved antibodies 42 with neutralizing activity against Omicron are reportedly ineffective against the subset of 43 Omicron variants that contain a R346K substitution, demonstrating the continued need for 44 discovery and characterization of candidate therapeutic antibodies with the breadth and 45 potency of neutralizing activity required to treat newly diagnosed COVID-19 linked to recently 46 emerged variants of concern. Following a campaign of antibody discovery based on the 47 vaccination of Harbour H2L2 mice with defined SARS-CoV-2 spike domains, we have 48 characterized the activity of a large collection of Spike-binding antibodies and identified a 49 lead neutralizing human IgG1 LALA antibody, STI-9167. STI-9167 has potent, broad-spectrum 50 neutralizing activity against the current SARS-COV-2 variants of concern and retained activity 51 against the Omicron and Omicron + R346K variants in both pseudotype and live virus 52 neutralization assays. Furthermore, STI-9167 nAb administered intranasally or intravenously 53 provided protection against weight loss and reduced virus lung titers to levels below the limit 54 of quantitation in Omicron-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. With this established activity 55 profile, a cGMP cell line has been developed and used to produce cGMP drug product 56 intended for use in human clinical trials.",

            "text": "The severe acute respiratory disease syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has 60 continued to significantly impact the health and lives of people around the globe 1 . To date, 61 public health agencies have sought to combat infections leading to COVID-19 by relying on 62 quarantine, social distancing, vaccination, and antiviral countermeasure strategies 2,3 . Despite 63 these efforts, the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of several variants 64 of concern (VOCs) that have risen in prevalence worldwide 2-7 . 65 Each VOC encodes multiple changes in the amino acid sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike that 66 can impact the neutralizing properties of manufactured SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies 67 (nAbs) as well as nAbs elicited following vaccination or during the course of natural infection. 68 Specifically, the Omicron VOC (B.1.1.529) live virus, when profiled in vitro using Vero cells 69 expressing human ACE2 and human TMPRSS2 for susceptibility to nAbs currently authorized or 70 approved for clinical use (AFCU nAbs), has been shown to be resistant to the neutralizing 71 activities of REGN10987 (imdevimab), REGN10933 (casirivimab), LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab), LY-72 CoV016 (etesevimab), and CT-P59 (regdanvimab), at nAb concentrations \u2264 10 \u00b5g/mL (IC50), and 73 remained susceptible to nAbs COV2-2130 (cilgavimab) and COV2-2196 (tixagevimab) tested as 74 single nAb therapies or in combination (IC50 of 43, 126, and 181 ng/mL, respectively) 8-13 . In live 75 virus neutralization assays utilizing Vero cells overexpressing human TMPRSS2, S309 76 (sotrovimab) registered an IC50 of 373 ng/mL, consistent with previously published activity in 77 Omicron pseudovirus assays for this antibody. 78 A subset (approximately 23% of Omicron sequences in GISAID recorded on outbreak.info) of 79 Omicron viruses encode an additional mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike at position R346K in 80 the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the protein 14-16 . The R346K mutation was previously 81 identified among the defining mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Mu VOC 7 . Using Omicron + R346K 82 pseudoviruses, neutralization potency was reported as substantially reduced for all tested AFCU 83 nAbs, including COV2-2130, COV2-2196, and S309 5,17-20 . Current antibodies in development, 84 including bebtelovimab and BRII-198 (romlusevimab), maintain activity in Omicron pseudotype 85 neutralization assays 12,21 . BRII-198 displays substantially reduced neutralizing activity in assays 86 using Omicron + R346K pseudoviruses while testing of bebtelovimab against the Omicron + 87 R346K variant has not yet been reported 12,21 . As such, there is a continued need for discovery 88 and development of nAbs that can provide potent immune protection against COVID-19 caused 89 by pandemic VOCs presently infecting the global population. 90 In the early COVID-19 disease setting, intravenous (IV) administration of nAbs is an effective 91 means of lessening progression and overall severity of disease 18 Figure 1B) . We observed that the serum from Mouse 1, 3, and 4 demonstrated a concentration 112 dependent and specific binding to 293ExpiF cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike. Given that 113 Mouse 3 and Mouse 4 had the highest titer humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 spike, the 114 spleens from these animals were used to generate hybridoma clones 26 . The hybridoma clones 115 (1,824 clones from Mouse 3 and 1,440 clones from Mouse 4) were screened for binding to 116 293ExpiF cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike by flow cytometry and RBD-spike (Wuhan) ( Figure   117 1). A representative heat map for Mouse 4 fusion was generated to summarize the mean 118 fluorescence intensity (MFI) for each hybridoma clone ( Figure 1C ). In parallel, hybridoma clones 119 were subjected to an RBD ELISA validating the clones that bound to SARS-CoV-2 spike. We 120 identified 188 clones with a >5-fold MFI over untransfected cells and classified these as 121 candidate SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies. The supernatants from these clones were then 122 evaluated in a high-throughput neutralization assay using the replication competent VsV 123 reporter virus that utilizes SARS-CoV-2 spike (VsV CoV2-spike ) as its envelope protein and 124 expressing GFP as readout for infection 27 (Figure 1C the Mouse 3 fusion, 340 clones were found to bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike and 90 clones were 131 found to have neutralization activity against VsV CoV2-spike . The selected neutralizing clones with 132 IC50 values <125pM were then examined for IgG isotypes and expanded for further analysis. 133 Sequencing of the heavy chain from each hybridoma clone revealed diverse CDR3 lengths 134 ranging from 10-20 aa in length ( Figure 1D ). Clones that were identical copies of each other 135 were consolidated to a single candidate. 136 To identify the most effective human anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike neutralizing antibodies, we 137 performed a VsV CoV2-spike neutralization assay ( Figure 1D) To determine the effects of variant specific spike S1 domain mutations within and outside the 155 RBD region of S1 on antibody binding, the affinity of STI-9167 and EUA-approved SARS-CoV-2 156 nAbs sotrovimab, cilgavimab, and tixagevimab were determined for monomeric WA-1 spike S1 157 subunit binding as well as VOC-derived S1 domains using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Of 158 note, the kD of STI-9167 was measured as 6.20 nM for the WA-1 isolate, 4.45 nM for the Delta 159 variant, and 22.6 nM for the Omicron variant. Binding kinetics for the Omicron variant were 160 compared between STI-9167, sotrovimab, cilgavimab, and tixagevimab. (Figure 2A , Table 1A 161 and Supplemental Figure 4) . STI-9167 and cilgavimab had a similar association rate and 162 sotrovimab was approximately 5-fold slower. The dissociation rate was slowest with sotrovimab 163 by a factor of approximately 10-fold as compared to STI-9167, and STI-9167 dissociated at an 164 approximately 2-fold slower rate than cilgavimab. Tixagevimab binding to Omicron S1 domain 165 monomer was insufficient to allow for quantitation. 166 In an effort to assess nAb binding to spike proteins in a native conformation, STI-9167 was Figure 5 ). Of note, half-maximal binding of STI-9167 to the Omicron + R346K 176 spike (EC50=0.023 \u00b5g/mL) was equivalent to that measured for Omicron, suggesting that the 177 epitope recognized by STI-9167 is preserved in the context of Omicron + R346K as compared to 178 epitopes engaged by cilgavimab, which displayed reductions in Omicron + R346K spike binding 179 of over 60-fold as compared to EC50 values in assays targeting Omicron spike. Based on the 180 spike S1 and full-length spike protein binding data, STI-9167 was further profiled to determine 181 the potency of virus neutralization and the breadth of neutralizing protection this antibody 182 provided against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in vitro. 183 Virus pseudotypes were used to determine the neutralization potency (IC50) of STI-9167 against 184 an index virus generated with a spike protein that carries a single D614G (VSV D614G-spike ) 185 mutation as compared to the WA-1 spike protein 35 . To approximate conditions found in the 186 setting of human SARS-CoV-2 infection, pseudovirus assays were carried out using HEK293 cells 187 which overexpressed human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins. The average IC50 value for STI-9167 188 in assays using the VSV D614G-spike pseudovirus was 3.6 ng/mL ( Table 1C) . The STI-9167 189 neutralization potency for VSV Delta-spike (IC50=5.4 ng/mL), VSV Omicron-spike (IC50=14.8 ng/mL), and 190 VSV Omicron+R346K-spike (IC50=23.9 ng/mL) pseudotypes was maintained to within 7-fold of that 191 measured in assays with the VSV D614G-spike pseudotype ( Figure 2C) . Furthermore, STI-9167 192 neutralization potency was maintained to the same degree against the full catalog of VOC-193 based pseudovirus tested, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta Plus, Epsilon, Zeta, Iota, Kappa, 194 Lambda, and Mu VOCs (Supplemental Data Figure 1 ). The concentration of nAbs required to 195 achieve half-maximal and eighty-percent-maximal levels of neutralization potency for VOC 196 pseudotypes as well as for the VSV D614G-spike pseudotype are detailed in Table 1C . The pool of antibodies we identified following vaccination of mice with an SARS-CoV-2 RBD 295 protein based on the Wuhan spike protein sequence includes a candidate with potent 296 neutralizing activity against many SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged in the Omicron: A67V, del69-70, T95I, G142D, del143-145, N211D, del212, G339D,   506   S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, for Spike S1 binding domain from the following isolates and VOCs: USA/WA-1/2020(WA-1) 666 isolate, Delta, and Omicron.

Neutralizing activity was determined following 199 infection with WA-1 strain or Omicron variant and compared to EUA approved antibodies200    (Table 1Dand Supplemental Figure 3). In keeping with the results from pseudovirus assays, we 201 observed that STI-9167 neutralized all isolates tested including the Delta variant and Omicron 202 variant at half-maximal concentrations within 9-fold of those measured against live WA-1 virus, 203 with an IC50 of 54.29 ng/ml against live Omicron variant virus (Figure 2D). Neutralization 204 potency for Omicron virus in experiments using Vero target cells was 582.. These studies illustrate the potential effects of delivery route on the timing of 210 antibody exposure in the lung tissue and sera of treated mice. Following IV treatment at a dose 211 level of 0.5 mg/kg, STI-9167 was detected in the serum, spleen, lungs, small intestine, and large 212 intestine of most animals. Detected levels in the serum following IV dosing at the 0.5 mg/kg 213 dose averaged 6.2 \u00b5g/mL, while STI-9167 was undetected in lung lavage material at each of the 214 IV doses tested, (Figure 3A, upper left panel). Upon processing of lung tissue, antibody was 215 detected at a mean concentration of 0.4 ng/mg of tissue in the 0.5 mg/kg IV dose group. Lower 216 IV doses of STI-9167 did not lead to a statistically significant difference in antibody detected in 217 lung tissue as compared to untreated animals. Antibody levels in the spleen reached an average 218 concentration of 0.2 ng/mg of tissue within 24 hours of IV dosing at 0.5 mg/kg. Similarly, 219 antibody was detectable in a majority of both the small and large intestines only at the highest 220 dose level, with average concentrations of 0.14 and 0.07 ng/mg of tissue, respectively (Figure 221 3A, upper right panel). 222 Following intranasal (IN) administration of STI-9167, the concentration of antibody in the serum 223 at 24 hours reached an average value of 0.054 \u00b5g/mL in the 0.5 mg/kg dose group. As 224 compared to IV treated animals at the 0.5 mg/kg dose, STI-9167 administered IN resulted in a 225 114-fold lower concentration of antibody in serum at the 24-hour timepoint. In contrast to the 226 observed reductions in IN serum nAb levels vs. those following IV nAb administration, STI-9167 227 concentrations in lung lavage samples following IN dosing reached average concentrations of 228 0.18 \u00b5g/mL in the 0.5 mg/kg group, a 9-fold increase over lung lavage nAb levels observed 229 following IV delivery of the 0.5 mg/kg dose, confirming that lung lavage materials can more 230 efficiently collect drugs delivered through the airway than those delivered IV. In lung tissue 231 samples 24 hours following the 0.5 mg/kg IN dose, STI-9167 was detected at an average 232 concentration of 0.173 ng/mg of tissue, similar to those levels recorded in IV-treated animals at 233 the same dose level. STI-9167 levels in spleen, small and large intestine at all IN dose levels 234 tested did not rise to concentrations above background (Figure 3B). 235 Overall, IN delivery of STI-9167 led to lower serum concentrations, increased lung lavage 236 concentrations, and similar tissue concentrations in the spleen, lungs, small intestine, and large 237 intestine when compared to IV delivery. This suggests that IN administration serves to increase 238 the amount of antibody in the pulmonary lavage material, potentially allowing for more 239 efficient neutralization of respiratory virus particles present in the extravascular spaces along 240 the respiratory tract during the initial stages of infection. STI-9167 pharmacokinetic parameters following intranasal dosing, antibody 243 levels in CD-1 mouse lung tissue lysates and serum were quantified at designated timepoints 244 spanning a total of 336 h using a human antibody detection ELISA assay. In this assay the 245 background concentration was on average 16.8 ng/mL based on measurements obtained using 246 pre-dose samples. Following IN administration of STI-9167, the antibody concentration was 247 quantifiable for most of the animals at the 336 h timepoint in both the lungs and serum (Figure 248 3C). The Cmax value of STI-9167 in the lungs was measured at 1.5 hours (Tmax) post-249 administration at a value of 43 \u00b5g/mL. In the lungs following IN administration, STI-9167 250 exhibited an apparent terminal half-life (T1/2) of 26.6 h. Kinetics of STI-9167 exposure in the 251 lungs following IN administration contrasted with the slower rate of antibody accumulation in 252 the serum of treated mice (Figure 3C). Antibody was first detected in the serum at 1.5 hours 253 post-administration and the Cmax of 456 ng/mL was reached at the 168 h timepoint (Tmax), 254 although consideration of the standard deviations in values measured among animals on or 255 between the 72h and 168h timepoints suggests that the Tmax may have occurred as early as 72 256 hours post-administration. Antibody levels remained relatively constant in serum over the 257 period spanning 24 -336 h, which is in keeping with the calculated STI-9167 serum half-life 258 observed following IV STI-9167 administration in CD-1 mice (data not shown). The total 259 systemic antibody exposure (AUClast) was greater than 5-fold higher in the lungs than in the 260 serum of IN-treated mice (AUClast were 594,705 and 105,149 h*ng/mL respectively). 261 Treatment using IV or IN administered STI-9167 in the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model CoV-2 pathogenesis in the K18-ACE2 transgenic model of COVID-19 respiratory disease 264 provides a tractable means of assessing nAb activity in a preclinical model of respiratory disease 265 36-38 . The clinical signs and histological markers of pathogenesis in this model include weight 266 loss over the first four to five days post-infection and the presence of microscopic lesions in the 267 infected lungs 37-40 . Peak virus lung titers are typically detected by day 5 post-infection, but the 268 timing and peak amplitude of replication in the lungs can vary depending on the specific VOC 269 used to challenge the mice 39 . The breadth of protection provided by STI-9167 was established 270 by treating mice following virus challenge with 1 x 10 5 half-maximal tissue culture infectious 271 dose (TCID50) of the WA-1 strain, the Delta variant, or the Omicron variant. Animals treated 272 with isotype control antibody lost weight in each experiment, with the 4B, 4E) as compared to average Day 0 weights in each group. To determine the 275 effects of the route of administration on the degree of protection conferred by treatment with 276 STI-9167 at doses ranging from 5 to 20 mg/kg, antibody was administered by either intravenous 277 injection (Figure 4A) or intranasal instillation (Figure 4D). At a dose level of 5 mg/kg, 278 administration of STI-9167 to K18-hACE2 mice by either the IV or IN route provided protection 279 against weight loss caused by WA-1 strain, Delta variant, and Omicron variant (Figure 4B, 4E). 280 Virus replication in the lungs, quantified on day 4 post-infection, was approximately 2./g on average in isotype control-treated mice infected with WA-1, 282 Delta variant, or Omicron variant, respectively. Following infection by each of the SARS-CoV-2 283 challenge viruses, lung virus titers in mice treated with STI-9167 were reduced to levels below 284 the limit of quantification, independent of the nAb dosing route or the nAb dose level antibody discovery platforms that do not require material derived from infected 288 individuals, such as the vaccination strategy employed here or the screening of established 289 antibody libraries, can provide a preemptive means of addressing the challenges presented by 290 pandemic threat pathogens 14,41 . The production of human antibodies in transgenic animals has 291 several advantages including in vivo affinity maturation, increased diversity, and clonal selection 292 for antibody optimization 42 . Thus, the generation of antibodies to specific protein domains 293 allows for the development of highly reactive and effective antibody therapeutics.294",

            "text": "297past two years of the pandemic. Our antibody binding studies and virus neutralization assays298    have provided clear evidence of the broad and potent neutralizing activity of STI-9167 toward299    those VOCs identified in the early period of the pandemic as well as those VOCs currently300    impacting public health, including Delta and Omicron. Following demonstration of neutralizing 301 activity against the parental Omicron variant, we have extended our activity profiling studies to302    include assessment of the Omicron + R346K subvariant, a virus that is currently represented in a303    reported 23% of sequences submitted to GISAID[14][15][16] . The frequency of Omicron virus304    sequences containing the R346K substitution has risen steadily since the first reports in305    November of 2021 describing detection of the Omicron variant[43][44][45] . Using virus pseudotypes,306    we have demonstrated durable STI-9167 activity against the Omicron +R346K subvariant. In 307 addition, we described neutralizing activity against the Mu variant, which also encodes the 308 R346K spike substitution 7 . The Omicron and Mu variants constitute divergent variants of SARS-309    CoV-2, and it appears that the R346K substitution is not sufficient in either of these contexts to310    provide a means of resistance to the neutralizing effects of STI-9167.311 Our studies of nAb STI-2020 previously demonstrated the protective efficacy of IN-administered 312 antibodies in the context of SARS-CoV-2 preclinical models of pathogenesis 46 . Previous work in 313 preclinical models of respiratory virus pathogenesis support the use of IN-administered IgG and 314 IgA mAbs in prophylactic and therapeutic dosing regimens 24,47-50 . In the current report, we 315 described the protective effects of STI-9167 delivered by either the IN or the IV route to animals 316 infected with WA-1 strain, Delta, or Omicron variants. As evidenced in recently reported 317 preclinical studies of Omicron pathogenesis as well as our experiments, the severity of clinical 318 signs and the amount of virus replication in the lungs following Omicron infection was reduced 319 in comparison to that following infection with the WA-1 strain or the Delta variant 51-53 . 320 Independent of the challenge virus used, at a dose level of 5 mg/kg, IN treatment with STI-9167 321 in K18 ACE2 transgenic mice 12 hours following infection provided protection against the 322 weight loss observed in control animals and also reduced virus lung titers to below the level of 323 quantitation. Phase 1 clinical studies with STI-2099 (plutavimab) have demonstrated the safety 324 of nAb delivered as formulated liquid drops to the upper airways. A Phase 2 study has 325 completed enrollment in the US, and additional Phase 2 studies are ongoing in Mexico and the 326 United Kingdom. Based on the favorable in vivo potency and physicochemical profile of STI-327 9167, cGMP drug product has been prepared in preparation for similar anticipated clinical 328 studies of STI-9167 administered IV or as intranasal drops (STI-9199human antibodies, Harbour H2L2\u00ae human antibody transgenic mice (Harbour 332 BioMed, Cambridge, MA) were utilized under a collaboration between the Icahn School of 333 Medicine at Mount Sinai and Harbour BioMed. The H2L2 transgenic mouse is a chimeric 334 transgenic mouse containing the human variable gene segment loci of the heavy and kappa 335 antibody chains along with the rat heavy and kappa constant gene segment loci, producing a 336 mouse with normal B cell homeostasis and effector functions, while also producing antibodies 337 that represent the typical diversity observed in human antibody immunity 54 . Immunizations 338 were done on eight-to twelve-week-old H2L2 mice interperitoneally with 50-100 \u00b5g of a 339 recombinant SARS-CoV2 Spike RBD319-591-Fc fusion protein generated from sequence from the 340 original Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate (GenBank Accession# MN908947) and 341 cloned in-frame into pcDNA vectors containing human IgG1 and mouse IgG2a Fc tags (GenScript 342 USA Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Each mouse received a prime followed by 2 boosts, and blood was 343 collected from the submandibular vein two weeks after each boost to monitor titer of sera 344 antibodies. Following sera binding and neutralization analysis, two mice were selected for 345 hybridoma fusion and received two final boosts consisting of 50-100 \u00b5g of the RBD protein at -346 5 and -2 days before being euthanized by IACUC approved methods with spleens harvested and 347 a final bleeding collected for sera analysis (\"fusion sera\"). The spleens were processed to single 348 cell suspension and hybridomas were generated using the standard protocol. Briefly, individual 349 B cell clones were grown on soft agar and selected for screening using a robotic ClonaCell Easy 350 Pick instrument (Hamilton/Stem Cell Technology). Individual clones were expanded, and the 351 supernatants were used to screen for binding, neutralization and ACE2 competition assays. All 352 animal studies were approved by the Icahn School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and 353 Use Committee (IACUC). 354 Hybridoma Screening: Expi293F cells were transiently transfected to express SARS-CoV-2 spike 355 (Wuhan) using Lipofectamine 3000 (L3000001, Thermo Fisher) and then incubated with 356 supernatant from the hybridoma cell lines from each fusion. Binding was detected using an 357 anti-rat IgG-APC detection antibody and samples were run on a high-throughput flow 358 cytometer (Intellicyte High Throughput Flow Cytometer [Intellicyte Corp., Albuquerque, NM]. 359 Samples were compared to controls of fusion sera, unimmunized \"normal\" mouse sera, and an 360 in-house generated anti-SARS1&2 Spike mouse monoclonal 2B3E5 at 1 \u00b5g/mL. Cells with a high 361 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were identified using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.) and 362 graphed using GraphPad Prism to create a heat map based on mean fluorescence intensity. 363 ELISA: Immulon 4 HBX high binding clear flat bottom 96 well plates (ThermoFisher) were coated 364 with SARS-CoV2 Spike RBD319-591-Fc fusion at 5 \u00b5g/ml in 1xPBS overnight at 4 o C followed by 365 washing. Washing with 1xPBS was done between each step in triplicate using a Biotek ELX405 366 MultiPlate Washer (Biotek, Winooski, VT). Plates were blocked for two hours in blocking 367 solution (1xPBS, 0.5% BSA). Supernatants from the hybridomas were then added and allowed 368 to incubate for one hour at room temperature followed by the addition of goat anti-rat IgG 369 (heavy chain specific)-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a 1:5,000 dilution in blocking solution 370 for one hour. ABTS substrate solution (ThermoFisher) was added and allowed to incubate for 5-371 10 minutes at room temperature, protected from light. Absorbance at 450nm was measured 372 using a Biotek Synergy HT Microplate Reader. Fusion sera, normal mouse sera, and 2B3E5 mAb 373 (0.5-1 \u00b5g/ml) were used as controls. 374 Neutralization: Prior to neutralization, hybridoma supernatants grown in SFM (sera free 375 hybridoma media) (Invitrogen) were quantitated using an Octet Red96 by diluting supernatants 376 1:5 and 1:10 in sera free media and measured for binding against the Anti-Murine IgG 377 Quantitation (AMQ) Biosensors (with cross reactivity to rat IgG Fc) on an Octet Red 96 BLI 378 Instrument (SartoriusAG, Goettingen, Germany). Results were compared to in-lab derived 379 purified rat IgG standards diluted in SFM in the range of 0.5-50 \u00b5g/ml. For neutralization, VsV-380 SARS-spike GFP-expressing reporter virus was pre-incubated with mouse sera (were resuspended in cold FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry (Intellicyte 385 Corp., Albuquerque, NM) for GFP fluorescence intensity. Cells with a high MFI were identified 386 using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.) and graphed using GraphPad Prism to create a the human variable heavy and kappa chains were obtained by using SMARTer 5' 390 RACE technology (Takara Bio USA) adapted for antibodies to amplify the variable genes from 391 heavy and kappa chains for each hybridoma. Briefly, RNA was extracted from each hybridoma 392 using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), followed by first stand cDNA synthesis 393 using constant gene specific 3' primers based on the specific isotype of the hybridoma and 394 incubation with the SMARTer II A Oligonucleotide and SMARTscribe reverse transcriptase. 395 Amplifying PCR of the first stand cDNA product was then performed using SeqAmp DNA 396 Polymerase (Takara) with a nested 3' primer to the constant genes and a 5' universal primer 397 based on universal primer sites added to the 5' end during cDNA generation. Purified PCR 398 product was then submitted for Sanger sequencing using 3' constant gene primers (GeneWiz, 399 South Plainfield, NJ). Sequence results were blasted against the IMGT human databank of 400 germline genes using V-Quest (http://imgt.org) and analyzed for clonality based on 401 CDR3/junction identity and V(D)J usage. Unique clones were chosen from each clonal family, 402 and DNA was synthesized and cloned in-framed into pcDNA-based vectors containing following standard protocols. Briefly, heavy chain and light chain variable domain 408 genes were designed by coding the amino acid sequences of an antibody using codon table of 409 Cricetulus griseus for CHO (Chinese hamster ovarian) cells as expression host. The heavy chain 410 and light chain variable domain gene fragments with flanking sequences for infusion cloning 411 were synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA technologies, San Diego), and cloned into a 412 mammalian expression vector with built-in IgG1 constant domain and/or light chain constant 413 domain sequences. The expression vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. CHO-S cells in 414 exponential phase at a cell density of 10 6 cells/ml with viability of \u2265 93%, were co-transfected 415 with both heavy and light chain expression plasmids of the target antibody. The transfection 416 complex was formed between DNA and PEI (polyethylenimine). Each antibody was harvested 417 by centrifuging the culture to pellet and remove the cells 10-14 days after the transfection. The 418 supernatant was processed with a protein A column, and the Protein A bound antibody was 419 eluded with low pH glycine buffer.
