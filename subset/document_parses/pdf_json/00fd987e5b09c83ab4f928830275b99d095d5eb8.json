            "text": "For the last few years, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been increasing rapidly. Numerous machine learning algorithms have been developed to identify different diseases, e.g., leukemia. Leukemia is a white blood cells-(WBC-) related illness affecting the bone marrow and/or blood. A quick, safe, and accurate early-stage diagnosis of leukemia plays a key role in curing and saving patients' lives. Based on developments, leukemia consists of two primary forms, i.e., acute and chronic leukemia. Each form can be subcategorized as myeloid and lymphoid. ere are, therefore, four leukemia subtypes. Various approaches have been developed to identify leukemia with respect to its subtypes. However, in terms of effectiveness, learning process, and performance, these methods require improvements. is study provides an Internet of Medical ings-(IoMT-) based framework to enhance and provide a quick and safe identification of leukemia. In the proposed IoMT system, with the help of cloud computing, clinical gadgets are linked to network resources. e system allows real-time coordination for testing, diagnosis, and treatment of leukemia among patients and healthcare professionals, which may save both time and efforts of patients and clinicians. Moreover, the presented framework is also helpful for resolving the problems of patients with critical condition in pandemics such as COVID-19. e methods used for the identification of leukemia subtypes in the suggested framework are Dense Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet-121) and Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-34). Two publicly available datasets for leukemia, i.e., ALL-IDB and ASH image bank, are used in this study. e results demonstrated that the suggested models supersede the other well-known machine learning algorithms used for healthy-versus-leukemia-subtypes identification.",

Platelets help to clot and control bleeding. RBC known as erythrocytes are responsible for the transfer of oxygen through lungs to the body tissues. While WBC, also known as leukocytes, are responsible for fighting against diseases and infections. Leukemia refers to the production of large numbers of immature WBC. It is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood while destroying the immune system of a human body. Two main categories of leukemia based on progress are acute and chronic leukemia. Infected WBC grow rapidly in acute leukemia and do not perform in a normal way, whereas in chronic leukemia, WBC can act normally and grow less quickly. However, this can be severe since it may not be distinguished easily from the normal WBC. In addition, two types of acute and chronic leukemia are lymphoid and myeloid leukemia based on the size and shape of WBC, where both of them can be further divided into two subtypes each, i.e., acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).",

In [32] , the proposed model detected ALL using KNN and Naive Bayes Classifier with 92.8% accuracy. e classifier is tested on 60 sample images. In [33] , a novel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on ABC-BPNN scheme is suggested for the classification of leukemia cells and attained 98.72% average accuracy with reduction in the computation time. In [34] , the ALL is identified. Firstly, leukemia images are segmented by BSA-based clustering. Secondly, Jaya technique is applied in integration with some standard classification methods such as Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine (SVM), ensemble random under-sampling boost, and decision tree. However, Jaya with SVM and Jaya with decision tree gave better accuracy. e Linear Discriminant Analysis-(LDA-) based PCA model for diagnosing leukemia by utilizing Discrete Orthogonal Stockwell Transform (DOST) method to extract the features of microscopic images is presented in [35] . In [36] , for feature extraction, three pre-trained CNN architectures are applied. However, for the leukemia classification on the hybrid database, SVM without segmentation is used. In [37] , for the identification of acute leukemia from microscopic images initially to extract features, the images were segmented by using unsharp masking sub-imaging bounding box and L \u00d7 a \u00d7 b color Fuzzy C-Means Clustering after applying the Nearest Neighbor. en, to identify ALL, the extracted features were passed to SVM, which attained 95% accuracy. In [38] , a robust feature extraction and selection technique for the identification of lymphocytes versus ALL is proposed. e classification is done by KNN using Euclidean Distance with 92.5% accuracy.

Here, a better assortment of microscopic blood cell images is provided by the retrieved datasets, but both datasets contain samples of limited numbers of leukemia subtypes.

            "text": "To show their efficiency, a comparison of the proposed models is done with previous approaches, i.e., GA with SVM [49] and CNN [39] . GA with SVM performs the identification of ALL, AML, and healthy samples, while CNN performs the leukemia subtype identification. Nevertheless, it is elucidated in Figure 12 that the utilized models, i.e., ResNet-34 and DenseNet-121, outperform the existing schemes, such as GA with SVM and CNN. It is exhibited from Figure 12 that GA with SVM has 99.50%, CNN has 81.74%, ResNet-34 has 99.56%, and DenseNet-121 has 99.91% accuracy, respectively. us, DenseNet-121 supersedes the other approaches. Previously, numerous machine learning techniques were using the same datasets, i.e., ALL-IDB and ASH image bank, for the detection of leukemia and its subtypes. In those studies, the feature extraction and classification methods were used, which require time and effort. However, the proposed models do not need handcrafted feature set for making predictions and save time and efforts. A thorough comparison of the proposed models with the previous approaches with respect to accuracy is presented in Table 5 . It is depicted from Table 5 Figure 6 : General architecture of DenseNet-121 (adapted from [29] ). proposed models outperform the previous approaches with average accuracy of 99.56% and 99.91% for ResNet-34 and DenseNet-121, respectively.",

In the proposed framework, an IoT-enabled microscope uploads the blood smear images to the leukemia cloud. e leukemia is diagnosed by using the ResNet-34 or DenseNet-121 models. It is observed that the diagnosing power of ResNet-34 and DenseNet-121 supersedes all the previous approaches. By using data augmentation techniques, ResNet-34 and DenseNet-121 both process large numbers of image patterns. After diagnosis, the result is sent to the doctor's computer where s/he provides medical care on the basis of test report through the IoMT framework. Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates the patients in pandemics such as COVID- 19. In the future, the dataset can be extended by adding new samples of blood images and utilizing new augmentation techniques to achieve better performances. Furthermore, the proposed IoMT-based framework can be equipped with the functionality of diagnosing the subcategories of each leukemia type. Moreover, the proposed models can also be used to find other abnormalities in the blood.",
