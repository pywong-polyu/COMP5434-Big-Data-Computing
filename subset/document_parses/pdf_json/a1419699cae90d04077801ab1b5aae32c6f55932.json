When this dose was administered every 4 h/six times per day, the plasma concentration of Miglustat stabilized around 10 \u00b5M [36] . When 200 mg Miglustat was administered every 8 h/three times a day, the plasma concentration could be also higher than 10 \u00b5M in 24 h. However, increased dosage could lead to well-described adverse reactions that include tremors, diarrhoea, numbness, and thrombocytopenia. The concentration of Miglustat at the site of SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs is not known.",

Miglustat interferes with this process resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and a defect in secretion. Consistently, the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-1 was shown to bind Calnexin, and disruption of this function caused a decrease of virus infectivity [32] .",

The work of Clarke et al. assessed the activity of a derivative of Miglustat, UV-4, and of Celgosivir on SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and demonstrated inhibitory activity in the micromolar range, in agreement with our work [40] . These different approaches concur in demonstrating that inhibitors of glucosidases are active in infectious assays and in in vitro assays probing Spike and ACE2 proteins. How the inhibitors are actually inhibiting the virus appears to be unrelated to binding to the receptor and, instead, to a post-binding effect.",

Alternative routes of administration, such as by aerosol, could also be envisaged for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Inhibitors of glycosidases represent a promising class of broad-range antivirals that could represent a first line option for emerging viral infections.",
