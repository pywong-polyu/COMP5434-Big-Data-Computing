Although it is less severe than other previously described coronaviruses infecting humans, such as SARS or MERS coronaviruses, it has a significantly higher transmission capacity. This elevated transmission compelled the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global health emergency on 31 January 2020 and, subsequently, a pandemic situation on 11 March 2020 [2] . Until the date of writing this manuscript, the COVID-19 pandemic had already affected over 114 million people worldwide and caused over 2.5 million deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html; accessed on 2 March 2021).",

We demonstrate our RT-LAMP assay proper operation on clinical samples by using a portable real-time device and in conventional colorimetric trials easily visualized with the naked eye. Furthermore, we developed a new simple one-step desiccation procedure to stabilize the RT-LAMP reagents in a single tube for potentially ready-to-use COVID-19 diagnosis. The Dry-RT-LAMP methodology does not require complex instrumentation and it is much faster to perform (30 min) than other available alternatives such as lyophilization. The Dry-RT-LAMP format could be very useful for easy testing in situations of high diagnostic demand and in low-resources settings thus contributing to rapid diagnosis for COVID-19.",

            "text": "In this work, five regions from SARS-CoV-2 viral genome were studied, including the open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b, and genes S, E, and N. For this, eight sequencespecific RT-LAMP primer sets were designed and screened for the detection of the novel coronavirus. Our RT-LAMP reaction was optimized using a well-established RNA-positive control from a COVID-19 patient and primer sets targeting ORF1ab, gene E, and gene N were finally selected. For most RT-LAMP assays detecting SARS-CoV-2, the genes ORF1ab and N have been used as the principal targets for amplification, to ensure specific and sensitive detection [33] . In fact, in our trials, we obtained the best performance in detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA targeting these two genes, not only in amplification times, but also in analytical sensitivity. First, we established the proper operation of the primer sets designed, specificity, and sensitivity in the amplification of the selected SARS-CoV-2 RNA target sequences. In set-up trials, the RT-LAMP reactions using Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase did not work well and, frequently, non-specific amplification was observed. It has been previously described several differences in efficiency of Bst 3.0 compared to Bst 2.0 WS depending on time and temperature for amplification [38] . As Bst 3.0 has an optimal temperature range for amplification between 68-70 \u2022 C, it is possible that when testing different temperatures in the optimization of RT-LAMP, a suboptimal annealing of our primer sets occurred, thus probably increasing the irregular and non-specific amplification. In addition, it has been recently described a significantly increased tendency of Bst 3.0 to yield false-positive results in comparison to Bst 2.0. These unspecific products were characterized by a higher Tm than specific products which also occurred in our Bst 3.0 reactions. These false positives have been associated with the interaction of multiple primers and the template switching and terminal transferase activities of the polymerase, combined with a lack of 3 \u21925 exonuclease activity [39] . In this sense, although some previously reported RT-LAMP tests for diagnosis of COVID-19 appear to have worked well using Bst 3.0 [40, 41] , different primers sequences targeting gene N were used and then annealing could be probably more effective or be less constrained by primer interaction. Nevertheless, most studies use a combination of a Bst 2.0 WS DNA polymerase and RTx WS in one-step reaction to amplify gene ORF1ab or gene N [33] . In our trials, optimization of RT-LAMP was finally carried out using the combination of the two enzymes and the best performance resulted for the amplification of regions ORF1ab, E, and N (using both primer sets N5 and N15). The shortest Tp values for RT-LAMP assays were obtained targeting gene N, particularly with primer set N15 (Tp = 15 min). On the other hand, ORF1b was prone to false-positive results so it was removed. Some background signal was detected in the case of E and M primer sets; however; it was not due to DNA amplification, but rather related to the real-time device measurements.",

To date, of the mutations reported for SARS-CoV-2 [42] , none of them match in the sequences targeted by the primer sets used in RT-LAMP assays.

The sensitivity of amplification based on gene E detection was proved to be lower (2000 copies/reaction) than ORF1ab or N genes. This might be caused by the slower kinetics of the RT-LAMP reaction targeting gen E, which lacks in loop primers, and therefore does not allow the detection of low concentrations of viral RNA within a reasonable time. Moreover, most of the RT-LAMP assays developed to date do target genes ORF1ab or N [33] , and do not gene E, thus suggesting poorer results when using this target. Other published studies have reported sensitivities as low as 2 copies/reaction for both ORF1ab and N genes [28] or 3 copies/reaction for gene ORF1ab [20] . However, those results for analytical sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found using synthesized RNA fragments of genes N and ORF1ab obtained from in vitro transcription instead real RNA isolates from COVID-19 patients. Our results are in line with those larger clinical studies in which RT-LAMP assays present analytical sensitivities around hundreds of copies of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA [17, 25, 44] .",

Other studies testing SARS-CoV-2 positive patients estimated a viral load ranging from 1 copy/\u00b5L to 10 8 copies/\u00b5L, with most samples ranging from 10 4 -10 8 copies/\u00b5L [46] or median viral load of 1440 copies/\u00b5L in nasopharyngeal swab samples [47] . In addition, a study performed by Yu et al. [48] showed that the viral loads in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher (over 46,000 copies) than in the recovery stage of the disease (over 1200 copies). Despite these variations in viral load of COVID-19 patients, our RT-LAMP assay resulted sensitive enough for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples, as it seems to indicate the comparison of Ct values with those Tp values obtained with RT-qPCR. Thus, for samples with a Ct \u2264 30 obtained by RT-qPCR (group 1), we found an excellent sensitivity and specificity values for viral RNA by RT-LAMP assays using primer sets ORF1ab, N5, and N15. The Tp values for the three RT-LAMP assays resulted much shorter than those obtained with RT-qPCR. This fact is even more significant if we take into account that to calculate the Tp of the RT-LAMP assay, both the time dedicated to retro-transcription and amplification are considered, while the Ct of the RT-qPCR does not include the time dedicated to retro-transcription. In general, for clinical samples with Ct > 30 (or with only one RT-qPCR-amplified target; suggestive positives), RT-LAMP assays were initially less sensitive, and amplification was not obtained in all samples. However, the RT-LAMP with the primers set N15, although with high threshold time values, tested positive in all but one sample, probably suggesting a sensitivity significantly lower than 200 copies/reaction for N15-RT-LAMP.",

            "text": "In this work, we have developed three highly efficient RT-LAMP assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Considering those samples with a RT-qPCR-positive result for two different targets (nos. 1-12; confirmed positives), value of sensitivities resulted in 75% (9/12) for N5-RT-LAMP, 83.3% (10/12) for ORF1ab-RT-LAMP, and 100% (12/12) for N15-RT-LAMP. Furthermore, if only samples nos. 1-10 are considered, with a RT-qPCR Ct \u2264 33 for ORF1ab (equivalent to approximately 10-100 copies), sensitivities of ORF1ab-RT-LAMP and N5-RT-LAMP increase to 100% and 90%, respectively. It should be also noted that Tp values for N5-RT-LAMP were considerably lower than the Ct values for RT-qPCR targeting gene N (nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9), and all positive result could be detected with excellent reaction times under 25 min. All these results suggest that any of the three RT-LAMP assays would be able to detect COVID-19 patients in all disease stages (early, progressive and recovery) according to the currently known data on viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples [45] [46] [47] [48] . The significant correlation between RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP threshold times obtained-particularly in theoretically high viral load samples (Ct \u2264 30)-together with the absolute agreement between real-time and conventional colorimetric RT-LAMP assays, increase the confidence in our results. Nevertheless, the increased variability in Tp values that N15-RT-LAMP presented with theoretically low viral load samples (Ct > 30) cannot be disregarded. In this respect, it is important to note that a lack of correlation between speed and sensitivity in isothermal amplification reactions has been previously reported [49] and reactions with higher efficiency can have substantially longer times to be positive, thus contradicting the intuition derived from qPCR reactions. We are aware of the limitations of our study in terms of the sample size and we acknowledge that further studies to examine the reproducibility of N15-RT-LAMP in testing larger sets of clinical samples, both positive and negative, are needed. We also acknowledge the limitations in sensitivity of sets N5 and ORF1ab for the detection of positive samples with low viral load, with RT-qPCR Ct over 33. Those limitations should also be investigated in larger sets of clinical samples.",

            "text": "To develop a RT-LAMP as simple as possible to carry out in any condition for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we tried to keep all necessary components in a non-reactive state using tubes containing dry master mixes coated on the inner walls and caps. In a previous work, we successfully developed a simple desiccation procedure for drying LAMP reagents adapted for conventional and real-time amplifications assays [14] . Now, for COVID-19 RT-LAMP test, that protocol has been modified to achieve better thermal stability of dehydrated RT-LAMP mixes at ambient temperature along time. A Dry-RT-LAMP format can overcomes the requirement of cold storage facilities and temperature-controlled shipping [50, 51] , allows the omission of adding reagents individually, making the process easier and faster, and avoids possible cross-contamination during multiple pipetting steps in master mix preparation. The new 30 min one-step dry-up protocol was applied for RT-LAMP mixes containing primer sets ORF1ab, N5, and N15, resulting in functional amplifications of the C+ after storage at RT (25 \u2022 C) for up 14, 21, and 28 days, respectively. At this moment, we are not aware of the underlying cause of differences in stability when using different primer sets, but it could be possible than the higher efficiency showed by RT-LAMP with the primers set N15 allowed to amplify viral RNA after longer periods of storage. On the other hand, the longer dry components are storage at RT, the longer the reaction incubation time to achieve amplification is needed. An increase in reaction time, as well as a reduction in the amplification level in comparison to fresh liquid mixtures was already described by our group in operation of desiccation LAMP procedure [14] . In any case, very reasonable amplification times of 80 min (for set N15), 95 min (for set N5) and 115 min (for set ORF1ab) were observed before functionality loss after storage for 28, 21, or 14 days, respectively. Additionally, the Q 10 method predicts a shelf-life for Dry-RT-LAMP using primer set N15 of over 64-66 days at 25 \u2022 C. Subsequently, the Dry-N15-RT-LAMP format was selected to test those eight samples used in conventional colorimetric RT-LAMP assay at 0, 1, and 7 days post-desiccation. In analysis, an expected increase in the Tp values was observed in comparison to results obtained in N15-RT-LAMP fresh liquid reactions. Thus, those samples with long Tp values when testing in fresh using primer set N15 (presumably with a very low viral load or marginal positives: nos. 12, 14, 15, and 16) did not work very well at post-desiccation times, resulting in no amplification or in amplification with Tp values much longer. By contrast, those samples with short Tp values in fresh testing (presumably with medium/high viral load: nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7), despite increase slightly in reaction time, were consistently detected over post-desiccation time.",

            "text": "In summary, we have developed a novel, rapid, specific and sensitive RT-LAMP test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in clinical samples by targeting gene N with a specificsequence primer set N15. Our RT-LAMP assay can be simply performed both as a singletube isothermal colorimetric method without any expensive equipment requirement and in a real-time platform. The results can be detected as soon as 9 min after the reaction starts and obtain close to 100% sensitivity within 60 min. Moreover, the procedure is easily adaptable to a dry format that could be stored and delivered at room temperature. At this moment, maintaining the functionality for at least 2 months at RT, would allow us to prepare and distribute a set of dried RT-LAMP master mixes to be used within a few weeks in settings where detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required at the point of collection, such as schools, nursing homes, or rural medical centers. This feature, which can be achieved by a simple and fast process in comparison to other available options, mainly lyophilization, could represent a great contribution to fast molecular SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tools. Additionally, the affordability of the test is apparent, as the price per reaction in this study was 1.76 \u20ac for fresh mixes when using SYBR Green I and 1.69 \u20ac when using Eva Green 20x. The desiccation process only added 0.02 \u20ac per reaction. However, it is important to highlight that RNA purification would add over 3.50 \u20ac per sample depending on the commercial extraction kit used. Thus, the price per reaction is significantly cheaper than a standard RT-qPCR test which is approximately 7-10 \u20ac without considering previous RNA purification. Notwithstanding its limitations, the possibility of avoid the RNA extraction, or the combination of this RT-LAMP with some rapid RNA purification methods already described [22, 34, 52] , could allow easy testing in situations of rapid diagnostic demand and in low-resource settings and areas of difficult access, where the limited testing capacity is one of the main challenges in the COVID-19 response [53] , reducing considerably its price too. More work on this with the aim to improve and achieve a point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 will be performed in the future.
