This in vitro diagnostic rapid test (immunochromatographic assay) for the qualitative detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, is intended for use in a POC setting and has previously been validated mainly for use with serum and plasma (13) . Here we further assess the Panbio TM test for its use with fingerstick capillary and venous whole blood in addition to serum and plasma, which form the matrix equivalence arm (ME) of the study. We then focus on determining the seroprevalence and duration of COVID-IgG and IgM antibodies in healthcare workers (HCWs) . Previous studies of COVID-19 patients from across the world (14) (15) (16) (17) , have shown that HCWs had a 10% greater risk of infection due to the nature of their work and viral exposure to the virus from the hospital setting (18) . Our aim was to assess the prevalence of a past immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus among HCWs, as measured by detecting seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies using the Panbio TM test with confirmation using the Architect TM SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, and to evaluate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at a 3-month follow-up visit. Monitoring HCWs may facilitate early detection of healthcare-associated outbreaks which would allow implementation of management strategies assisting containment (19) .",

As complementary diagnostic tests, they can confirm infection in symptomatic patients with high clinical suspicion who present late after illness onset, when the sensitivity of nucleic acid detection is lower. Indeed, negative antibody results of PCR positive individuals is not sufficient to exclude infection (false positivity of the molecular test) as antibody levels may be undetectable if the serologic test is performed too early (6) (7) (8) (9) or if subjects are immunocompromised.

While the Architect Index is intended for the qualitative detection of IgG, the reported units of Architect Index are related to IgG concentration by a monotonic calibration curve. It is a limitation of the study that the calibration curve was not determined at the time of the measurements. However, by segmenting the population into quartiles of the Architect Index the relationship between IgG concentration and baseline characteristics can be explored. Complementing previous studies earlier in the course of the pandemic, which identified certain co-morbidities as risk factors for more severe manifestations of COVID-19 (45, (49) (50) (51) , we report that hypertension is associated with higher Architect Indices (OR = 2.128). In parallel to the higher IgG readings at enrolment within the Black and Asian ethnic groups as well as the older participants and those with hypertension, at the 3-month follow-up these groups showed a smaller decrease in antibody positivity compared to the reference groups (White, 18-32 yrs and normotensive, respectively). Additionally, IgG prevalence at enrolment was higher among frontline workers (28.3%) compared to nonfrontline workers (19.9%) with a similar decline rate observed after 3 months. We observed that participants who declared COVID-19 defining symptoms (as specified by the PHE) had higher Architect Index readings than those with other symptoms (e.g., headache, runny nose, diarrhoea) or who were asymptomatic (OR = 1.869). Additionally, we observed that participants with a symptom duration of more than 11 days were twice as likely to have elevated Architect Indices. This is consistent with findings which suggest the presence and duration of symptoms along with disease severity were more likely to influence the development of an adequate and persistent serum immune response (51) .",

To date, there is limited evidence of reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, although it is generally assumed that reinfections by coronaviruses occur (52) (53) (54) . In our study, a reinfection could be an explanation for 2 of the 3 subjects, as they reported COVID-19 defining symptoms a week prior to follow-up testing. The third participant only reported symptoms before enrolment in March 2020. Notably, only 4 out of the 146 antibody negative participants at enrolment (2.7%) became positive after 3 months. Similar to the much larger SIREN study (55) , which recruited nationally, our local cohort data suggests that those that had a known previous infection did not become re-infected during the study period. However, we were not able to determine an association between previous infections and lower risks of new infections due to the lack of PCR information. Additionally, the low rates of seroconversion (2.7%), indicative of new infections during the September-November period (although not confirmed by PCR), may have resulted from improved workplace containment practices.",

HCW subjects with pre-defined risk factors for serious COVID-19 illness demonstrated greater prevalence, higher levels and greater persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody than those deemed low risk. It is accepted that we will require an arsenal of tools at our disposal to diagnose early, manage and contain community outbreaks. In line with this, we envisage that the Panbio TM will be incorporated as part of a battery of tests to provide diagnostic information and facilitate interventions, as it will allow the distinction between antibody production induced by natural infection and vaccination, the latter inducing anti-S, but not anti-N antibody production. Future studies should focus on better understanding antibody prevalence and persistence especially in high-risk populations aided with POC testing methods in the COVID-19 diagnostic algorithm.",

For samples without an Elecsys R result, the Architect TM result was the composite reference result. The IgG results demonstrated a high PPA of the Panbio TM COVID-19 IgG/IgM test in comparison with the Architect TM SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, when used with fingerstick and venous whole blood and with plasma; the NPA was lower. With serum, the Panbio TM COVID-19 IgG/IgM test PPA was lower than with other sample types. The NPA at 10 min using the composite reference result increased for all sample types. The Architect TM assay detects SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies only, whereas the Elecsys R result consists of a composite SARS-COV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA result. However, the participants with a positive Elecsys R reference result and a negative Architect TM reference result all had a negative EDI TM Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgM ELISA test result, indicating a lack of IgM influence on the final reference test result.
