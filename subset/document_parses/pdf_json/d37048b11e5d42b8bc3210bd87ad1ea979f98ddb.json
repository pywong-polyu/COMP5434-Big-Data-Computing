SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and had an immeasurable toll on the economy. Currently, most clinical cases are identified by qualitative molecular testing. However, the need for quantitative assessment is gaining traction. Areas covered: In this review, the current state and future perspective of SARS-CoV-2 viral load quantification is presented. Expert opinion: Viral load quantification is a critical measure that informs clinicians of treatment response, actionable viral load levels, and guidance on patient management. Additionally, for pathogens with epidemiological consequences, viral load can provide information to guide infection control measures and policies. While qualitative detection is sufficient to identify cases and initiate containment and mitigation measures in the vast majority of COVID-19 cases, in certain situations, SARS-CoV-2 quantification is needed to assess viral load trending. However, there are obstacles to quantification, including variability in respiratory specimen collection and the lack of commutable reference material. At the same time, the need for quantification for clinical and epidemiological management is growing, especially concerning individuals with prolonged RNA shedding.",

Like pandemics in the past, the exact origins and first human transmission events of SARS-CoV-2 remain a mystery [7] . As of this writing, COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of close to three million people worldwide [8] . Also devastating are the tens of millions of patients admitted to intensive care units in isolation commonly referred to as COVID wards, where a vast number of them would be put on ventilators and rigorously managed. For survivors of COVID-19, the sequelae of the disease is not fully known and still evolving, but it is clear that many who have recovered still need long-term management from complications of COVID-19 [9] . This includes cardiovascular and neurological manifestations, as well as continuous pulmonary function abnormalities [9] . In fact, academic medical institutions across the United States are establishing post-COVID-19 care centers to manage patients with late sequelae [9] . As with any highly transmissible infection, rapid identification of infected individuals with effective isolation or quarantine measures are paramount to controlling the spread. In order to provide rapid diagnosis, governments and test manufacturers around the world were under high pressure in the early days of the pandemic to produce fast and accurate diagnostic tests.",

Other jurisdictions have similar regulatory bodies that oversee test manufacturing like the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in the European Union or National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China. Given the need for rapid deployment of diagnostic tests to combat the pandemic, on 4 February 2020, the US Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency concerning COVID-19 [11] . The declaration allows the FDA to authorize unapproved medical products to be used during a public health emergency, including diagnostic tests. Thus, test manufacturers can apply for an FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) without submitting extensive data and obtaining an FDA in vitro diagnostic (IVD) approval that can take years. As of this writing, there are over 220 EUA assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen and over 70 EUA assays for the detection of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 [12] . These assays have various specimen requirements, as well as collection options. These figures don't include the hundreds of laboratory-developed tests (LDT) and those that are investigational or research use only that may be in use in various research and clinical settings. Table 1 lists several commonly used EUA qualitative assays and their respective test characteristics and analytical performance ( Table 1) . It is important to note that qualitative SARS-CoV-2 assays are slowly getting approved by the FDA. Most recently, BioFire Respiratory Viral Panel 2.1, a qualitative multiplex assay that includes SARS-CoV -2 as a target, received FDA IVD approval [13] . Once the public health emergency declaration ends, EUA assays will no longer be allowed. Therefore, it is important for manufacturers to obtain FDA IVD approval of their EUA assays prior to the end of the declaration.",

For diagnostic purposes to assess whether a person is currently infected, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a molecular method like nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen by an immunoassay would be most appropriate. To evaluate past-infection and understand the epidemiology of COVID-19 and assess seroprevalence, including immunization, detection of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 would be most appropriate. The pretest probabilities of these methodologies and window of detection are largely dependent upon the timing of the infection, anatomic site of sample collection, prevalence in the community or specific population, and good collection techniques [14] . A number of studies show that viral antigen is detectable by current methods within the first 5 to 7 day post-onset of symptoms [15, 16] . This is a much shorter detection window compared to viral RNA detected by NAAT, which can be detectable weeks into the infection [15] . Antibody detection occurs after the second week post-infection, and optimally detectable at 3-4 weeks [15, 17] . Unconventionally, both IgM and IgG seems to rise at the same time, making IgM detection not as helpful in diagnosing acute infection in contrast to other infections.",

Recently, the FDA clarified that reporting Ct values from qualitative SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays with EUA status is allowed if the platform provides such information [30] . While the FDA does provide limitations and caution statements on how Ct values should be interpreted, it reasons that Ct values could be used as a measure of estimation of viral load, and could provide guidance in evaluating disease burden and transmission.

First, EUA assays from different manufacturers have different Ct value ranges. An assay from one platform may have a reportable Ct value range of 10 to 40 while another platform may have a range of 10 to 35. Thus, a Ct value of 35 will have different interpretation depending on what platform the specimen was tested on. Given the large testing volume and the need to build redundancy around reagent shortages, many clinical labs are running multiple platforms, which have different detection ranges and Ct reporting. Secondly, different primer/probe designs will have different PCR efficiency and binding properties. Not only will this result in differences in Ct values, but also provide inconsistent interpretation when trending Ct values. A difference of three cycles from a prior test result performed may hold different significance with different platforms, and certainly not interchangeable. Lastly, and probably the most important point, is that a respiratory specimen, especially the commonly collected nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs, are not homogenous specimen types. Unlike serum or plasma, respiratory specimen collection is largely dependent on sampling techniques. Depending on the rigor, depth, and contact time of the swab during collection, varying amounts of viral RNA and host cellular materials may be collected. While collection technique is important for qualitative testing, it is absolutely critical for quantitative testing.",

For laboratories subscribing to the CAP proficiency testing program, CAP sends unknown samples to participating laboratories and grade their results. For SARS-CoV-2 qualitative PCR testing, CAP recently published data from a proficiency testing survey of over 700 participating laboratories [31] . As with any proficiency testing survey, the same batch of test material was sent. Participating laboratories were asked to report back Ct values in addition to qualitative results. CAP received data on eight different EUA assays with various assay designs for detection, two targets with separate probes, two targets with a combined probe, and a single target with a single probe. The median Ct value range among the different platform was 14 cycles. Interestingly, differences in Ct value tested in different laboratories using the same platform were as high as 3 cycles.

In the US, the most widely used SARS-CoV-2 reference material for test development is the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain, a viral isolate obtained from a patient who returned to Washington state after traveling to an affected region of China in January 2020. Different preparations of the product, like extracted RNA, cell culture lysate, and heat-inactivated lysates, are available. Importantly, the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain preparations are available as products from a variety of reference material manufacturers. This has resulted in variation in propagation and passage among different manufacturers as evidenced by different cell line used for viral culture to manufacture the products, which could impact the quality and commutability of the material. Therefore, a concerted effort is needed to standardize the manufacturing of reference materials, or move toward wider adoption of the WHO international standard.

While education and training can streamline collection techniques, sample collection is inherently variable for specimens like nasal and nasopharyngeal swabbing. Therefore, rather than relying on the hopes of consistent technique of sample collectors, an assessment of the sample integrity and subsequent normalization may be a better approach. One option is to normalize the viral quantitation with host cell quantitation as measured with housekeeping genes and report viral load as NAAT detectable unit (NDU) per host cell. Some of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection assays include host nucleic acid detection like RNase P. While there are limitations of using RNase P in its current formulation, like detection of both DNA and RNA in the same reaction, other housekeeping genes or a different primer/probe design specifically targeting host DNA to derive an estimation of host cellular material would be needed. Thus, rather than reporting per mL of sample, quantification would be normalized based on how much host epithelial cells are collected, with the assumption that a higher number of epithelial cells may equate to a better collection. Establishing standard curve using a reference material in IU per mL or copies per mL, then converting that into an NDU per host cell may require some background calculations. For other sample types like bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) or sputum, where sample collection technique can be considered more consistent than swabbing, NDU per mL may be more appropriate. One point to note, kinetics of viral shedding has been shown to vary in different anatomic sites, especially in relation to anatomic sites of viral entry [39, 40] . Therefore, quantification should be limited to serial collection of a single or specific sites for consistent result interpretation. To account for shedding at different anatomic sites, perhaps a stratification approach based on patient risk factors, and sampling at multiple sites when feasible, could be devised into an algorithm.",

In patients with prolonged RNA shedding or in assessing infection control measures for patients that are already qualitatively positive for COVID-19, evaluating SARS-CoV-2 viral load trends could provide useful insights. Whether a single viral load test result can provide meaningful or actionable information without viral load trend data remains to be seen. In developing a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 test, there are a number of limitations to consider, including imperfect specimen collection, imperfect reference materials, and imperfect knowledge of the virus species and state in vivo that can impact quantification. As the field awaits solutions to these limitations, it is important to keep a perspective on minimizing risks and maximizing benefits in developing an assay with these limitations. Perhaps, the risk is minimized by narrowing the indication for testing or restricting the testing population. In the alternative, reporting quantitation based on a standard curve, regardless of the reference material, may be more beneficial than simply reporting Ct values.",

As test manufacturers, government grant agencies, regulatory bodies, testing laboratories, clinicians, investors, and the public at-large conduct postmortem analyses, one thing will become clear: the in vitro diagnostic space will never be the same. Prior to the pandemic, most people did not know what a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) was, or that an antigen test is different from an antibody test. The concept of pretest probability and false positive or negative test was foreign to most people, no less that medical laboratory professionals perform these diagnostic tests and provide result interpretation. Now, these terms and concepts have become common parlance, and for better or worse, we live in a world with a greater and expanded general knowledge of diagnostic testing.",

Incubators and government-sponsored programs have pushed diagnostic test development to new levels of collaboration and innovation. This shift has allowed the expansion of home-collection, selfcollection, and at-home testing, not to mention smartphone and online-based result reporting and tracking, to name a few. It has opened avenues for over-the-counter (OTC) and directto-consumer (DTC) respiratory viral antigen and antibody testing, and NAAT with newer platform designs.",

In the midst of this exciting and revolutionary times in the in vitro diagnostic space, manufacturers and regulatory agencies, and clinical and laboratory professionals must all work as stewards to ensure that innovation and progress is rooted in evidence. This includes robust collection devices and methods that are optimal for quantification, reliable commutable reference material, and well-designed clinical studies evaluating viral load trends. Ensuring public confidence by gaining and maintaining public trust through evidence is pivotal, especially in the current world of social media and 'viral' spread of misinformation.",
