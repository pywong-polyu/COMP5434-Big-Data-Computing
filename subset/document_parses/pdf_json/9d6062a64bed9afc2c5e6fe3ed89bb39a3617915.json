Randomized and observational trial data demonstrate consistent benefit of targeting neutral fluid balances in the ICU and clinicians report management aligned with these evidence-based practices [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Despite this, evidence suggests that in daily practice, clinicians fail to recognize nearly one-third of patients who have significant FO and patients continue to receive unrecognized levels of fluid administration [19, 22, 23] .

For our current study, patients were required to have a serum creatinine measurement within 12 h of ICU admission as well as complete fluid balance data through Day 3 after ICU admission. Patients were also required to have the complete data necessary to determine RAI, including transplant, mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive medication status. Exclusion criteria were death before Day 3, history of stage 5 chronic kidney disease (i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 mL/min per 1.73m 2 or on maintenance dialysis), kidney transplantation in the last 90 days, incomplete kidney injury information, or patients admitted during the study period but were not part of the parent study.

The score assigned in the Injury Strata is the highest score based on either the serum creatinine or FO accumulation. The score is calculated at 12 h after ICU admission. FO: Fluid overload, by percentage and urine was used to define urine output as previously published [25] . Additionally, if the patient had an unmeasurable output, it was defined as a normal amount for age by default. To further protect against false positive identification of oliguria in patients without urethral catheters, total urine output was divided over the period of time between instances of output, allowing for normal sleep periods of > 6 h with no urine output.

Here, we confirm and extend these findings to fluid accumulation, with children fulfilling RAI criteria having over 5 times odds of developing FO. FO states are common among critically ill children and are associated with a large burden of resource utilization, morbidity and mortality in multiple pediatric populations [2, 15, 16, [31] [32] [33] [34] .

Major contributions to FO states tend to be from \"fluid creep\" as opposed to resuscitation fluids early in the ICU course and median fluid exposure exceeds weight-based maintenance on Day 3 of critical illness [22] . Here, we found that fluid accumulation was significantly different among children who developed severe AKI compared to those who did not. This finding was present as early as 36 h after ICU admission, suggesting an early opportunity to recognize and intervene before significant FO develops. Importantly, this finding was seen among patients who fulfilled RA criteria, but not among those who did not. As such, this discriminatory power of RAI may be helpful in identifying those children most at risk for excessive fluid accumulation at admission.",

Importantly, this study does not answer the cause-and-effect nature of AKI and FO. However, it does suggest the possibility to identify children early in an ICU course in a future, prospective way. Secondly, this study did not identify medications which may affect fluid balance or influence development of AKI through nephrotoxic actions. These multiple interactions should be investigated in future, prospective ways. Further, we did not find significant associations with mortality at 30 days. This finding is likely related to low overall mortality and a small cohort with inadequate power to find a difference. However, other patient-and family-centered outcomes, including dialysis receipt and hospital length of stay, were reinforced in this study. The included patients all had an expected length of stay > 48 h, which may suggest these patients were sicker and potentially bias the findings toward the development of AKI and FO. However, as the RAI was used in all patients, this inclusion factor served as a population enrichment strategy. Finally, if a patient did not have a Foley catheter in place, any mixed stool and urine output was classified as \"urine output\", potentially overestimating urine output and therefore underestimating the rate of oliguria. This may bias the classification of AKI to be less severe than was actually present, potentially weakening or missing important AKI related associations.",
