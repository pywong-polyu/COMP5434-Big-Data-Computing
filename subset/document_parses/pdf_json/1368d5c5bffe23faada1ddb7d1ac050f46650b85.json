It can be concluded from an examination of this triangle that it is necessary to make compromises among 'high value', 'low cost', and 'short time-to-market', and that it is usually possible to achieve only one out of three. For example, an MMP aimed at providing 'high value' needs to be of 'high quality', and such an MMP, in turn, tends to take longer to develop and costs more; conversely, it is possible to shorten the initial development time, but that comes at the expense of reducing the value provided by the delivered MMP, assuming cost is kept almost constant.",
