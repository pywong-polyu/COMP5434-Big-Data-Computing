This is by no means a straightforward process and it is inevitably influenced by both the attitudes and beliefs of those doing the collecting and by the challenges and obstacles they can often face at the time. As a result, historic collections are invariably uneven in content. Sometimes physical objects associated with widespread practices or even historic global events may be barely represented or entirely absent from collections otherwise recognized as exemplars in the associated fields, such as disposable items used for disinfecting. Many researchers have surely been crushed by the revelation that there are no surviving artefacts from a key scientific breakthrough or that examples of a once commonplace, throwaway item appear to have all been \u2026 thrown away.",

In recent years, closer interrogations of museum collections are also revealing how objects that might illustrate the lives and experiences of particular groups and communities, to reflect on disability, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation can also be missing. These and other absences can sometimes be due to the approach taken to collecting and are, of course, not restricted to collections of health and medicine. But perhaps some of these other absences are more easily explained. For example, collections of historic dress traditionally tend to be rich in 'Sunday best' and special occasion outfits, as it was these that were kept and treasured. Curator and historian of fashion, Julia Petrov has noted that the 'earliest museum collections of historical dress rarely included any fashions that might have been worn within living memory' [1] , a situation that would naturally favour the aforementioned 'kept and treasured'. A well-worn kitchen apron or typical workman's clothes, while once numerically far more common, were less likely to be preserved, so are rarer survivors.",

The galleries also explore what could be considered the more cultural side of science-for example, how belief and faith in treatment have direct health outcomes. The galleries contain a series of striking, newly commissioned artworks to help visitors respond to the story of medicine in visual and creative ways.

Wellcome (1853-1936) was a pharmaceutical millionaire, born in Minnesota but whose business was based in London where he later became a naturalized British citizen. His passion was for collecting health and medicine across continents and cultures, believing that through the study of such an accumulated mass of objects would come a greater understanding of humanity [2] . His wealth allowed for collecting on an extravagant scale, and at his death in 1936, his collection comprised over 1 million objects. Now largely dispersed, 115 000 core objects primarily relating to the history of medicine were kept by the Wellcome Trust and transferred on long-term loan to the Science Museum in the 1970s [3] . This transfer marked the formal birth of the museum's Medicine collection. The collection now contains well over 150 000 items and is increasing every day as curators actively gather material that we hope will reflect medical developments, breakthroughs, triumphs-and failures-as well as everyday practices and experiences for the use of future research and display.",

Why then might collecting around epidemic and pandemic disease events be particularly problematic-as is suggested by the evidence of museum catalogues, not only in the Science Museum but in other museum collections relating to medicine? Here, broadly speaking, we can define an epidemic as a marked prevalence of a disease within a community, population or region and a pandemic when this spreads across entire countries, continents or the whole world. Such events present a striking contrast to the endemic diseases that exist at a background level within such populations all the time. Of course, as conditions shift and circumstances change and bacterial or viral strains adapt-an endemic disease such as seasonal flu could occasionally evolve into an epidemic or even pandemic.",

There, the absence of material might perhaps be ascribed to the influence of connoisseurial preferences or museological elitism. It is also a tradition with deep connections to those who actually practice medicine. The medical profession has a strong affection for its own heritage, and physicians, surgeons and more recently, pharmacists and nurses, are among practitioners who have saved objects to form their own discreet collections. Although varying in scale, stature and scope, this urge to preserve their own heritage is a notable and widespread characteristic of the medical professions. Such collections can be found among the various royal medical colleges and societies and across the hospital trusts. Some were created as a physical and very prominent record of professional prestige, whereas others may owe their more modest existence to the often-unbidden efforts of dedicated volunteers. Weir's Guide to Medical Museums in Britain of 1993 lists museums that have medical parts to their collection, as well as ones dedicated entirely to medicine. Although some of the collections listed have now become subsumed into others, it still provides a useful overview of medical collections nationally. From this book, we can see that some areas dominate-'personalia' of famous medical professionals, surgery and other instruments, hospital collections with a strong local connection, and specialist collections relating to very specific areas of medicine and a handful of medical military museums [4] .",

This inevitably means that in many areas, representations of the everyday in collections can be severely underrepresented in museum displays. But medical museums storerooms tell a different story. Medical collections large and small contain many examples of mundane tools of the trade, especially in the case of surgical collections. Admittedly an extreme example as an especially enthusiastic collector, Henry Wellcome's historic collection contains around 700 pairs of artery forceps, a tool that has fundamentally changed little in its design over the three centuries since it was invented. So if the everyday is carefully kept in collections relating to surgery, anatomy or personalia of famous medical practitioners, why is there so relatively little historic material relating to some of the major epidemics and pandemics of the past?",

Almost certainly the deadliest disease event in history, the total number killed may have been as high a 100 million, with over 500 million infected. Yet Laura Spinney argues it features in the public consciousness purely as a footnote to the First World War. 'When asked what was the biggest disaster of the twentieth century, almost nobody answers the Spanish flu.' [5] . The way that Spanish flu almost misses a perceived place in history is perhaps mirrored in historic medicine collections-by the very absence of objects relating to this seismic event.",

Searching the Science Museum's extensive digital catalogue, the term 'Spanish flu'-and variations thereof-produce not a single return. Conversely, objects with direct associations with the First World War are numbered in the low thousands. Other museum collections do have more material associated with that pandemic, such as advertisements sharing public health directives, and items relating to preventing the spread of infection such as disinfectant, handwashing and masks.

            "text": "The reasons for the lack of museum objects relating to this disease event would appear to be complex and overlapping. The pandemic unfolded very quickly-with the vast majority of deaths occurring in the autumn months of 1918, at the very time that the First World War was coming to a close. Both swift and brutal was the effect on nations exhausted by the conflict. Spinney argues that a natural response to this widespread trauma of death-frequently the death of young and otherwise healthy people-was to avoid thinking and speaking of it. The widespread loss of people in communities who would ordinarily have been the family providers had longlasting and widespread impacts, especially on children left orphaned. To illustrate one community deeply impacted by the Spanish flu pandemic, she quotes a 1994 report of Yupik people in Alaska. Yupik elder Harold Napoleon writes that the epidemics experienced over two centuries caused such trauma that the only response was silence. 'To this day nallunguaq remains a way of dealing with problems or unpleasant occurrences in Yupik life', Napoleon writes, 'Young people are advised by elders to nallunguarluku, 'to pretend it didn't happen.'' [5] . Although this is a very explicit example of silencing, Spinney suggests that this avoidance of a devastating subject can be seen more widely. Is it a step too far to suggest that this avoidance can be seen only too clearly in the gaps in medical collections relating to the Spanish flu? This could particularly be the case when we consider that for many people, the pandemic was consolidating the trauma already experienced by many during the First World War.",

Much of the equipment and other material called on in these crises simply carried on being used for ordinary medical needs until they reached the end of their natural life. They were generally neither specialized tools nor new innovations, but just everyday items of nursing, hygiene nor laboratory kit. Another consideration for the lack of material culture is that the items in use might have been (or at least considered to have been) highly infectious and therefore burnt or otherwise disposed of soon after useoften as standard practice to minimize health risks. A housework manual of 1926 gives domestic insight into such an approach, recommending that the housewife, following an infectious disease in the home, completely disinfects the sickroom, '\u2026 including the clothes of the nurse and of everything used by the patient which cannot be destroyed. Books given to read should be of little value and should be burnt, as they cannot be satisfactorily disinfected.' [6] .",

Diphtheria, measles and scarlet fever were three of the most common infectious diseases in post-industrial society which together with whooping cough posed the biggest risk to child health and mortality. The impact of these diseases prior to effective vaccination is captured in detail in records kept by Medical Officers of Health at the time, many of which make chilling reading today. The Medical Officer for Islington, reporting on a measles epidemic in 1910 that had killed 160 people, 131 of them under five, wrote: 'Very large numbers of little ones are daily exposed to unnecessary danger by their attendance at the schools. Indeed, when we look at the roll of deaths from measles and whooping-cough, we cannot, if we have unbiased minds, come to any other conclusion than that the lives of many of the little ones who have died from this disease might have been preserved if they had not been sent to school, where they were brought into contact with the disease 3 '. Yet despite the detail kept in the paper records, the material culture-much of it simple and disposableassociated with these once common epidemics can be sparsely represented in museum collections. Conversely, there are some epidemics that devastated communities that have fared better in their presence in museums. Polio is one example that clearly caught the attention of collectors and curators, possibly due to innovations in technology that developed as a response to this disease. Rather than a single devastating event, polio emerged to become a recurring seasonal epidemic during the middle decades of the twentieth century. Its regular and appalling reappearances also prompted vaccine research, the successful outputs of which were rolled out across the world from the 1950s. Polio killed but also produced both short-term and lifelong disabilities and over its extended timeframe it developed its own distinct material culture. One such example is a set of four splints used by a Mrs Blackstone, a British woman who was affected by polio as a child in the 1940s. The splints range from heavy to light, as each one was exchanged as her condition improved. As sometimes happens, these splints came to light some 40 years later, when her elderly mother moved to a new house, and cupboards needed clearing. Mrs Blackstone noted 'The sight of them after so many years was a somewhat disturbing one.' [7] . Fortunately for us, she donated them to the museum rather than throwing them away. A nice example of a retrospective donation of personal equipment that both shares the experience of the patient and physically records medical treatments of the time.",

The very size of this machinery perhaps contributed to its continuing interest. Expensive to produce, difficult to dispose of and for many years potentially still needed in an emergency, they languished in hospital basements and storerooms until so much time had passed that they had inadvertently gained historic interest. Elsewhere, other less technologically impressive pieces that relate to polio were literally saved from the skip by a curatorial intervention.

Purely for practical reasons, the Science Museum decided to largely focus on the British experience of the pandemic. To frame and limit the scope was essential, especially as the range of topics is necessarily broad. One particular area it was decided not to collect was in oral history. The reasons for this decision were threefold-one is that collecting personal experiences of the pandemic is being done very effectively elsewhere, notably by the NHS at 70 project. Second, sourcing, obtaining and processing oral history recordings are very resource intensive and the decision was made, given the limitations on staff movements and access, to focus our energies elsewhere. In addition, ethical considerations again came into play in the decision not to pursue this. The Oral History Society's guidelines around collecting COVID-19-related oral histories warns that 'when interviewing healthcare or other frontline workers there is a danger that 'single session interventions that require staff to talk about their thoughts or feelings' may increase the likelihood of PTSD' [9] . Indeed, the wider emotional cost of attempting to collect material associated with COVID-19, while the pandemic is still playing out, has led the museum community to debate, and in some cases criticise, the rapid response collecting approach. 5 Another challenge for line royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsfs Interface Focus 11: 20210030 managers involved in this collecting project has been to monitor the emotional wellbeing and stress levels of their teams (and themselves), while all working from their own homes.

The digital outputs come from numerous sources and are being produced for many reasons. They also exist in a myriad of different forms and formats. Be it NHS apps or pandemic modelling software, official government tweets or satirical social media GIFs, the volume is overwhelming. Much of it only exists in a digital form, although physical examples of material that has been printed out from a digital source and then used in real settings are being collected when available.

This is in part due to an acknowledgement of the importance of collecting objects, largely overlooked by previous curators, that can represent health and medicine at a population level-a truer reflection of 'public health'.
