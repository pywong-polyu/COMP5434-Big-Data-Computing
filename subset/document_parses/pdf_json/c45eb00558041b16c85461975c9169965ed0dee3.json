Overall, the number of publications and authors in development economics are rising steeply with the average annual growth rate of nearly 23% and 26%, respectively. Moreover, the 'quality' of the research appears to be high as 59% of the articles are published in journals in the first and second quartile according Scimago journal ranking. However, the citation counts for these studies indicate their impacts are far more languishing in comparison. In terms of research trends, this study identified three emerging areas of studies that are relatively under-researched, namely natural resources, technology, and urbanization. As for publishing practices, There is also a positive sign for the adoption of open science among Vietnamese researchers in this field. The findings are useful for predicting future research trends. In addition, the study provides several implications for policymakers in Vietnam to enhance research capacity.",

Secondly, based on the literature review, a list of keywords will be created. The keywords have to yield all essential aspects of development economics. Thirdly, based on availability, a popular and reliable source of data is chosen. In this study, with the focus on development economics research in Vietnam, the Social Sciences and Humanities Peer Awards database (SSHPA)-A database of Vietnamese social sciences and humanities' productivity, is a suitable option. The collected data from the SSHPA database will be cleaned, verified, and cross-checked manually to ensure quality.",

More than one million articles are indexed in the PubMed database each year (Landhuis 2016) , and many researchers publish a paper every 5 days (Ioannidis et al. 2018) . Thus, scientists have to constantly update their methods to keep up with the growing volume of scientific papers. For instance, in medical research, Living Systematic Review was proposed as a practical solution for information overload (Elliott et al. 2014) . In recent years, the advent of artificial intelligence also provides experimental tools to help scientists with updating the latest findings, sorting out papers, or even supporting the peer review process (Extance 2018; Heaven 2018) . More conventionally, bibliometric databases like Web of Science or Scopus are important venues for researchers. The in-depth analysis of their data can provide essential insights into the development of science (Ellegaard and Wallin 2015) . The well-known journal metrics from Web of Science and Scopus are considered as a simple type of bibliometric. However, using a mere number to rank a journal has many shortcomings and can be abused in various ways (Berenbaum 2019; Tran et al. 2020) . Thus, in its reports, the Web of Science has to use more sophisticated methods to provide an overview of the scientific development in South and East Asia (Adams et al. 2019) or to identify hot topics and new research fronts (Szomszor et al. 2020) .",

Nevertheless, the contribution of Vietnam to the world's scientific output is still very modest (around 0.2%) compared with the country's population size (around 1.2% of the world's population) (Nguyen et al. 2017c) . Furthermore, similar to (Ho 2015) 's findings, around 75% of the growth in Vietnam's scientific output in the past 15 years resulted from international collaborations, even though the share of internationally authored papers has slightly decreased over time (Nguyen et al. 2017c ).",

In this way, the most cited article was published in 2014, as it took 6 years to attain 266 citations (Huynh 2014) .

However, the open-access model can often be mistaken as (2010) Chau (2018) and Pham et al. (2019b) low quality or a pay-to-publish scheme. Thus, policymakers should review the development of open access journals and provide useful guidelines and supports to manage the cost of science (Vuong 2018) . The promotion of internal capacity is also vital for the field. Currently, Vietnamese authors rely on quantitative research and the availability of secondary data in Vietnam. Nevertheless, researchers should also focus on other scientific innovations as well.
