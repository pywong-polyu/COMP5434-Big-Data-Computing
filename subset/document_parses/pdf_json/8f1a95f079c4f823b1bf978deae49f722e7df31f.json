            "text": "The programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting element (PFSE) of SARS-CoV-2 is a well conserved structured RNA found in all coronaviruses' genomes. By adopting a pseudoknot structure in the presence of the ribosome, the PFSE promotes a ribosomal frameshifting event near the stop codon of the first open reading frame Orf1a during translation of the polyprotein pp1a. Frameshifting results in continuation of pp1a via a new open reading frame, Orf1b, that produces the longer pp1ab polyprotein. Polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab produce nonstructural proteins NSPs 1\u221210 and NSPs 1\u221216, respectively, which contribute vital functions during the viral life cycle and must be present in the proper stoichiometry. Both drugs and sequence alterations that affect the stability of the \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting element disrupt the stoichiometry of the NSPs produced, which compromise viral replication. For this reason, the \u22121 programmed frameshifting element is considered a promising drug target. Using chaperone assisted RNA crystallography, we successfully crystallized and solved the three-dimensional structure of the PFSE. We observe a three-stem H-type pseudoknot structure with the three stems stacked in a vertical orientation stabilized by two triple base pairs at the stem 1/stem 2 and stem 1/ stem 3 junctions. This structure provides a new conformation of PFSE distinct from the bent conformations inferred from midresolution cryo-EM models and provides a high-resolution framework for mechanistic investigations and structure-based drug design.",

            "text": "The historic and deadly COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Researchers around the world are searching for treatments for this catastrophic disease, in part by targeting drug design efforts toward the structured RNA elements in the nearly 30 kb RNA genome of the virus. However, a lack of high-resolution, three-dimensional structural information about structured regions of the genome make development of drugs to target them difficult. Computational modeling and structural probing techniques are able to identify structured regions within RNAs and can suggest whether an RNA element might contain a pocket sufficient for ligand binding, but these estimations often lack certainty about the chemical arrangement of binding pockets. 1, 2 By contrast, broad screens of RNA binding chemicals do not require high resolution structural information as a starting point and can yield lead molecules, but these chemicals are rarely drug-like due to their toxicity, lack of cell permeability, or lack of bioavailability. 1 Experimentally derived structures of viral RNA elements can provide another route to drug discovery. Existing drugs can be screened against experimentally determined structural models using structural dynamics simulations to identify potential binders. 3 One potentially druggable RNA target in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is the programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting element (PFSE). Thus far, it has been shown to bind the ligand 2-{[4-(2-methyl-thiazol-4ylmethyl)- [1, 4] diazepane-1carbonyl]-amino}-benzoic acid ethyl ester (MTDB), and in cell culture this ligand can compromise ribosomal frameshifting and inhibit viral replication by three orders of magnitude. 3\u22128 Chemical probing and homology modeling consistently predict this programmed frameshifting element to form a stable and well-ordered three-stemmed H-type pseudoknot. 8\u221214 For structural biologists, its small size also makes it a promising candidate for X-ray crystallography. Thus, we saw an opportunity to support the drug design process and mechanistic investigations by generating a high-resolution structure of the programmed frameshifting element using our lab's method of chaperone-assisted RNA crystallography.",

            "text": "Ribosomal frameshifting from Orf1a to Orf1b is a critical step in coronavirus propagation. 15, 18 Orf1a and its out-of-frame continuation Orf1b are the first open reading frames to be translated directly from the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome upon infection and disassembly ( Figure 1A ). They encode the nonstructural proteins (NSPs) 1\u221216, which are involved in evading the host immune response, replicating the genomic RNA, and producing the subgenomic mRNAs that encode the structural proteins. NSPs 1\u221210 are produced from Orf1a as the self-cleaving polypeptide pp1a. 13, 16 As the ribosome approaches the stop codon of Orf1a, the programmed frameshifting element pseudoknot can cause the ribosome to slip backward by one position. 16\u221218 If frameshifting occurs the ribosome will continue translating into Orf1b, producing pp1ab, which comprises NSPs 1\u221216. Known as the golden mean hypothesis of ribosomal frameshifting, incorrect stoichiometry of early replication products, in this case pp1a and pp1ab, disrupts the replication cycle and reduces virus propagation. 4, 13, 19 The basic mechanism of \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting is known, although there are many levels of regulation at play that are not understood. 17, [20] [21] [22] 46 Generally, a structured region of the RNA causes a translating ribosome to pause over a so-called slippery site with a nucleotide sequence pattern of X XXY YYZ composition. 16, 18, 23, 24 This structured region is most often a pseudoknot, which forms 6\u22128 nts downstream of the slippery site. The pseudoknot structure opposes the translocating ribosome, which creates tension that causes the slippery site codon interactions with P-and A-site tRNAs to slide backward by one nucleotide from X XXY YYZ to XXX YYY Z, resulting in a \u22121 shift in the reading frame. 16,18,23\u221225 When incorporated into luciferase reporter mRNA constructs, the minimal sequence of frameshifting pseudoknots from different viruses induces frameshifting at an internally consistent frequency, but this frequency varies widely from virus to virus. 27 For example, the programmed frameshifting element from West Nile virus induces frameshifting around 70 to 80% of the time, while the SARS-CoV-1 PFSE induces frameshifting around 15 to 30% of the time. 5, 27, 28 Force extension curves of the different pseudoknots in an optical trap reveal that those elements populating more conformations Figure 1 .

            "text": "In SARS-CoV-2, the PFSE encompasses the roughly 80-ntlong sequence (residues 13462\u221213542 in the HB01 strain, gen bank number NC_45512.2) that includes a hepta-nucleotide slippery site, nucleotides 13462\u221213468 in the genomic numbering, and a spacer region followed by the proposed RNA pseudoknot structure in positions 13474\u221213542 in the genome ( Figure 1A ). 30 Interestingly, this pseudoknot sequence is nearly perfectly conserved from SARS-CoV-1, the etiological agent of the 2003 coronavirus pandemic, with the exception of a single point mutation at position C 13444 in SARS-CoV-1 (Gen bank number AY278488.2) which corresponds to an A in position 13533 in SARS-CoV-2. 12, 33, 59 The pseudoknot structure of the frameshifting element from SARS-CoV-1 has been well-characterized previously by chemical probing, mutational, and NMR studies of minimal constructs. 12, 14, 21 The secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-1 PFSE derived from these studies ( Figure 1B ) has been used to guide molecular dynamics and tertiary structure prediction models. [8] [9] [10] 32 Briefly, the PFSE's secondary structure comprises stem 1 (labeled S1 in Figure 1 ) at its 5\u2032 end, which leads into loop 1 (L1) followed by stem 2 (S2; Figure 1B ). Stem 3 (S3) forms below stem 1 and folds the RNA structure back on itself by forming the 12-nucleotide long loop 2. Stem 3 leads into loop 3 (L3), which spans the gap between the end of stem 3 and the start of stem 2. Stem 2 forms the long-distance interactions in the pseudoknot, which defines it as an H-type, and ties the 5\u2032 end of the RNA to the 3\u2032 end ( Figure 1B) . 12, 31 Despite the one nucleotide substitution, the SARS-CoV-2 PFSE likely adopts the same conformation as the SARS-CoV-1 PFSE. Computational modeling predicts similar structures for both sequences, and NMR studies show close agreement with the predicted three stem structure in both cases. 8\u221210,31,33\u221235 Small-angle X-ray scattering diffraction analysis by Kelly et al. has shown that the SARS-CoV-1 frameshifting pseudoknot and the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting pseudoknot have nearly identical topology. 33 Functionally, both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots frameshift to appreciable rates in vitro and in cells. 33 Likewise, in both cases, frameshifting is inhibited in the presence of the ligand MTDB, which implies that both PFSEs bind the ligand. 7, 33 This evidence allows us to apply the established research on the SARS-CoV-1 PFSE to this new SARS-CoV-2 PFSE in our investigation of the structure.",

We omitted the spacer and the slippery site sequences from the crystallization construct due to the high flexibility expected for singlestranded regions at the ends of RNAs, which can reduce crystallization efficiency. In this construct, the starting residue, nucleotide 13474, was mutated from U to G to enhance in vitro transcription efficiency. This residue is predicted to be unpaired and is not considered essential for pseudoknot formation. It was unclear whether the final uridine of the pseudoknot sequence (residue 13542) would be paired. 9 To avoid a dangling nucleotide in the construct, which can compromise the crystallization construct rigidity, this nucleotide was excluded from the template sequence. However, upon sequencing RNA extracted directly from the crystal, we found that the construct that crystallized had an untemplated G added to the 3\u2032 end (see below and Supplementary Figure S3 ).

Our lab has found that antibody fragment (Fab) RNA complexes crystallize more readily than RNA alone. In previous work, we reported developing a suite of humanized murine antibody fragments and their cognate RNA motifs, which can be grafted into structured RNA targets to create a Fab binding site. 36, 37 Among these, Fab BL3\u22126 binds to hairpins with the loop sequence (AAACA) closed by a GC pair, which we call the BL3\u22126-binding epitope. The most suitable location to graft the BL3\u22126-binding epitope into the PFSE was loop 2, at the base of stem 3. The SARS-CoV-1 PFSE has been shown to retain wild type levels of frameshifting activity in vitro when loop 2 was replaced with a GUUG tetraloop; therefore we expected that the PFSE structure could tolerate an AAACA pentaloop in the loop 2 position. 14 We refer to this Fab-binding PFSE construct as PFSE BL3\u22126. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), the PFSE BL3\u22126 construct formed a mobility shifted species in the presence of Fab BL3\u22126, suggesting that the grafted sequence formed the expected loop and had not altered the predicted RNA secondary structure as shown in Supporting Informaiton Figure 4 ( Figure S4 ).",

Some crystals were soaked in cryogenic protectant containing iridium hexammine to aid in phasing using anomalous dispersion. These crystals, with and without heavy metal soaking, yielded multiple data sets with the best diffracting to 2.09 \u00c5. To solve the structure, data sets with a strong anomalous signal and low resolution were phased in Phenix using a combination of singlewavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) experimental phasing and molecular replacement using the Fab BL3\u22126 model. 36,38\u221240 An initial electron density map was generated, and a partial model of the RNA was then built in COOT. 41 This partial RNA model and the Fab model were then used to find a molecular replacement solution for a separate high resolution native diffraction data set. This solution gave complete electron density maps. Iterative rounds of building and refinement in this high-resolution data set yielded a complete structure for the PFSE pseudoknot at 2.09 \u00c5 with an R work of 19.93% and an R free of 23.08% (additional statistics reported in Table 1 ).

The SARS-CoV-2 PFSE forms a three-stemmed H-type pseudoknot structure with three loops, consistent with original predictions for the SARS-CoV-1 PFSE by Plant et al. and confirmed as the general secondary structure for the SARS-CoV-2 PFSE more recently. 12, 14, 31 In our structure ( Figure 1C and D), stem 1, shown in green in all figures, begins at the 5\u2032 end and forms between nucleotides 13474 and 13484 on the 5\u2032-side and nucleotides 13493 and 13504 on the 3\u2032-side ( Figure 1C ). Interestingly, the 5\u2032 end of stem 1 threads through the ring created by loop 3 ( Figure 4E and Figure S2 ), a feature inferred from midresolution cryo-EM models (see discussion). 4, 43 The 5\u2032 strand of stem 1 leads into loop 1, colored cyan in all figures, which encompasses nucleotides 13485\u221213488. Within loop 1, nucleotides 13485 and 13486 form interactions with nucleotides 13494 and 13493 of stem 1, respectively. The loop 1 interactions position G13489 for pairing with the 3\u2032 end of the RNA to form stem 2, shown in navy in all figures. Stem 2 is G-rich and comprises nucleotides 13489\u221213492 pairing with nucleotides 13541\u221213537, respectively. The 5\u2032 end of nucleotide 13538 connects to loop 3, shown in magenta or gray when residues lack electron density. Loop 3 encompasses nucleotides 13533\u221213537 and connects the end of stem 2 with stem 3. Stem 3, colored orange in all figures, coaxially stacks below stem 1. Stem 3 encompasses nucleotides 13505\u221213513, which pair with nucleotides 13523 to 13532 with residue 13526 unpaired. This helically stacked three-stemmed structure approximately matches the predicted secondary structure of the PFSE ( Figure 1B ). 12 Nevertheless, we observe several base pairing differences, detectable because of the highresolution data.",

In the helically stacked conformation of the PFSE, loop 1 forms interactions that position the descending strand (in our illustrations) of stem 2 to form the long-distance H-type pseudoknot interaction. Starting from the 5\u2032 end of loop 1, nucleotide U13485, which was predicted to be unpaired (Figure 2A ), forms a water-mediated base-pairing interaction with U13494 in stem 1 involving the O2 keto group and N3 imino group, respectively ( Figure 2D ). Additionally, the N3 imino NH of U13485 donates a hydrogen bond to the O4 keto group of U13494. While U13485 was predicted to be unpaired, nucleotide U13494 was predicted to pair with A13535 as part of stem 2. However, in our structure, U13494 faces inward toward stem 1 and is sandwiched in place by base stacking interactions with G13493 and C13495 ( Figure 2F ). The base pairing between U13494 and U13485 keeps the loop 1 strand close to the core of stem 1, which helps position G13486 to form its interactions.",

We consider this G13486\u2212 G13493\u2212A13537 base triple the transition between stem 1 and stem 2 because G13486 is no longer stacking on the stem 1 helical axis.

C13487's nucleobase plane has rotated relative to the base planes of G13486 and A13488 to run parallel to the helical axis of stem 1 ( Figure 2C ). After the turn at C13487, the ribose-phosphate backbone reverses direction again to allow A13488 to engage in a noncanonical pairing interaction with the 3\u2032-terminal G13542, forming the uppermost base pair of the pseudoknot duplex, stem 2.

A ACS Chemical Biology pubs.acs.org/acschemicalbiology Articles hydrogen bond between G13538's nonbridging phosphate oxygen and the imino NH of G13486 further stabilizes the base triple, in addition to the 2\u2032 OH and G13486 keto group hydrogen bond mentioned previously ( Figure 2E and F). A key difference between the predicted stem 2 and the crystal structure is that nucleotides C13536 and A13535 do not form the predicted base pairs with G13493 and U13494, respectively. Instead, there is clear density showing that G13493 and U13494 direct their Watson\u2212Crick faces away from the central axis of stem 2, leaving C13536 and A13535, which lack clear density, without their predicted pairing partners ( Figure 3D ). We conclude that, in this conformation, stem 2 is shorter than predicted. Although the DNA template used for transcription of the PFSE construct was designed to terminate transcription at nucleotide 13541, the electron density map showed density for an additional 65th nucleotide. As T7 RNA polymerase is known to add untemplated nucleotides to the 3\u2032 terminus of transcripts, we used a simple method to sequence the 3\u2032 ends of in vitro transcribed RNAs extracted from crystals to confirm the presence of an additional nucleotide and reveal its identity. 42 Briefly, the RNA was polyadenylated to create a primer binding site for a poly(T) reverse primer for reverse transcription into cDNA. The resulting cDNA was amplified and sequenced. This not only revealed the identity of the terminal residues but also quantitatively measured the enrichment for each of the four nucleotides randomly added by T7. RNA extracted from washed crystals shows a G predominating after C13541 ( Figure S3 ). By contrast the mother liquor contains transcripts with a mix of G and C ( Figure S3) . The enrichment for G over C in the crystal may be due to the crystal contact involving stacking of G13542 with a mirrored symmetry mate of the RNA. Whether the native U in position 13542 forms a base pair with A13488 remains unclear. 9 The C56A Point Mutation between SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2 PFSEs Forms a Base Triple. Secondary structure predictions and computational models of the PFSE vary in the arrangement of A13533. 9, 10, 34, 35 This residue is often modeled as unpaired in Loop 3 or paired to U13504 in Stem 3. However, in this structure we see clear density for a triple base pair involving G13475, U13504 and A13533 at the S1/S3 junction ( Figure 4C ). Stem 3 ends at a wobble base pair between G13505 and U13532; above this, A13533 breaks away from this helical stack to form a Watson\u2212Crick sugaredge interaction with G13475, which forms a wobble pair with U13504 ( Figure 4C and E). This base triple interaction may help stabilize the vertical arrangement of stem 1/stem 3.",

Loop 3, which connects stems 2 and 3, consists of nucleotides 13533, 13534, 13535, 13536, and 13537 in our structure. Density for residues 13534, 13535, and 13536 is missing from the data sets, suggesting this loop is flexible and not well organized in the crystal ( Figure  3D ). Nevertheless, the 3\u2032 end of A13533 and the 5\u2032 phosphate of A13537, which are well-defined by the electron density, are 44 Single-stranded RNA is expected to be more compact than ssDNA due to steric restraints imposed by the 2\u2032 OH on the sugar pucker conformations. If nucleotides 13534, 13535, and 13536 in loop 3 were fully extended, they would span a maximum distance of 20.1 \u00c5, leaving only \u223c2.7 \u00c5 of slack for bending. In a study of a 40-nucleotide strand of poly(U) RNA, a total contour length of 196 \u00c5 was measured, giving 4.9 \u00c5 as the average length of each nt. 44 In a relaxed state, we would therefore expect three nucleotides to span 14.3 \u00c5, meaning that in spanning 17 \u00c5 the nucleotides in loop 3 are likely extended and less flexible than they would be if their ends were free. We anticipate that the residues in this region likely possess enough flexibility to wiggle back and forth like a short string held at both ends but must maintain a relatively extended backbone conformation to bridge the distance between residues 13533 and 13537. Stem 3 Organization Matches Predictions. The base pairing for stem 3 observed in our structure agrees with the predicted pairing. In previous work, A13526 frequently exhibits sensitivity to chemical modification indicative of a singlestranded nucleotide. 14 We find this residue unpaired and stacked within stem 3 ( Figure 4D ). Previous mutational studies have shown that deletion of A13526 or insertion of a corresponding U to form a base pair both reduce frameshifting efficiency in the SARS-CoV-1 PFSE, suggesting that this residue's unpaired state contributes to the frameshifting mechanism. Nevertheless, complete deletion of stem 3 rescues frameshifting. 14 Often computational modeling predicts that the PFSE is bent at the junction between stem 1 and stem 3, and cryo-EM structures exhibit this bend. 4, [8] [9] [10] 32, 35, 43 Having A13526 unpaired could contribute to the dynamic character of stem 3, facilitating sampling of the bent conformation.",

However, during translation with translocating ribosomes upstream and downstream, the PFSE region would be unfolded and isolated from the rest of the genomic RNA enabling formation of the frameshifting structure. 4, 17, 46 Additionally, the finding that the MTDB can inhibit viral replication and alters the ratios of the conformations the PFSE can adopt suggests that structures adopted by the minimal PFSE element have relevance for viral function. 4, 5 Comparison of our Crystal Structure to cryo-EM Structures. Currently, two midresolution cryo-EM models exist for the PFSE. Both share important features with our model, and the differences may provide hints as to the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting.

The bent conformation of the PFSE and slippery site observed in the solution cryo-EM model (PDB code: 6XRZ) positions the S1/ S2 base triple nucleotides (G13486, G13493, and A13537) too far apart to form the base triple ( Figure 5C ). 43 Additionally, in the ribosome-bound structure, G13486 forms direct interactions with the N-terminal domain of US3 while A13537 remains unpaired in the J2/3 region. 4 Therefore, the S1/S2 base triple we observe would have to be dissolved in the bent conformation and in the ribosome bound state. Interestingly, mutations to G13486 or A13537 in isolation were shown to reduce frameshifting frequency markedly, although the role of A13537 is unknown. 4 The PFSE's intolerance to A13537 mutations combined with these structural observations suggest that G13486 may serve an additional structural role to orient G13493's sugar edge to interact with A13533's WC face. In other \u22121 frameshifting pseudoknots, elimination of known base triple interactions does reduce frameshifting efficiency by destabilizing the pseudoknot. 48 These observations suggest that the S1/S2 base triple may act as a conformational switch or decision point between the bent conformation and the vertical conformation.",

For example, our construct lacks the 5\u2032 slippery site sequence, which forms a helix that coaxially stacks beneath stem 1 in the cryo-EM model. The slippery site helix could preclude formation of the vertically stacked conformation just as the ribosome does. Additionally, recent investigation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome both within the cytoplasm and the virion infers entirely new secondary structures for the PFSE. 11, 47, 58 Rather than frameshifting itself, the vertical conformation observed here could have significance for PFSE structural rearrangements that occur during other stages of the virial lifecycle. Moreover, as there are limited structures available for RNA pseudoknots, the high-resolution structure data presented herein have intrinsic value for the structurebased design of small molecule binders, as a starting point for molecular dynamics simulations, and as a framework for testing the relationship of the RNA structure to its function.",

Crystals grew in 2% v/v tacsimate at pH 4. 0.1 M sodium acetate trihydrate at pH 4.6, and 16% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350 and were further optimized with the addition of either 0.01 M sarcosine or 0.01 M betaine hydrochloride. Crystals appeared and grew to full size within a week at 21\u00b0C. Some crystals were looped and transferred to new drops of a solution containing 80% glycerol and 3 mM MTDB in addition to the original crystallization conditions to incorporate the PFSE ligand. Other crystals were grown in the presence of 10 mol equiv of ligand for each mole of RNA-Fab complex. In neither case was density for the ligand detected in the electron density map. Other crystals were looped and transferred to new drops containing the original crystallization conditions with added 20% glycerol (v/v) and 3 mM iridium hexammine as a cryo-protectant and to incorporate iridium hexammine into the crystal lattice. Iridium hexammine was synthesized in-house following the protocol established by Batey et al. 53 A set of crystals were allowed to incubate for 24 h while another set of crystals were only allowed to incubate for 2 h before looping and freezing. The crystals incubated with iridium hexammine for only 2 h diffracted to higher resolution than those soaked for 24 h.",

Crystals soaked with iridium hexammine were shot with both the default wavelength of 0.979180 and a wavelength of 1.04040 to illicit anomalous diffraction of the iridium. All of the data sets were then integrated and scaled using its on-site RAPD automated programs (https://rapd.nec. aps.anl.gov). Initial SAD-MR phases were obtained from a data set which diffracted to only 3.27 \u00c5 using a partial molecular replacement (MR) solution of the Fab (PDB code: 6DB8) in Phenix Autosol. 38, 40 A low-resolution election density map was able to be calculated for a portion of the RNA from which a partial model of the FSE was built. This partial RNA model was used in addition to the fab model (PDB code: 6DB8) to find a molecular replacement solution for a higher resolution (2.09 \u00c5) data set collected from a native unsoaked crystal. The electron density map using the MR phases of the partial RNA-Fab model were vastly improved and allowed for unambiguous model building nucleotide by nucleotide. 26, 38 The model was iteratively built and refined in COOT and Phenix Refine until the R work and R free could not be further improved. 39\u221241 Water was automatically added during refinement and later validated visually in COOT 41 according to the electron density map and difference map and potential hydrogen bonding interactions. All structure related figures were made in PyMOL 54 (www.pymol.org), and figure labels were edited in Microsoft PowerPoint.",
