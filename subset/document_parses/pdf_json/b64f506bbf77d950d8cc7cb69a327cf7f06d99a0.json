Virtually, every activity today is technology related. In these conditions, scientific activity is also changing. Digitalization processes act as integrative to various scientific directions, which form the base for interdisciplinary scientific research. The study of their formation is an important scientific task aimed at predicting the development of both science and society as a whole. In this study, based on the integrated use of ICTs, we consider methods of the terminology base analysis in various interdisciplinary research directions on the instance of tourism in the digital age. The development of scientific interest in the area of digital tourism in Russian and global scientific discourses is also compared. The purpose of this paper is to proof the relevance of scientific study in the field of tourism digitalization, to identify the generic directions and trends of digital tourism, and to specify technologies for the implementation of digital tourism using the case study of St. Petersburg.",

Manufacturers of tourism services are forced to introduce modern digital technologies, thereby forming a new directiondigital tourism or tourism digitalization within more general directiondigital economy. Although, there is no any unified definition of the term 'digital tourism' yet, scientific and media discourse offers some approaches and a vision of this phenomenon through the digitalization prism. As a result, the primary tasks of modern tourism are formed and reflected in \"The strategy of tourism development till 2035 \" as \"... reaching the level of world leaders in the development of digital infrastructure and services, the development of digital platforms for promoting tourism products and brands, digital navigation aids and the formation of a tourist product\" [41] . The strategy proposes groups of concepts associated with digitalization: digital technologies, digital solutions, and digital services. The analysis of scientific publications allowed determining the basic term-concepts that define the processes of digitalization in tourism: 'digital tourism', 'e-tourism', and 'smart tourism' [22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 42] .",

            "text": "The solution to urban problems can be found through the use of smart city concepts and projects. This decision supports public administration oriented towards the interests of citizens [8, 30] . The implementation of smart city (region) projects requires an architectural approach [1, 7, 43] and involves obtaining a number of results: concepts, principles, architecture (models) of a smart city, as well as areas of urban economy. The technology is a key moment in the smart city development [18] . Figure 1 shows a simplified metamodel of smart city architecture based on the Open Group TOGAF 9.2 standard [34] as applied to digital tourism as one of the urban economy areas. The TOGAF standard takes a holistic approach to enterprise architecture that allows us to see the individual blocks and elements in logic and relationships. The proposed architecture reflects an integrated view of digital tourism that allows classifying studies in this area as interdisciplinary research. Moreover, architecture is a way to identify semantic groups, which will be the base to build the trends reflected the topic and the development dynamic of interdisciplinary direction. M. Kohno, a researcher from Japan, [16] has studied concepts and implementations of smart cities, basing on the main trends characterizing smart city models around the world. As a result of this monitoring, Kohno has concluded that a modern smart city is not just focused on certain technology packages. In fact, this is the city which is a way to create and shape a new society, to solve a problem that limits the life of this community, and to determine a breakthrough into the future.",

Interdisciplinary areas (in fact contexts) are believed to be identified through a thematic search and described quantitatively and qualitatively through various kinds of measurements and procedures. Thus, for instance, K. Okamura, focusing on clusters of highly cited papers widely known as research fronts (RFs), has suggested that interdisciplinarity is statistically significantly and positively associated with research impact by focusing on highly cited paper clusters [32] . C. Carusi and G. Bianchi have applied the quantifying of journals' interdisciplinarity by exploiting relation between scholars and journals where such scholars do publish [4] . J. Raimbault has offered a measurement methodology that combines the analysis of citation networks and semantic analysis, studying the qualitative laws of relations between endogenous disciplines [40] . C. Piciocchi and L. Martinelli have conducted research on the development of categorical-conceptual apparatuses of various scientific areas, where Digital Humanities methods and approaches are used [38] . The paper on the cultural initiatives and the mapping process of governance and participation dynamics involve an abductive reasoning as a pragmatic approach to advancing the social sciences through a process of \"systematic combining\" both the analytical framework and the case studies in order to expand the theoretical and empirical understanding of results [2] . The methodology of research groups [14, 35] consists of data extraction, analytical approach (descriptive analysis and text mining), and machine-learning analysis. G. Par\u00e9, M. C. Trudel, M. Jaana, S. Kitsiou focus the researchers on the preparation as well as analysis of reviews, and develop their own typology of reviews, encouraging authors to use this typology to position their contribution [34] . Gamification studies constitute a significant part of such studies. For instance, Finnish researchers practice intellectual search and analysis of scientific texts in their study, preferring manual data processing [17] . The search strategy of Indonesian authors described in their paper \"The Approach to the Meta-description of the Interdisciplinary Research Terminological Landscape\" consists of \"sorting digital libraries, determining keywords, using existing tools in digital libraries to facilitate the search, and taking primary studies obtained for processing\" [39] .",

[31] , according to the authors, can be classified as a narrative review aimed at analyzing the academic literature linking ICTs and tourism as well as making a critical assessment of its quality. The review was conducted in a traditional, namely, conceptual and chronological manner. From a methodological point of view, the online databases of scientific publications (Web of Science, SciencieDirect) and various combinations of keywords related to e-tourism were used. Since in a number of previous publications the predominant use of scientific articles on tourism was declared as the main limitation of research (which would not correspond to the interdisciplinary nature of the topic under consideration), the authors included journals related to ICTs in the review. In the study, the following review procedure was adopted: at the beginning, the determination of the purpose and scope (period, subject of the review); then the determination of the selection materials' procedure; the adjusting of the source selecting process (manual search and identification of relevance using various combinations of key-words, inclusion of JCR Q1 articles with a significant number of citations in the review); the compilation of the most relevant materials for analysis; the reselection and the review of sources; highlighting of the relevant content with using the multiple coders. Having given the presence of a large number of topics and approaches reflecting the research of the links between ICTs and tourism in recent years, the authors of the paper argue that it was impossible to imply an overview of such a multi-dimensional area as 'smart tourism' without limiting any volume of material.",

[24] have applied such a research methodology as the complex analysis of critical media discourse (CMDA), which is the integration of the analysis of media discourse Carvalho (MDA, 2008) with Fairclough Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA, 1995) methodology research. The CDA approach provides a skeleton framework; while the media discourse analysis framework suggests analytical components for each CDA dimension. CDA includes three various types of analysis: text analysis, processing analysis, and social analysis, which are simultaneous but interdependent. CDA is suitable for the study of social and cultural change because it facilitates the integration of discourse analysis and analysis of macro-contexts. The Carvalho text analysis scheme was applied to the text description. Contextual analysis was used to interpret the processes. The dataset in this work is news, industry reports and reviews, magazine articles, expert reviews, travel advertisements, editorials, and travel notes collected through the Google search engine. The research was conducted using Leximancer software to identify the main concepts and dominant themes in media discourses, followed by manual coding for CMDA. Data collection began with the selection of keywords. As the basic term-concepts and keywords for collecting data from media discourses, the combinations that most often appeared in scientific research were chosen. The definition of basic term-concepts and their relationships is an integral part of discourse analysis, and the vocabulary used to represent a certain phenomenon is an essential component for the explication of meanings. Close attention was paid to the formation of the thesaurus, including the term-concepts found in the headings and first paragraphs of articles in the media. As a result, 94 term-concepts were identified in the work, which were divided into twelve semantic topics. The thesaurus reflected the semantic diversity of the contexts of the materials processed.",

The review used a grounded theory method aimed at exploring a specific phenomenon through an inductive process that generates a theoretical understanding of the phenomenon. The approach is useful for conducting a comprehensive theoretical analysis related to a topic and consists of explaining the target phenomenon in accordance with concepts, categories, and relationships between them.

From the Integrum information system results were obtained from 2010 to 2019 for Russian-language queries: (\"digital tourism\" or \"electronic tourism\") and (\"smart tourism \"or\" smart tourism\"). The results obtained indicate a rather weak interest of the official media in the development of the tourism sector based on the use of information and communication technologies. So, in the period from 2010 to 2019, only 18 publications were identified for the first request, and 17 for the second, with a clearly chaotic spread over the years. The discourse in mass media shows that journal-ists use the terminology of \"digital tourism\" poorly. At the same time, they do not bother to seriously immerse themselves in this topic. Basically, the term \"digital tourism\" or \"smart tourism\" is used once in the title or annotation, and then no terms reflecting the topic of \"digital tourism\" are found in the text.
