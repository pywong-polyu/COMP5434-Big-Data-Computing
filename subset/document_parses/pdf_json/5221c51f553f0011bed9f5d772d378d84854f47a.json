No significant demographic differences existed between the comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group interacted with Ajivar for a mean time of 1424 (SD 1168) minutes. There was a significant decrease in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7: the mean score was 11.47 (SD 1.85) at the start of the study compared to 6.27 (SD 1.44) at the end (P<.001). There was a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression measured by the PHQ-9: the mean score was 10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness Inventory from pretest to posttest. The subgroups in the social awareness and spirituality inventories showed significant improvement in the intervention group. In a subgroup of participants (11/49, 22%) where the GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in anxiety from the start of the study (mean score 11.63, SD 2.16) to mid-March (ie, onset of the pandemic) (mean score 13.03, SD 1.48; P=.23), followed by a significant decrease at the end of the study period (mean score 5.9, SD 1.44; P=.001).",

EI involves a set of learned noncognitive skills, which helps individuals foster better relationships, improve time and stress management, maintain better impulse control, and improve problem-solving abilities [1] [2] [3] . Mindfulness has been defined as the awareness that arises by \"paying attention to the present moment on purpose and non-judgmentally\" [4] . EI and mindfulness can impact the level of anxiety and depression an individual experiences. This is particularly important during stressful times, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ajivar is an app that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to deliver personalized mindfulness and EI training to college students.

The symptoms associated with anxiety and depression often persist over time. More than 75% to 85% of college students have reported feeling stressed and overwhelmed [6] [7] [8] . There are several reasons college students experience disproportionately higher levels of stress than the general population, including first-time independence leading to having to manage their academic responsibilities, financial responsibility, and planning for their future [9, 10] . Despite the prevalence and persistence of anxiety and depression, up to 75% of college students do not access the needed resources and needed assistance, primarily because of the underlying stigma associated with a diagnosis and mental health services [11] . Additionally, colleges and universities have limited resources to aid the large number of students who suffer from mental health conditions.

Not only has this novel pandemic resulted in severe health consequences, but it has also impacted the mental well-being of college students who have struggled with immediate displacement from college, learning online models of course delivery, and having to socially distance from their friends and social support. In a self-reported survey by the Healthy Minds Network during the COVID-19 crisis, college students reported increased mental health concerns (ie, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, etc), which resulted in poor academic performance [13] . Increased frequency of anxiety and depression have been reported among undergraduate students during the pandemic [14, 15] . Initial findings from the pandemic suggest that the mental health consequences will be far reaching. Time will tell the true impact of the social and behavioral changes experienced by college students. Providing novel, scalable, and disruptive tools to help this vulnerable section of the population is going to be important if we are to prevent long-term mental health sequelae from the pandemic.",

EI is not commonly taught in colleges and universities, which can inhibit students' full potential of learning due to lack of coping skills in managing stress, anxiety, and interpersonal relationships. The inability to emotionally self-regulate often leads to psychopathology due to the avoidance of, or preoccupation with, negative emotion [18] and, as a result, may have negative consequences on the individual's health, relationships, and work and school performance [19] . EI acts as a protective factor for mental health and is positively associated with adaptive coping styles, peer relationships, and socioemotional competence [20] .

            "text": "The findings from our study suggest that the use of Ajivar had many positive benefits for the college student participants. These results were especially impactful given that the students experienced the pandemic during the course of the study. We found that students in the intervention group had less depression over time as measured by the PHQ-9, less anxiety as measured by the GAD-7, and improvement in EI as measured by the EQ. Student anxiety increased around mid-March and then decreased significantly by the end of the semester, despite the upheaval caused by the pandemic. Mid-March was the time during the semester when learning was shifted for all students at the university to a remote format. This transition occurred over the course of a few days. Further testing is suggested as the pandemic continues. The subgroups of social awareness and spirituality were significantly improved with the use of the app. There were also areas of no significance, including the pretest and posttest scores of the TestWell Wellness Inventory. We also noted a high engagement rate, with over 60% of users interacting with the Ajivar app for a greater amount of time than was required.",

Technology apps can be used for mental health conditions along with other behavioral issues. Bakker et al found specific recommendations for mental health apps [39] , including the aim to prevent emotional mental health problems. Also, to maximize engagement, it is recommended to use gamification, as was carried out in Ajivar, so that habit formation of self-care practices can take place [39] . Mental health apps have proven to provide positive results and success in a variety of populations. Additional testing is recommended as the pandemic continues. However, the results of this study demonstrate positive outcomes for mental and emotional health, along with a decrease in anxiety and depression levels.
