Neutrophils presumably deploy NETs to trap and kill pathogens (5) ; however, NETs may also be key players in the pathophysiology of thromboinflammatory diseases such as cancer, lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and -based on recent work -COVID-19 (6) (7) (8) . Indeed, our group and others have described high levels of NETs circulating in the blood of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, where they correlate with disease severity (6, (9) (10) (11) (12) .

At the same time, a variety of functional autoantibodies have been observed in individuals with severe COVID-19, where they likely contribute to immunopathology. Here, we aimed to determine the extent to which autoantibodies might target NETs in COVID-19 and, if detected, to elucidate their potential functions and clinical associations. We measured anti-NET antibodies in 328 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 alongside 48 healthy controls. We found high anti-NET activity in the IgG and IgM fractions of 27% and 60% of patients, respectively. There was a strong correlation between anti-NET IgG and anti-NET IgM. Both anti-NET IgG and anti-NET IgM tracked with high levels of circulating NETs, impaired oxygenation efficiency, and high circulating D-dimer. Furthermore, patients who required mechanical ventilation had a greater burden of anti-NET antibodies than did those not requiring oxygen supplementation. Levels of anti-NET IgG (and, to a lesser extent, anti-NET IgM) demonstrated an inverse correlation with the efficiency of NET degradation by COVID-19 sera. Furthermore, purified IgG from COVID-19 sera with high levels of anti-NET antibodies impaired the ability of healthy control serum to degrade NETs. In summary, many individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 have anti-NET antibodies, which likely impair NET clearance and may potentiate SARS-CoV-2-mediated thromboinflammation.",

Utilizing a unique ELISA platform that we developed ( Figure  1A ), we measured anti-NET IgG and IgM antibodies in 328 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 alongside 48 healthy controls. The clinical characteristics of these patients are described in Table 1 . Elevated levels of anti-NET IgG and IgM were detected in patients with COVID-19 as compared with healthy controls ( Figure 1 , B and C). Based on a threshold set at 2 SDs above the control mean, 89 COVID-19 patients (27%) had high anti-NET IgG activity, while 197 (60%) had high anti-NET IgM activity. We also noted a strong correlation between anti-NET IgG and anti-NET IgM (r = 0.4; P < 0.0001) (Supplemental Figure 1 ; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.150111DS1). Beyond the ELISA platform, we also assessed anti-NET activity by immunofluorescence microscopy. When paraformaldehyde-fixed NETs were incubated with sera from COVID-19 patients with high levels of anti-NET IgG, antibodies robustly decorated NET strands ( Figure 1D ). We had sufficient sera available to test antiphospholipid antibodies in 171 COVID-19 patients. Positive correlations were noted between anti-NET IgG/IgM, anticardiolipin IgG/IgM, and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin IgG/IgM. Anti-NET IgM was also weakly correlated with anti-\u03b2-2 glycoprotein I IgM (Supplemental Table 1 ).

(C) Freshly induced NETs were also incubated with control serum supplemented with purified IgG from either COVID-19 patients or controls, and percent residual NETs was determined for each sample after 90 minutes. Some samples were treated with Micrococcal nuclease as a positive control. Untreated NETs (no serum) acted as negative control. Percent residual NETs was normalized to the mean of untreated NETs. COVID-19 IgG was compared with control by 1-way ANOVA, with correction for multiple comparisons by Dunnett's method; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001. with COVID-19 serum samples diluted to 5% in nuclease buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 50 mM NaCl). In some experiments, NETs were incubated with healthy control serum diluted to 5% in nuclease buffer and supplemented with COVID-19 or control IgG at a final concentration of 500 \u03bcg/mL. Each sample was tested in triplicate. MNase-treated (10 U/mL) wells served as the positive control. Following the 90-minute incubation, the serum-containing supernatants were discarded, and PBS was added to each well. To quantify residual NETs, SYTOX fluorescence was again measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 504 nm and 523 nm using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek). The schematic illustration of the NET degradation assay in Figure 4 was created with BioRender.com.",

Specifically, anti-NET IgG and IgM both demonstrated positive correlations with D-dimer, neutrophil count, and platelet count, while showing negative correlations with oxygenation efficiency. To determine associated clinical status, we compared serum samples of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 140) with patients with oxygen saturation \u2265 94% on room air (n = 69). As compared with patients breathing room air, patients requiring mechanical ventilation had significantly higher levels of anti-NET IgG and IgM (Figure 3, E and F). In summary, anti-NET IgG and IgM levels track with various measures of COVID-19 severity. Most notably, they are associated with impaired oxygenation efficiency and requirement for mechanical ventilation.",

The correlation was relatively stronger for anti-NET IgG (r = 0.39, P = 0.0009) than for anti-NET IgM (r = 0.27, P = 0.023). To further confirm the relationship between anti-NET IgG and NET degradation, total IgG was purified from 4 COVID-19 patients with high anti-NET IgG and supplemented into healthy control serum. These were tested alongside IgG pooled from healthy controls.
