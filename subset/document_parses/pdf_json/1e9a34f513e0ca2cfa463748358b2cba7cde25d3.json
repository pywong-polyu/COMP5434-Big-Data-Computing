Design A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and reflexive thematic analysis. Setting Seven medical disciplines (general dermatology, dermato-oncology, head and neck oncology, internal medicine, medical oncology, gynaecological oncology and surgical oncology) at a large university hospital in the Netherlands. Participants Patients who received and HCPs who provided TCs as a substitute for outpatient follow-up appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Eighty-two patients and 58 HCPs were interviewed. Predominantly, patients and HCPs were satisfied with the quality of care by TCs. They regarded TCs as efficient, accessible and of acceptable quality, provided there was an established patient-HCP relationship, medical complaints were absent and physical examination was not indicated. However, most patients were worried about the accuracy of their health assessment in the absence of physical examination and non-verbal communication. Both patients and HCPs wish to use TCs in the future alternatively with face-to-face consultations. Conclusion This study concludes that TCs seem a valuable contribution to the context of follow-up care and could partially replace face-to-face consultations. TCs can be performed in stable, chronic patients with whom a doctor-patient relationship has already been established. Face-to-face consultations are considered more appropriate in the case of new patients, challenging or emotionally charged consultations and when clinically relevant physical examination is indicated. Due to the context-dependent nature of experiences of patients and HCPs, TCs should be used with an individually customised approach based on patient and disease specifics, in which shared decision-making plays an extensive role. Before major implementation is considered, sufficient data on the safety regarding missed diagnoses or cancer recurrences should be assembled first.",

Regarding chronic and non-life-saving care, a difficult trade-off had to be made between the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and the necessity for a physical hospital visit to assure adequate patient follow-up care. This drove innovation in ways in which follow-up care was provided. One of these ways was by means of telephone consultations (TCs).",

[2] [3] [4] In patient surveys, the possibility of fair communication, 5 high patient satisfaction and confidence in its quality were reported. 6 7 The absence of travel costs and benefits of time saving for patients have consistently been identified as predominantly important benefits compared with face-to-face consultations (FtFCs). 4 8 9 Although TCs were increasingly used for low-risk conditions in the primary care setting, TCs were never harnessed on a large scale in secondary and tertiary care. 10 Concerns about ensuring patient safety by negotiations of clinical risk, uncertainty of diagnosis without performing physical examination, 11 impact on workload faced by healthcare professionals (HCPs), 12 lack of financial compensation for HCPs and legal restrictions and insurance issues 13 14 impeded implementation. Therefore, evidence on the quality and safety of TCs remained narrow. Studies replacing FtFCs with TCs are considered ethically questionable because of the fear of negative outcome on survival. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the abrupt replacement of nearly all face-to-face follow-up care and naturally realised this experiment.",

In a survey study by Kadakia et al, 27 patients with cancer appraise both the pragmatic and symbolic aspects of physical examination, which confirms our findings that especially oncological patients are more likely to value physical examination: a decreased sense of reassurance is directly associated with reduced perceived quality of care. For this specific group, the benefits of TCs did not outweigh the value of being able to physically attend a follow-up appointment, shining a new light on the literature thus far. In addition, some HCPs in our study mentioned using physical examination for reassurance of patients rather than for diagnostics. The role of physical examination therefore seems ambiguous for both HCP and patient. Nevertheless, reassurance seems to play a crucial role, especially in oncological care, and yet seems to be better accomplished face-to-face. We discovered that purely the option for an FtFC after a TC contributes to the reassurance of both patient and HCP.",

To ensure efficiency, proper and adequate selection of patients in whom a TC is most likely to be successful, is therefore crucial.",

In our study, however, many patients and HCPs preferred FtFCs, and provided reasons and explanations, which amplified the complementary value of a qualitative approach. Harris and Brown 35 empathise that consensus and consistency statistics are generally weak between these two research methods. Qualitative research enables a deeper, more layered, analysis that addresses topics that would be missed, never addressed or underestimated by questionnaire exploration. An example of this depth are patients mentioning to feel a greater responsibility to appear better verbally in a TC. Also, the expression of lower job satisfaction with performing TCs by several HCPs and the lack of human-to-human interaction during TCs demonstrates the added value of this study's approach.",

The use of validated concepts for the qualitative analysis ensured that discussed subjects were relevant to patients and HCPs. The involuntary character of this experiment can be seen as a strength regarding exploring the experiences with TCs: many patients admitted that after an initial hesitation or resistance they eventually concluded to be convinced of TCs. For example, Beaver et al 33 noticed a preference for clinical examination and FtFCs as reasons for refusal of participating in their study, leading to a highly selected population biased towards patients favouring TCs. This might explain the difference with our results and highlights our added value compared with previous studies. The rapid setup provided in-depth information about the participants' first experiences, and presented limitations: participants were aware that TCs were performed for their own safety and were therefore possibly more accepting than in non-pandemic times. In addition, interviews were conducted by inexperienced interviewers, which, despite interview training sessions and using a shared topic list, could have resulted in varying interview quality. However, with our large population information power appeared strong and it is unlikely that this has led to missing relevant information. The majority of the specialties (5/7) concerned oncological related care, which resulted in a less diverse multidisciplinary approach. Lastly, it is important to mention that safety has not been investigated in this study, at best the perceived feeling of safety has been explored.",

This hybrid form can be flexibly used to provide tailored care for the individual. One could consider the use of TC as a low-threshold screening instrument. For some patients, this 'screening TC' may lead to an additional FtFC to still perform physical examination. In others, efficiency is increased for both patient and HCP as TC appears to be sufficient and FtFC can be postponed.",
