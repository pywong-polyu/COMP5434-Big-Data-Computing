The present study aimed to assess how the forced use of the mask influenced the communication before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods. An online questionnaire was administered including two socio-demographic items, such as sex, as male and female, and role, as nurse or patient, and the Quality of Communication Questionnaire (QOC) for twice, referring to the period before and during the pandemic. Results. 178 subjects participated in the study, of which 60 (33.7%) were patients and 118 (66.3%) were nurses. During the pandemic, patients reported no significant differences in the perception of the quality of nurse-patient communication. While nurses recorded a lower perception of communication quality during the pandemic period than before. Conclusions. The patient willingly accepted the use of the face mask unlike nurses considered it a further obstacle to an effective communication between nurse-patient. However, it could be considered the emotional and caring overload that each nurse had stored during the Covid-19 pandemic, in addition to the fear of contagion that had gripped the lives of nurses on a daily basis.",

Therefore, the literature suggests how important is a nursing approach based on the medical nature of the patient (16) and on effective communication between nurse-patient, capable of influencing the quality of the services received and the perception of one's own pathology (17, 18) . However, evidence suggested that many nurse-patient communication approaches depend heavily on the personal characteristics of nurses, as well as on their levels of education and not on a common standard that all nurses possess in basic patient communication skills (19, 20) . If we add to all this the condition of health emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the forced use of the face mask as an individual protection device for the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the question that arises spontaneously is: how is the quality of communication between nurses-patients perceived during the period of the pandemic? And therefore, the use of the face mask has negatively influenced the nurse-patient communication especially because the use of this device has considerably reduced the messages deriving from the non-verbal communication channel?",

Surely, the expected data would have included greater differences in the perception of the quality of nurse-patient communication considering the point of view of patients, even before that of nurses. From the recorded data, however, no significant difference was highlighted in the perception of the quality of communication by patients: the latter in fact did not report different data in their assessments in the two periods, therefore it could be inferred that the patient's face mask was not considered a barrier in the therapeutic communication with the nurse. On the other hand, nurses recorded significant differences in many aspects of the perception of the quality of communication with the patient, especially regarding the aspects inherent in the explanation and discussion of therapeutic communication. For nurses, the face mask was considered a barrier, an impediment to effective communication with the patient. In the literature studies comparable to this both for purpose and method were not available, therefore the present study could be considered as pilot in this sense. On the other hand, in the literature, there were multiple studies that emphasized the importance for nurses of non-verbal communication as a learning method for more information about the patient, especially essential in the treatment of patients in an emergency regime (23) (24) (25) . This channel of communication was absolutely irrelevant in the period of the pandemic due to the forced use of the face mask. Therefore, there was inherently a physical barrier to non-verbal communication which allowed less information to be collected about the patient. Furthermore, the period of the pandemic has been described by numerous studies as a period of additional work overload for nurses (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) compared to normal conditions (31) and certainly this situation has even less predisposed the nurse to listening and therapeutic communication. In this regard, an Iranian study (32) reported that the job dissatisfaction, the routine-centered care and the trust to nurses from patient views were the most frequent barriers to effective communication (33, 34) . Furthermore, other concomitant factors that did not favor the quality of nurse-patient communication were reported in the overburdening of nursing work and subsequent fatigue, as well as the limited availability of time available to communicate with patients (25, 35) . In light of what has been reported in the literature, data recorded in this study could therefore find an explanation for all this: nurses certainly during the pandemic were experiencing an unprecedented work overload (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) and, therefore, found it more difficult to communicate with their patients due to increasingly longer scarce and the physical barrier of the face mask which made communication even more difficult. In support of this, there was another aspect contemplated in the literature (36) : in emergency conditions, nurses attributed greater importance to the care of the patient's physicality, of his disease, not worrying in the least about the relational aspect that would require more time to layout. Therefore, it was evident from the causes described in the literature that they could be directly correlated with the data reported in the present study that nurses perceived the face mask as an impediment, a barrier to effective communication with their patients. On the other hand, the patient did not report any difficulties, perhaps because it was strictly connected to the state of necessity that the mask had in itself in this period of the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the difficulties exposed by nurses for communication could be connected to the level of emotional and physical overload that the nurse was experiencing during this pandemic period (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) .",

Although, data were collected only online and there was no form of iteration with the participants, both for nurses and patients. Furthermore, the major flaw of this study was the sampling and retroactive evaluation of mask less communication, which might have been influenced by patients' memories in their hospital stay on the one hand and by the daily experience of nurses, on the other hand. However, the study, albeit with some limitations, helped to highlight a further factor present in nurse-patient communication, such as the forced use of the face mask. Additionally, it could be considered the emotional and caring overload that each nurse had stored during the Covid-19 pandemic, in addition to the fear of contagion that had gripped the lives of nurses on a daily basis. In this regard, therefore, it would be useful if since university training there was greater attention to nursing training in the management of health emergencies in order to better prepare future nurses who might face such emergency situations (37, 38) .",
