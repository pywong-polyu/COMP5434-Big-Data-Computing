The results show that positive rate of IgG antibody against receptor-binding domain of spike protein (RBD-IgG) to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors exceeded 70% for 12 months post diagnosis. The level of RBD-IgG decreases with time, with the titer stabilizing at 64.3% of the initial level by the 9th month. Moreover, male plasma donors produce more RBD-IgG than female, and age of the patients positively correlates with the RBD-IgG titer. A strong positive correlation between RBD-IgG and neutralizing antibody titers is also identified. These results facilitate our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced immune memory to promote vaccine and therapy development.",

In the patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), the specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 can last for an average of 2 years, with the positive rate and titer of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies significantly reduced at the third year.

Similar to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via the binding with S protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 3 , which is expressed on the surface of human alveolar epithelial cells, small intestinal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells 4 . SARS-CoV-2 S protein has an approximate size of 180 kDa, consisted of S1 and S2 subunits, the former of which contains ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD, amino acid residues 331-524) 5 . Anti-RBD IgG (RBD-IgG) titers have been shown to be strongly and positively correlated with virus neutralization 6 . Although highly homologous amino acid sequences are shared between the RBD regions of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, the plasma of convalescent SARS patients or SARS-CoV-1 RBD monoclonal antibodies could not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, indicating the limited crossneutralization protection between these two viruses 5, 7 . Nevertheless, successful convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 patients has been reported: The symptoms of 10 severe COVID-19 patients who received 200 mL of convalescent plasma containing high-titer neutralizing antibody were significantly improved or even completely disappeared within 3-7 days 8 .",

According to a longitudinal study, though both IgM and IgA antibodies are produced early within 1 week after symptom onset, IgM reaches the peak at the 10th-12th days but the level subsequently decreases after 18 days, while IgA response persists at a higher level for a longer time period, reaching the peak at the 20th-22nd days 9 . On the contrary, the level of IgG antibody keeps increasing for 3 weeks after symptom onset, declines after 8 weeks, while remains detectable over 8 months 1, 10, 11 . However, the antibody response and neutralizing activity in COVID-19 convalescent patients up to 12 months are still unclear. For preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2, as well as the vaccine development, the duration of functional neutralizing antibody response after individual infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the protective immunity for reinfection are necessary to be investigated by a long-term study. Therefore, we aim to investigate the RBD-IgG response of convalescent COVID-19 patients for up to 12 months. In this study, a total of 1782 convalescent plasma samples from 869 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors are tested for the presence and titers of RBD-IgG, which is proved to be positively associated with neutralizing antibody titers. In addition, influences of other factors (gender, age, and blood type) on the kinetics of RBD-IgG responses are analyzed. Our finding is critical for assessing the durability of the protective immunity induced by COVID-19 vaccines and predicting the future trend of COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Sustained RBD-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. In order to study the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-IgG responses in convalescent COVID-19 patients, 1,782 plasma samples obtained from 869 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors in Wuhan are analyzed. All the samples are collected within 12 months after diagnosis. The presence and titers of RBD-IgG in the plasma samples are tested by using a CE-marked SARS-CoV-2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit 12 . Figure 1A shows the positive rate of RBD-IgG in the convalescent plasma donors at different time points within 12 months after diagnosis. Specifically, a total of 390 plasma samples from plasma donors at the 1st and 2nd months after diagnosis (defined as the early stage following diagnosis) are tested, and the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-IgG is 94.6% (the RBD-IgG titer is 1:80 or higher). At the 6th and 7th months after diagnosis (defined as the middle stage following diagnosis) and the 11th and 12th months after diagnosis (defined as the late stage following diagnosis), the positive rates of RBD-IgG are 89.4% and 81.2%, respectively. The titers of RBD-IgG are categorized as 1:80 (the actual value range is greater than or equal to 80 but less than 160), 1:160 (the actual value range is greater than or equal to 160 but less than 320), 1:320 (the actual value range is greater than or equal to 320 but less than 640), 1:640 (the actual value range is greater than or equal to 640 but less than 1280), 1:1280 (the actual value range is greater than or equal to 1280 but less than 2560) and 1:2560 (the actual value range is greater than or equal to 2560). Titers less than 1:80 are considered as negative, 1:80-1:160 as low titers, 1:320-1:640 as moderate titers, and 1:1280 and \u2265 1:2560 as high titers 13 . As shown in Fig. 1B , the proportion of higher titers displays a time-dependent downward trend, while the proportion of negative titers shows the opposite. Specifically, the proportions of plasma samples with moderate and high titers of RBD-IgG are 72.6%, 41.3%, and 27.2% at the early, middle, and late stages following diagnosis, respectively (Supplementary Table 1 ). It should be noted that even at the early stage following diagnosis, the titers of RBD-IgG in 5.4% of the convalescent plasma donors are at a level (<1:80) (Supplementary Table 1 ), which might be attributed to the failure of antibody production during infection or the low sensitivity of the method for antibody detection. As expected, at the late stage following diagnosis, the proportion of negative titers is increased to 18.8% (Supplementary Table 1 ).",

It shows that the plasma donors with higher initial titers remained faster RBD-IgG attenuation (Fig. 3A) . Interestingly, after a long period of time, the RBD-IgG titers of the plasma donors with higher initial titers are still higher than those with lower initial titers. From the 1st-2nd month to the 10th-11th month, the RBD-IgG titer is decreased by 71.4% to a GMT of 207 in the 237 plasma donors (Fig. 3A ). Additionally, we analyze the changes of RBD-IgG titers in plasma donors stratified by the initial titers from the early stage to the 10th and 11th months. As shown in Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table 2 , 51.67% of the low-titer population turn into negative after a long period of time, while 60.75% of the moderate-titer population and 54.29% of the high-titer population are decreased by one titer grade.

Most COVID-19 vaccine candidates employ the same antigen(s) of the original SARS-CoV-2, implying that the type and kinetics of neutralizing antibody response induced by vaccination are similar to those induced by the original live virus 21 . On the other hand, it has been reported that IgA and IgM antibodies are produced and reduced at the early stage of infection 9 , raising concerns on the sustainable neutralizing activity of the patients' plasma. As a consequence, the long-term study of neutralizing antibody response in convalescent patients is essential to offer powerful support on developing COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. At present, the longest observation period for SARS-CoV-2 antibody reaction kinetics is only several months 13,22-25 , whereas no study has been carried out for more than 1 year time period. The titer of anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies shows an overall decreasing trend over time, while several factors may accelerate the attenuation of anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies. In a 6-month follow-up of COVID-19 patients in Paris, non-severe clinical presentation was found to be the only factor associated with the faster decay of IgG anti-spike antibodies 26 . However, the correlation between the titer change of neutralizing antibodies and clinical symptoms was not significant. Another 9-month study conducted in Wuhan showed that the titers of neutralizing antibody were not significantly decreased, regardless of symptoms 27 . Dispinseri et al. also reported that COVID-19 severity at disease onset of multiple co-morbidities cannot affect the kinetics and persistence of neutralizing antibodies 28 .",

Therefore, we further correlate such factors of the COVID-19 plasma donors with their RBD-IgG titers, and find that the titer of RBD-IgG in male plasma donors is significantly higher than that in female plasma donors at the early stage following diagnosis. Consistent with previous reports, the positive correlation between age and RBD-IgG titer in a population of plasma donors aged 18 to 55 years indicates that elder plasma donors might develop antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 more effectively than younger ones 14 . Nevertheless, no significant correlation is identified between the blood type of the patients and their RBD-IgG titers, indicating that although individuals with A blood type are associated with higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is not related to RBD-IgG titers.

In addition, the RBD-IgG titers of male plasma donors are higher than those of female plasma donors at the initial stage of infection, meanwhile, age is positively correlated with the RBD-IgG titers. Furthermore, we confirm the positive association between RBD-IgG and neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, this study provides long-term strong support for the duration of protection by neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 plasma donors, indicates the potential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, and illustrates the role of neutralizing antibodies in clinical research and development evaluation of vaccines.",
