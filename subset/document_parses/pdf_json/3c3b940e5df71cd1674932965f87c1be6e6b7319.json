Applying platform optimization strategies, we tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity and protective effect of a candidate DNA plasmid vaccine specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The DNA vaccine induced spike-specific binding IgG and neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and rhesus macaques together with robust Th1 dominant cellular responses in small animals. Intradermal and intramuscular needle-free administration of the DNA vaccine yielded comparable immune responses. In a vaccination-challenge study of rhesus macaques, the vaccine demonstrated protection from viral replication in the lungs following intranasal and intratracheal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, the candidate plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is immunogenic in different models and confers protection against lung infection in nonhuman primates. Further evaluation of this DNA vaccine candidate in clinical trials is warranted.",

Inducing both broad antibody and cellular immune responses, DNA vaccines have the potential to reduce both infection and disease. Intrinsically, the DNA vaccines are stable and can be freeze-dried, allowing for long-term storage at ambient temperature 4 .

This was compounded by the application of the platform to complex pathogens where the correlates of protection are undefined and where other traditional vaccines have similarly failed, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, continued platform optimization has seen to the improved performance of DNA vaccines in nonhuman primates and man. For example, a candidate Zika virus DNA vaccine protected rhesus macaques against viremia following Zika virus challenge and induced neutralizing antibody titers >300 when delivered intramuscularly with the needle-free Stratis Device (Pharma-Jet\u00ae) 6, 7 . A different flavivirus DNA vaccine, targeting West Nile virus, is FDA approved for horses but also induced T cell and neutralizing antibody responses in humans 8 . Furthermore, an influenza trivalent DNA vaccine conferred protection against influenza challenge in a phase 1b clinical trial 9 and, through cellmediated immunity, a human papillomavirus DNA vaccine aided the regression of lesions and viral clearance in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-3 patients 10 .",

The human codon optimized nucleotide sequence was subcloned into the NTC8685-eRNA41H (Fig. 1a) , a nano-plasmid eukaryotic expression vector approved for clinical use 17 . Considerations for the vector design are described in detail elsewhere 12 . Notable features of this vector backbone include: (i) the lack of any antibiotic resistance genes to improve DNA vaccine safety 15 ; (ii) improved transgene expression over vectors containing antibiotic resistance genes 18 ; (iii) co-expression of a RIG-I agonist that facilitates a type 1 interferon response and increases DNA vaccine-induced antibody and cellular responses 14 ; and (iv) a reduced size (3.6 kb). NTC8685-eRNA41H has an established toxicity and bio-distribution profile and a documented history of testing in humans with other vaccine-gene inserts 17 . In order to demonstrate expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encoded by this optimized vector, we generated highly specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting the S1-or S2-domain of SARS-CoV-2 using hybridoma technology. Based on a stringent selection procedure, mAbs S1-1047 and S2-1254 were obtained that showed an excellent specificity against their respective target domain and no cross-reactivity against the related spike proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or any of the four Coronaviruses pathogenic to humans ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ).",

The spike protein fragment sizes correspond to that observed by others and reflect the glycosylation of the full-length spike protein and its S1 and S2 subunits with all fragments migrating higher than the predicted 141 kDa, 77 kDa/, and 65 kDa, respectively 19 . Additional fragments of <100 kDa may be cleavage products produced by other cellular proteases such as cathepsin B and L, elastase, and trypsin, which have been demonstrated to cleave coronavirus spike proteins 20, 21 , although this warrants further characterization. The cellular distribution of expressed proteins from pNTC-Spike was visualized with immunofluorescence staining of Vero E6 cells 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 1c) . SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and S2 labeling with mAbs S1-1047 and S2-1254, respectively, showed cytoplasmic distribution for both proteins as reported 22 .",

These filial generation hybrid mice are a cross between C57BL/6 males and BALB/c females. With the parental strains each biased towards Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively, the cross confers a balanced Th1/Th2 responsiveness in the CB6F1 mice. The animals were immunized with either pNTC-Spike, in 10 \u00b5g (N = 5) or 50 \u00b5g (N = 5) doses, or vector control in a 50 \u00b5g dose (N = 5) without adjuvant at weeks 0, 2, and 4 by intradermal injection (Fig. 2a) . Both 10 \u00b5g and 50 \u00b5g doses of pNTC-Spike elicited IgG responses specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain and receptor-binding domain (RBD) after the second immunization (week 4), which were further boosted by a subsequent immunization in a dose-dependent manner (week 6) ( Fig. 2b) . At week 6, the median end-point titer of antibodies specific for the spike ectodomain were 1547 (range: and 9887 (range: 167-27922) for the 10 \u00b5g and 50 \u00b5g group, respectively. All animals that developed spike-and RBD-specific binding IgG by ELISA also developed neutralizing antibodies as determined at week 6 in a SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralization assay (Fig. 2c) . Neutralizing antibody titers directly correlated with spike binding antibody titers (Spearman r = 0.758, P = 0.015) and RBD binding antibody titers (Spearman r = 0.818, P = 0.006). The limited volume of serum obtained from animals after the first and second immunization precluded an evaluation of neutralizing antibody responses at week 2 and week 4.",

New Zealand white rabbits (10 weeks old) received three immunizations of 125 \u00b5g DNA without adjuvant at weeks 0, 2, and 4 by the intradermal route using needle-and-syringe injection intradermal (N = 3) or the PharmaJet\u00ae Tropis ID device (N = 4) or via the intramuscular route using the PharmaJet\u00ae Stratis IM device (N = 5; Fig. 3a ) in separate experiments. While calibrated for human use, the devices deliver liquid to the skin (Tropis ID) and muscle (Stratis IM) of rabbits as determined empirically using a liquid dye (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Overall, needle-free administration of the vaccine via the intradermal and intramuscular route induced comparable binding IgG and neutralizing antibody responses that were higher and more consistent than intradermal injection using needle and syringe (Figs. 3b and 3c).",

The SARS-CoV-2 virus was measured in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and nasal swabs using an RT-PCR specific for subgenomic messenger RNA (sgmRNA), which are viral RNA intermediates believed to represent replicating virus [23] [24] [25] . The sham controls had a median peak of 3.74 log 10 sgmRNA copies/ mL in BAL (range: 2.5-4.03; Fig. 5a ), which is consistent with a 4-5 log 10 sgmRNA copies/mL peak observed in other studies conducted at the same facility with the same challenge dose and virus strain [26] [27] [28] . The vaccinated animals had a 2.04 log 10 reduction in viral RNA in BAL. In particular, five out of six animals had viral loads below the quantitation limit of the assay (1.69 log 10 sgmRNA copies/mL), one animal had a detectable low positive measure of 1.91 log 10 sgmRNA copies/mL on one time point, day 4 post-challenge.

The variants tested depending on the viral isolates available at the facilities where the animal studies were conducted. In rabbits, for all vaccine administration methods, pNTC-spike induced crossreactive neutralizing antibodies against the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants in 91.7%, 66.7%, and 91.7% of vaccinated animals, respectively. With the optimized needlefree intradermal and intramuscular administrations, crossneutralizing antibody responses increased to 100%, 77.7%, and 100%, respectively. Overall, the neutralization titers for the Alpha variant (median: 139, range: 5-136) and Delta variant (median: 108, range: 5-688) did not differ significantly from the early pandemic strain (median: 166, range: 10-275; p > 0.05 for both comparisons). However, the neutralization titers against the Beta variant (median: 27, range: 5-136) were reduced 6.1-fold (p = 0.0001).

The candidate DNA vaccine is immunogenic in three different animal species, with a relatively small difference between smaller animals and nonhuman primates. The increased potency in nonhuman primates is likely attributed to a combination of improved vector design, optimization of antigen expression, and vaccine delivery through needle-free jet injection. Of note, the vaccine was equally immunogenic following administration, either intradermal or intramuscular, using needle-free jet delivery and were both superior to needle-and-syringe injection intradermal.

The macaque monkey is considered a suitable model for studying SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection 23, 29, 30 . The animal species are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and develops virus-specific humoral and cellular immunity that may confer protection against subsequent infection. Na\u00efve animals develop a systemic infection with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper and lower airways 23, 30 . The disease course is generally mild and self-limiting, although pathological evidence of pneumonia is observed. Several, including now approved, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have undergone evaluation in nonhuman primates. These include inactivated vaccines (PiCoVacc and BBIBP-CorV) 31, 32 , viral vectored vaccines (ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S) 26, 33 , mRNA vaccines (mRNA1273 and BNT162b2) 34 , DNA vaccines (INO-4800 and prototypes) 27, 28 , and a subunit vaccine (NVX-CoV3273) 35 . pNTC-Spike is one of three similar SARS-CoV-2 spike DNA vaccine candidates tested in rhesus macaques to date. The other includes a prototype vaccine expressing unmodified full-length wild-type spike (S) from within pcDNA3.1 + (a vector not approved for clinical use) 28 and Inovio's INO-4800 vaccine that comprises a clinical plasmid vector (pGX0001) encoding the fulllength spike with an N-terminal IgE leader sequence and delivers intramuscularly by electroporation 27 . These vaccines were independently evaluated at the same nonhuman primate facility using the same challenge strain and challenge dose. The three DNA vaccines, administered intramuscular or intradermal, as two or three doses of 1-5 mg (without adjuvant) 2-4 weeks apart, all induced SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific immune responses in rhesus macaques and conferred protection against lower respiratory disease. Protection was not sterilizing, but likely the result of rapid control of viremia following challenge, as suggested by anamnestic antibody responses in protected prototype S and INO-4800 vaccinated animals 27, 28 . In the present study, a 2 week interval between immunizations was deemed necessary to address the urgency for rapid vaccination during the pandemic; however, longer immunization intervals may likely increase immunogenicity and protection [36] [37] [38] . The previously reported SARS-CoV-2 plasmid DNA vaccines tested in nonhuman primates were well tolerated and none resulted in vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) 27, 28 . Moreover, pNTC-Spike induced comparable antibody responses in small animals and nonhuman primates. These data support the known excellent safety profile of DNA vaccines and demonstrate that different SARS-CoV-2 spike DNA vaccines are immunogenic under various conditions without any adjuvants.",

            "text": "All SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulations tested in nonhuman primates have conferred a substantial degree of protection to the immunized animals; however, sterilizing immunity was rarely achieved 26 . The common outcome, which extends to DNA vaccines, is a reduction of disease severity marked by lower viral loads, shorter duration of virus shedding, and reduced pathology in the lungs compared to control animals. The correlates of protection against infection and disease are currently unknown. Preliminary analyses suggest an important role for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in vaccine protection 26, 28 . However, current macaque-challenge studies are insufficiently powered to conclude with confidence that NAbs levels at the time of challenge determine the outcome. Due to differences in neutralization assays used in the various vaccine studies, it is difficult to precisely compare NAb levels induced by the different vaccines; however, there is a trend towards other DNA vaccines inducing lower NAb titers compared to viral vectored vaccines, mRNA vaccines, and subunit vaccines 39 . Nevertheless, DNA vaccines were similarly efficacious to the majority of their counterparts in protecting vaccinated nonhuman primates against lower respiratory disease from SARS-CoV-2. This suggests either that low neutralizing antibody responses are sufficient or that other immune mechanisms such as cellular immunity or antibody Fc-mediated effector functions contribute to protection. Considering the presence of neutralizing antibodies following two immunizations with pNTC-Spike in rhesus macaques, we speculate that the DNA vaccine candidate may confer partial protection after two immunizations.",

Furthermore, pNTC-Spike vaccinated rhesus macaques did not demonstrate enhanced viral replication or clinical disease but complete or near-complete protection in BAL samples likely mediated by rapid immunological control of viral replication. To date, all approved and protective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have a similar Th1-biased response 43 , and none of the human SARS-CoV-2 vaccines clinical trials testing nucleic acid vaccines, including mRNA and needle-free delivered plasmid DNA, has reported VAERD. On the contrary, these approved nucleic acid vaccines proved protective against disease [44] [45] [46] [47] .",
