She had generalized tonic-clonic seizure with multiple injuries. She had no previous or family history of seizure but she had generalized anxiety disorder and was doing well on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed theta waves background (likely post-ictal discharges). Magnetic resonance Imagining (MRI) Brain showed features of focal cerebritis on both the frontal lobes. She was started with anti-epileptic drug. After 6 weeks, repeat MRI Brain and EEG were completely normal.",

About one week prior to ictus, she was discharged from another hospital with the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to the eye witness, she had a sudden up-rolling of eyes along with tonic-clonic movements of all limbs followed by lateral tongue bite and fall with injuries of forehead and black eye (left side). The seizure lasted for about 2 minutes. After convulsion, she had post-ictal confusion and lethargy which persisted for about an hour. She was continuing SSRI (Escitalopram 10 mg) for her anxiety disorder. There was no family history of seizure, stress, sleep deprivation, and substance abuse. It was also not associated with fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. No history of previous traumatic head injury, paresis, visual impairment, speech impairment, and involuntary movements. Her menstrual cycle was normal and regular. She had no additional systemic disease. She received Favipiravir (11600 mg), during her SARS-CoV-2 infection. She was hemodynamically stable with normal sensorium. Neurological and other clinical examinations were normal except blackeye on left side. The cause of the seizure was undetermined at that moment.",

            "text": "Seizure was first reported in covid-19 by Moriguchi et al. [6] Seizure is possibly due to the direct (through olfactory route) or indirect neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in central nervous system and causing focal cerebritis although the exact mechanism is unknown. [7, 8] Nikbakht et al. [9] described that covid19 infection may break down the integrity of blood brain barrier (BBB) causing relocation of blood cells and proteins which ultimately disrupts the osmotic balance thus leads to seizure. MRI Brain of our patient showed focal cerebritis likely due to neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Post-stroke epilepsy is another pertinent cause of seizure. [10] But in our patient, no such evidence of stroke was found. Our patient was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 week prior to seizure and had no previous or family history of seizure. Clinical as well as electrophysiological and imagining evidences showed that she had true epileptic seizure. CSF studies showed mild elevation of protein which is usual in any viral infection and moreover the amount of viral load may be not enough for detection. [11] Herpetic encephalitis seems to be less likely as there was no finding on MRI brain suggestive of such. This is not a case of nonepileptic seizure (NES) because in NES this type of self-injuries with post-ictal phenomenon is uncommon. Although she has GAD for which she is taking SSRI and has continued this drug throughout her hospitalization during covid-19 illness, seizure was not related to SSRI here. Flavipiravir is so far not known to induce seizure. Volkow suggested that patients with substance use disorder (SUD) are mainly susceptible to covid-19 due to their underlying condition. [12] Many studies showed electrolyte imbalance in covid-19 patients such as hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. [13, 14] In our patient, the metabolic causes of seizures were excluded. Emami et al. [15] reported that seizure rate in covid-19 patients was 0.08%. There is always a diagnostic dilemma between seizure and syncope, but it is clear that our patient had definite seizure due to the nature of clinical manifestation and post-ictal phenomenon. Thus, the patients who are diagnosed with covid-19 infection even after recovery need proper follow-up under primary care physician.",
