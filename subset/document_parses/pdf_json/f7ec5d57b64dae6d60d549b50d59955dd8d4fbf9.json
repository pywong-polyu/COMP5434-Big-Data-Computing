Taking the dissemination of rumor rebuttals related to COVID-19 epidemic in the early stage in China as an example, we firstly adapted network analysis to construct representative networks of information and communication flow networks of users based on users' retweeting and commenting behaviors. Then quantitative indicators and exponential random graph models were used to evaluate the level of homophily based on topic and veracity in information networks, identity and standpoint in user networks. Meanwhile, chi square tests were added to compare the degree of echo chamber effect in retweeting and commenting. Findings showed that, users did show significant echo chamber effect when retweeting or commenting on rumor rebuttal information with different veracity. They showed diversification when retweeting but a certain tendency and pertinence when commenting in topic selection. Weibo's direct and open platform for retweeting and commenting broke the boundaries between stakeholders from different professional fields. However, the retweeting mechanism promoted self-isolation of users' standpoints, while the commenting mechanism provided an understanding and integrating channel for groups with opposing standpoints.",

Due to the characteristics, namely participation, openness, communication, dialogue and community, of social media, such as Twitter and Weibo (a primary microblog website in China), the speed, breadth and depth of rumor spread have been increased (Zubiaga et al., 2016) . Especially during COVID-19 epidemic, the spread of false information (such as \"The Air Force of the Central Theatre District spread the disinfectant powder over Wuhan\", \"Citizens in Wuhan used high-concentration alcohol to disinfect indoors and caused fires\", \"5G was the cause of COVID-19 or it could accelerate the disaster's spread.\") not only exacerbated the spread of panic, but also affected the public's correct understanding of scientific preventions, various conspiracy theories even became a stumbling block for the formation of a national anti-epidemic alliance (Wasim et al., 2020) .",

Relevant organizations, including the police and official media, have published hundreds of accounts on Weibo to help distinguish rumors and release rumor rebuttal information (Cao & An, 2011) . General public also actively participate in the rumor suppression practice (Zeng et al., 2019) . Unfortunately, the above actions are not entirely effective for the following reasons. Some rumor rebuttal information released by public lacks fact-checking. National media or government agencies even make up new rumors to refute the old (\"refute rumors with rumors\") to cover up scandals or underestimate the casualties caused by the crisis (Wen & Huang, 2015, pp. 81-87) , which severely undermines the public's trust in the authority of rumor rebuttal information, conversely deepening their trust in rumors and triggering \"backfire effect\" eventually (Petrova & Cialdini, 2005) .",

Communication has become increasingly personalized, both in the way messages are framed and how they are shared across social networks (Schmidt et al., 2017) . Recent studies have shown that online users tend to focus on specific narratives which conform to their worldview (even if pieces of content are deliberately false (Bessi et al., 2014; Mocanu et al., 2015) ) and dismiss information unrelated or contradictory to their worldview to form an echo chamber, which has profoundly affected social issues such as policy dissemination Tsai et al., 2020) , public debate (Schmidt et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2015) and rumor governance (Wang & Song, 2020) . In the spread of rumor rebuttal information related to public health emergencies, although this kind of information environment can meet the personalized information need and save the cost of obtaining information. Being trapped in the inertia of selective exposure by one and one's neighbors in the social network might narrow the information sources of users and block the normal communication between different groups (Wang & Song, 2020) . The accompanying cognitive defects and narrow biases might lead to group polarization and social fragmentation, eventually causing the invalidation of the guidance for rumor rebuttal (Zhang, 2020) . The key to solving this problem is to pay attention to the echo chamber in rumor rebuttal discussion, only after making sense of the relationship between which and the information consumption/social interaction of users on social media, can we provide urgent insights about rumor rebuttal strategies for public opinion managers from the perspective of users' comprehensive access to information and the prevention of group polarization.",

            "text": "Rumor refers to the information widely circulated without confirmation to alleviate fear and anxiety under uncertain or dangerous information situations (DiFonzo & Bordia, 2006; Jung, 1909) . Rumor rebuttal is a kind of anti-rumor persuasion behavior, and its essence is to produce correct information to effectively counteract the spread of rumors (Xiong, 2012) . According to the persuasive information model (Hovland & Weiss, 1951) , the characteristics of rumor rebuttal source (Berinsky, 2011; Bordia et al., 1998 Bordia et al., , 2005 DiFonzo & Bordia, 2000; Esposito & Rosnow, 1983; Tang & Lai, 2018; Wang et al., 2013, pp. 2-8; Zeng et al., 2019; Zeng & Wei, 2016, pp. 25-34) , content (Chen et al., 2017; Ruan & Xia, 2020) , communication channels (Chen, 2020, pp. 2-11; Huang, 2020) , and information receivers (Nyhan & Reifler, 2010) significantly affect the effectiveness of rumor rebuttals. In disaster events, government is the main force (Wang et al., 2013, pp. 2-8) and media is the backbone (Zeng & Wei, 2016, pp. 25-34) . Limited researches also shifted attention to other subjects, such as general public, civil organizations (Zeng et al., 2019) . Chen et al. (2017) found that the topic, originality, number of pictures and \"@\" significantly affected the number of retweets, while the topic, originality, way to refute rumors, emotional intensity and content length significantly affected the number of comments. Ruan and Xia (2020) divided the ways to refute rumors into \"direct refutation\" and \"indirect refutation supplemented by truth statement\". This classification strategy obviously assumed the rumor rebuttal having been verified and true, but ignored the false side of it. Therefore, this study, analogous to Wang and Song (2020) on the definition of rumors' veracity, proposed another way to classify the rumor rebuttal's veracity (\"refute rumors with truth\", \"refute rumors with rumors\", and \"refute rumors with doubts\"). A few researches pointed out that different individuals had different perceptions of the credibility or importance of information based on their own needs, interests, and values. They tended to trust information that conformed to their original standpoints (Nyhan & Reifler, 2010) .",

Bruns (2017) pointed out that the existence of clusters in social networks was understood as the evidence of echo chamber where nodes tended to preferentially connect to nodes in clusters and form homogeneous communities. Homophily meant that \"the contact probability between similar nodes was higher than that between dissimilar nodes\" (Himelboim et al., 2013) . Some research found highly isolated homogeneous communities on social media (Bessi et al., 2014; Medaglia & Yang, 2016; Schmidt et al., 2017) , while others showed that viral information on social media could penetrate into different communities (Weng et al., 2013) . The latter argued that several studies exaggerated the extent to which social media users deliberately avoided expressing objections on Internet (Holbert et al., 2010) . Compared with offline networks, online networks could achieve diversified information disclosure and weaken interpersonal ties (De Meo et al., 2013) , so users were more likely to encounter novel ideas than those frequently seen in closely connected social circles .",

Wang and Song (2020) established a representative network of information and a communication flow network of users based on users' commenting behavior. Combined with the low level of homophily based on rumors' veracity in the information network, and the mix of homogeneity and heterogeneity based on users' attitudes in the user network, they concluded that the echo chamber effect in discussions on genetically modified rumors on Weibo was unobvious, specifically, on the one hand, users tended to comment on both true and false rumors; on the other hand, some users who supported rumors only commented on users who supported rumors, but there were also some users who supported rumors commented on users holding different attitudes. Bessi et al. (2014) and Schmidt et al. (2017) used similar methods to construct information representative networks, which proved the echo chamber effect in users' selecting information's topics. The former indicated that conspiracists preferred topics based on conspiracy rather than science, the latter characterized the news consumption patterns of users on Facebook, and discovered that each user tended to focus on a limited set of pages with relatively fixed and similar topics. Zhang and Ho (2020) draw lessons from the principle quoted in Bibliometrics, according to the retweeting behavior of the third-party users, established a network of retweeted users, and concluded that the performance of data-driven journalism in electronic public domain had broken the boundaries between people from different professional field. Tsai et al. (2020) constructed three user interaction networks (communication flow networks) based on users' retweeting, mentioning and commenting behaviors. In the context of political consumers' rights protection, they revealed the prominent performance of ideological echo chamber in the retweeting and mentioning networks, and the highly mixed user groups with opposing political views in the commenting network. They explained that retweet expressed the will to increase the visibility of a given information, mention was used to call out to specific like-minded peers to accomplish collective goals (both retweet and mention served to share information with one's followers and specific audiences), but comment was the way in which online collective debates took place around the original posts. Guo et al. (2020) merged retweeting and mentioning relationships, and investigated the echo chamber on Twitter based on users' standpoints on candidates in retweeting and commenting during the 2016 US presidential election.",

Researches on echo chamber effect mainly focused on the controversial and widespread social problems, but rarely focused on rumor governance especially during public health emergencies. As the opposite of rumors, rumor rebuttals were still controversial in the dynamic game process with rumors (Goh et al., 2017) . This study attempted to explore whether echo chamber effect existed in the cognition, decision-making and interaction behaviors of users when participating in the rumor rebuttal discussion on Weibo, and clarify its form and degree. The performance of echo chamber varied with types of social networks (representative networks, communication flow networks), feature dimensions (information's topic, veracity, and user's professional-field and standpoint attributes) and interaction mechanisms (retweeting, commenting). To guide that trajectory of our research, we devised the following research questions.",

It was not until midnight on April 8, 2020, that Wuhan announced its unblocking. Facing the sudden health crisis, absence of the key official information led to an information vacuum (Shibutani, 1966) . Public sought information more intensely than ever as health issues required unfamiliar expertise and dealt with life-and-death problems. The increase in fear and uncertainty made public more vulnerable to rumors. During this period, attention and actions for rumor rebuttals were extremely significant. Firstly, using the keywords \"novel coronavirus/COVID (\u65b0\u51a0)\" and \"rumor rebuttal (\u8f9f \u8c23)\", Sina Weibo API was called to obtain the original tweets of rumor rebuttals and their posters' information from 10 a.m. on January 23, 2020 to midnight on April 8, 2020. Then, it traversed the retweeting and commenting lists of each original tweet, and crawled the tweets and user information of retweeting/commenting. A total of 3446 original tweets were initially obtained, corresponding to 23,858 retweeting tweets and 12,740 commenting tweets. Next, we invited two trained professionals to annotate the 3446 original tweets. if it talked about unrelated topics or did not aim to refute rumors, it was coded as 'N'; if not, it was 'Y'. The coders conducted the intercoder reliability test (Krippendorff, 2011) based on the 10% of sample data (\u03ba = 0.887). After eliminating differences and reaching agreement through discussion, they marked the remaining samples. We deleted 29 original tweets coded as 'N', and 3351 original tweets whose retweeting or commenting volume less than 20 to exclude the samples with low influence (Wang & Song, 2020) . Remained 66 original rumor rebuttal tweets contrasted with recognized rumors, corresponding to 62 posters, 19,222 retweeting tweets corresponding to 17,727 users, 7323 commenting tweets corresponding to 5928 users.",

Certain researches treated retweeting as a sign of approval (Li et al., 2021) . But in fact, when users retweet the original content, they will also add their own additional ideas. Therefore, for each original poster, if the veracity of original rumor rebuttal tweet was coded as \"refute rumors with doubts\", then the poster's standpoint was marked as \"query\", otherwise, \"agree\". For each retweeting user, we firstly determined the user's standpoint expressed in a single retweeting tweet, then comprehensively considered all the retweeting tweets from the user, and selected the standpoint with the highest frequency of expression as the user's common standpoint (\"agree\", \"disagree\", \"query\"). If there was frequency juxtaposition, the standpoint expressed by the latest retweeting tweet shall prevail. If all the retweeting tweets of the user did not express standpoints clearly, then the user's standpoint was \"unknown\". For each commenting user, we made annotation following the same rule.

Although previous studies showed that social media could increase access to anti-attitude messages and reduce polarization (Beam et al., 2018) , our findings emphasized the universality of self-isolation, which indicated a more proactive engagement level than information consumption through retweeting (Tsai & Men, 2018) . Boyd et al. (2010) pointed out that, affected by individual or community factors (like value identity, group pressure), spiral of silence and confirmation bias might appear when users retweeted controversial divergent issues. Individuals intentionally avoided expressing dissent, or tended to stay close to others who might support their own opinions, to do self-confirm in the homophily network. Therefore, large-scale interactive retweeting might reflect the nature of collective activism around rumor rebuttal, and combined with the explanation above that the low homophily based on professional fields might promote information sharing among different stakeholder groups, it should be noticed that retweeting mechanism had significant advantages in launching large-scale mobilization. Unlike retweeting, standpoint-based echo chamber effect did not significantly exist in comment user network, which was consistent with the researches of Tsai et al. (2020) , Wang and Song (2020) . Commenting mechanism was conducive to sharing knowledge, condensing group wisdom, promoting mutual understanding and integration among groups with opposing views. Spiral of silence (Noelle-Neumann, 1974) did not seem to work. On the one hand, it might be attributed to the fact that the comment mechanism reduced the individuals' exposure ratio in social networks compared with retweeting . On the other hand, it might be due to the different purposes when users used different interaction mechanisms, which was when users responded to something they disagreed with, they would choose to comment on rather than retweet it, avoiding amplifying its visibility (Tsai et al., 2020) .",

Significant topicbased echo chamber effect existed in users' commenting behavior and standpoint-based echo chamber effect existed in users' retweeting behavior. Like-minded and cross-standpoint communication coexisted in users' commenting behavior. The findings provided meaningful inspiration for public opinion managers to use or eliminate the echo chamber to improve the rumor rebuttal strategies' effectiveness. ",
