With the increasing number of confirmed cases, the cardiovascular manifestations associated by this highly contagious viral infection have gained more and more attention. Several observational studies have found that between 7.2 and 37.5% of COVID-19 patients had cardiac injury (CI) which was associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . However, a portion of CI does not occur on admission and the association of the timing of CI with prognosis is unknown. Furthermore, the clinical features and risk factors associated with early or late onset CI in COVID-19 patients have not been formally evaluated. The clinical sequence preceding and following CI at the time of admission may provide additional understanding of the pathogenesis associated with CI in COVID-19. Therefore, this study compared the clinical characteristics, risk factors and prognostic value of early vs. late onset of CI in COVID-19 patients.",

In our study, a remarkable 35.2% of patients had any CI. The pathogenesis of CI associated with COVID-19 is still unknown partly due to a dearth of autopsy or biopsy reported in these patients. The following potential mechanisms for CI have been proposed. The first possibility is direct myocardial damage by the virus, because angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has been identified as a functional receptor for coronaviruses, which is also expressed abundantly in the myocardium (19, 20) . Mixed literature from autopsy and biopsy case series were reported without conclusive evidence yet (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . The second mechanism is presumably the systemic inflammatory cytokine response, namely cytokine storm (26, 27) . It can cause the proliferation of highly pro-inflammatory CCR4+CCR6+Th17 cells amongst the CD4+T cells, the expression of high concentrations of cytotoxic particles in CD8+T cells and over activation of T cells in general, all of which lead to a stronger inflammatory response in return (3, 21) . Inflammation can in turn lead to thromboembolic complications (28) . Our study showed that inflammation-related indices (CRP, PCT) were higher in the CI group compared to the non-CI group. Another mechanism is CI related to hypoxia. The balance between the oxygen demand and supply of the myocardium is disrupted during acute hypoxia. A cascade of cellular, biochemical and inflammatory reactions can occur during hypoxia, eventually causing myocardial apoptosis (29) . Acute severe hypoxia can (30) . In this study, patients with early or late CI had lower level of SpO 2 on admission and higher incidence of ARDS compared to the non-CI group. There was a large timing overlap between CI and ARDS in the early CI group and 75% of patients with late CI were preceded by ARDS which supports a strong relationship between CI and hypoxia. Lastly, antiviral drugs can cause cardiac insufficiency, arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disorders with variable individual susceptibility (4, 31) . In the present study, almost all patients (93.4% of COVID-19 patients) were administrated with antiviral drugs either on admission or after admission for which the opportunity of individual susceptibility and/or interaction with the underlying comorbid conditions could contribute to onset of late CI or recurrence of the initial one. In addition, patients in the CI group were more likely to have received glucocorticoid therapy. The relationship between glucocorticoid therapy and cardiac injury remains controversial and is under investigation (32) . On the other hand, it is also likely that patients with any CI had higher disease severity for which more treatment was administered. This may suggest that the CI after admission was a sign of disease severity and/or progression.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to depict the clinical characteristics of both early CI and late CI and their association with in-hospital mortality. Our study showed that early CI was an independent predictor of death in COVID-19 patients even after accounting for variables that have proven prognostic value in the risk stratification of acutely ill patients, such as respiratory rate, heart rate, SpO 2 , temperature, mean arterial pressure, and coma (16, 34) . Cardiac injury remained significant after accounting for potential confounding laboratory variables with proven prognostic value in COVID hospitalizations such as lymphocyte count, LDH, CRP (17) . This is important because clinicians should not consider patients being out of danger despite absence of CI in the first 72 h since it can occur late. Similarly, a fall after the early rise in Trop I should not translate into a lower risk status since recurrence of CI can occur. Conversely, we also found that CI is closely related to the occurrence of ARDS as opposed to a primary cardiac event. Accordingly, our study suggested the need for a more systematic assessment of cardiac troponins for risk stratification of COVID-19 patients on admission, with repeat measures for those who already have initial CI or who are at risk for clinical deterioration. With the advent of multiple therapies now to reduce the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 (35) (36) (37) , early identification of higher risk patients with cardiac biomarkers may be helpful to balance the cost vs. the effect of therapy.",

First, this was a relatively small sample size and single-center retrospective observational study for which residual confounding cannot be excluded and we did not include all the potential factors associated with mortality in our study. Second, only 196 patients both had the data of hs-TNI within and after 72 h of admission, which may have underestimated the true incidence of CI in our study. Therefore, future studies should be multi-centered, with larger sample size and systematic data collection, in order to promote a more comprehensive understanding of the association between cardiac injury and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.",

This study highlights the importance of early examination and periodical monitoring of cardiac biomarkers to identify predictors and markers of clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients to guide intervention.",
