Increased concerns are directed toward immunocompromised patients who responded poorly to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as they are predisposed to higher morbidity and mortality when contracted Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) (2) . Similarly, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) showed a blunted response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, with reported response rates of 96% to as low as 29%, even after two doses of vaccination (reviewed by Yen et al. (3) ), and the antibody titer (AT) generated is significantly lower than healthy individuals receiving the same vaccine (4) . Studies of response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the ESRD cohort mainly employed the mRNA vaccine platform and observed humoral immune responses (3) . Less is known about the role of cellular immunity.",

            "text": "This study aimed to unravel the kinetics of immune response following vaccination with the ChAdOx nCOV-19 (AstraZeneca), an adenovirus-vectored vaccine, in an ESRD cohort with maintenance dialysis. Peripheral blood was collected from 53 patients at four time-points (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Time 0 (T0), 0-7 days before the first dose of vaccine, and Time 1 (T1) taken 14-20 days after the first dose of vaccine. Time 2 (T2) was taken day 0-4 before the second dose of vaccine. Given the recommended ChAdOx nCOV-19 dosing interval of 8-10 weeks, the T2 blood was drawn approximately 70 days following the T0 sampling. Lastly, Time 3 (T3) was taken on days 21-35 following the second dose of vaccine (about 28 days after the T2 sampling). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG quantification was determined using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay on an ARCHITECHT analyzer, Abbott) according to the manufacturer's protocol. An AT of \uf0b350 arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) was considered a positive antibody response. We observed 32 patients who showed positive AT response (termed as responder group). Instead, 21 patients (40%) did not yield positive AT (termed as delayed responder, DR) following the first dose of vaccination (T2) ( Figure 1A) . There was no significant difference in clinical and demographic characteristics among the two groups ( Table 1) . Most DR eventually showed improvement of the AT after the second dose of vaccination (T3). However, the AT was lower quantitatively than that of the responders ( Figure 1B) . The antibody response from two patients (3.78%) remained negative despite two vaccination doses.",

Following the first dose of the vaccine, the studied immune cell profile, including B cells, NK cells, total T cells, and Th and Tc cells, did not differ between antibody response groups (data not shown). Despite the antibody response, early active (CD69 + ) B and T cells were increased following the SP challenge. The responder group exhibited a significant increase of total B cells and early active NK and Tc cells ( Figure 1C) . On the other hand, the DR group revealed no rise in B cells and Tc cells, suggesting inadequately articulated cellular immune response following vaccination. Instead, the DR group exhibited a unique expansion of NKT subsets, including the early active NKT, cytotoxic NKT, as well as total NKT cell counts ( Figure 1D) . A separate investigation on the non-responders is provided in the supplementary materials.",

In a phase 1/2 clinical trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 among the healthy population, a single vaccine dose induced a Th1-biased response, followed by Tc cells of monofunctional, polyfunctional, and cytotoxic phenotypes (7). We did not find a prominent Th1 response even among the responders in our ESRD cohort, possibly pointing out a discrepancy in immune cell capacity. Contrary to the responders, an inadequacy in neutralizing the humoral immune response in the DR group may accentuate the activation of NKT cells, a critical process in immunogenicity maturation following the antigen stimulation (8) . Studies have proposed important roles of NKT cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, notably during the acute phase. It promotes viral clearance through direct cytotoxicity and the mediation of the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity effect (9) . Noticeable decreases of NKT cells are observed in patients with severe COVID-19 and may serve as a biomarker for outcome prediction (10) .",

SP challenge triggered activation of circulating CD69 + B and T cells. The responder group elicited prominent increase of B and early active Tc cells, while the DR group interestingly showed an increased number of NKT cell population. Despite the minimal antibody response to vaccination, the understanding of early immune cell activation sparked a notion of potential attempt to modulate the cellular immune response, notably in immunocompromised individuals. Our findings also highlighted the concern of impaired immune response in this population and necessitated the need for a thorough discussion on current and future vaccination programs. A globally coordinated and standardized method to analyze the seroconversion and immune cell activation following vaccination is also prompted.",
