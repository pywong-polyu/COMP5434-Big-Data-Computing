However, conflicting results have been reported regarding viral loads between NPS and saliva. We conducted a study to compare the viral loads between NPS and saliva in 42 COVID-19 patients. Viral loads were estimated by the cycle threshold (Ct) values. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 34 (81%) using NPS with median Ct value of 27.4, and 38 (90%) using saliva with median Ct value of 28.9 (P = 0.79). Kendall's W was 0.82, showing a high degree of agreement, indicating equivalent viral loads in NPS and saliva. After symptom onset, the Ct values of both NPS and saliva continued to increase over time, with no substantial difference. Self-collected saliva has a detection sensitivity comparable to that of NPS and is a useful diagnostic tool with mitigating uncomfortable process and the risk of aerosol transmission to healthcare workers.",

Although the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is considered a gold standard in the diagnosis, self-collected saliva has been reported to have several advantages 1 . Specifically, self-collection reduces the risk of viral exposure for the healthcare worker and causes less discomfort for the patients. However, although emerging evidences have shown the utility of saliva as an alternative to NPS 2-6 , conflicting results have been reported regarding SARS-CoV-2 viral loads between NPS and saliva. Wyllie et al. showed that the viral load was higher in saliva than NPS 7 , while William et al. has reported results to the contrary 6 . We recently reported that the viral load was equivalent between saliva and NPS samples in large number of asymptomatic persons 8 . Herein, we conducted a study to compare the viral loads in paired samples (saliva and NPS) from symptomatic patients who were admitted for COVID-19.",

In summary, self-collected saliva is a useful alternative to NPS as a specimen for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. The methodology of self-collection carries significant logistical and cost advantages over NPS by mitigating the risk of aerosol transmission to healthcare workers and obviating the need for full protective suits.",

Paired NPS and saliva samples were simultaneously collected from all patients upon hospital admission between June 12, 2020 and August 6, 2020. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board (Hokkaido University Hospital Division of Clinical Research Administration Number: 020-0116) and informed consent was obtained from all patients. All the procedures are carried out according to relevant guidelines. qRT-PCR was performed at a central laboratory (SRL, Tokyo, Japan). Self-collected saliva was diluted fourfold with phosphate buffered saline and centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g for 5 min to remove cells and debris. RNA was extracted from 200 \u00b5L of the supernatant or nasopharyngeal swab samples using QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen kit and QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). qRT-PCR tests were performed, according to the manual by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID, https ://www.niid.go.jp/niid/image s/epi/coron a/2019-nCoVm anual 20200 217-en.pdf). Briefly, 5uL of the extracted RNA was used to perform one step qRT-PCR using Thunderbird Probe One-step qRT-PCR Kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and 7500 Real-time PCR Systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The Ct values were obtained by using N1 primers (N_Sarbeco_F1, N_Sarbeco_R1) with N1 probe (N_Sarbeco_P1) and by using N2 primers (NIID_2019-nCOV_N_F2, NIID_2019-nCOV_N_R2) with N2 probe (NIID_2019-nCOV_N_P2), as described 9 .",

Kendall's W was 0.82, showing a high degree of agreement. Additionally, the Ct values of both NPS and saliva continued to increase over time, with no substantial difference(Fig. 1C). There were cases of both NPS and saliva that became undetermined only three days after the onset of symptoms. Similar results were obtained from N1 primers/probe; the Ct values using the N1 primers/probe were equivalent between NPS and saliva, withmedian [IQR] of 31.0 [24.2, 39.5] and 33.1 [27.3, 37.3], respectively (Wilcoxon's signed rank P = 0.24, Fig. 1B).",
