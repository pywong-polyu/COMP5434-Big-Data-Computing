The proposed PCPLP follows an encoder-decoder architecture. Particularly, the encoder is implemented as a computationally efficient fully convolutional network (FCN). In this study, a multi-scale multi-level feature recursive aggregation (mmFRA) network is used to integrate multi-scale features (viz. global guidance features and local refinement features) with multi-level features (viz. high-level semantic features, middlelevel comprehensive features, and low-level detailed features). Because of this innovative aggregation of features, an edge-preserving segmentation map can be produced in a boundary-aware multiple supervision (BMS) way. Furthermore, both global perception and local perception are devised. On the one hand, a global perception module (GPM) providing a holistic estimation of potential lung infection regions is employed to capture more complementary coarse-structure information from different pyramid levels by enlarging the receptive fields without substantially increasing the computational burden. On the other hand, a local polishing module (LPM), which provides a fine prediction of the segmentation regions, is applied to explicitly heighten the fine-detail information and reduce the dilution effect of boundary knowledge. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PCPLP in boosting the learning ability to identify the lung infected regions with clear contours accurately. Our model is superior remarkably to the state-of-the-art segmentation models both quantitatively and qualitatively on a real CT dataset of COVID-19. (J. Tang). age, transfer, purification, and processing yield high false-negative errors, becoming a hazardous factor for stopping the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "The spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) becomes a global public health crisis known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 continues threatening the world due to its high infectivity and extreme lethality. To stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, a robust, accurate, and rapid testing protocol plays a critical role. The gold standard for detecting COVID-19 infections in clinics is reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [1] . Unfortunately, the shortage of equipment and long operation time ( i.e., a typical 24-hour sample-to-result turnaround time) dramatically limits our ability to screen suspected patients rapidly. In addition, the reduced sensitivity of RT-PCR tests caused by inappropriate sample collection, stor- itor and determine the severity of the disease over time, which allows doctors to predict risks and prognostics in a \"patient-specific\" fashion. Currently, the segmentation of the COVID-19-caused pneumonia infections has been done manually by experienced radiologists. However, such a task is labor-intensive and prone to interand intra-observer variability. Automated segmentation of COVID-19-caused infections from CT images, will relieve clinicians' workloads and make radiologic diagnoses more reliable and reproducible. However, there are several challenges: 1) compared with classification tasks, the segmentation of infection regions in the lung needs to process more discriminative information; 2) texture of the infected regions on CT images, especially the tiny infection regions, is devilishly complicated and detailed CT image characteristics vary dramatically, leading to false-negative; 3) the segmentation is sensitive to several intrinsic factors in the images, e.g. , the difference of the locations of the lesions, intensity inhomogeneity of the infected regions, high variation of the infection characteristics, soft tissue appearance within the proximity of a suspected infection, etc.",

            "text": "Our image segmentation method is inspired by practices in the clinical workflow. More specifically, during the diagnosis of pulmonary infections, clinicians first identify the overall infected regions and then zoom in to the details of those detected pulmonary lesions, e.g., local appearances on CT images. In other words, clinicians use both global (a rough lesion contour) and local (detailed imaging characteristics) information to distinguish the infected lesions from normal tissues. Our algorithm first predicts the rough infection areas and then refines the suspected lesion boundaries by taking imaging details into considerations. However, the combination of imaging artifacts ( e.g., motion artifacts) and insufficient image contrast between the infections and their surroundings (soft tissue) makes the automated image segmentation of COVID-19 infection regions challenging. This paper proposes a progressive global perception and local polishing (PCPLP) deep network to overcome the technological challenges mentioned above. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the proposed PCPLP network follows an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder structure uses a VGG-16 framework, which starts by extract-ing multi-level Pyramid features, i.e. , high-level semantic features, middle-level comprehensive features, and low-level detailed features. Two additional modules: a global perception module (GPM) and a local polishing module (LPM), are added to extend the classical VGG model. GPM is used to extract the global knowledge to find the infected regions' rough locations. In contrast, the LPM is used to extract the local information to obtain the infected regions' internal details and external contours. After the image encoding, local features obtained by the LPM models at various scales, the discriminant features of the contrast layers, and the upsampling features of the previous decoder layer are hierarchically integrated to obtain the enriched feature representations ( i.e., local score map in Fig. 1 ). After that, the local refinement features, which are generated through multi-level feature recursive aggregation (ml-FRA) by multistage parallel fusion in a recurrent manner, are combined with the global guidance features ( i.e., a global score map in Fig. 1 ) via multi-scale feature recursive aggregation (msFRA) to produce the initial segmentation map. Finally, we propose to train the multi-scale multi-level feature recursive aggregation (mmFRA) network by exploiting the boundary-aware multiple supervision (BMS), i.e., segmentation cross-entropy loss (SCEL), boundary cross-entropy loss (BCEL), and boundary-refinement loss (BRL).",

Image segmentation enables subsequent quantitative analysis for patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. A critical application of infection segmentation is to provide a comprehensive prediction of the disease severity; this can be done by visualizing and stratifying the lesion distribution utilizing the percentage of infection (POI). As mentioned before, image segmentation algorithms must overcome several challenges, including intensity inhomogeneity, interference of imaging artifacts, lack of image contrast among different tissue types, etc . Some innovative strategies have been proposed to overcome the above-said challenges. The most prominent neural network architectures of this line of research are U-Net [18] and its variants ( e.g. , residual attention U-Net [19] , spatial and channel attention U-Net [20] , 3D U-Net [21] , etc .). Particularly, Zhou et al . [22] designed a rapid, accurate, and machine-agnostic model to segment the infection regions in COVID-19 CT scans. Wang et al .

Now referring to the decoder configuration, we develop a supervised learning framework that enables recursive integration of multi-scale high-level features for generating the predications of the lung infection regions. The four decoder blocks D 1 ~D 4 share a similar structure, which contains a ReLU activation function and an LPM. Each decoder block is designed to merge the features from a contrast layer, an encoder block, and a previous decoder block, as shown in Fig. 2 (far right column). Of note, features from the previous decoder are upsampled via a deconvolution layer before the above-referenced feature merge. For instance, the coarse-level features from the encoder block E 0 , the discriminant features from the contrast layer, and the upsampled output from D 1 are concatenated to produce the fine-level features. The fine-level features are then passed through two convolution layers and two LPMs to obtain the final local refinement information (see the local score map in Fig. 2 ) that is used to precisely determine the boundaries of lung infection regions.",

            "text": "In the past, when a CNN is designed ( e.g ., VGGNet [26] , AlexNet [27] , GoogLeNet [28] , ResNet [29] , LeNet [30] , DenseNet [31] ), small convolutional kernels ( e.g., 3 \u00d7 3 or 1 \u00d7 1 ) are commonly used to extract hierarchical features because they are less computationally expensive (low time and memory requirements). However, small kernel sizes ( 3 \u00d7 3 or 1 \u00d7 1 ) limit the network's overall representation ability. It is desirable to explore a more effective strategy for handling large receptive field problems, which aims at capturing the global shape and appearance information of the lung infected regions. Research efforts have been devoted to enlarging the receptive field; strategies include dilated convolutions [32] , deepen- ing the convolutional layers [33] , and adding a series of downsampling [34] . However, these operations pose new challenges as explained below. Conducting dilated convolutions and network deepening will lead to an increase in storage space and a decrease in computing efficiency. Performing multiple downsampling results in the loss and distortion of high-level feature information, thereby negatively impacting the determination of the gross lung infection regions. We are motivated to introduce a global perception module (GPM) that can enlarge the range of the receptive field but has low memory requirements and computation demands. GPM can enlarge the receptive field while maintaining the resolution of the feature map so that the loss of spatial information in the feature maps can be avoided. In particular, using a 1 \u00d7 n convolution operation followed by a n \u00d7 1 convolution operation is equivalent to a convolution with an n \u00d7 n receptive field [35] . Let I denote a 2-d image, K x and K y denote two 1-d kernels along xdimension and y-dimension, respectively. This mechanism can be represented as follows: where K is a 2-d kernel, W and H are the width and height of the 2-d image, respectively. As a result, the number of parameters is dramatically reduced and the performance degradation is minimal. Furthermore, let C denote the number of channels in the input layer and output layer of GPM, the computational cost of adopting two 1-d convolution operations is 2 n C 2 , which is 1 \u2212 2 /n less than that of a 2-d convolution operation n 2 C 2 .",

Taking the proposed encoder ( i.e., Bloc k 1 ~Bloc k 5 in Fig. 2 ) as an example, the convolutional layers of different levels correspond to abstract features in different spatial scales: 1) for high-level features, there is abundant semantic information that is beneficial to positioning the lung infection regions and suppressing noise interference; 2) for middle-level features, both the semantic and detailed information can be adaptively prioritized, offering flexibility for feature utilization; 3) for low-level features, the fine-grained details can be preserved and are useful for predicting the boundaries of the lung infection regions. We strive to enhance multi-scale feature fusion by developing the innovative mlFRA scheme during the encoder step.

Instead of exploiting more complicated modules and sophisticated strategies to integrate the multi-scale features, our msFRA architecture is quite simple. It directly concatenates the global guidance feature map (which is obtained by feeding the backbone VGG-16 output into a series of GPM, LPM, and convolution with varying subsampling rates in the forward pass) and the local refinement feature map (which is obtained by feeding the output from mlFRA to a series of LPMs and convolutions with varying downsampling rates). In concrete terms, the proposed msFRA is implemented by integrating the global features with local features through a Softmax function: (5) where ( w L , v L ) and ( w G , v G ) denote the linear operators of the local feature map (denoted as L F ) and the global feature map (de-noted as G F ), respectively. In effect, the probability P of pixel p belonging to the lung infection regions in the initial segmentation map can be predicted. In this way, the multi-scale features are aggregated to assist the localization of lung infection regions and the refinement of the local details and generate a rough segmentation map. The rough map will be used as the input to the BMS module (see Section 3.5 below).",

The subjective performance comparisons between the manual annotations (ground truths) and nine AI-generated lung infection segmentation maps are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen clearly that the segmentation results of the proposed PGPLP model are highly consistent with the ground truth maps, which may supply a powerful guarantee for subsequent analysis. In contrast, the AttUnet and BASNet models generated unsatisfactory results, with many miss-segmented infection regions. FCN and UNet models were able to segment the large in-fection regions, but poor in identifying small regions. EGNet and UNet ++ models over-segmented or improperly segmented some of the COVID-19 lesions. PoolNet and Inf-Net models produced relatively good results by aggregating the high-level features, but the complete structure and clear contour could not be predicted. The advantage of our PGPLP is mainly due to the coarse-to-fine deep FCN framework, in which the coarse-level Pyramid features are progressively integrated into fine-level features to roughly locate the lung infection regions and precisely segment the lesions respectively in an escalatory manner. This process mimics how a clinician visually segments the COVID-19 lung infected regions from CT slices and therefore can achieve good performance.",

Meanwhile, the infection regions obtained by the Backbone + LPM model have sharpness boundaries, which verifies that the LPM component can significantly contribute to the fine-grained detail improvement. The optimum performance is gained with the joint GPM and LPM for higher emphasis on the structures and contours of the infected regions.

The proposed model employs a global perception module and a local polishing module to improve the localization and identification of the infection regions by more effectively retaining and assembling multi-level structure information and multi-scale detail information. Moreover, the multi-scale multi-level feature recursive aggregation strategy is exploited to integrate the multi-scale and multi-level features in a progressive manner, which not only substantially narrows the semantic gaps between the encoder and decoder blocks but also develops parallel inter-linking among multi-scale and multi-level features, thus greatly alleviates the vanishing gradient problem. Fur-thermore, our boundary-aware multiple supervision achieves considerable improvement over traditional single supervision methods for introducing more boundary information to produce finer details. Extensive experiments show that the proposed PGPLP architecture is capable of segmenting the infection regions of COVID-19 lesions under challenging conditions such as blurred infected interiors, diffusive infecting regions, and scattered boundaries.",
