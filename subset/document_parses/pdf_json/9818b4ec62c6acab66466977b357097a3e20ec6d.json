Using data from the Current Population Survey, the authors compare estimates between February and April 2020 to examine the period of time before the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States to the height of the first wave, when stay-at-home orders were issued across the country. The findings illustrate that women, particularly mothers, have employment disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Mothers are more likely than fathers to exit the labor force and become unemployed. Among heterosexual married couples of which both partners work in telecommutingcapable occupations, mothers have scaled back their work hours to a far greater extent than fathers. These patterns suggest that the COVID-19 crisis is already worsening existing gender inequality, with long-term implications for women's employment.",

These data were strategically selected to capture a distinct coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) time frame: the period before and during the peak of the first wave and associated pandemic lockdowns. Drawing upon a representative sample of the U.S. workforce, we find that women report higher unemployment than men and that mothers are exiting the labor force and reducing work hours to a greater extent than fathers (Figure 1 ). The long-term impacts of the COVID-19 lockdowns on gender inequality are paramount and require strategic policy intervention.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, women are facing a \"triple whammy\": (1) as frontline workers at risk for contracting COVID-19, (2) as workers in industries experiencing greater economic distress, and (3) as caregivers shouldering increased domestic work due to school and daycare closures (Cooper and Mosseri, 2020) . We bring robust evidence to show that women are more likely to be unemployed than men, and mothers of young children report higher unemployment rates and labor force exit rates compared with fathers. Even in households in which both parents remained employed and able to telecommute, our estimates show that mothers are reducing work time to a greater extent than fathers. The longterm implications are clear: the pandemic will likely exacerbate inequalities between women and men in occupational attainment, lifetime earnings, and economic independence. As cases continue to climb, governments must weigh the gendered consequences of COVID-19 to develop policies to support women's, particularly mothers', employment.",
