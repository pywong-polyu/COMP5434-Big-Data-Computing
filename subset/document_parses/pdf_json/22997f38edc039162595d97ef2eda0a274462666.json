IL-1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HLH 4 and IL-1 receptor antagonists have shown success in treating this condition. 5 We present a case of fulminant myocarditis secondary to Neisseria meningitidis septicaemia complicated by HLH, which was successfully treated with the recombinant, non-glycosylated human monoclonal IL-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra.",

Kumar et al. 12 replicated these results in rats. There has been some success in translating these findings into the clinic. The Recently Decompensated Heart Failure Anakinra Response Trial (REDHART) trial 13 randomized patients with a recent decompensated heart failure admission and CRP >2 mg/L, to receive Anakinra or placebo. Those who received Anakinra for 12 weeks had an increase in peak oxygen consumption, although the trial was not powered to detect differences in rates of rehospitalization or death. The Tailored Immunosuppression in Inflammatory Cardiomyopathy (TIMIC) trial 14 randomized patients with chronic heart failure unresponsive to standard therapy and free of viral infection, to receive Azathioprine \u00fe Prednisolone, or placebo, in addition to standard heart failure therapy. Patients in the immunosuppression arm showed improvements in LV ejection fraction, reductions in LV volumes and improvement in New York Heart Association functional class, although hard outcomes such as MACE were not ascertained.

Mutations of the PRF1 and UNC13D genes [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) catalogue numbers 170280 and 608897] on chromosomes 10q22.1 and 17q25.1, which encode perforin 1 and Unc-13 Homolog D proteins, respectively, account for around 40-60% of genetically mediated cases. IL-1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of HLH 4 and inhibition of IL-1 signalling with Anakinra has been associated with improved outcomes in patients with HLH, albeit in case series rather than randomized trials. 5, 15 In this case, the organism responsible for the patient's initial presentation with sepsis was only identified by PCR and the result was not available until the critical phase of his illness had resolved. Although multiple sets of blood cultures were taken at the time of admission this goes to reiterate the importance of taking samples for culture prior to the administration of antibiotics, whenever possible, and the value of molecular genetic testing in arriving at a precise diagnosis.",
