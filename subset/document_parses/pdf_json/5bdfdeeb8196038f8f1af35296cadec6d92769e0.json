Right now, a future COVID-19 vaccine is widely seen as the end of a nightmare. This is only partially true. If we had had a vaccine, and when we do have a vaccine that is widely available, COVID-19 will stop being a threat only if enough people are willing and given the opportunity to be vaccinated. This is where the most interesting ethical issues around vaccination policies and vaccination behaviours arise. To the extent that vaccination decisions affect not only (or even not primarily) the individuals who get vaccinated, but also people around them and the community more broadly, vaccination decisions and policies are also ethical decisions. In its most basic understanding, ethics is about values and principles that ought to regulate behaviours that are not only or not exclusively in one's own self-interest, but also and sometimes primarily in other peoples' interest or in line with certain societal expectations or requirements.",

For example, recent drops in vaccination uptake caused measles cases to triple in Europe in 2018/19. 3 Measles is a good example of an infectious disease where the vaccine makes a huge difference, both where it is widely available and is preventing a significant number of deaths, and where it is not widely available and people, especially children, keep dying or suffering permanent damages because of measles. For instance, the WHO estimates that the measles vaccine has saved 17.1 million lives worldwide between 2000 and 2015. 4 One might wonder how comes that vaccination is an ethical issue at all. Given how beneficial it is and how low risk it is, and given that the benefits accrue not only to the individual who is vaccinated but to third parties and the wider community as well, one might think that there really should not be any significant ethical issue raised by vaccination.",

            "text": "And yet, many people do not vaccinate against measles and other common infectious diseases. Low and inconsistent vaccination uptake characterizes both low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) that do not have adequate access to vaccines 5 but also, perhaps surprisingly, high-income countries (HICs), though for different reasons. These include fears of iatrogenic diseases, 6,7 preferences for natural lifestyles, 8 religious opposition to vaccines 6 or increased sense of responsibility for the small risks of vaccines, as opposed to the responsibility for the risks of exposing one's children to infectious diseases. 9 Some people are simply 'vaccine hesitant': they do not reject vaccination tout court or in principle, but their scepticism and concerns often cause them to delay vaccination for their children. 10 Significant drops in vaccination uptake are more likely to occur in countries with no mandatory vaccination policies or where vaccination mandates have very flexible non-medical exemption clauses, such as in many US states. Even when vaccination uptake is sufficiently high, the risk of drops in uptake always looms large. For example, in the UK, where no vaccination is mandatory, the child uptake for the MMR vaccine has declined in each of the past 5 years and has consistently been below the WHO recommended threshold of 95%, which is necessary for herd immunity. 11 Thus, even when vaccines are widely available and when many people do vaccinate, vaccination still raises a number of ethical issues both about public policies and individual behaviours. For example, is it unethical not to be vaccinated or not to vaccinate one's children against certain infectious diseases? What policies ought a state to implement to promote vaccination uptake? What kinds of penalties, if any, should there be for non-vaccination? How do the small risks of vaccines affect the ethics of individual vaccination decisions and of vaccination policies? Are there any groups that have a special moral obligation to be vaccinated or that vaccination policies should specifically target? There is a debate as to which vaccines exactly these questions and their answers apply. However, the questions are normally taken to be more pressing with regard to those vaccines that protect against the infectious diseases that represent major threats in certain areas, either because they are more severe or because they are more infectious, or both. For example, in most HICs the questions apply to the MMR vaccine, but not to the fever vaccine, because yellow fever is not a public health threat in those countries.",

There are different ethical views on the ethical weight of both and on the extent to which they ground individual responsibilities and justify different kinds of vaccination policies. Such principles need to be weighed against countervailing considerations, such as the fact that certain people have personal views against vaccination or that vaccine do present some risk of iatrogenic harm, and countervailing principles, such as freedom of conscience, a principle of least restrictive alternative in public health, and the minimization of risks on individuals in the pursuit of the collective good.",

For measles, for example, the threshold for herd immunity is 95% immunity, but for other infectious diseases the threshold is typically lower. Achieving and maintaining herd immunity is vital for that fraction of a population that cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons (e.g. because they are immunosuppressed) or for age reasons (e.g. the first shot of the MMR vaccine is not recommended for children before the age of 6 months). When collective immunity drops, the risk of measles outbreaks becomes higher.",

In few words, this means that it is difficult to prevent people from benefitting from them, and that individuals benefit from them regardless of how many other individuals do. For example, clean air is a public good. In the case of herd immunity, the benefit can be either direct, for those who are not vaccinated or immune, or indirect, for those who benefit from living in a community with a good level of public health and low risks of outbreaks. By their own nature, public goods raise distinctive ethical issues around fairness and free-riding. Because they are non-excludable, people would benefit from them even if they do not contribute, so there is an incentive to free-ride.",

And because they are non-rivalrous, the fact that someone does not contribute does not deprive others of the good-for instance, in the case of vaccination, the fact that I do not contribute to herd immunity is very unlikely to compromise herd immunity and therefore deprive others of this good. Again, at least according to some accounts, failing to make one's contribution to herd immunity just because it doesn't make a difference violates a fairness requirement. 14, 15 Infectious disease outbreaks can be very disruptive of normal life and can have a huge economic cost. The COVID-19 outbreak is an obvious example at the moment. It is very easy to see how vaccineinduced herd immunity against COVID-19 would be one of the most important public goods we could have right now. The realistic possibility of other pandemics raises important question about whether we have a moral obligation, and indeed we should have a legal obligation, to contribute to the realization of herd immunity when we do have a vaccine that can prevent or stop them. 16 Indeed, even seasonal flu outbreaks, which do not reach pandemic levels, often entail a large collective cost, even for those who do not get the flu. For instance, it has been estimated that the economic impact of annual influenza epidemics in the USA, taking into account loss of earning, would amount to US$87.1 billion. 17 As we shall see, the nature of public good of herd immunity gives rise to some distinctive ethical issues both with regard to individual behaviour and vaccination policies.",

The focus on rights and freedoms is however just one way of interpreting restrictiveness. An alternative interpretation of what counts as more or less restrictive might place more emphasis on the risk of harm entailed by certain public policies, rather than on liberty infringement 20 : on this understanding, a policy is more restrictive than alternative ones if it poses higher risks on the population, quite independently of the fact that it restrict liberties.

As per Thaler and Sunstein's 25 standard characterization, a nudge 'alters people's behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding any option or significantly changing their economic incentives'. Nudges might be seen to undermine autonomy to a certain degree because they might circumvent people's capacity for rational thinking by making a certain default more prominent. However, they are not coercive to the extent that individuals are free to opt out and the degree of autonomy infringement involved is lesser than in the case of, say, mandatory vaccination. Navin and Largent 26 have suggested that an alternative option would be to make vaccine refusal difficult-e.g. to have burdensome bureaucratic procedures for opting out of vaccination mandates, or to require parents who do not want to vaccinate their children to attend meetings where they learn about the benefits of vaccine. They do not refer to this option as a form of 'nudge'. However, we could interpret the notion of incentives and disincentives more broadly than in the case of the definition provided by Thaler and Sunstein, which only refers to economic incentives. If we consider also practical and not only economic aspects of incentives and disincentives, then Navin and Largent's suggestion would also count as a form of nudging policy.",

There is conflicting evidence as to whether incentives are effective at increasing vaccination uptake, both in children 27 and adults. 28 From an ethical point of view, incentives for vaccination raise two kinds of issues. First, we should ask whether they can be considered coercive. According to some philosophical understandings of coercion, 29, 30 but not according to others, 31 large incentives can be coercive if the offers are irresistible to refuse. However, even assuming they are coercive, they seem to be less coercive than large threats of penalties. Second, regardless of whether incentives are coercive, there is an ethical issue on whether it is justifiable to pay people to do something they have an independent moral obligation to do. If vaccination is an individual moral obligation, some argue there is a stronger ethical reason to create disincentives (e.g. legal penalties) for those who fail to vaccination than to incentivize people to vaccinate. 32 Thus, one might argue, if nudging or incentives would allow to achieve herd immunity, the principle of least restrictive alternative implies that mandatory vaccination is not justified.",

An infectious disease is in this respect like a bullet that can be shot and harm or even kill innocent people. Another analogy that has been used to support the same point is that of allowing children to go around with a bottle of a toxic substance like bleach that, if accidentally spilled, could cause serious harm or even death. 37 Once again, in the same way as we legitimately prohibit children from doing that, we should prohibit children from going around risking 'spilling' viruses. Considerations of harm prevention prevail over considerations of individual liberty. The second analogy seems more apt because it better reflects the situation with regard to vaccination and infectious disease. Unlike the gunfiring example, in the bleach example the harm or risk of harm posed on others is unintentional, but this does not mean that there no good reasons to prevent it. Preventing harm or risk of harm to others is normally taken to be a sufficient ground for liberty restrictions, at least when the cost on individuals of preventing risk of harm to others is small.",

However, this kind of risk assessment would also need to factor in the risk that immunization rates drop below the threshold of herd immunity (as they often do), which would reintroduce the risks of infectious diseases for the unvaccinated. Besides, other ethical considerations beyond risk prevention are sometimes taken to weigh in favour of exposing individuals to the very small risks of vaccines even in presence of herd immunity.

Public goods raise ethical issues on their own that are quite independent from the considerations of individually imposed risk of harm. In particular, public goods normally raise issues of fairness related to the freeriding problem. In many cases, everyone is expected to contribute to important public goods even if doing or failing to do so does not make a difference in terms of significantly decreasing or increasing risk of harm to others, and even if for any individual it would be better not to contribute. If I use public transport, I am expected to pay the ticket even if it does not make difference to the efficiency of the service and even if I would be better off without paying, as long as enough others do so. The same can be said about herd immunity. I would be better off by not being vaccinated, as long as enough others do so and guarantee herd immunity; in such case my non-vaccination would not make a significant difference to the level of risk I impose on others, and I would still be indirectly protected without having to take on myself the small risk or the annoyance of getting vaccinated. Thus, there are two kinds of fairness requirements: (1) a requirement not to freeride on a public good like herd immunity, when the public good exists; and (2) a requirement to make one's contribution to an important public good like herd immunity, regardless of whether the individual contribution 'makes a difference'. 15 Fairness is sometimes taken to be a reason for a moral obligation to get vaccinated against certain infectious diseases, 34 in addition to considerations about harm prevention. On some other views, drawing on analogies with other ways in which fair contribution to important public goods is made compulsory (e.g. taxation 15 ), fairness is a strong enough reason to make vaccination compulsory quite independently of whether it 'makes a difference' and on whether a community already has herd immunity.",

Here, I have provided a general overview of the main ethical issues involved, but of course more specific ethical issues are raised by certain vaccines and do not apply to all vaccines. For example, evidence suggests that the flu vaccine is more effective at building up immunity at the collective level if targeted at children, even if those who benefit the most from protection from the flu are the elderly. In this case, some have argued that whatever vaccination policy we adopt, it should target children primarily in order to maximize the benefit of the vaccine. 38 Another factor that affects the strength of the ethical considerations above is the effectiveness of a vaccine at stopping transmission. Again, this is relevant with regard to the future COVID-19 vaccine. There is a realistic possibility that what currently is the most promising vaccine candidate, being developed at Oxford, will be effective at preventing people from getting sick but not too effective at blocking transmission (this hypothesis is at the moment based on observations on animal models). If so, the cases for compulsory vaccination based on fairness and of harm prevention seem to be weaker-although they might still be supported on the basis of the high toll that COVID-19 infections are imposing on healthcare systems.",
