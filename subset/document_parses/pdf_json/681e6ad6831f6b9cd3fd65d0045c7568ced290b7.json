The strategy of aiming at two different targets has not changed over the past 12 months, but now results from large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have become available to optimize and guide the therapy for COVID-19 with more solid evidence, although further improvements could and will certainly emerge from still ongoing RCTs.",

LPV is also an inhibitor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) main protease, a protein crucial for viral replication which is highly conserved also in SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9] . In 2003, two retrospective matched cohort studies indicated a possible favorable effect of LPV/r in patients with SARS-CoV infection [10, 11] , thus ; thus, it seemed reasonable, at least initially, to evaluate its possible use also in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this regard, preliminary data in a ferret animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection showed how LPV/r marginally reduced clinical symptoms but did not significantly impact virus titers [12] . Nevertheless, due to the widespread availability and lack of alternatives, the drug was widely employed in the first phases of COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Initial retrospective reports described a reduced viral shedding in patients treated with LPV/r plus interferon-\u03b1 [13] , but subsequent larger studies of the same type reported opposite results [14] . In a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomized, phase 2 trials conducted in Hong Kong, an early triple antiviral therapy with LPV/r plus ribavirin plus interferon-\u03b2-1b was safe and more efficacious than LPV/r alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding (7 days vs. 12 days) and hospital stay (9 days vs. 14.5 days) in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 [15] . Other doubts about any possible true LPV/r efficacy were suggested by a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conducted in China. In this study, treatment with LPV/r was not associated, in comparison with standard care, with a difference in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio [HR] for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.80) and mortality at 28 days (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, \u22125.8%; 95% CI, \u221217.3 to 5.7). Furthermore, the percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. Overall, no substantial benefits of LPV/r treatment were observed compared to standard care [16] . Similar results were provided by the RECOVERY trial, a large, randomized, controlled, open-label, platform trial, performed across 176 hospitals in the United Kingdom. In this trial, treatment with LPV/r plus standard care was not associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality (23% vs 22%), duration of hospitalization (median of 11 days in both groups), and progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (4% in both groups) when compared to standard care [17] . Finally, in the large, worldwide, World Health Organization (WHO)-sponsored SOLIDARITY trial, the main outcome of death occurred in 148 of 1,399 patients receiving LPV and in 146 of 1,372 receiving its control (rate ratio [RR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25) . No differences in the RR for in-hospital deaths were observed even when patients were stratified by age (<50 years, 50-69 years, \u226570 years) and respiratory support (no mechanical ventilation vs mechanical ventilation) at enrollment. Finally, also the secondary outcomes, initiation of ventilation and time to discharge, were not reduced in patients treated with LPV/r. The WHO's living guidelines did not report any difference between LPV/r and standard care in terms of mortality, progression to mechanical ventilation, viral clearance at 7 days, length of hospitalization, and time to symptoms' resolution, recommending against the use of LPV/r in COVID-19 patients [18] .",

At the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of antiviral agents for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection was mostly based on the promising results of in vitro studies or limited, previous experiences in patients with SARS-CoV infection. This off-label and compassionate use was nonetheless much debated. On the one hand, the principle of \"first, do not harm\" certainly held true [7] , discouraging the use of drugs outside approved indications without clinical studies providing sufficient evidence in terms of efficacy or effectiveness. On the other hand, at the beginning there were obviously neither clinical studies nor alternative agents for treating COVID-19 patients. From this perspective, in our opinion it was reasonable to consider the use of potentially effective agents (based on preliminary in vitro or in vivo data) in those patients worsening despite adequate supportive care, also as off-label/compassionate use whenever the patients could not be enrolled in RCTs (that remained the priority, in order to ultimately provide high certainty of evidence to optimize treatment algorithms and improve patients' care) [6] .",

The available evidence from RCTs, described in the previous sections, currently discourage the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and interferons, which did not show improved efficacy compared to standard care or placebo. With regard to remdesivir, the scenario is more complex. Indeed, while preliminary evidence from the open-label Solidarity RCT does not fully support use of remdesivir even in the subgroup of patients needing oxygen supplementation but not invasive ventilation (i.e., in those patients in whom the drug was efficacious in the ACTT-1 RCT), it is of note that the direction of the effect was toward reduced mortality (RR 0.86, with 95% CI 0.67-1.11), which is in line with the reduced mortality observed in the ACTT-1 RCT in the similar subgroup of patients who were not under invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline (HR for 28-day fatality 0.30, with 95% CI 0.-14-0.64) [37, 40] . In our opinion, pending complete results of the Solidarity RCT, the current body of evidence may support the use of remdesivir in patients requiring oxygen supplementation but still not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, although it should be acknowledged that the true magnitude of this favorable effect still remains controversial.",

            "text": "Eventually, we think three important points should be stressed. The first is that, after only 1 year of COVID-19, we are discussing the use of antivirals on the basis of RCT and not only observational studies. This is extremely important to optimize therapeutic algorithms, and has also shown us once again that, for anti-infective agents, observational studies may be strongly affected by residual and unmeasured confounding, and possibly by publication bias, and should only be considered as hypothesis-generating (i.e., to be confirmed/ refuted by RCT, as correctly was the case for antivirals discussed in the present review). The second point is that, in addition to antivirals, immunomodulatory agents have also been (and still are) tested in RCT for the treatment of COVID-19, with well-known positive results for steroid administration in severely ill patients. From this standpoint, we think an intriguing field of research for the future is the combined use of antiviral and immunomodulatory agents, in the context of a balanced approach taking into account the possible different timing of administration and the different patients' phenotypes (based on laboratory or genetic data), which it is plausible may also explain why no antiviral treatment (if evaluated alone independent of immunomodulatory agents) has been proven very efficacious up to now, although this consideration still remains largely speculative pending further dedicated investigation. Finally, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies also interferes with viral activity (e.g., by preventing membrane fusion or by prompting antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity [68] ), and may be an important weapon against SARS-CoV-2 in the early phases of the disease. A proposal of treatment algorithm in patients with COVID-19, including the current role of antivirals pending further RCT results, is shown in Figure 1 .",
