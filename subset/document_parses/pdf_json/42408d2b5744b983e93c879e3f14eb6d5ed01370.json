[6] [7] [8] COVID-19 infection is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 9 The virus consists of various nonstructural proteins and 4 major structural proteins: the surface-exposed spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins and the internal nucleocapsid (N) protein. 9, 10 The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells, such as pneumocytes in the lung, 11 via binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) within its S1 protein 12 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor. 10, 13 Recent findings indicate that infected patients develop spontaneous antibody-mediated immune responses against viral particles, 10, 14, 15 and an apparent improvement in the clinical status was observed upon treatment with convalescent plasma containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. 16 Indeed, it was recently shown that patient-derived antibodies directed against the viral S protein are able to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 12 However, the exact targets of the clinically relevant antibodies within the polyclonal plasma remain unclear, the potential immunogenicity and clinical relevance of other viral proteins has not been investigated, and individual epitopes of the antibodies present in convalescent plasma and in the blood of COVID-19 patients have not been identified. In addition, it has never been demonstrated whether the complete antiviral immunity can be transferred and detected in the recipient after transfusing a convalescent plasma product.",

We obtained fulllength recombinant proteins for the S1 protein, the RBD within the S1 protein, and the S2 and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. S1, S2, and RBD used in this study were expressed in human 293 cells to preserve structure and glycosylation patterns. Peptide libraries consisting of 20mers overlapping by 10 aa were synthesized for these SARS-CoV-2 proteins and for the M and E proteins. In addition, we obtained a 69-aa synthetic peptide comprising a highly conserved cryptic epitope in the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 19 We performed assay validation assessing sera from 6 patients with PCR-confirmed and symptomatic COVID-19 and from 5 healthy donors for antibodies against the different SARS-CoV-2 proteins and peptides, positive-control antigens influenza H1N1 nucleoprotein (FLU) and tetanus toxoid (TT), and the negative-control protein glutathione-S-transferase. We found that all patients showed strong antibody responses against S1 and the RBD ( Figure 1C ). In addition, all 5 patients showed antibody responses against the S2 and N proteins. Interestingly, the RBD produced synthetically was not recognized by any of the patient-derived antibodies, pointing to glycosylation-dependent and/or conformational epitopes as targets for the antiviral immune responses. Accordingly, we did not observe antibody responses against pooled M and E peptides (data not shown). With the exception of the mammalian cell-expressed RBD, which was recognized by serum from 1 healthy donor, none of the other SARS-CoV-2 proteins were recognized by sera from non-COVID-19 individuals ( Figure 1C ).",
