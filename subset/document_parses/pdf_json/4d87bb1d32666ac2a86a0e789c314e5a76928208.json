This review examines the challenges and opportunities associated with MMM in this population. Recent Findings Locally and internationally, the use of MMM varies. Practical challenges include difficulties with data acquisition, curation, and harmonization with other data sources limiting collaboration. However, efforts toward integration of MMM data, advancements in data science, and the availability of cloud-based infrastructures are now affording the opportunity for MMM to advance the care of patients with brain trauma. Summary MMM provides data to guide the precision management of patients with traumatic brain injury in real time. While challenges exist, there are exciting opportunities for MMM to live up to this promise and to drive new insights into the physiology of the brain and beyond.",

Primary brain injuries are characterized by the pathoanatomic damage incurred by the specific mechanism of trauma, and include contusions, intracranial hemorrhage, and axonal shear injuries. Secondary brain injuries refer to downstream pathology that evolves following the primary brain injury. In patients who eventually die after sTBI, secondary brain injuries such as herniation or necrosis are seen in half and histopathologic evidence of ischemia has been reported in more than 90% [6] . However, \"secondary brain injury\" is a broad term. Brain injuries such as TBI create heterogeneous zones of vulnerable tissue at high risk for further injury [7\u2022\u2022] , resulting from mismatches between the metabolic supply and demand of the brain. After sTBI, inadequate perfusion pressure, brain tissue hypoxia, autoregulatory dysfunction, seizures, and spreading depolarizations of brain tissue have been observed in 50-90% of patients with ramifications for the health and recovery of the brain [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

Clinically, secondary brain injury manifests as neurological deterioration, which occurs in one-quarter of patients with sTBI, increasing mortality from 10 to 56% [8] . The clinical neurological exam is the standard for detecting the clinical sequelae of secondary brain injury. However, early detection is challenging in patients with sTBI due to coma or concomitant injuries that limit the sensitivity of the neurological examination. Snapshots of the brain, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide important information about secondary brain injuries, but typically at a time when damage is no longer reversible. The central use of MMM is to leverage real-time objective measurements of the mechanics, metabolism, and function of the brain to guide clinical management based on each patient's individual pathophysiology and to detect physiologic alterations before secondary brain injuries can occur.",

In the absence of standards, there is significant variability in the clinical practice of neuromonitoring. Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is the most common modality [13] . However, in the USA, as few as 11.5% of patients who might be eligible for ICP monitoring actually undergo the procedure [14] and internationally, significant variability exists in the clinical criteria for its use [15\u2022\u2022] . When brain monitoring is performed, a survey of primarily US institutions showed that most (95%) reported monitoring ICP, whereas cEEG was used by only 58% of the intensivists who responded, followed by transcranial Doppler (TCD; 49%) [13] . This experience mirrors that across 66 centers in Europe, in which TCD was used by 38% and brain tissue oxygen monitoring by 19%.

Furthermore, computational algorithms are required to infer optimum targets for cerebral perfusion pressure (ICM+\u00ae; Cambridge, UK). Tools such as this highlight the need for access to time-resolute data and an ability to manipulate that data through either existing or home-grown software. In a review of the capabilities of centers involved in TBI research internationally, barriers to the use of MMM data included lack of access to waveform-level data; variability in the recording, capture, and labeling of specific measurements; a lack of standard annotations to understand the impact of bedside events; and a lack of automated integration with other clinical information, such as imaging [18\u2022\u2022] .",

Neurocritical monitoring involves supplementing standard ICU data such as the electrocardiogram, ABP, respiratory and ventilator parameters, and temperature with brain-specific measurements such as ICP, PbtO2, or EEG. The volume of this waveform-level, high-resolution data at scale is incredibly large precluding permanent storage at most institutions, although devicespecific data from individual patients can often be acquired and stored locally. For example, ICP recorded through the Camino\u00ae Intracranial Pressure Monitor (Natus Medical Incorporated; Pleasanton, CA) can be exported as a continuous, high-resolution waveform. However, this often requires direct interaction with the monitor itself or additional connectivity solutions to send the data to an intermediary server. When several such devices are used to generate measurements, a significant barrier occurs when each device manufacturer uses proprietary methods for collecting and converting signals or unique communication protocols. Details about the name of the device, the location of the monitoring probe, the units used to measure the ICP, and the sampling frequency may be missing or variably expressed based on the proprietary format of the metadata. These include important considerations in terms of how the data were recorded, too. The validity of ICP measurement using an external ventricular drainage catheter (EVD) depends on whether or not cerebrospinal fluid drainage was being performed concomitantly with ICP measurements, and at what level the catheter had been leveled. Additionally, even when signals can be acquired, they lack synchronization with other contextual data, such as medication administration. Without adequate synchronized, timestamped annotations, data interpretation may be limited.",

Existing electronic health record (EHR) systems do not enable the collection of waveform-resolution data in neurocritical care units such that this potentially rich source of data is not integrated with a patient's clinical record. Systems have been developed to collect and integrate data from multiple devices, such as the bedside CNS Monitor (Moberg Solutions, Inc; Ambler, PA), the BedMasterEx TM software platform (Excel Medical Electronics, Inc; Jupiter, FL), the PC-based ICM + \u00ae software, or the cloud-based Sickbay TM platform (Medical informatics Corp; Houston, TX). Yet, to date, these solutions do not integrate seamlessly with the EHR. MMM research often requires development of ad hoc data infrastructures in order to collect, integrate, and share data between sites. This process can be extremely time-consuming and expensive, resulting in scattered systems all attempting to achieve a similar task. Currently, there is no universally agreed-upon standard format for multidimensional data including the high-resolution data recorded in neurocritical care, but there are examples of frameworks that are being adopted, such as the HDF5 format [19] . For EEG data, the EDF/EDF+ standard has been widely adopted, and as a result there are data repositories and analysis software solutions that have grown to support this format independent of the EEG platform used for data collection. Developing a standard data format with defined metadata to capture critical device information and contextual clinical events in the form of annotations will prove invaluable for systems in which collected data then can be easily organized, shared, and stored for clinical or research use.",

Stimulation-based paradigms that link clinical activity or neurologic examination to physiologic data may shed light on phenotypes such as coma recovery [21, 22] , but these techniques similarly require pragmatic data cleaning in order to facilitate test-retest reliability. Spatial co-registration is also required for functional imaging, for instance, merging metabolic imaging data with EEG [23, 24] . Software used for analyzing different data modalities depends upon the type of data and may employ data-specific processing (e.g., Persyst\u00ae [Persyst; Solana Beach, CA] for EEG data; ICM + \u00ae for ICP and ABP data) before the data can be linked. This suggests a role for an application programming interface (API) to facilitate interoperability and analysis in the clinical environment.",

The National Institutes of Health have further defined core, supplemental, and exploratory Common Data Elements for patients with specific clinical phenotypes, including TBI [30] . In the case of the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format used for imaging data, terminologies were developed in conjunction with the data format, but this standard has suffered from significant variability in the structure and use of its metadata. A strategy to define terminology as part of the core metadata within a data format may allow for hierarchical file structures that incorporate distinct data types, including timestamps for high-resolution physiologic data, as in the open-source HDF5 format [19] . More recently, standards have evolved to define concepts and their relationship with other ontologies, including SNOMED and LOINC mentioned above. The Observational health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium has adopted the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. Other standards such as the Informatics for Integrating Biology at the Bedside (i2B2) data model have been developed and tools are now available to harmonize between standards such that an increasing number of sites may be able to combine health data for collaborative research [31] .",

Movements to standardize the clinical reporting and interpretation of MMM data may serve as a guide to a more systematic understand of how MMM may be interpreted clinically. Yet, the ability for humans to process multiple sources of independent data is inherently limited. Computational analytic approaches integrating MMM data complement these efforts by uncovering complex inter-relationships between the body and the brain [40, 41] , the network architecture of the brain itself [42] , and the regulation of cerebral blood flow after injury [16] . The clinical utility of MMM data will require clinical experience married with sophisticated computational tools. Early examples of this include cluster-based analyses uncovering patterns within MMM data that correspond to unique cohorts of patients with different outcomes and individual physiologic states that evolve over time [43, 44] .

Device data is sent to a bedside CNS monitor which acts to aggregate data sources. For the data path from devices to aggregator, we used the devices' proprietary protocols since no standard medical device communications protocol has yet been widely adopted. Software was written to implement the data path subsequently from clinical sites to the cloud object storage repository. This upload portal is capable of user authentication, initial error-checking, and secure transfer to cloud object storage. Data is mapped to standardized labels and metadata is extracted. Events and annotations noted at the bedside are extracted from a separate data file.",

When recurrent seizures or status epilepticus (SE) occurs, patients may be treated with anesthetic coma. However, when sedation is weaned, uncertain EEG patterns may emerge that mimic SE [49] , albeit transiently, before EEG begins to improve [50] . In contrast, weaning sedative medications may be informed by changes in EEG activity not apparent to the human eye [51] . Therefore, inclusion of medication data from the EHR may be instrumental to understanding EEG monitoring data during liberation from anesthetics, limiting morbidity associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and sedation.",

Operating at CPP opt may limit the sequelae of falling below the lower limits of autoregulation (ischemia, hypoxia, elevations in ICP) or riding above the upper limits of autoregulation (hyperemia, elevations in ICP). Identification of CPP opt requires 10-s measurements of average ICP and mean arterial pressure to generate a 5-min moving average correlation coefficient termed the pressure reactivity index (PRx), which is mapped against average CPP values yielding a U-shaped curve [16] . As a proof of concept, we developed a graphical user interface that incorporates second-by-second ICP and ABP from the CNS monitor translated to Matlab (MathWorks; Natick, MA) format and published multi-window weighting algorithms [52] to generate a time-series of estimated CPP opt values. Communication of CPP opt into the EHR forms a critical next step through the Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies (SMART) standard using a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) API.",

For example, ICP measurements recorded while an EVD is clamped are not useful for calculating the PRx, but these epochs can be readily distinguished from valid, pulsatile ICP waveform data. Artifact reduction technologies for EEG data are more mature, but there is a need for data-specific algorithms. Second, contextual clinical data requires automated methods of accurate time-synchronized annotation. Currently, bedside annotations are not standardized and medication administration data contained within the EHR may be inaccurate by minutes or even hours in some cases. Finally, metadata that captures data critical for the interpretation of MMM data is needed, likely as an extension of the existing NIH/NINDS Common Fig. 1 A medical record for the brain. A schematic depicting an architecture designed to overcome many of the challenges to the use of multimodality monitoring for clinical and research use. Nodes refer to sources of data including devices such as bedside vital sign monitoring devices, intracranial monitoring devices, or systems designed to capture electroencephalography activity. Nodes also refer to sources of clinical and contextual data such as the electronic health record (EHR) or annotations made at bedside, as shown here through an interactive touchscreen interface. Blue arrows indicate data pathways, which refer to methods of moving data from one node to another. Harmonization mapping refers to methods that allow for disparate data paths to link to a specific patient encounter and to synchronize with date/time stamps using standard definitions or labels. These standards further allow harmonization across patients and institutions. Harmonized data is then uploaded to a cloud-based object storage repository in order to maximize collaboration while limiting local resource utilization Data Elements and incorporated into Common Data Models and/or open-source, portable data formats.",
