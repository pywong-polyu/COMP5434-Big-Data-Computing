In response to this dire situation, the global research community has made major efforts to develop novel treatments for prevention and therapy of COVID-19. These include vaccines that induce host immunity [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , small molecules that counteract pathological progression [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that prevent the virus from entering host cells [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Experimental treatments based on COVID-19 convalescent sera, which contain nAbs, showed promising clinical effects that can help prevent progression to intensive care and mortality for infected individuals [19, 20] .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by the engagement of the spike (S) protein receptorbinding domain (RBD) to the host receptor molecule, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This binding triggers subsequent conformational changes within the S protein that enable viral entry. Most neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) therefore target the RBD to compete with ACE2 and prevent viral entry. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, several nAbs were developed for SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV [21] . As SARS--CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 74% sequence similarity in their RBDs, nAbs against SARS-CoV are potentially available for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 [15, 17] . Furthermore, single chain nanobodies from llamas that recognize SARS-CoV S RBD can also bind to the RBD of SARS--CoV-2 S protein with high affinities [22] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, major efforts have also been devoted to identifying nAbs from COVID-19 convalescent sera [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 23] . In parallel, mouse immunization and phage display were also utilized to identify potential therapeutic Abs against SARS-CoV-2 [24] . In order to optimize treatment efficacy, it is desirable to develop cocktails of nAbs that can simultaneously bind different sites of the RBD and synergistically neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [14, 25, 26] .",

These mAbs potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with high affinity. The 12 most effective neutralizing chimeric Abs (chAbs) exhibited potent neutralizing capability to reduce 50% of plaque counts in the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), yielding the PRNT 50 residues within the receptor binding motif (RBM) required for neutralizing activities of these mAbs. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed atomic details of the structural epitopes of two representative chAbs, which could potentially be used in a cocktail therapy. The prophylactic and therapeutic potentials of these antibodies and their combination were confirmed in SARS-CoV-2 mouse and hamster infection models, wherein injection of the therapeutic mAb cocktail markedly reduced the virus titers, underscoring their potential to be used in prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, a cocktail of therapeutic chAbs targeting separate epitopes on the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may increase therapeutic efficacy and decrease the potential for virus escape mutants, providing additional benefit to tackle the emergence of new variants that harbor multiple mutations within the S protein.",

A total of 38 mAbs were generated, and their binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was determined by ELISA ( Fig 1A) . We first examined the in vitro competition abilities of all RBD-specific hybridoma clones against SARS-CoV-2 using human ACE2-overexpressing 293T cells and flow cytometry (S2A Fig). 17 of the 38 mAbs showed more than 80% inhibition of ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S RBD. To improve the clinical applicability of these mAbs, the 17 SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-specific mAbs were engineered into human IgG1 chimeric antibodies (chAbs). The V H and V L domains of the neutralizing mAbs from hybridoma cell lines were identified and grafted onto a human IgG1 and kappa backbone to generate 12 chAb clones. The binding of all chAbs to SARS-CoV-2 RBD or S recombinant protein were evaluated by ELISA, and the EpEX-His protein [27] was used as a control protein (Fig 1B-1G ). RBD-chAb-28, -45, and -51 exhibited the highest binding signals for recombinant RBD (Fig 1B) . RBD-chAb-51 was the most potent, in terms of antigen binding ( Fig 1C) . HEK-293 cells that overexpress SARS-CoV-2 S RBD on the cell surface were used to evaluate chAb binding. In this context, the binding activities of RBD-chAb-1, -15, -34, -45, and -51 were approximately two-fold weaker compared to the signals to purified protein ( Fig  1E-1G ). Expression of full-length S protein on the cell surface further confirmed the binding of these chAbs ( Fig 1F) . As a negative control, HEK-293 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S2 domain on the cell surface were not recognized by the chAbs (Fig 1G) . To assess the possible neutralization abilities for all 12 chAbs, we performed in vitro neutralization studies by PRNT. All tested RBD-specific chAbs, but except RBD-chAb- 26 These six chAbs were highly specific to SARS-CoV-2 S protein. None were found to crossreact with the S proteins of the other six human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hCo-V-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-229E, with the sole exception of RBD-chAb-15, which exhibited partial cross-reactivity to the S1 domain of SARS-CoV S protein (S3A Fig). Additional assessments of antibody specificity (lack of cross-reactivity with whole organs) were performed by staining the FDA human normal organ tissue array. The appropriate amounts of antibodies required for immunocytochemistry staining were assessed using RBDexpressing 293T cells as a reference. All six chAbs showed clear binding to RBD-expressing cells at 1 \u03bcg/ml (S3B Fig and Table A in S1 Text). We then used a higher concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ ml to examine the cross-reactivity of each chAb with a multi-normal tissue array. No tissue cross-reactivity was observed for six major target organs (lungs, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, and larynx) for any of the tested chAbs (S3C Fig and Table A in S1 Text). Further analyses with 27 other human organs, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, adrenal gland, ovary, pancreas, parathyroid gland, hypophysis, testis, thyroid gland, breast, tonsil, thymus, bone marrow, cardiac muscle, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, salivary gland, prostate, A. ELISA-reactivity of anti-RBD mAbs. Each anti-RBD mAb was serially diluted from 0.1 \u03bcg/ml to 0.8 ng/ml, then incubated in a RBD-His recombinant protein (0.5 \u03bcg/ml)-coated plate in an ELISA. OD 450 , Optical density at 450 nm. B-D. Binding of anti-RBD chAbs was determined by ELISA. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-His or S-His were immobilized on 96-well plates prior to blocking with 1% BSA in PBS and incubated with diluted anti-RBD chAbs at concentrations ranging from 1000 ng/ml to 0.25 ng/ml. Signal was detected (OD) after labeling with Donkey anti-human IgG-HRP secondary antibody. EpEX-His served as a negative control. E-G. Binding of anti-RBD chAbs was assessed by cellular ELISA. HEK-293T cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2 RBD-flag-His, S2-flag-His or S-flag-His plasmids. A series of dilutions for anti-RBD chAbs were added to the 96-well plates. The ODs were detected with Goat anti-human IgG F(ab') 2 -HRP secondary antibody.

Notably, the epitope for RBD-chAb-25 appears to partially overlap with that of RBD-chAb-1, 15 and -28 (Fig 3B-3F ). We therefore classified the six chAbs into three distinct groups, each of which recognized a unique epitope on the RBD (Fig 3B and 3C ). Structural analysis of ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 S RBD indicated that K417, Y453, Q474, F486, Q498, T500, and N501 within the RBD make direct contacts with ACE2 forming part of the RBM [28] . These residues are categorized into three clusters, namely Q498, T500 and N501 at the proximal end of the RBM, K417 and Y453 in the middle of RBM, and Q474 and F486 at the distal end of the RBM [28] . To dissect the contributions of these residues to the neutralizing effects of our RBD-chAbs, we carried out alanine scanning of the residues A. Schematic illustration of the experimental design of the epitope competition-binding assay. First, RBD-His was captured by RBD-neutralizing chAbs on a 96-well plate. Second, 10-fold capture antibody was added to saturate the RBD. Third, biotinylated RBD-chAb was added to compete with capture RBD-chAb. Finally, HRP-conjugated streptavidin was added to bind the biotinylated reporter RBD-chAb, and competitive binding was detected by optical density at 450 nm (OD 450 ). B. Results of triplicate epitope competition-binding assays for RBD-chAb-1, -15, -25, -28, -45, and -51 are shown. EpEX-His served as a negative control (Crtl: without biotin-RBD-chAb). All data points are shown, along with the mean \u00b1 SD. C. Heatmap of the epitope competition-binding assay results. The detected OD 450 values are colored according to the scale bar shown in the right. D-E. Epitope mapping of RBD-neutralizing antibodies by mutagenesis. Normalized binding to RBD alanine variants by RBD-chAbs with respect to that of wild type (WT) based on ELISA. The human 293T cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant RBD plasmids with combinatorial alanine mutations. The binding of RBD-chAbs to the RBD mutants was examined by cellular ELISA. F. Structural mapping of key residues on the RBD responsible for the recognition by RBD-chAbs. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD in complex with ACE2 (PDB entry: 6M0J) is shown on the white/grey surface. Regions in the RBD within 4 \u00c5 of any atoms of ACE2 (defined as RBM) are outlined in black. The positions of the key residues, Y453, F486 and N501, are indicated.

Moreover, RBD-chAb-45 and -51 responded similarly to different singleton mutations, with the F486 mutation being the most disruptive, suggesting that RBD-chAb-45 and -51 bind to the same epitope ( Fig  3D) . We subsequently generated combinations of singleton mutations and evaluated the effects on RBD-chAb binding. The K417A/Y453A and Q498A/T500A/N501A mutations were found to substantially reduce binding of RBD-chAb-25. The K417A/Y453A mutations had a similar effect on RBD-chAb-28. The Q474A/F486A mutations were more disruptive for RBD-chAb-45 and RBD-chAb-51 ( Fig 3E) .

To verify their simultaneous binding, we mixed RBD-chAb-25 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein and isolated the binary complex by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), followed by the addition of RBD-chAb-45 for another round of SEC analysis (Fig 5B) . A clear shift in the elution volume of the main peak was observed, indicating the formation of a ternary complex, wherein the added RBD-chAb-45 was bound to the complex of RBD-chAb-25 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein, despite the limited space around the three RBDs to accommodate more than PLOS PATHOGENS SARS-CoV-2 potent neutralizing antibody cocktail three chAbs. The same shift in elution peak was observed when RBD-chAb-25 was added to the complex of RBD-chAb-45 bound SARS-CoV-2 S protein, i.e., in reverse mixing order (Figs 4A, 4D and 5B).

The resolution of the EM map was limited, in part due to the conformational heterogeneity of the nAbs in complex with the RBD. However, the resolution was sufficient for us to dock the Fabs of RBD-chAb-25 and -45 onto the RBD, which required considerable conformational rearrangements of the relative orientation of the Fab of chAb-45 with respect to the binary S-chAb-45 complex for one of the three RBDs (Fig 5C and 5D ). While the cryo-EM map of the Fab of RBD-chAb-45 could be seen at a lower threshold for the other two RBDs, the EM map corresponding to the Fab of RBD-chAb-25 was less visible in the other two RBDs. The lack of EM-density from RBD-chAb-25 could be attributed to either conformational heterogeneity or substoichiometric binding. While the exact binding stoichiometry of the ternary complex remains to be established, our SEC and cryo-EM analyses provided good evidence of the simultaneous binding of RBD-chAb-25 and -45 to the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD, that could serve as the basis for antibody cocktail therapy developments.",

We administered a single intraperitoneal injection of low-dose RBD-chAb-25, -28, -45 and -51 at 1.5 mg/kg one day prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig 6E-6H ). The virus titer was determined from the lung tissue of each hamster at the third day after infection. Although no body weights were changed ( Fig 6F) and only RBD-chAb-45 caused a statistically significant decrease in the level of virus RNA measured by RT-qPCR (Fig 6G) , the TCID 50 values were decreased in all chAb-treated groups, and the effect was especially significant in the RBD-chAb-45-treated group at the third day post-infection compared to the control group ( Fig 6H) . We further assessed the efficacy of the cocktail of the two best RBD-chAbs (RBD-chAb-25 and -45) to hamsters (Fig 6I-6K) . A single intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 or 4.5 mg/ kg both RBD-chAb or 4.5 mg/kg single RBD-chAb one day prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred dramatic protection, according to the infectious SARS-CoV-2 titers at the third day PLOS PATHOGENS SARS-CoV-2 potent neutralizing antibody cocktail post infection. Body weights were not changed in the group injected with 1.5 mg/kg antibody and may have even been slightly increased in the group receiving 4.5 mg/kg antibody ( Fig 6I) . Importantly, the virus RNA and TCID 50 values were decreased drastically in groups that received combinations of RBD-chAb-25 and -45 (1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg of each antibody, 3 or 9 mg/kg of total antibody at 3 days post-infection ( Fig 6J and 6K ). As the lower dose of neutralizing antibodies may induce antibody-dependent enhancement infection in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters [30] , we tested 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg of each RBD-mAb-25, -45, or the combination treated at three or five days prior to intranasal challenge of SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters ( Fig  7A) . No body weight loss was observed at the third day after virus challenge (Fig 7B) , and significant reduction of viral load was seen (Fig 7C and 7D) . Notably, when using the low dose of these two antibodies (1.5 mg/kg) or their combination (3.0 mg/kg), we did not find that any of the neutralizing antibodies enhance disease. In groups receiving a combination of RBD-chAb-25 and -45, the neutralizing activity (TCID 50 values) exhibited a synergistic effect compared to those receiving single treatments of RBD-chAb-25 or -45 (Figs 6K and 7D ).",

The structural epitopes are generally hydrophilic, and the intermolecular interactions mostly involve hydrogen bonding. Additionally, F486 of the RBD is sandwiched by a T-shaped edge-to-face \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with Y94 L and a CH-\u03c0 interaction with T59 H of RBD-chAb-45 ( Fig 4F) . This unique binding motif may help stabilize the complex formation despite its relatively small binding interface compared to that of RBD-chAb-25 (Fig 4B and 4E ). Of all reported structures for SARS-CoV-2 S protein in complex with antibodies and nanobodies, only six showed all three RBDs in an upward, open conformation [12, 14, 15, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . By lifting the RBD upward, more binding surface is made available to other nAbs (Fig 4A and 4D) . Indeed, molecular modeling of RBD-chAb-25 and -45 in complex with the RBD suggested the possibility that these two Abs could bind simultaneously to the same RBD by occupying two distinct structural epitopes (Fig 5A) , a finding which was subsequently confirmed by SEC analyses (Figs 5B and S9) . As the collective contributions to the binding interface of RBD-chAb-25 and -45 essentially cover the entire RBM of ACE2 (Fig 3F) , the combined use of these two Abs is expected to exhibit strong synergy in neutralizing SARS--CoV-2; this synergistic neutralization was confirmed by our in vivo animal model studies (Figs  6K and 7D ).",

Since the release of the first SARS-CoV-2 complete sequence [48] , 28811 point mutations have been identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome [49]. Non-silent mutations in specific residues may severely disrupt nAb epitopes or enhance viral infection. Among these mutants, the D614G point mutation is the most prevalent [50, 51] . This point mutation in the S1 domain (not in the RBD) is frequently recognized by nAbs, and it leads to a more stable S protein and higher virus infectivity [51] [52] [53] . In addition to the D614G mutant, more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants have been reported [54] . While some mutations outside the RBD site were found to escape antibody binding [55] , all six of our potent antibodies retained high binding signals when tested with S protein variants harboring some of the most common mutations on the GISAD sequencing database for COVID-19 on determined by qRT-PCR and median tissue culture infectious dose per ml (TCID 50 /ml).

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 potent neutralizing antibody cocktail December, 2020 (S10A Fig). Residue N501 within the RBM is highly mutable in various infectious SARS-CoV-2 strains, including the recently emerged United Kingdom variant B.1.1.7 and the South African variant B.1.351, which are more infectious than the original strain [56] . We continue to track the binding of these six antibodies to other common SARS-CoV-2 mutant variants, including N501Y, using cellular ELISA (S10B Fig). Nearly all of the antibodies retain the ability to recognize most common mutation variants, with only RBD-chAb- 25 showing poor binding to the N501Y mutant (S10B Fig). Three major mutations of concern within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., N501Y, K417N/ K417T and E484K) are present in the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil) variants, and were recently reported to disrupt binding by several prominent nAbs, including REGEN10933, 2-15, LY-Cov555, and CT-P59 [57] . We have tested the neutralization activities of our antibodies against these mutant RBD recombinant proteins using ELISA and pseudotype viruses for B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 (S10C-S10F Fig) . Fortunately, RBD-chAb-45 and -51, which share almost the same epitope, retained high binding ability for all three major variants of concern. Although RBD-chAb-25 lost its binding ability for the N501Y mutant form of RBD and B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 pseudoviruses, it still retained the ability to recognize K417N and E484K mutant RBD proteins (S10C Fig) . Furthermore, the antibody cocktail, RBD-chAb-25 and -45, was tested against D614G, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 pseudoviruses. The cocktail showed IC 50 values close to those of RBD-chAb-45 only, meaning that the effect was not diminished due to the loss neutralization ability for RBD-chAb-25 (S10F Fig). Although mutations of N501 could perturb the binding of RBD-chAb-25 to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4C) , none of the reported mutations within the RBD overlaps with the epitope of RBD-chAb-45 ( Fig 4F) . In addition, the E484K mutation is not located within the binding surfaces of RBD-chAb-25 and RBD-chAb-45 according to our cryo-EM analysis (S11 Fig). Although the K417N mutation is located within the binding epitope of RBD-chAb25, it is at the edge of the binding surface (S11 Fig), and RBD-chAb25 still retains the ability to bind the RBD (S10C Fig). These findings suggest that the cocktail of RBD-chAb-25 and -45 might be effective at overcoming drug resistance due to escape mutations. This is similar to REGEN10987, which retains neutralizing activity for SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 [57] . Interestingly, we have identified the cryo-EM structure of RBD-chAb-15 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found the combination of RBD-chAb-15 and -45 show a synergistic effect toward B.1.1.7 in the pseudovirus neutralization assay [58] . Therefore, our six chimeric antibodies can be used strategically to create cocktail therapies against multiple SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains.",

Additionally, Liu and co-workers demonstrated additive inhibitory effects for cocktail antibodies [18] . The crystal structure of one of the antibodies, B38, has an epitope that largely overlaps with the ACE2 binding interface, which is similar to the epitope of RBD-chAb-25 in our study. Crowe and co-workers also reported the use of cocktail antibodies to increase the protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection in an animal model. A low-resolution EM structure was demonstrated the simultaneous binding of two nAbs to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 [34] . While our current study provides very similar findings to those above, including the efficacies derived from in vitro and in vivo neutralization assays, we provide additional information that was hitherto unavailable. First, we determined the atomic structures of two potent nAbs, namely RBD-chAb-25 and -45 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which revealed an unusual 3:3 binding stoichiometry (Fig 4) . In other words, both RBD-chAbs occupy all three RBDs to preclude ACE2 binding to the S protein, although RBD-chAb-25 is similar to REGEN10933 (one of the antibodies in",

For both RBD-chAb-25 and -45, the majority of classes corresponded to an all-open state for all three RBDs. Particles within the best class were used for further processing by using non-uniform 3D refinement imposed with C1 symmetry. The overall resolution of the EM map was estimated by the goldstandard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 (Table B in S1 Text). To improve the resolution at the mAb binding interface of S-chAb-25 and S-chAb-45 complexes, a focused refinement procedure was employed. For S-chAb-25, a further local refinement with a focus mask covering the NTD, RBD and chAb-25 was performed in cryoSPARC. For S-chAb-45, the particles of NU-refinement were symmetrically expanded by C3 symmetry, then converted to Relion-3.0 using the pyem script (developed by Daniel Asarnow, https://github.com/asarnow/ pyem). A further focus classification with a focus mask corresponding to the RBD and chAb-45 was implemented in Relion. The particles of the best 3D class were selected and transferred to cryoSPARC for another round of local refinement with same focus mask.
