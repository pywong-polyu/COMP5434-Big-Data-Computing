Further, pandemic-related loss of employment may diminish our sense of worth, our identity, and the meaningfulness of our lives. At the same time, conditions of social isolation can place undue strain on our primary relational figures, eroding these security-enhancing relationships.

This process entails making meaning of challenging events, such as the pandemic, by restoring or revising violated core beliefs. Grief research has shown that poor mental health outcomes following death-related loss are mediated by failed attempts to make meaning, wherein the bereft struggle to rebuild beliefs and life-narratives that were violated by the death ( Boelen et al., 2015 ; Milman et al., 2018 Milman et al., , 2019a Milman et al., , 2019b Neimeyer, 2019 ; Park, 2008 ) .

Specifically, this study assesses both processes in terms of their capacity to explain the severity of depression, general anxiety, and CA, beyond the influence of demographic variables that have been associated with pandemic mental health in previous studies (for studies examining demographics see Lee et al., 2020a Lee et al., , 2020c Mazza et al., 2020 ; Park et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020 ) and substantial pandemic stressors including direct COVID impacts (diagnosis and death) and indirect COVID impacts (unemployment, increased living costs, and loss of childcare). Further, this study seeks to highlight violation of core beliefs and disrupted meaning making as a common, explanatory mechanism mediating the effects of each pandemic stressor on the severity of depression, general anxiety, and CA. Specifically, the study tests the hypothesis that each pandemic risk factor exacerbates depression, general anxiety, and CA as a result of its association with the violation of core beliefs and the disruption of meaning making. This research is intended to provide an empirical basis for the first model describing how poor mental health outcomes develop during the pandemic. Ultimately, such a model establishes targets for clinical intervention in the context of diverse pandemic stressors.",

The first three blocks of predictor variables -demographics, indirect COVID stressors, and direct COVID stressors -were entered based on theoretical considerations regarding the relative impact of each type of predictor on COVID mental health. Specifically, the influence of more generic demographic variables (e.g., education) on COVID mental health might be expected to be lower than that of indirect COVID-specific stressors, such as job loss.

In other words, core belief violation appears to fully mediate the impact of each secondary stressor on CA. Of note, when core belief violation served as the mediator, losing childcare was the only secondary stressor that did not demonstrate a direct effect on PHQ-4 scores, suggesting that core belief violation also fully mediates the impact of childcare loss on depression and general anxiety.",

These processes, core belief violation and disrupted meaning making, explained the severity of mental health symptoms to a greater degree than did multiple, substantial COVID stressors. Specifically, core belief violation and disrupted meaning making accounted for nearly a quarter of the variance in depression and general anxiety, which is twice the variance explained collectively by demographics (gender, age, ethnicity, and education), direct COVID stressors (diagnosis and death), and indirect COVID stressors (unemployment, loss of childcare, and increased living costs). This is particularly striking given that the COVID stressors and the demographic variables assessed in this study have been associated with pandemic mental health in previous research (e.g., Mazza et al., 2020 ; Park et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020 ) and in this study (see Table 2 ). When coronavirus anxiety (CA) was examined as an outcome, the results were similar with nearly a third of the variance in CA explained by core belief violation and disrupted meaning making, as compared with one fifth explained by demographics and COVID stressors. Core belief violation also had significantly stronger correlations with all mental health outcomes than did experiencing a COVID death or diagnosis. In fact, when core belief violation and disrupted meaning making were accounted for, experiencing a COVID death no longer significantly predicted depression and general anxiety. Such findings suggest that these cognitive processes are more closely related to pandemic mental health than both direct and indirect COVID stressors. Crucially, both cognitive processes appear to mediate the influence of pandemic stressors on the severity of depression, general anxiety, and CA. Specifically, both direct and indirect COVID stressors were associated with increased core belief violation and decreased meaning making. In turn, those whose core beliefs were more violated by the pandemic and those who made less Table 4 Testing the mediation hypothesis with core belief as the mediator. meaning of the pandemic experienced greater depression, general anxiety, and CA. These findings highlight two cognitive processes as shared explanatory mechanisms mediating the adverse mental health impacts of multiple, diverse pandemic stressors. The first of these processes, core belief violation, appears to dictate whether the pandemic is experienced as a traumatic event. The assumptive world theory of trauma posits that on a cognitive level traumatic experiences are defined by the disruption of core beliefs ( Cann et al., 2010 ; Janoff-Bulman, 1989 ; Park and Kennedy, 2017 ; Park et al., 2016 ) . According to this theory, if an event undermines foundational, largely implicit beliefs that govern everyday functioning, it takes on a traumatic quality. Applying this theory to COVID suggests that it is not the objective circumstances of the pandemic but rather their impact on core beliefs that determines whether the pandemic is experienced in a manner that is characteristic of a trauma, even in cases where the pandemic does present threat of death and/or serious injury. Within this framework, the study's findings suggest that the presence of core belief violation, and the ensuing disorientation as to the self, the world, and the future, establishes the perceived catastrophic, existentially-threatening nature of the pandemic, resulting in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and CA.",

The meaning making process entails revision of violated beliefs, rendering such beliefs more useful and adaptive ( Boelen et al., 2015 ; Neimeyer, 2019 ; Park, 2010 ) . For example, COVID illness may challenge the notion that one's life circumstances are stable and secure, but making meaning of COVID illness can foster a more nuanced belief that life should be cherished and lived fully precisely because stability and security are not guaranteed. As another example, a COVID job loss could initially undermine achievement-oriented definitions of self-worth, but ultimately lead one to consider new sources of self-worth such as perseverance despite setbacks. In each case, the pandemic violates core beliefs, which are then modified giving rise to new and reaffirming meanings.",

Indeed, each of the considerable pandemic stressors examined in this study -loss of livelihood, increased costs of living, loss of child care, COVID illness, and the COVID death of a significant relational figurewas associated with less meaning made of the pandemic. Crucially, participants who struggled to make meaning also experienced more severe depression, anxiety, and CA. Similar findings have been demonstrated in grief research, where a variety of loss-related stressors, ranging from violent cause of death to low post-loss social support, have been found to exacerbate mental health symptoms by undermining survivors' capacity to make meaning of their grief ( Boelen et al., 2015 ; Milman et al., 2018 Milman et al., , 2019a Rozalski et al., 2017 ) . Perhaps then, as is the case with grief and stress-coping more generally, adapting to the challenges posed by the pandemic depends substantially on one's ability to make meaning of these challenges. In other words, as suggested by the work of Victor Frankl, it may be that we are \"ready and willing to shoulder any suffering \" as long as we can \"see a meaning in it \" ( Frankl, 1961 , p. 5 ).",

By contrast, core belief violation and meaning making are cognitive processes that can be influenced in a clinical setting, and as such, offer a target for intervention. For example, a clinician might recognize that career endeavors are central to the identity of a client who has experienced a COVID job loss. The clinician might then work collaboratively to find meaning in this pandemic-imposed circumstance by reframing the job loss in terms of opportunities to consider new career trajectories or by bolstering relational aspects of the client's identity in a compensatory fashion (e.g., investing in family relationships that may have been neglected). This approach to working with pandemic mental health draws on well-established psychotherapy traditions. For example, existential and narrative interventions use cognitive and experiential techniques to elicit and where necessary, support clients in reconsidering their identities, life stories, and worldviews so as to better adapt to challenging events ( Kelly, 1955 ; Madigan, 2011 ; May and Yalom, 1989 ; Neimeyer, 2009 Neimeyer, , 2012 White, 2007 ) . Using a more solution-focused and directive approach, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on identifying and challenging beliefs that are no longer adaptive and/or accurate representations of the client's life experiences ( Beck and Beck, 2011 ; Boelen and van Den Bout, 2012 ; Wenzel, 2012 ) . These and other evidence-based therapies can inform clinicians working to mitigate the mental health toll of the pandemic by offering a variety of techniques for recognizing how the pandemic may have threatened a client's belief system and how this threat can be negotiated. Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID pandemic and its sweeping impacts on daily life, this research provides crucial insights and guidance on how we can apply and adapt existing psychotherapy approaches to working with a wide variety of pandemic circumstances.",

            "text": "Some limitations must be considered when interpreting the findings from this research. This study was conducted entirely within the US. Thus, despite the representativeness of the study's sample, in terms of ethnicity and education in the US, as well as its diversity in terms of gender, age, and geographical area of residence within the US (see Table 1 ), it is unclear how the study's findings translate to the global pandemic experience. Nevertheless, preliminary research has suggested that core belief violation and meaning making are relevant to COVID mental health in other national contexts ( Trzebi \u0144 ski et al., 2020 ). In addition, although the PHQ-4 is a validated and widely-used screening instrument adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect national mental health statistics on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020 ), it does not provide a multidimensional evaluation of depression and anxiety. Thus, future research would benefit from testing the proposed model of pandemic health internationally and with the use of a more detailed assessment of depressive and anxious symptomatology. Furthermore, this study employed a cross-sectional design, and therefore could not exclude the possibility of alternative causal orders in the hypothesized relationships. Despite research highlighting core belief violation and disrupted meaning making as processes driving poor mental health following stressful events ( Boelen et al., 2015 ; Milman et al., 2018 Milman et al., , 2019a Neimeyer, 2019 ; Park, 2010 ) , the reverse is also possible: it may be that poor mental health violates core beliefs and disrupts meaning making. However, this scenario is particularly unlikely in the case of CA, which is defined exclusively in terms of physical symptoms such as lightheadedness and loss of appetite. Conceptually, broad physical symptoms of this nature have not been identified as causal factors undermining specific beliefs about the self, the world, and the future. Yet another possibility is that pandemic stressors directly disrupt mental health, core beliefs, and meaning making; in turn, poor mental health, violated core beliefs, and low levels of meaning may then mutually exacerbate one another over time. The plausibility of these various alternatives must be assessed using prospective longitudinal designs or intervention studies that address pandemic-related mental health by targeting challenged belief systems.",

            "text": "A final limitation of this study is related to the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) as a recruitment platform. Concerns have been voiced regarding the physical isolation of MTurk participants, which can lead to lack of survey comprehension or inattentiveness (e.g., if partici-pants are unable to easily seek clarification regarding questions), causing internal and external validity to be compromised ( Aruguete et al., 2019 ; Kees et al., 2017 ; Thomas and Clifford, 2017 ) . As such, scholarship recommends the use of multiple screener item sets assessing participant attentiveness, comprehension, and other types of problematic responding ( Thomas and Clifford, 2017 ) . This study did not employ such screener items because maintaining survey brevity while accommodating measurement of all necessary constructs was a priority. As a result, the study's findings may be limited by decreased reliability of data. On the other hand, a review article has suggested that in-person survey completion may give researchers a false confidence regarding the reliability of their data as rates of participant inattentiveness and lack of comprehension were found to comparable to that of MTurk studies ( Thomas and Clifford, 2017 ) . Thus, while the absence of screener items may limit the reliability of the data, this effect is not likely to be more pronounced than it would have been if in-person survey completion were employed.",

As such, the study provides compelling preliminary support for a parsimonious, unifying model wherein violation of core beliefs and the inability to make meaning of the pandemic serve as a final, common pathway undermining mental health during the pandemic. This model has substantial explanatory power as it not only accounts for the effects of all the pandemic stressors examined in this study but also clarifies the otherwise counterintuitive finding that social isolation plays a protective psychological function during the pandemic ( Milman et al., 2020a ) . Future research would benefit from examining other pandemic stressors identified in the literature, including variables that heighten the perception of COVID threat, such as exposure to media and social interactions that catastrophize the pandemic ( Dryhurst et al., 2020 ; Garfin et al., 2020 ) .",
