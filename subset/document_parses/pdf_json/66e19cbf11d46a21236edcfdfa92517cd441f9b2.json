Reported mortality rates for patients with S. aureus bacteremia are up to 30% [17] [18] [19] . As the median days from positive blood culture to death was <8, S. aureus bacteremia was likely to have contributed to the deaths. S. aureus infections are a known complication of other viral pandemics, such as the Spanish flu in 1918-1919 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009-2010 [8, 20] . S. aureus is known to act synergistically in all influenza seasons, increasing mortality and severity of disease [7, 21, 22] . The proposed mechanisms of viral-induced bacterial co-infections include viral modification of airway structures, as well as initiation of immune-suppressive responses [23] [24] [25] . Viruses can upregulate ligands for bacterial adherence to virus-infected respiratory tract cells [23, 24] and can initiate immune-suppressive cytokines to reduce neutrophil recruitment [25] . Eight patients in our case series were determined to have a pneumonia source, with only 2 patients having community-onset S. aureus pneumonia. We also found that the majority of patients had hospital-onset bacteremia, which suggests that the interaction of S. aureus with SARS CoV-2 is dissimilar to influenza. Further clinical and translational research is warranted to further define this relationship.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 30 studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 identified that out of 3834 patients, 7% had bacterial co-infections [27] . The authors performed a pooled analysis and found an increased risk of death with bacterial co-infections (OR, 5.82; 95% CI, 3.4-9.9; I 2 = 85.4%), but they did not explore specific sites of infections or pathogens such as S. aureus [27] . There have been 2 reports from other centers in NYC about bacteremia in patients with COVID-19. Sepulveda et al. reported that through March 31, 1.6% of COVID-19 patients had bacteremia, with S. aureus as the second most common pathogen accounting for 13% of bacteremias [5] . Nori et al. reported similar findings, with 1.9% of COVID-19 patients with bacteremia with S. aureus as the most common etiology, accounting for 44% of bacteremias [26] . Neither of these studies evaluated timing of bacteremia with COVID-19 infection or association with mortality [5, 26] . In comparison with these studies, our case series found a greater percentage of patients who specifically had S. aureus bacteremias, which may be explained by our longer observation time that included the entire admission of the patient. The majority of our patients were also found to have hospitalonset bacteremia. Hospital-onset bacteremia was a predictor of 14-day mortality on multivariate analysis but not of 30-day mortality. Hospital-onset bacteremia has previously been reported to be associated with increased mortality [28] [29] [30] . We also identified age as a predictor of 14-day hospital mortality on multivariate analysis, which is consistent with previous findings that older patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of death [31] .",

Although the Pitt bacteremia score was first developed to predict gram-negative bacteremia mortality, a score \u22652 has indicated a significant risk of mortality for S. aureus [12, 13] . Comparatively, our median Pitt bacteremia score (IQR) of 5.0 (2.0-7.0) is higher than previously published S. aureus bacteremia studies [13, 32] . One study reported a median Pitt bacteremia score (IQR) of 0 (0-2), whereas another study found the mean Pitt bacteremia score to be 4 [13, 32] . We found that the median Pitt bacteremia score was elevated in patients with hospital-onset bacteremia, which likely contributed to the association between hospital-onset bacteremia and 14-day mortality.",
