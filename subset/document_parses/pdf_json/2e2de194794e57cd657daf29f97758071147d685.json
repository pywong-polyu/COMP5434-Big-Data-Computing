            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes a potentially life-threatening liver infection that frequently results in lifelong chronic infection. HBV is responsible for 887,000 deaths each year, most resulting from chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. Presently, there are 250 million chronic HBV carriers worldwide who are at a high risk for developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is the most common type of liver cancer with a strong association with HBV infection. HBV transmission through blood transfusions and perinatal transfer from infected mother to child have been common routes of infection. In the present study, we describe the development of a synthetic DNA plasmid encoding an anti-HBV human monoclonal antibody specific for the common \"a determinant region\" of HBsAg of hepatitis B virus and demonstrate the ability of this platform at directing in vivo antibody expression. In vivo delivery of this DNA encoded monoclonal antibody (DMAb) plasmid in mice resulted in expression of human IgG over a period of one month following a single injection. Serum antibody was found to recognize the relevant conformational epitope from plasma purified native HBsAg as well as bound HBV in HepG2.2.15 cells. The serum DMAb efficiently neutralized HBV and prevented infection of HepaRG cells in vitro. Additional study of these HBV-DMAb as a possible therapy or immunoprophylaxis for HBV infection is warranted.",

Moreover, these approaches are associated with the development of acquired drug resistance, resulting in low response rates, and risk of numerous side-effects.",

Such individuals remain susceptible to HBV infection. 2, 8 In this regard, hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) can provide rapid passive protection against infection after acute exposure to infection. 9 ,10 HBIG is a polyclonal antibody against HBsAg derived from pooled plasma of individuals having high anti-HBs titer. 11, 12 Pooled plasma can vary in the titer of anti-HBs which is a concern for the consistency. Apart from variability in anti-HBs titer among patients, the neutralization efficiency of HBIG is largely based on protective anti-HB serum titer. In addition, the polyclonal immunoglobulin contains antibodies with different specificities which may select for HBV mutants resistant to currently used antiviral drugs and provide variability for patient management.",

We have demonstrated that this novel platform is capable of inducing sufficient MAb levels to protect mice in a number of specific infectious disease models. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 14, 21 Recently, we demonstrated that this approach can generate protective levels of MAb in an NHP challenge model. 22 We were interested in developing more enhanced levels of expression in the context of immunotherapy for HBV infection. Such an approach could provide an additional serum-free tool for protection in seronegative, at-risk persons. 2, 23, 24 Multiple immunotherapeutic approaches for preventing HBV infection and treatment have been evaluated over the past several decades. We focused on developing a protective antibody response against regions of the HBsAg important in immune protection from viral infection. The HBsAg contains a highly antigenic segment known as the major hydrophilic region (MHR) from amino acids 100-169. 25 The MHR consists of a complex set of continuous and discontinuous epitopes defined by disulfide bridging. The common \"a determinant region\" of MHR classically includes amino acids 124-147 of the HBsAg and is shared by all HBV genotypes and serotypes (adw, ady, ayw, ayr). 4,26 It contains a major conformationdependent neutralizing epitope of HBV which is the principal binding site of anti-HBs following natural infection, after immunization with Hepatitis B vaccine, and during HBIG prophylaxis. 4, 23, 27 Recent reports describe monoclonal antibodies that target this region of HBV. 11 We systematically converted an anti-HBV MAb sequence into a single-plasmid antibody-encoding DNA cassette for insertion into a DNA plasmid and optimized it with the aim of increasing HBV-specific human IgG production from the construct. We optimized the leader sequences from the Ig and performed RNA and codon optimization as we have described. [28] [29] [30] The synthetic DNA encoding the human H and L chains were synthesized independently and cloned into a mammalian expression plasmid pVax1 (Figure 2a) . We then studied in vitro expression in cell lines for the HBV-DNA construct by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of supernatant and cell lysates of 293 T cells transfected with HBV-DMAb. These analyses confirmed intracellular expression as well as potent secretion of human IgG (Figure 2b) . Moreover, Western blot analyses demonstrated the presence of IgG heavy and light chains in the supernatant and cell lysate of HBV-DMAb transfected cells (Figure 2c ). To then study if the HBV-DMAb was expressed in vivo, athymic nude CAnN.Cg-Foxn1 nu /Crl mice were administered HBV-IgG plasmid DNA at dose of 100 \u03bcg or 400 \u03bcg utilizing Cellectra 3P electroporation. Notably, significant human IgG expression persisted for at least 4-5-weeks post a single injection (Figure 2d ) with 100 \u03bcg dose. Mean expression levels in mice sera immunized with HBV-DMAb were 41.6 \u03bcg/ml (Figure 2e ). The DMAb-expressed antibody exhibited substantial reactivity to HBV viral antigen in ELISA assay (Figure 2f ). These results demonstrate that our synthetic DMAb plasmid is capable of inducing HBV-specific antibody expression in vitro and in vivo.",

The human DMAb is directed against the common \"a determinant region\" of HBsAg which carries a major HBV neutralizing epitope for anti-HBs that is highly conserved. 11, 20 We observed that the DMAb reacted well with the native antigen as well as HepG2.2.15 cells but reacted poorly with the denatured antigen, supporting the three-dimensional nature of the epitope targeted. Advantages of the DMAb platform include the ease and cost-effectiveness of producing DNA plasmids compared to protein therapies and the ease of delivery of plasmid DNA as well as its ability to generate sustained in vivo monoclonal antibody expression which in the present study lasted at least one-month post administration. Moreover, the epitope specificity of the monoclonal antibody was known and is well characterized. For HBIG, the preparation method is based on the physical characteristic of immunoglobulins and not on the specificity of the antibodies, the precise antigen specificity of most HBV immunoglobulin preparations is not known and thus far, are only determined to be reactive with HBV surface antigen proteins in general. This provides a source of variability in these preparations, that can facilitate poor control or viral escape as well as having the complication of being a blood-based product. The DMAb technology might have advantages in this regard as a standalone additional tool or to be used in combination with current HBV immunotherapies.",

DMAbs have the potential to provide rapid protection against infectious diseases such as HBV through in vivo antibody production. Conceptually, this technology provides the simplicity of immunization with the power of specific mAb delivery. Advantages of this approach include rapid protection or treatment of affected populations, including health care workers, travelers, and immune-compromised personnel. Furthermore, this technology has the possibility to enable routine mAb delivery to treat other circulating and emerging infectious diseases. Immune escape by hepatitis B viruses is a challenge for all form of antiviral therapeutics, including DMAbs; however, through the use of combination therapeutics such as co-administration of broadly neutralizing DMAbs with small molecule antivirals or HBIG, potentially superior control over the HBV infection could be achieved. Also, it is necessary to determine that with each DMAb target and strategy that a sufficient level of mAb is produced to mediate the desired biological effect in terms of quantity and duration compared to conventional delivery of protein-based mAbs.",

(b) Western blot of HBsAG after SDS-PAGE separation under reducing (denatured) conditions. No binding of HBV-DMAb was observed when reduced HBsAg was used in SDS-PAGE. (c) Native PAGE and western blot analysis of HBsAg using sera from mice immunized with HBV DMAb. Detection of DMAb binding to purified HBsAg was performed using goat anti-human IgG-HRP conjugate by chemiluminescence. No binding of HBV-DMAb was observed when denatured HBsAg was used in SDS-PAGE. However, the DMAb strongly bound to native HBsAg in Native-PAGE which indicates that antibody binds to a conformational epitope of HBsAg.",
