An estimated 516,000 planned operations were cancelled in the first wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom (UK) [1] . Orthopaedic departments in the UK currently face a challenging situation with significant staff absences due to high numbers of positive COVID-19 cases set against a background of vastly expanded waiting lists [2] [3] [4] [5] . Figures from the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) show the total waiting list for trauma and orthopaedics in England now stands over 704,000 patients, with over 63,000 patients waiting over one year to begin treatment [4] . These figures have increased significantly over the last 12 months with a 30% increase in the number of patients waiting over two years for an operation. Orthopaedics had the second-lowest return to the expected capacity of inpatient planned care [6] . Another barrier to resuming elective care are patient concerns with regards to undergoing surgery during a pandemic with studies showing only 56% of patients wished to proceed with planned orthopaedic care [7] . These figures were mirrored in our department when patients were initially contacted at the onset of the pandemic [8] . However, deferring the burden of chronic musculoskeletal conditions will not make it go away. Many individuals awaiting joint replacement surgery have a severely reduced quality of life, enduring significant amounts of pain and suffering, described by some patients as a state 'worse than death' [9] .",

The previously published study was limited to a low-risk patient cohort, with all patients being American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade 1, indicating an otherwise healthy individual (8) . The patient cohort for the previously published work was selected as they were deemed to be at the lowest risk of developing significant complications of COVID-19 post-operatively [10] .

Phase 1 documented the first 100 patients to undergo surgery under the new COVID-19 precautions. Patients were prospectively monitored for symptoms of COVID-19 or post-operative complications at 14 days. None of the first 100 patients required re-admission to the hospital for any complication.

For phases 1-4, the pre-operative patient and household isolation period was set at 14 days; however, this was later reduced to three days on the 3rd August 2020 for lower-risk patients as per instructions from Public Health England. For low-risk patients in phase 4, the isolation period was optional. Any patient with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test preoperatively or symptoms of COVID-19 had their operation postponed. Elective operating returned to our NHS DGH site on 3rd August 2020 (phase 4). The designated green pathways as implemented in the independent sector were followed.
