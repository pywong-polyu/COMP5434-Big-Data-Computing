Using a field experiment with 458 students from three different subjects at Universidad Aut\u00f3 noma de Madrid (Spain), we study the differences in assessments by dividing students into two groups. The first group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is the group of students that had their faceto-face activities interrupted because of the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect of the COVID-19 confinement on students' performance. This effect is also significant in activities that did not change their format when performed after the confinement. We find that this effect is significant both in subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that did not change the student workload. Additionally, an analysis of students' learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study on a continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement changed students' learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students' assessment are expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in their learning performance.",

Both assessment processes and self-evaluation have been proven to benefit from technological advancement. Even courses that solely offer online contents such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) [6, 7] have also become popular. The inclusion of e-Learning tools in higher education implies that a greater amount of information can be analyzed, improving teaching quality [8] [9] [10] . In recent years, many studies have been performed analyzing the advantages and challenges of massive data analysis in higher education [11] . For example, a study of Gasevic et al. [12] indicates that time management tactics had significant correlations with academic performance. Jovanovic et al also demonstrated that assisting students in their management of learning resources is critical for a correct management of their learning strategies in terms of regularity [13] .",

Computer adaptive test (CAT), based on item response theory, was formally proposed by Lord in 1980 [28] [29] [30] , as is the case with linear testing. Some platforms couple the advantages of CAT-specific feedback with multistage adaptive testing [38] . The use of CAT is also increasingly being promoted in clinical practice to improve patient quality of life. Over the decades, different systems and approaches based on CAT have been used in the educational space to enhance the learning process [39, 40] . Considering the usage of CAT as a learning tool, establishing the knowledge of the learner is crucial for personalizing subsequent question difficulty. CAT does have some negative aspects such as continued test item exposure, which allows learners to memorize the test answers and share them with their peers [41, 42]. As a solution to limit test item exposure, a large question bank has been suggested. This solution is unfeasible in most cases, since most of the CAT models already require more items than comparable linear testing [43].",

This fact means that, in our model, the L k depends on the full history of answers given by the student. L k is inversely proportional to N Q , which means that it takes a higher number of correct answers to increase L k . Once L k is defined, a randomly selected question is shown to the student. Another important fact that implies the use of Eq 5 in the adaptive test is that we will never have L k <L k-1 . In other words, once a student starts answering questions from a certain L value, they will never go back to the previous one. In Fig 1 we show a simple example of the multiple possible paths that a student can follow when facing a test that uses our model. In the example shown in Fig 1 we have used N Q = 6 and N L = 3. In this very straightforward example, the L value changes every time a student gives 2 correct answers (following diagonal arrows on the diagram). Wrong answers imply a vertical drop on the diagram. In this case, the L value will not change (L k = L k-1 ). The final student's grade G is shown on the lower part of the diagram. The lowest grade (G = 0) corresponds to a test where the student has failed all the N Q questions. In this case, L = 1 for all the possible j values. The highest grade (G = 6) implies that the student has faced questions from all the possible L values (L = {1,2,3} in Fig 1) .",

To manage the theory contents, a MA-T with three possible answers to each question and only one correct has been created. In the first stage, with the test made available only one day before the exam, students had at their disposal a MA-T composed of 16 questions and with a time limit of 15 minutes. In the second stage, the time available was increased to 30 minutes and the question number to 18. These changes are related to the nature of the subject contents and do not have a significant impact on the study. The OA-T tests had 6 and 9 questions in the first and second stage, respectively. In order to maintain consistency in the subsequent study, an additional effort has been made to keep the difficulty of the questions as similar as possible.",

It is worth noting that the academic year for this subject ended with the final exam on May 21. In Fig 4B we show the distribution of attempts between February and May. We found 62 in February, which is a low but reasonable number since students did not yet have enough knowledge to face tests properly. They generally started using the platform in the middle of the month. In March, we noted an increase in the number of attempts followed by a slight decrease in April. This difference can be justified by the Easter holidays (one week) in April. The number of attempts strongly increased in May. Even when counting only the first two weeks of the month, we have more attempts than in previous months (292 from May 1-15). In the period of May 16-21, we have recorded 396 attempts (469 if we count the attempts in the final exam). In the inset of Fig 4B  we show the attempt distribution in the last period (May 16-21).

In the earlier stage, fewer students used the application intensively by making multiple attempts a day. Students who logged in at the later stage were more likely to use the application once or twice a day over several days because of the reward related to this behavior. Out of a total sample of 19 students who used the tool in stage 3, 5 were eliminated by the test as they accessed the tests the same number of days in both stages. Then, for the use of the application by the remaining 14 students the W-value was of 15.5, with the critical value of W = 25 at p.0.05. Therefore, the result is significant.",

In Fig 6 we show the scores obtained by all the students in the 3 courses analysed in all the e-valUAM tests performed in the subject \"Applied Computing\". In the figure we indicate the period of the COVID-19 confinement during the 2019/2020 course (from March 11 to March 30). For clarity, we also indicate the equivalent period in the two previous years. As we can see in the figure, the number of tests performed before confinement was similar (225 and 246) in the two previous years (control group), but there is a remarkable increment in the number of tests (328) performed in the experimental group. These differences can be easily explained normalizing these numbers to the number of students each year (97, 73 and 91 respectively). By doing that, we obtain 2.31, 3.37 and 3.6 test/student, respectively. Thus, differences between courses 2018/ 2019 and 2019/2020 are reduced, although there is still some difference with respect students from course 2017/2018, that can be explained by the fact that some of these students were retaking the subject and, therefore, did not use the e-valUAM application often until the contents were more difficult. If we count the number of tests finished until the end of the academic year in courses 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, we find 1345 and 1175 tests respectively. Normalizing with the number of students, we find 13.87 and 16.1 test/student respectively. This is a difference of 2.23 test/student in a period of 3.5 months, which means a difference of less than 1 test/student each month.",

We have analysed students' scores and the proportion of students that passed the activity (score\ufffd5). As it can be observed in Fig 8A, the scores obtained by students in the different activities during the course were consistently similar in both years of the control group, with the only exception in the second activity where there was a slightly decrease in year 2018/2019 (p<0.05). Similarly, the proportion of students with a score\ufffd5 was very similar in the control group (p>0.05) ( Fig  8B) . Therefore, students' performance in the previous 2 years (control group) was not significantly different, allowing us to compare these results to the results from 2019/2020. Scores obtained by the students in the 2019/2020 academic year before confinement were similar to those obtained by students from the control group, although some differences were found at the beginning of the course (activities number 2, 3 and 4, p<0.05). We think that this could be due to the adaptation of the students to the course and to the new assessment methodology, being afterwards similar again. However, after the end of face-to-face teaching and at the beginning of the confinement, students' scores were significantly higher than in the previous academic years (Fig 8A) . The most remarkable differences are evident in activities 10 and 11, that have always been on-line activities. Thus, in activity 10, mean score in the present year (2019/2020) was 8.1\u00b10.2 vs. 6.5\u00b10.2 (p<0.0001) and vs. 6.7\u00b10.3 (p = 0.0005) in 2017/2018 and https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239490.g008 significant differences when comparing students' performance in confinement with the performance in previous periods where activities were not limited to distant learning.",

There are some concerns related to these new assessment methods such as the opportunity for cheating by the students. This is the reason why we have chosen only subjects that include several tests that have not been modified because of the confinement. The results of our study show that students also achieved significant improvements in their scores even in tests that were performed in the on-line format in previous years. Moreover, this improvement is only significant when comparing data after the confinement (i.e. there are no significant differences in on-line tests that were performed before the confinement). These findings reveal that the new assessment process cannot be the reason for the improvement in students' performance because the learners also achieved better scores when the format of the assessment did not change. For these reasons, we establish that the new learning methodology is the main reason for the change in students' performance during the confinement. Now, we shall discuss research question 3 (What are the reasons of the differences (if any) in students' performance?). We have proven that something has changed in students' learning methodology. The question is: What is the common element in those methodologies that caused the improvement in the learning process?",

In both cases, we have found a significant increment in students' performance in the evaluation tests after the confinement. It seems that students' performance is increased independently of the learning strategies followed by teachers. Since we have established that the assessment process cannot be responsible for the differences, and we cannot find any common elements in the learning methodologies, we must conclude on a general change in the autonomous learning process.",

Without any previous reference, students need to be confident that they are following the course correctly and therefore, work continuously in order not to miss any important content. Another interpretation is that they are afraid of missing the academic year because of the COVID-19 confinement and they work harder to overcome any difficulty. Finally, students might be motivated by their intrinsic responsibility in a very confused situation and work hard to contribute as much as they can to solve the problems that higher education is facing. Most probably, different students will find different motivations in this new scenario (probably a combination of many).

Therefore, we conducted an experiment among 450 students from three subjects in different degrees of higher education at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Spain. The results of this study answer our 4 research questions:1. Is there any effect (positive or negative) of COVID-19 confinement on students' performance?2. Is it possible to be sure that COVID-19 confinement is the origin of the different performance (if any)?3. What are the reasons of the differences (if any) in students' performance?4. What are the expected effects of the differences in students' performance (if any) in the assessment process?With respect to research question 1, the results analyzed in section 3.2 show that there is a significant positive effect of COVID-19 confinement on students' performance. The results indicate that students obtained better scores in all kinds of tests that were performed after the beginning of confinement. Different sources of error have been removed from our study by including only subjects that fit the following requirements for the last three academic years:\u2022 Same teaching methodology and teachers in all the years.\u2022 Same assessment process in all years, including both distance and on-site activities.\u2022 Tests performed both before and after the COVID-19 confinement in the present academicyear.\u2022 Tests that only imply an objective assessment process in order to avoid any possible subjective interpretation by the lecturers.We have compared results of students from the present 2019/2020 academic year (experimental group) with results of students from the last two academic years 2018/2019 and 2017/ 2018 (control group). Students from the two previous academic years had similar circumstances from the beginning to the end of their course. When compared to students of the 2019/2020 academic year, we have two periods with different conditions. The first period is taught in the same conditions as in previous years (before confinement). In the second period, those conditions dramatically changed, and all the teaching and learning activities were limited to distance learning. The results of our studies (section 3.2) clearly indicate that there are ",
