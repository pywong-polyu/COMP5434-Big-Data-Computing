To prevent filter clotting, systemic heparin or regional citrate anticoagulation are the two main anticoagulation strategies used in daily practice. The latter has become the standard of care as prolonged filter life span with lower complications is described. 6 Regional citrate anticoagulation consists of a citrate infusion to the blood before the filter of the extracorporeal circuit, thereby chelating ionized calcium, a key cofactor of many steps of the coagulation cascade. The calcium-citrate complexes are then removed by filtration or metabolized by the liver and muscle. Calcium is then given intravenously with continuous infusion to maintain ionized calcium within normal range.",

Mechanism underlying immobilization related hypercalcemia is not well understood and might be multifactorial. A lack of mechanical stress related to chronic unloading conditions of the muscle and denervation of the sympathetic neural fibers in the bone increases osteoclastic bone resorption. On the other hand, bone formation is reduced by excessive sclerostin production from osteocytes. 2, 7 Usual cause of hypercalcemia needs to be ruled out first by different blood test: PTH, PTH-related peptide, 25-hydroxy vitamin D 3 , and 1,25-hydroxy vitamin D 3 . Telopeptide C or N, if elevated, confirm calcium bone loss. Malignancy needs to be excluded as it is the most prevalent cause of hypercalcemia: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanner is a sensitive examination to exclude this diagnosis. 8 In our specific case, hypercalcemia was masked by regional citrate anticoagulation renal replacement therapy, 9 which was initiated in a context of acute kidney injury. Hypercalcemia itself can lead to a reversible fall in glomerular filtration rate that is mediated by direct renal vasoconstriction and natriuresis-induced volume contraction. However, in our situation, hypercalcemia was not the cause of acute renal failure as it was not present at baseline and critical COVID-19 is a well-described cause of tubular dysfunction. 10 However, in the second period of the hospitalization, when renal replacement therapy and citrate were stopped, hypercalcemia started to be unmasked and could have played a role in the worsening renal function.",

Potential advantages of denosumab are independent elimination from renal or hepatic function, longer duration, and subcutaneous injection. 14 The best treatment remains mobilization. 15 Patients developing SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure were typically ventilated longer than in typical acute respiratory disease syndrome. More than half of patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation have functional limitations after discharge from hospital that may last many years. 16 Early rehabilitation, starting as soon as possible in ICU, is safe and results in better functional outcomes at hospital discharge, a shorter duration of delirium, and more ventilator-free days. 17 In the case of our patient, this was not an alternative until respiratory failure was stabilized and because he had markedly sarcopenia and muscle loss associated with severe critical illness neuromyopathy.",
