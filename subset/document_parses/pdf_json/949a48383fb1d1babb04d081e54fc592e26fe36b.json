Be that as it may, mTOR itself is controlled by different sorts of cell indicators such as factors of growth, nutritional environment, hormones, and energy level for cellular. As growth factor tie with cell receptor, Phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) gets initiated, changes over phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidyl inositol trisphosphate (PIP3).

Therefore, the method of production and its therapeutic actions on the different types of cancer cell lines were investigated extensively. However, more studies are Tuli et al. (2014a) still required to improve the production process in both upstream and downstream. In addition, more investigations are still needed for scaling up and industrialization of this process. Finally, finding the correlation between cordycepin and other bioactive ingredients in the extract need further investigations to improve the production process.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 728, "end": 747, "text": "Tuli et al.
