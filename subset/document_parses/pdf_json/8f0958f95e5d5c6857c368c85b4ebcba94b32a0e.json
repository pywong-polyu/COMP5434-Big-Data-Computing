Bias awareness is one of the key elements to be included in implicit bias education. Research on education enhancing bias awareness is limited. Bias awareness can motivate behavior change. The objective was to evaluate whether exposure to a brief online course, Implicit Bias in the Clinical and Learning Environment, increased bias awareness.",

A sample of U.S. academic family, internal, and emergency medicine providers were recruited into the study from August to December 2019. Measures of provider implicit and explicit bias, personal and practice characteristics, and prepost-bias awareness measures were collected. Results: Of 111 participants, 78 (70%) were female, 81 (73%) were White, and 63 (57%) were MDs. Providers held moderate implicit pro-White bias on the Race IAT (Cohen's d = 0.68) and strong implicit stereotypes associating males rather than females with 'career' on the Gender-Career IAT (Cohen's d = 1.15). Overall, providers held no explicit race bias (Cohen's d = 0.05). Providers reported moderate explicit male-career (Cohen's d = 0.68) and strong female-family stereotype (Cohen's d = 0.83). A statistically significant increase in bias awareness was found after exposure to the course (p = 0.03). Provider implicit and explicit biases and personal and practice characteristics were not associated with an increase in bias awareness. Conclusions: Implicit bias education is effective to increase providers' bias awareness regardless of strength of their implicit and explicit biases and personal and practice characteristics. Increasing bias awareness is one step of many toward creating a positive learning environment and a system of more equitable healthcare.",

Implicit biases are positive or negative attitudes and stereotypes that are not available to introspection but influence thoughts, decisions, and actions toward others [2] . Explicit biases are attitudes and beliefs that make up our belief system and that we can report [2] . The first studies to investigate implicit bias in healthcare focused on identifying whether implicit bias exists among healthcare providers and if bias impacts patient care [3] [4] [5] . Since then, studies have found that provider implicit racial bias is associated with less patient-centered communication, less patient trust of their clinician [6] , poorer quality of clinical interactions, and disparities in pain management and other areas [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Research on implicit bias in healthcare has expanded to include gender [11] , sexuality [12] , weight [13] , mental health [14] , socioeconomic status [15] , and many other areas.",

In a review of gender bias in resident physician assessment, five of nine studies found that gender bias potentially influenced assessment of medical residents [18] .

Brief education on implicit bias has a positive effect on increasing diversity in medical residency admissions and reducing bias toward women in medicine [11, 23] . Implicit bias curricula can be a tool to promote social justice [24] . Not enough is known about whether healthcare providers' implicit and explicit biases and personal and practice characteristics affect uptake and application of implicit bias education. Sukhera & Watling [21] created a Framework for Integrating Implicit Bias Education into the Health Professions that outlines the importance of increasing bias awareness, creating a safe non-threatening learning context, increasing knowledge of the science of implicit bias, showing how implicit bias influences provider behaviors and patient outcomes, improving efforts to overcome bias, and enhancing awareness of how bias influences others [21] . Evaluation on whether these interventions increase healthcare providers' bias awareness is limited.",

Using the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) U.S. Medical School Faculty by Medical School and Department Type, 2018 [29] , we chose four medical schools, two public and two private, two nursing schools within each of the nine U.S. Census Divisions, and 19 U.S. PA programs, purposefully striving for geographic diversity. We identified publicly available emails on university/program websites by departments based on their roles in three specialties providing primary care (internal medicine, family medicine, and gerontology) as well as emergency medicine. Because NP and PA subspecialty could not be determined, we invited all clinical faculty from these schools to participate. Our prospective participant email list included 7,671 emails recruited from a total of 144 schools of medicine, nursing, and physician assistant, representing all nine U.S. Census Sub-Regions. Included in our recruitment list were 90 medical schools (including large, small, public, and private), 35 nursing schools, and 19 physician assistant programs. We recruited an average 16 schools from each of nine U.S. Census Sub-Regions, for about 10 medical schools, 4 nursing schools, and 2 physician assistant programs representing each subregion.",

The course was developed by faculty with expertise in adult learning, implicit bias in healthcare, online education, academic clinicians who teach or mentor, regional affiliate faculty, school of medicine leadership, and others. In developing the course, we aimed to be brief, which busy clinicians identified as necessary due to high workloads. We wanted to expose faculty to many concepts, define common terminology, and create foundational knowledge among all providers in a large and geographically diverse system. We believed the combination of the history of racism in medicine, evidence of social determinants of health, and the science of implicit bias would form a powerful and necessary knowledge foundation for academic clinicians who teach. We presented common terms and definitions, evidence that implicit bias is common, and the way our minds work [30] . We presented evidence that implicit bias is contagious [31] , which underscores that the point that clinicians who teach are important role models. We introduced the concepts of split-second judgements [32] , in-group favoritism [30] , and stereotype threat [33] and showed how they impact clinical care and teaching. We provided strategies to mitigate bias such as removing discretion from decision-making and collecting data to identify inequities. The course addressed three learning objectives: (1) Define implicit bias and how it is manifested in healthcare; (2) Recognize how implicit bias may be operating in the clinical setting and learning environment; and (3) Apply strategies that can be used to minimize the impact of implicit bias on teaching and clinical practice. Our evaluation used a pre-post-bias awareness measure [11] to determine whether providers' bias awareness was impacted. The course is publicly available for all to use (https://catalyst.uw.edu/webq/survey/ dolson/394766).",

We found that 74 (67%) participants had engaged in CE on working with diverse populations and 50 (45%) had engaged in CE on gender equity in the past year. Providers held moderate levels of implicit pro-White bias (Cohen's d = 0.68) ( Table 2 ). There was a significant difference in strength of implicit race bias based on participant race (p < 0.001). White and Asian participants held strong implicit bias favoring White Americans versus Black/African Americans (Cohen's d = 0.93 and Cohen's d = 1.93, respectively). Black/ African American participants, 83% (N = 10) of whom lived in the South, held a strong implicit bias favoring African Americans over White Americans (Cohen's d = 0.86). Overall, by region, Race IAT scores favored White Americans over African Americans, but there were differences in magnitude of this implicit race bias by region (p = 0.04). Participants in the Northeast (Cohen's d = 1.05) and Midwest (Cohen's d = 1.19) held strong implicit race bias; in the West, moderate implicit race bias (Cohen's d = 0.70); and in the South, weak implicit race bias (Cohen's d = 0.35). We chose not to apply a Bonferroni correction to these tests due to concerns that it has been shown to be overly conservative.",
