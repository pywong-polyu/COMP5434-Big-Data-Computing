Research that used the inventory of five major personality factors (The Big Five) described by Costa and McCrae (15) revealed the existence of relationships between health predictors and all factors (Neuroticism, Extraversion-Intraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness). However, among these, neuroticism is the factor that has been most closely associated with health status, including self-reported health, with clinical biomarkers, and with longevity (16) . Higher scores in neuroticism are not only linked to negative subjective health assessments, but also to behavioral markers of loss of walking speed (17, 18) and of biological dysfunction (19) . Notably, it is a widespread predictor of chronic respiratory disease, depression and dementia (20) (21) (22) . Individuals with higher neuroticism scores may be more likely to negatively assess their own health than is suggested by objective indicators (19) . The levels of perceived health remain stable with age, even in advanced old age, and are often higher than levels of health assessed through objective criteria (23) . In addition, longitudinal studies have shown that there may be downgrades in self-rated health associated with objective normative or unexpected losses in a person's health status throughout the aging process (1, 23, 24) , but that the scores of self-rated health tend to return to baseline levels as soon as recovery from previous health conditions occurs (10) . Systematic decline in self-rated health with advancing age is associated with physical limitations, with disabilities, and with chronic pain and depression that often accompany the onset of disease, and not with the passage of time itself (1) .",

Results from a ten-year follow-up of the Bambu\u00ed older adult cohort (BHAS) showed a multidimensional structure regarding self-assessed health among older individuals, including socioeconomic status, social support, health status with emphasis on mental health, and access to healthcare services (29, 30) . In the 2010 cohort of the SABE study, which started in 2000, prevalence of negative self-assessments was directly associated with worse indicators of income, education and consumer class (31) . The FIBRA Study (2008-2009) identified multiple interactions of negative self-assessed health with indicators of structural, social and health vulnerability (27, 32) , as well as of positive self-assessed health with maintenance of social engagement and of functional capacity (33, 34) . ELSI-BRASIL baseline data, collected in 2015-2016, pointed out that worse self-rated health is directly associated with frailty (35, 36) .",

The EPEPP cross-sectional study (2005) (2006) , found that having autonomy, being independent in activities of daily living and being in good emotional state were related with positive self-assessment of health among long-lived individuals (37) . EpiDoc data from the second wave of research collected between 2013 and 2015 revealed that the prevalence of multimorbidities combined with unhealthy lifestyles is associated with negative self-rated health among Portuguese older adults (38, 39) . The Portuguese subsample of the SHARE study had negative self-assessed health, high prevalence of chronic diseases since early old age, high rates of depressive problems reported by women, and high levels of disability among the long-lived individuals (40) . Scheel-Hincke et al. (10) examined gender differences in the performance of activities of daily living among older people from different European regions in a grouped sample of Waves 1 (2004-2005) through 6 (2015) of the SHARE Study. Differences in gender and in activities of daily living were found in all age groups for Southern Europe. Women had greater functional limitations and worse health outcomes. Serrano-Alarc\u00f3n and Perelman (41) carried out a study with data from the SHARE study (Wave 4) for the countries of Southern Europe (Portugal, Spain and Italy). Results showed that among the subjects who composed the sample from these three countries the risk of suffering from severe functional limitation was higher among women and among individuals with low levels of schooling. The Portuguese sample showed relatively worse functional status and self-rated health when compared to the Spanish and Italian samples.",

Brazil and Portugal have markedly different dimensions-about 212 million vs. 10 million inhabitants, respectively-and are located in different continents-the former in South America and the latter in Europe. Despite this contrast, they share many cultural traits, including language, as a result of the Portuguese colonization of Brazil between 1500 and 1822. In 2020, the population aged 65 and over in Portugal represented 27% of the total population (44). Life expectancy at birth in Portugal is 81.12 years (44), 6 years higher than in Brazil, where it is estimated at 75.46 years (45) . Brazilian older adults aged 65 and over represent 10.53% of the total population (46) . Both countries face great challenges in terms of aging and health. In both, an increasing number of older people suffer from multiple chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, systemic arterial hypertension, rheumatic diseases, obesity and diabetes (26, 39, (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) .",

The literature does not include comparative data about objective and subjective aspects of health, functional ability and personality in samples from Portuguese-speaking countries, such as Portugal and Brazil, that could contribute to understanding the extent and origins of these similarities and differences. The fact that Portugal is an aging country with a larger share of older adults in their population-much larger than Brazil's-may offer information that could support health policy planning in Brazil. Portugal is a country with sound investments in primary care. Their very low rates of hospitalization that could be avoided indicate the overall effectiveness of primary care services. In recent years, combined efforts to increase the efficiency of care have improved the cost-benefit ratio in the healthcare system's activity levels. On the other hand, low-income individuals in Portugal face a greater challenge in paying for medication and in having access to healthcare services not covered by the National Health System (SNS) (52) . Differences in health literacy can also have an impact, although this is overlaid by issues related to internet access and health-related information available online, which can be difficult to access among the older population, as well as among people with lower education levels (52) .",

According to the multiple regression analysis, having a high score in MMSE, being independent for performing ADLs, and having intermediate or low levels of neuroticism are associated with self-rated health as \"very good\" or \"good\" among Brazilian older adults. Low level of neuroticism was found to be a major determinant for Portuguese older adults to assess their health as \"very good\" or \"good.\" There was prevalence of women and of participants with 1 to 8 years of schooling in samples from both countries, replicating data from their respective populations. Brazilian women aged 70 and over represent 3.7% against 2.7% of men in the total Brazilian population (71) . In Portugal, the representation of women aged 70 and older is also higher (9.61%) compared to that of men (6.50%) (44). Feminization of old age is a recognized phenomenon worldwide and is due to the decrease in mortality rates of women in relation to men's (72) . Women are the majority in the older adult population in all regions of the world. It is estimated that they live, on average, 5 to 7 years longer than men (73) . However, along their lives, women accumulate disadvantages such as violence, discrimination, lower wages than men, double shifts, low level of education, loneliness due to widowhood, poverty and dependence on external resources (74) .",

In return, they also provide support to their family members, as they are often providers through their retirement payments, pensions and other benefits. These women play an important social role as grandparents and caregivers, providing help to sick friends or neighbors and taking on more and more responsibilities (75) . Difficulties in having access to education was evidenced in other Brazilian studies (36, 76, 77) . In Portugal, the level of schooling of older adults is much lower than the level of schooling of the adult population across the country. Average years of schooling is 6.3, which means that most older adults did not have access to high school or have stopped studying before that. In addition, women have even lower levels of schooling (40, 41, 78) . As a rule, education is built early in life and affects a person's future health in many aspects. People with more years of schooling tend to have higher incomes, safer occupations, more self-esteem, more adherence to healthy behaviors and more resources for timely healthcare seeking (79, 80) .",

About 3.63% of the population of older adults live in Residential Facilities for Older Adults (ERPI) in Portugal, whereas a little over 1.0% of the Brazilian older adults are institutionalized, in part due to the absence of operative policies and resources concerning oldest older adults, in part due to prejudice against institutionalization in Brazil. About 60% of this population live alone or with other older adult(s) (44). In Brazil, 15.3% of the older adult population live alone (82) . Older adults not living alone (84.9%) often live in family arrangements typical of poverty, which include one or two older individuals, children, grandchildren and other relatives, and they tend to be important providers of financial support for their families (69.8% of their family income) (83) .",

Country, gender and socioeconomic status were pointed out as important predictors of severe functional dependence. Functional limitations were higher among Portuguese older adults, especially women with low level of schooling (41) . Women live longer than men, but compared to them, they have disadvantages in several health indicators, including lower handgrip strength and higher prevalence of frailty. They have greater dependence in activities of daily living and worse self-rated health than men do (9, 10, 91) .

Among its strengths is the fact that this study presents pioneering data on positive self-rated health by older adults aged 70 and over from two Portuguese-speaking countries, and is useful as an examination of the possibility of conducting comparative research with controlled samples from Brazil and Portugal. Most of the studies available on self-rated health are more focused on groups of young people or of young older adults. Little research is conducted on looking into the variables associated with selfrated health, especially positive, among oldest older adults. As individuals age, their standards of what they consider to be good health are adjusted in the presence of physical and emotional decline; consequently, findings from research on younger people do not apply to older adults, thus highlighting the importance of carrying out specific studies with older participants. Among the limitations of this study are its relatively modest sample size and the fact that it was based on samples and measurements that were not specifically designed for it. Another aspect is related to the fact that older people aged 80 and over have a higher share in the Brazilian sample, even though the aging pattern of the Portuguese population includes more oldest older adults. The sample base of the FIBRA study is representative of cohorts 70-79 years old and 80 and over, whereas the base of the DIA study includes people aged 55 and over.",

The present paper shows that older people from two different countries, and particularly Brazilians, often rated their own health as \"very good\" or \"good.\" There are important differences between Brazil and Portugal, both in the prevalence of positive perceptions of one's own health and in its impact on mental and physical health. Results from comparisons between countries suggest a need for investing in improving one's health throughout life, because childhood living conditions can be considered distal determinants of independent performance of activities of daily living and of reduced burden of chronic diseases among older adults (111, 112) . Personality, expressed through the trait neuroticism, deserves special attention. Neuroticism is a predictor of many different mental and physical disorders, including comorbid conditions, and of the frequency of use of mental health and general healthcare services (113) . Nevertheless, \"healthy neuroticism\" can be a good thing: if neurotic people channel their concerns into proactive healthcare behaviors, such as promptly seeking medical care, it can substantially improve treatment prognosis (114) . It should be emphasized that healthcare systems need to be designed to meet these demands as people age. In Portugal, population aging is considered one of the main sources of pressure on the National Healthcare Service (SNS). Patients aged 70 and over represent 50.53% of hospitalization costs (115) . In Brazil, 75.3% of older adults rely exclusively on the services provided by the Unified Health System (SUS), and this represents 30% of hospitalization costs (36) .",

It has strong primary care systems and preventive services that result in lower mortality rates than the European Union average (with 140 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016, compared to 149 in 2011) (52) .

The Portuguese sample from the DIA Study-From Disability to Activity: The Challenge of Ageing' (DIA; 2011-2014) -, with 1,322 individuals aged 55 and over, consisted of a probabilistic sample of men and women living in urban and rural areas of continental and island regions of Portugal, with total population of 10,374,822 at the time of the survey (2011-2014) (57). This sample of older adults was recruited in their places of residence and in areas where there is flow of people from this intended population, in randomly selected regions. To compose the sample of the Brazilian study-Frailty in Brazilian Older Adults (FIBRA)\u2212418 older adults aged 70 and over who participated in the first follow up of the FIBRA study (2016-2017), whose baseline was carried out in 2008-2009, were selected. These older adults lived in the urban area of the city of Campinas (with 1,150,753 inhabitants in 2016), or in the urban area of the sub-district of Ermelino Matarazzo (117,372 inhabitants in 2016), one of the administrative regions of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo (20,579,717 inhabitants in 2016) (58). Subjects were recruited at home, based on a list of participants in the baseline study carried out in 2008 and 2009, with 1,284 older adults residing in 60 census tracts randomly drawn within the urban area of the two locations: 900 (60 census tracts) in Campinas and 384 (60 census tracts) in Ermelino Matarazzo.",
