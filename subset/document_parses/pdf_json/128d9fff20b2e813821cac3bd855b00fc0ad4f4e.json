Inspired by a door-to-door Covid-19 testing program we helped design, we combine multi-armed bandit strategies and insights from sampling theory to demonstrate how to recover accurate prevalence estimates while continuing to allocate resources to at-risk areas. We use the outbreak of an infectious disease as our running example. The public health setting has several characteristics distinguishing it from typical bandit settings, such as distribution shift (the true disease prevalence is changing with time) and batched sampling (multiple decisions must be made simultaneously). Nevertheless, we demonstrate that several bandit algorithms are capable out-performing greedy resource allocation strategies, which often perform worse than random allocation as they fail to notice outbreaks in new areas.",

In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, public health officials grappled with how to best allocate diagnostic tests [10] . Some advocate random sampling to learn about the disease [12, 11] , while others favor more targeted allocation [5, 4] . This is perceived to pose a tradeoff: Random sampling is seen to enable reliable prevalence estimates and the discovery of new hot spots, while risk targeting focuses on symptomatic and/or exposed individuals to ostensibly drive down disease rates. 1 While the general tension runs throughput public health, the setting presents novel challenges to classical bandit approaches. Outbreaks present distribution shifts and allocation is necessarily batched for operational reasons.",

To illustrate, we consider the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak when tests are not widely available. A public health agency must decide how to allocate tests between K different units, U 1 , . . . , U K . Units might be neighbourhoods [4] , apartments buildings [9] , or dorm rooms on a college campus [17] . They might also be artificially constructed clusters of individuals based on interaction networks [14] . We consider a series of discrete timesteps t = 1, . . . , T , which could represent days or weeks. At time t, m t tests can be distributed among the regions in any way we choose. The supply may vary from period to period, in which case m t = m t+1 .",

The prevalence rate 2 in each unit is the \"reward\" distribution, thus encouraging tests to be allocated to units with higher proportions of infected individuals. Unlike most bandit problems our reward distributions are non-stationary [1] . In particular, they change as a function of the disease spread and the number of tests (Section 2). In addition, we must make take multiple actions at once (actions are batched) [7] . We investigate four bandit algorithms: Upper confidence bound sampling, Thompson sampling, Exponential Weights (Exp3), and -greedy. We discuss their details and how they've been extended to the non-stationary and batched setting in Section 3. The following section discusses how we model the spread of the disease in each unit and the effect of testing. Code is available at https://github.com/reglab/mab-infectious-disease.",

The figure on the left hand side demonstrates the evolution of the true prevalence rates (across all units) and the estimates over time. Note that the true means are different for different budgets because testing changes the prevalence of the disease, and a higher budget implies more testing. Thus, a lower budget results in a higher prevalence. The right hand side of Figure 2 demonstrates the effect of different budget sizes on the variance of the estimate. While the estimates are unbiased on average across all three budgets, smaller budgets result in larger variance. Of course, this is due to the fact that the variance of\u03bc t grows as a function of the inverse of p i p j , where p i is the probability that individual i is tested. This, in turn, is a function of m t . Thus, as m t \u2192 0, V ar(\u03bc t ) \u2192 \u221e.",

Figure 3 : Improvement over random sampling. As in the right hand side of Figure 1 , the x-axis is the budget, and the y-axis is the difference in number of cases between the given strategy and random sampling by the end of 30 timesteps. As K increases, we see a general increase in the effectiveness of Thompson Sampling and Exp3 relative to the two -greedy strategies. For all values of K and \u03b3, -greedy at = 0.01 performs worse than random sampling across the majority of budgets. This suggests that with such a small exploration budget, it is unable to discover those units whose prevalence is increasing drastically over time. Interestingly, at lower values of K, -greedy with more exploration (10%) is unable to compete with the other bandit algorithms.",
