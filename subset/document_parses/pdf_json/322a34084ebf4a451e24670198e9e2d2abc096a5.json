In fact, since 1999, suicide rates have increased by more than 30% making it the 10th leading cause of death since 2017 (1) . From 1999 to 2016, suicide rates increased between 6% and 58% in every state except Nevada (1) . With this increasing trend in mind, one can only question if the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic will result in even greater suicide rates. This article uses mental health trends during the COVID-19 pandemic to question how we can leverage current technologies such as telehealth to provide preventative measures during and after pandemics or global crises. Furthermore, the increased use of technology during COVID-19 can help improve future uses of telehealth, particularly for reaching rural communities with limited access to mental health care.",

Individuals first experience a honeymoon or pulling together phase in which they have increased community cohesion. Consequently, suicide trends drop. Emotional lows occur during the proceeding disillusionment phase, which \"occurs in the second half of the year after the disaster\" and is often triggered by a \"slower-than-expected pace of disaster recovery\" (5) . During the disillusionment phases of Hurricane Katrina and the Nantou earthquake in Taiwan, suicidal ideation and behavior increased (4) . Although this article equates the pandemic to a traumatic and stressful event, COVID-19 is not directly equated it to a natural disaster.

Children with mental and behavioral disabilities often receive services in schools, but with school closed, services and therapies now occur in their homes. Rather than sending the child's entire team into the home, telehealth is being used to reduce the amount of contact patients and clients incur.
