The use of pulse oximeter at home may be feasible in countries where devices are readily available and affordable, but this seems like a far-fetched idea in resource-limited countries. With only $6 and $26 to spend per person for COVID-19related social protection in LIC and LMIC, respectively, many people from those areas are struggling for basic needs like food. 2 The idea of distributing pulse oximeter (each of which costs $20-$48) with added cost of telephone calls, from emergency social fund to each suspected person discharged form emergency department in such countries, is challenging without international support. 1 3 Shortage of standard devices is a rising problem in such countries. Even the ones that are available in the market are either not quality-certified or expensive. 4 This adds to the financial burden without any potential benefit while increasing false reassurance.",

Even those who can read the numbers are not aware of the correct method to use it. Factors like poor perfusion, dye, pigmentation, movement of hands, etc lead to false reading. 3 Failure to identify potential sources of error adds to the problem.",

Financial aid from international fraternity and provision of quality as well as cost control of the devices from government level may be helpful in solving economic hardship. Governments can mobilise community health volunteers for creating awareness about the correct use of oximeters. They can monitor the oxygen saturation of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases by visiting individual houses while taking necessary precautions. Overall, the protocol given by Gootenberg et al provides a safe and effective framework for use of pulse oximeter to identify silent hypoxia. 1 Contributors SR and BP: concept.
