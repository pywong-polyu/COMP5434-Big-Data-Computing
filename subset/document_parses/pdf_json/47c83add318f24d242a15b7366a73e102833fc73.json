            "text": "Mutually exclusive splicing is an important means of increasing the protein repertoire, by which the Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene potentially generates 38,016 different isoforms in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the regulatory mechanisms remain obscure due to the complexity of the Dscam exon cluster. Here, we reveal a molecular model for the regulation of the mutually exclusive splicing of the serpent pre-mRNA based on competition between upstream and downstream RNA pairings. Such dual RNA pairings confer fine tuning of the inclusion of alternative exons. Moreover, we demonstrate that the splicing outcome of alternative exons is mediated in relative pairing strength-correlated mode. Combined comparative genomics analysis and experimental evidence revealed similar bidirectional structural architectures in exon clusters 4 and 9 of the Dscam gene. Our findings provide a novel mechanistic framework for the regulation of mutually exclusive splicing and may offer potentially applicable insights into long-range RNA-RNA interactions in gene regulatory networks.",

            "text": "Alternative splicing is a crucial source of proteome diversity, which plays an important role in many cellular processes and functions (Black 2003; Matlin et al. 2005; Blencowe 2006; Chen and Manley 2009; Nilsen and Graveley 2010) . In humans, \u223c95% of multiexon genes are alternatively spliced (Pan et al. 2008; Sultan et al. 2008) , and these splicing events have implications for disease, since some mutations that influence the splicing process might cause genetic disorders. Alternative splicing includes various splicing events, such as exon skipping, alternative 5 \u2032 or 3 \u2032 splice site usage, intron retention, and mutually exclusive splicing (Black 2003; Matlin et al. 2005; Blencowe 2006; Nilsen and Graveley 2010) . Mutually exclusive splicing is defined as a cluster of internal exons in which only one of the exons is included in a given mRNA (Smith 2005) . The most extraordinary example of this is the arthropod Dscam (Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule) pre-mRNA, which potentially generates 38,016 different mRNA isoforms in Drosophila melanogaster (Schmucker et al. 2000) . In this case, the 95 alternative exons are organized into exon 4, 6, 9 and 17 clusters, containing 12, 48, 33, and 2 variable exons, respectively. The elaboration of the Dscam locus in arthropod to produce large isoform repertoires with diverse expression patterns presents Dscam as a key target that could affect dramatic changes in adaptive immune or nervous responses (Watson et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2006) . Indeed, much evidence has revealed that the extraordinary diversity of the Dscam isoform is required for its nervous and immune function (Zhan et al. 2004; Watson et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2006; Hattori et al. 2007 Hattori et al. , 2009 Matthews et al. 2007; Watthanasurorot et al. 2011; Dong et al. 2012; Miura et al. 2013; He et al. 2014) .",

This mechanism was initially discovered within the exon 6 cluster of Dscam, where the docking site in the intron downstream from constitutive exon 5 could pair with the selector sequences upstream of each of the 48 exon 6 variants (Graveley 2005) . Combined with alternative RNA structures, the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hrp36 was shown to contribute to splicing fidelity (Olson et al. 2007) . We recently revealed similar structural arrangements in several clusters of mutually exclusive exons, including the exon 4 and exon 9 clusters in Drosophila Dscam ). All of these structural elements differed from the exon 6 structures in that the docking sites are located in the downstream intron of the cluster. Moreover, a locus control region (LCR) was defined to activate the exon 6 cluster and allow the inclusion of the most proximal exon variant when the docking site is paired with its selector sequence (Wang et al. 2012) . However, the intricate regulatory mechanism still remains obscure. For example, a recent deletion analysis of Dscam exon 6 demonstrates a dramatic decrease in the inclusion frequency of most exons 6, while some exon 6 variants were increasingly included (May et al. 2011) , implying that not all of the selections of exon 6 variants may be dependent on the docking site located in the intron downstream from constitutive exon 5. Importantly, further efforts to explore the control mechanism have been hampered by the lack of a sufficient system due to the technical challenges associated with the large size and complexity of the exon cluster.",

Moreover, we demonstrate that bidirectional pairings mediate the splicing outcome of alternative exons in relative pairing strength-correlated mode.

To decipher the mechanism for srp mutually exclusive splicing, we first searched for sequences that were conserved in Drosophila. Interestingly, comparative sequence analysis identified four highly conserved intronic elements, one in the intron downstream from exon 3, two between exon 4.1 and exon 4.2, and one upstream of exon 5 ( Fig. 1; Supplemental Fig. S2) . Surprisingly, these elements are predicted to form two pairs of RNA secondary structures between introns in all of the species surveyed ( Fig. 1B; Supplemental Fig. S3 ). Importantly, the predicted formation of unusual architectures between introns points to a potential mechanism for the mutually exclusive selection of exon 4 variants. As shown in Figure 1B , the inclusion of exon 4.1 would be activated if the latter stem is implemented. However, in the other configuration, where the former stem is implemented, exon 4.2 would be included. Alternatively, both pairs could possibly form a long-range pseudoknot structure. Thus, the presence of these dual docking-site-dependent pairings could constitute a novel mechanistic framework responsible for the mutually exclusive choice of exon variant.",

We generated a minigene construct containing exons 3-5 and intervening sequences driven by the inducible metallothionein promoter (Fig. 1A) . Splice isoforms containing mutually exclusive exons recapitulating the splicing pattern of the endogenous gene could be detected in transfection experiments using Drosophila S2 cells. This system is well suited for delineating important cis-elements involved in the selection of alternative exon 4. We observed that mutating the upstream docking sequence (Ud) or the downstream selector (Ds), designed to disrupt the upstream pairing interaction, did not cause a significant decrease in the exon 4 inclusion frequency (M1 and M2, Fig. 1C ,D). Nevertheless, M1 or M2 mutations resulted in a marked reduction in the exon 4.2 inclusion frequency, while the exon 4.1 inclusion frequency was increased (Fig. 1C,D) . Importantly, the reduced efficiency of exon 4.2 inclusion caused by the individual mutations was restored to wild-type levels by compensatory double mutations (M12, Fig. 1C ,D). These data indicated that exon 4.2 inclusion was controlled by upstream RNA pairing in D. melanogaster. To validate this finding, we generated a series of mutations to assess the contribution of upstream RNA pairing to the selection of exon 4 variants by changing the upstream RNA pairings while leaving the downstream RNA pairings unaffected ( Fig. 1E; Supplemental Fig. S4A ). When the upstream RNA pairing was weakened by point mutations, the inclusion frequency of exon 4.2 was decreased dramatically. In contrast, strengthening the upstream RNA pairing increased the frequency of exon 4.2 inclusion markedly (Fig. 1E ). Analysis of a series of mutations revealed that the exon 4.2 inclusion frequency was strongly correlated with the strength of upstream RNA pairing, whereas the effect of pairing strength on exon 4.2 inclusion was graded (Fig. 1F ). Our results indicate that upstream RNA pairing (stem I) specifically directs exon 4.2 inclusion.",

To determine how dual RNA pairing could function to ensure the fidelity of exon 4 mutually exclusive splicing, we examined the effect of simultaneous disruption of stems I and II on exon 4 inclusion ( Fig. 2A) . A small but significant increase in exon 4 skipping was observed when the Ud and Ds sequences were disrupted to abolish stems I and II simultaneously (M1, M2, Fig. 2B ,C). Similar results were obtained using other constructs designed to simultaneously abolish stems I and II (M3, M4, Fig. 2B ,C). Such exon 4 skipping, which results in frameshift mutations, cannot be detected in vivo (Supplemental Fig. S5A ). Moreover, we observed RT-PCR products containing exon 4.1 and exon 4.2 spliced together as a consequence of the simultaneous disruptive mutations (Fig. 2B ). This aberrant splicing is analogous to the inclusion of multiple exon 6 variants in Dscam, which results from the depletion of the binding protein hrp36 (Olson et al. 2007 ). However, the latter is mechanistically different from the disruption of RNA pairing, which acts by relaxing the suppression of the in-loop exon. Collectively, these results showed that the simultaneous disruption of the upstream and downstream pairing increased the aberrant splicing of exon 4 markedly (Fig. 2C ). This strongly suggests that dual RNA pairings may be required for the efficient inclusion of alternative exon 4.",

Intriguingly, we observed only a slight change in the exon 4.2 inclusion frequency when stem I was disrupted, in stark contrast to the \u223c50% decrease in inclusion frequency in the presence of stem II (Fig. 3A ). This trend was reflected by the correlation between the upstream RNA pairing strength and the exon 4.2 inclusion frequency in the presence or absence of competition from stem II (Fig. 3A ). In the former case, the 4.2 inclusion frequency ranged from 30% to 75% in response to the modulation of stem I strength as evidenced by the steep slope of the curve. In contrast, stem I strength had little effect on the selection of the exon 4 variant in the stem II disruption construct.

In addition, we observed that the intronic distances between the 5 \u2032 splice site and the upstream selector were shorter than the distances between the upstream selector and the 3 \u2032 splice site in Drosophila (Supplemental Fig. S5F ), which cannot account for differences in exon 4.1 and 4.2 inclusion frequencies.",

            "text": "To investigate these two possibilities, we created a series of constructs with deletions of Us and Dd, and/or the loop sequence (Fig. 6A) . These deletions were designed to mimic the approximation of sequences caused by the inter-intronic Us-to-Dd pairing (stem II). RT-PCR analysis revealed that exon 4.1 was predominantly included (\u223c90%) (M3, Fig.  6B ,C), while the perturbation of downstream pairing caused a remarkable decrease in exon 4.1 inclusion (M4) and enhanced exon 4 skipping. Importantly, the exon 4.1 inclusion frequency was not affected significantly even though the construct lacked the Us-to-Dd RNA stem (M6, Fig. 6B,C) . This change in splicing pattern was consistent with previous studies (Muh et al. 2002; Baraniak et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2011) and provides strong evidence that exon 4.1 inclusion is dependent on the formation of downstream pairing to bring splice sites (or/and the elements) in proximity, but the structure itself is not required. Interestingly, a distinct pattern was observed when we examined the approximation effect of Ud-to-Ds RNA pairing (stem I) on the selection of alternative exon 4.2 (Fig. 6D-F) . We observed that exon 4.2 was frequently included (\u223c70%) in the presence of the upstream pairing (M9, Fig. 6E,F) , as in the construct that lacked Ud, Ds and intervening sequence (M12). However, exon 4.2 inclusion was slightly but not significantly reduced by perturbation of the upstream pairing (M10). These observations demonstrate that RNA pairingfacilitated approximation may not be evident. These results are supported by the fact that alternative exon 4.2 was included frequently even after the simultaneous disruption of stems I and II ( Fig. 2A,B) . This approximation pattern discrepancy was compatible with the much stronger splice site strength of alternative exon 4.2 than exon 4.1. These results indicated that upstream pairing acted to enhance the exon 4.2 splicing rate and efficiency by bringing splice sites in proximity, thereby resulting in striking preferences in competition with downstream-pairing-dependent exon 4.1 splicing.",

We inserted exon 4.1 and its flanking sequence into the exon 4 cluster and evaluated the splicing pattern and efficiency of the resulting construct ( Fig. 7A ). In this case, an upstream selector sequence required to ensure mutually exclusive splicing was duplicated simultaneously with the exon 4.1 expansion. Little aberrant splicing, including exon skipping, was detected (Fig. 7B) . Exon-specific restriction digestion revealed that three exon variants, including nascent exon 4.1 * , were alternatively spliced in the mutually exclusive manner (In1, Fig. 7B,C) . This result demonstrated that mutually exclusive splicing was not disrupted by expansion of the two-exon cluster in srp to a three-exon cluster. In addition, a similar splicing pattern was observed with an insertion construct containing a duplication of exon 4.2 and its flanking sequence (In2, Fig.  7B ,C). Furthermore, mutually exclusive splicing was not disrupted within the cluster after the three-exon cluster was expanded to a four-exon cluster (In3, Fig. 7B,C) . The elegant arrangement of intronic elements facilitates the heritable expansion of the control system in accompaniment with bidirectional expansion of exon clusters thus preserving the integrity of mutually exclusive splicing in an ever-increasing exon cluster. This suggests that the dual pairing system faces little regulatory conflict during the evolutionary expansion of an exon cluster.",

Previous studies indicated that single selection of variant exons is directed by RNA pairing interaction between a unique docking site and a selector sequence in the exon 4, 6, and 9 clusters in Drosophila Dscam (Graveley 2005; Anastassiou et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2011) . However, this model was based on relatively small-scale data from limited Drosophila species. Therefore, we revisited Dscam exon clusters 4, 6, and 9 using a larger number of different arthropod species for higher resolution. Consistent with our previous study , we found no convincing evidence for the arrangement of dual docking sites and secondary structural interactions within the exon 4 cluster in Drosophila species, nevertheless we discovered conserved dual docking sites within Dscam exon 4 clusters in hymenopteran species (Fig. 8A ). In these cases, a conserved intronic element downstream from constitutive exon 3 was complementary to an intronic element within alternative exon 4 in 11 hymenopteran species, while a conserved intronic element upstream of constitutive exon 5 was complementary to an upstream intronic element (Supplemental Fig. S7 ). Given the large size of the hymenopteran Dscam exon 4 cluster and the concomitant technical difficulties, we sought to generate deletion constructs to test the effects of RNA pairing on splicing in silkworm cells (Fig. 8A,B) . Since exon 4.4 was seldom included in the minigene constructs using BmN cells, we did not demonstrate the proposed dsRNA stem in exon 4.4 inclusion. However, mutating the upstream docking site (M1) or the downstream selector (M2) significantly increased exon 4.1 inclusion (Fig. 8C-E) . Importantly, compensatory double mutations (M12) reverted the efficiency of exon 4.1 inclusion to wild-type level. Moreover, stronger pairing in compensatory double dsRNA (M34) enhanced such inhibitory effects on exon 4.1 inclusion (Fig. 8D-F) .",

Interestingly, we discovered dual docking sites and their guided structural architecture within Dscam exon 9 clusters in lepidopteran species (Fig. 9A; Supplemental Fig. S8 ). To validate the bidirectional RNA pairing interaction, we tested the effect of the silkworm dsRNA on exon 9 inclusion using disrupting and compensatory mutations (Fig. 9B) . Disrupting mutations (M1, M2) on upstream stem I led to a dramatic decrease in silkworm exon 9.8 (Fig. 9C-E) . The reduced efficiency of silkworm exon 9.8 inclusion caused by individual mutations (M1, M2) was restored by compensatory double mutations (M12) (Fig. 9C-E) . Likewise, disruption of this downstream structure (stem III) by individual mutations (M3, M4) eliminated silkworm exon 9.5 inclusion, but its reduced efficiency was restored by compensatory double mutations (M34) (Fig. 9C-E) . Moreover, the reduced efficiency of silkworm exon 9.6 inclusion in other deleted minigenes caused by individual mutation of the downstream stem (stem IV) was largely restored by compensatory double mutations (M54) (Fig. 9C-E) . Because the targeted exons for dsRNA II and V were seldom included in transfection experiments with silkworm cells, we have not yet experimentally demonstrated their proposed structures. However, they are strongly supported by their evolutionary conservation and some compensatory mutations in Danaus plexippus (Supplemental Fig. S8B ). Moreover, this architecture is evolutionarily conserved in hymenopteran species, although the primary sequence is highly diverged (Supplemental Fig. S9 ). Moreover, clear evidence of compensatory structural evolution and evolutionary intermediates exists within dsRNA regions in hymenopteran (Supplemental Fig. S9 ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the bidirectional RNA pairings function in the inclusion of Dscam exon 9 in lepidopteran and hymenopteran species.",

In silico approaches such as comparative genomics and structural prediction are useful for identifying base-pairing interactions (Plocik and Graveley 2013) ; however, highly complex RNA interactions may be extremely difficult to predict (Cruz and Westhof 2009) . The RNA architectures identified in our study were not predicted by in silico approaches (Pervouchine 2014) , nor were they detected using recent high-throughput RNA structure sequencing techniques (Daines et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012) . Moreover, most RNA structural studies focus on the role of a local RNA duplex in alternative splicing and other processing. More than five years after the discovery of competing pairing based on an upstream docking site in the Dscam exon cluster 6 (Graveley 2005), we explored the competing pairing in the 14-3-3\u03be gene and in Dscam exon clusters 4 and 9 based on a downstream docking site ). Ten years after the initial model was described (Graveley 2005) , this study further revealed that the upstream and downstream docking sites and their base-pairing are present in the same exon cluster. Combining informatics and evolutionary analysis with experimental data, we propose a bidirectional pairing model to explain the splicing mechanism of commitment to a single choice from a tandem array of exons (Fig. 10) .",

            "text": "Obviously, dual docking sites heavily complicate pairing-guided mutually exclusive selections of exon variants. In contrast with absolute mutually exclusive pairing in the previous unidirectional pairing model (Graveley 2005; Yang et al. 2011) , it is possible that both pairs are not mutually exclusive, but occur simultaneously through the formation of a long-range pseudoknot (i.e., srp) or double hairpin (i.e., Dscam exon 9 cluster). However, the former is contradictory in regulation; for example, upstream RNA pairing activated exon 4.2 inclusion, while downstream RNA pairing simultaneously suppressed it. Moreover, long-range tertiary pseudoknot structures are frequently essential for function. For example, telomerase relies on a core pseudoknot within its RNA component to synthesize telomeric DNA (Blackburn and Collins 2011) . Similarly, the formation of a pseudoknot is required for efficient coronavirus ribosomal frameshifting during protein synthesis (Brierley et al. 1989) . In contrast, no precedent exists for a requirement for a long-range pseudoknot structure governing specific exon inclusion in a mutually exclusive mode. Our results indicate that inclusion of a single exon 4 is similar to the WT in the disruption of alternate pairing (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, simultaneous strengthening or weakening of both pairs to similar degrees had no remarkable effect on exon 4 selection (Fig. 4A,B) . Therefore, we propose that these elements would not tend to act via the formation of a pseudoknot, but via competing RNA-RNA pairing interactions in vivo. Alternatively, even if both pairs occur simultaneously, the mutually exclusive inclusion of alternative exon 4 may depend on the kinetics of pairing-based splicing. In this case, the more quickly spliced exon would be included in the mRNA while the other is spliced out (Fig. 10A) . Thus, in any specific structure, only one exon variant would be included in each mRNA. Overall, these studies provide a distinct mechanistic framework for the regulation of mutually exclusive splicing.",

            "text": "According to our pairing-mediated splicing model, alternative splicing includes two sequential processes: pairing and subsequent splicing (Fig. 10A) , both of which could influence the outcomes of alternative splicing. In the first pro-cess, the inclusion of an alternative exon could be modulated by pairing efficiency, which depends on the pairing strength, the interacting distance, the position of the alternative exon, and the proteins that facilitate long-range RNA interactions. Despite stochastic pairing, the stronger pairing interaction generally leads to more pre-mRNA molecules that contain such pairing thereby increasing the frequency of targeted exon variant inclusion as evidenced by mutation and in vivo analysis (May et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2011) . Moreover, the stronger pairing interaction might elicit more splicing repression via a looping-out mechanism (Jin et al. 2011) , thus enhancing targeted exon variant inclusion. Notably, this inclusion was not determined by the upstream or downstream pairing strengths, but by the relative competitiveness between them (Fig. 10B ). After pairing, the inclusion of an alternative exon is regulated by splicing speed and efficiency, which depend on the strength of the alternative exon splice site, the intronic distance from the selector element to the splice site, the presence of a splicing silencer/enhancer, and the presence of activator-and repressor-binding proteins, as has been reported previously (Black 2003; Matlin et al. 2005; Blencowe 2006; Olson et al. 2007; Chen and Manley 2009; Nilsen and Graveley 2010; Fu and Ares 2014; Matera and Wang 2014) . The splice site strength, in particular, which directly influences its recognition and splicing speed, is likely to play an important role in the pairing-mediated selection of an alternative exon. Pairingmediated splicing is highly regulated by multiple mechanisms in an overlapping manner.",

Bidirectional RNA pairings would be advantageous for the evolutionary expansion of exon clusters. Indeed, mimicking the expansion of either the downstreampairing-guided exon 4.1 or the upstream-pairing-guided exon 4.2 produced little conflict between splicing and regulatory (Fig. 7) . In our previous model, the exon most proximal to the docking site would be included if the docking site assumes a linear conformation without specific RNA pairing interactions . However, this model could not explain how the duplicated exon would also be spliced in a mutually exclusive manner if this exon variant were further Figure 1 . The dashed gray arrow is depicted as the potential pairing interaction. For an alternative exon B to be included in the mature mRNA, either of the docking sites alternately interacts with their selector sequence. For example, when the Us pairs with the Dd, the RNA pairing interaction functions to promote the recognition of the weak splice site, thereby activating the splicing of exon B1 to constitutive exon C. In this case, only the exon B1 variant is included in the mRNA, because the remaining exon B2 might be actively repressed by downstream pairing in combination with other players such as weak or suboptimal splice sites (yellow circle) and splicing repressors (red oval). While the Ud pairs with the Ds, such RNA pairing interactions serve to activate or enhance the inclusion of alternative exon B2. Alternatively, both pairs occur simultaneously through the formation of a longrange pseudoknot. In this case, the more quickly spliced exon would be included in the mRNA, while the other is spliced out. (B) Upstream pairing (red) and downstream pairing (blue) are competitive but regulate the inclusion of the alternative exon. duplicated. The dual-docking-site model of this study could provide a reasonable explanation for its control mechanism in such an evolutionary expansion. Furthermore, any mutation in the single docking site would influence the interaction with the selector sequences and thus interfere with the inclusion of all within-cluster exon variants (Graveley 2005) . We showed that mutation of either of the dual docking sites had little effect on srp exon 4 inclusion frequency (Fig. 1) . This suggests that dual docking sites probably are much better able to tolerate this deleterious mutation. Finally, our results revealed that bidirectional RNA pairings may fine tune the inclusion of alternative exon. These bidirectional pairing interactions are not only characterized as competition but also cooperation. Such long-range RNA crosstalk, in cooperation with other elements, shapes a dynamic architectural network of complex alternative splicing regulation.",

            "text": "This unusual type of dynamic RNA secondary structures and architecture is not restricted to the srp gene. We showed that it also operates in Dscam exon 4 and 9 clusters. In addition, such dual secondary structures and architecture may be embedded in Drosophila RIC-3 (Supplemental Fig. S10 ). Some of them are young and clade-specific alternatively spliced exons (i.e., \u223c80 million years for srp), whereas others are much more ancient and deeply conserved (i.e., >300 million years for Dscam exon 9 cluster). Although we have not found strong evidence for the arrangements of dual docking sites and their secondary structural interactions within Dscam exon 6 clusters, this possibility cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the unique docking site does not explain why its deletion did not result in a dramatic decrease in the inclusion frequency of all exons 6 (May et al. 2011) . Higher-resolution comparative genomics from more species may allow determination of structurally conserved intronic sequences. In summary, the architectural landscape across arthropod species proposed here has shaped a potentially broad pattern for long-range RNA-RNA interaction in directing mutually exclusive splicing. Further investigations posed by this study involve exploring the extent and role of such complex RNA-RNA regulatory networks in other RNAs, particularly in explosively increasing long noncoding RNAs.",

The genomic sequences of the Dscam genes for other insect species were determined by PCR and sequencing (Supplemental Table S1 ). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) and an oligo(dT) 20 primer (Life Technologies). PCR was performed using a denaturing step at 95\u00b0C for 2 min and 35 cycles of a denaturing step at 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, an annealing step at 50\u00b0C-55\u00b0C for 30 sec and an extension step at 72\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. RT-PCR and PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for sequencing. The specific primers were designed based on the cDNA sequence (Supplemental Table S1 ). Total genomic DNA was extracted using the MiniBEST Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 55\u00b0C-60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 2-4 min, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Amplification products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector for sequencing. and the intervening sequence for minigene constructs. Site mutagenesis was performed in both elements to disrupt the RNA stem according to the schematic diagrams of minigene constructs using primers (Supplemental Table S1 ). Disruptive and compensatory double mutations were performed to restore RNA stem structure, based on the schematic diagrams. To discriminate from the original exon 4.1 or 4.2, point mutations were introduced to generate a specific restriction enzyme site. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. WT and mutant constructs from D. melanogaster srp were inserted into the pMT/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) under the metallothionein promoter. A. mellifera Dscam exon 4 was seldom seen in S2 cells transfected with the minigene constructs; therefore, we used BmN cells for transfection under control of the Baculovirus IE1 promoter (a gift from C. Gong, Shuzhou University, China). The plasmids were isolated using the Endo-free Plasmid Mini Kit I (OMEGA, Norcross, GA, USA) and transfected into Drosophila S2 cell lines or silkworm cells (BmN) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To induce the expression of the minigene, copper sulfate was added directly to the S2 cell culture medium to a final concentration of 500 \u03bcM. Total RNA was harvested 48 h after transfection using TRIzol reagent. RT-PCR and/or exon-specific restriction enzyme analysis were performed to detect the alternative splicing status. The values of the error bars used in this study were calculated from the average of three independent experiments.",
