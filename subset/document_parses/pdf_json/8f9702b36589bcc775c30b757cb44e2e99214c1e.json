Endoscopic nasal polypectomy under local anaesthesia offers instant relief in selected patients with obstructive chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We aimed to analyse patient tolerability during the procedure while measuring its effectiveness. Methods A prospective study of patients who underwent in-office microdebrider-assisted polypectomy under local anaesthetic from September 2018 to November 2019 in a Spanish tertiary hospital was performed. The tolerability was measured by monitoring vital signs during the procedure and using a visual analogue scale posteriorly. The effectiveness was calculated through patient-reported outcomes (SNOT-22) and endoscopic evaluation 1 and 6 months follow-up. Results Forty-four patients were included, with a mean age of 60.7 years. The mean visual analogue scale score was 2.76 out of 10 points. Vital signs were steady overall, with a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.001) in systolic pressure during the procedure. Presyncope and epistaxis were among the few mild complications. However, we registered one major complication that required intensive care admission. There was a 64% reduction in the SNOT-22 score in the first month, with a maintained effect after 6 months. Patients with asthma and a higher polyp load were the subgroups that required more time to achieve significant improvement. Conclusions In-office polypectomy is a very effective technique that alleviates obstructive symptoms in patients with nasal polyposis, and it is generally safe and well tolerated when performed by an expert. However, rhinologists must be aware of potentially severe complications.",

Nevertheless, there are several case reports of severe hypotension during nasal or oral manipulations that could be explained by the trigeminal cardiac reflex (TCR), triggered by the stimulation of any branch of the fifth cranial nerve along its course [12] . It is a clinical phenomenon characterised by hemodynamic alterations such as hypotension, apnoea, bradycardia, and gastric hypermobility [13] . It represents one of the most powerful autonomous reflexes, and it has been infrequently noted by otolaryngologists. The strength and duration of the stimulus in combination with other risk factors (e.g., medication) have been described as triggers for the TCR.

When performing a potential aerosol and respiratory droplets generating procedure like in-office polypectomy, the currently available guideline recommendation for personal protective equipment should be followed [18] .",

Besides, there might also be a selection bias as anxious patients might have chosen FESS more often than in-office polypectomy, when the two options were offered. Moreover, the surgeons might have had a tendency to suggest FESS in severe cases and polypectomy in milder cases. However, in the final sample there were cases from all the severity spectrum of this disease.",

Nevertheless, further randomized studies are needed to narrow down the most cost-effective indications.",
