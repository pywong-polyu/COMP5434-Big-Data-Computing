Although the number of COVID-19 cases in Japan is relatively low (i.e., 16,305 confirmed cases out of 124 million Japanese citizens as of May 18, 2020), there are still concerns about the pandemic's substantial impact on mental health in the general population (Shigemura et al., 2020) . Given this situation, many researchers have emphasized mental health assessment, prevention, and treatment in the context of a pandemic (Bao et al., 2020; Torales et al., 2020) .",

Some prospective longitudinal surveys have been conducted targeting adult populations (e.g., Pierce et al., 2020; Wang, Pan, Wan, Tan, Xu, McIntyre, et al., 2020) ; however, no such studies have been conducted with children or adolescents.

For example, non-completers tended to have a lower family income and showed more prosocial behavior. This indicates that attrition in the study could be the common effect (Hern\u00e1n et al., 2004) of annual income and prosocial behavior. While this study statistically addressed the effect of sample attrition with the multiple imputation method, future research will need to take substantial measures to prevent sample dropout.",

Measurement bias may have also occurred in the self-report section for the length of school closure. Accordingly, clinicians' ratings of neurodevelopmental disorders, children's self-reports on depression/anxiety, the official record of school closure, or any other valid measurements should be considered in future research.",
