However, few studies met the inclusion criteria. A Swedish study including patients with and without COVID-19 admitted to a geriatric clinic found that clinical frailty was a more important predictor for death with COVID-19 than age [5] . In addition, a US-based study using information from electronic medical records found that age had only a small effect on COVID-19 mortality when comorbidities were considered [6] . However, the existing literature has failed to address two important questions regarding age and COVID-19 mortality. First, what the age trajectory of mortality during the pandemic looks like, in comparison to previous years, and if this differs by groups with different health status. Often age is adjusted for but how death risk increases with age is rarely presented. Age is among the strongest risk factors for mortality, even in the absence of a pandemic, with an exponential increase in death risk with age [7] . The question is, has age had a more pronounced role on mortality during the pandemic, and, if so, has this age effect been different in groups with different health status and care need? A reasonable strategy to assess the risk of dying from COVID-19 in different groups is to stratify the population accordingly and estimate death rates within each subgroup separately.",

Relative risks of certain risk factors in relation to others are valid only among the infected individuals under study or generalized to subgroups of other infected individuals. They are, however, not valid as risk estimates for the same factors within the total population.

With time, they are offered publicly organized and funded home care to manage everyday life. This care consists of assistance with everyday activities, such as cleaning, groceries, and cooking, and personal care, such as showering and going to bed. A smaller proportion also receives home health care. If individuals lose the ability to live at home even with assistance, they are offered the opportunity to live in a care home. Once individuals move to a care home, they are generally frail and suffer from a high burden of comorbidity, which is reflected by the statistic that, as of 2018, older adults spent only a median 2 years in a care home before dying [15] . Here we distinguish three groups in the total population according to their level of care, which may be considered a proxy of health status.

We estimated expected mortality in 2020 using a Poisson GLM, which was the preferred choice in a comparison with a negative binomial GLM. We estimated separate models for each age group, care status group, and sex. Our model specification followed a Serfling-like regression model, which has frequently been used for the estimation of baseline mortality in seasonal settings [18] . Each model consisted of a time trend component that we modeled using a natural cubic spline, a seasonal component that we modeled using a sine and cosine wave, and an offset given by the respective number of person years at risk. We excluded January to March, July, and August, and November and December in the estimation to reduce the effect of months that are particularly vulnerable to external factors such as winter flu epidemics or heat waves in the summer. This is in line with the procedure applied by EuroMOMO [19] . The model was fitted to the respective monthly death counts from 2015 to 2019. We used bootstrapping to address the uncertainty in observed death counts and to provide a prediction interval (PI) for the predicted mortality in 2020. We produced 5000 sets of resampled death counts, assuming that deaths are Poisson distributed with mean equal to the observed counts. The model was fitted separately to each of these sets. Across the resulting 5000 predictions for the months in 2020, we extracted the median estimate, as well as the estimates at 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to calculate the 95% prediction interval (PI).",

Before age 80, the proportion of individuals with public financed care, at own home or in care homes, did not exceed 5%. Compared to men, a higher proportion of women received care. In age group 85\u00c089, around 25% of women received either home care or lived in a care home, while the corresponding proportion in men was around 20%. In age group 90+, more than 50% of the population received home care or lived in a care home. Even if subject to small variations, the distributions have been rather stable over the study period. Fig. 1 presents the observed and expected death rates by sex and over age from January to July 2020. The figure clearly shows pronounced mortality differences between the three groups regardless of the pandemic, with individuals in care homes having around ten to twenty times higher death rates compared to individuals in independent living at comparable ages. The differences were larger among the younger old than among the oldest old. The figure further shows that in the months prior to the pandemic, the observed death rates for 2020 were at the lower end of the prediction interval of the expected death rates. From April onwards, when the pandemic had a clear impact on death rates, excess mortality was primarily present in the two groups who received care, while the group in independent living showed little excess mortality. Finally, the figure shows that the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have shifted mortality to higher levels almost in parallel to the age trajectory we would expect without the pandemic. To wit, the excess mortality was not more present in the oldest old than in the younger old compared to each age groups' expected levels of mortality, with some minor exceptions. For example, in May, the largest excess in the independent living group was experienced by those aged 90+. By July, almost all mortality levels were within the range of the expected mortality for 2020. Fig. 2 shows the relative differences in excess mortality within each care group, and by sex and age. While the relative increase in excess mortality was largest in April and May for the two groups with care, the pattern was even more pronounced over these months for the group in independent living. In this group, it was particularly pronounced the oldest individuals \u00c0 among women aged 90+ and men 85+ -who experienced consistently higher death rates than expected, corresponding to around 70% higher than expected for women and 50% higher for men from April to June. As seen in Fig. 1 , the group living in care homes experienced the greatest increases in age-specific death rates, corresponding to 75% or more in ages 70\u00c090 for men and ages 70\u00c084 for women. Above that age, the excess mortality was around 50% for both men and women, lower than among the oldest age group in independent living.",

In fact, during April, the number of excess deaths was higher at every age in the care home group compared to the other two groups. Although Fig. 1 related the number of excess deaths to the size of each group, Fig. 3 presents only crude death counts, as illustrated by the rather low contribution of deaths in the youngest age group in care home settings. Even though this group had the highest relative excess mortality, it did not substantially impact overall excess mortality because so few individuals live in care homes at this age. At no time were there fewer deaths than expected for any of the age groups. The highest contribution of death counts was seen in April in women aged 90+ living in care homes, with 441 more deaths than expected (PI: 383\u00c0494). The corresponding number for men was 202 (PI: 160\u00c0239). Fig. 4 presents two things, first, the total relative excess mortality for the entire period from April to June 2020 for the three groups, by age and sex (black line), as well as the share of those deaths attributable to COVID-19 deaths (bars). For example, among women aged 70\u00c074, we observe a relative excess in death rate of around 5%. Additionally, adding in the respective COVID-19 deaths in women receiving home care, the relative excess in the death rate rises to 10%. Finally, also adding the deaths in women in care homes results in relative excess of 17.5%. The total relative excess observed for this age group was around 20%. Notes: Relative mortality differences have been calculated by diving death rates in 2020 by the corresponding predicted death rates minus one. Expected death rates have been predicted from a Poisson regression, with a time and a seasonal component, fitted for the months April to June and September to October between 2015 and 2019.

In March 2020, excess mortality was observed only in young-old women residing in care homes, whereas in April there was excess mortality in all three groups and at all ages. However, excess mortality was more pronounced among those receiving care than among the group in independent living. The relative increase in mortality with age was not larger during 2020 than what was expected from previous years. For the group living in care homes, we instead observed higher excess mortality among the younger ages than among the oldest old. Because excess mortality is estimated as the difference between observed and expected mortality, the magnitude depends on the predicted level of the expected mortality. We chose a regression approach to model our baseline because we compared three population groups with varying degrees of mortality improvement. However, in sensitivity analyses related to model specification and data input, where we tested the inclusion and exclusion of different months, the shape of the seasonal component, and the inclusion of 2020 summer months, we found the age pattern for mortality was consistent (supplementary figures 6, 7) . That is, despite varying magnitudes of excess mortality, the finding that the relative effect of age on mortality seems to be similar during the pandemic as before the pandemic. This is not to be confused with the fact that age is indeed a strong predictor of death, and that the level of mortality was clearly highest at higher ages.",

This interpretation is supported by the gradient dose-response relationship between care and mortality, where care home residents experienced the greatest excess mortality, followed by those with home care, and finally those living independently. Furthermore, the results suggest that age alone is not necessarily a risk factor for COVID-19-specific death, beyond the \"normal\" risk of age that is present in absence of the pandemic. This interpretation is supported by the parallel shift in death rates over age observed in all three groups, rather than an exponential increase with age.

Although Individuals receiving care regularly meet home care providers, the group in independent living is likely to have fewer contacts outside their household. Even if the relatively healthy group in independent living may have been exposed to the virus during the early phase of the pandemic through social events and everyday living, they may have been able to avoid the virus to a higher extent by self-isolation. In Sweden, individuals 70 years and older were identified as a risk group and recommended to stay in isolation in late March 2020, something those with home care and in care homes could not do. Official statistics of confirmed COVID-19 in the groups with home care and in care homes in July 2020 (National Board of Health and Welfare) indeed show that the proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases was higher in care homes than in home care. This may indicate that individuals in care homes were more affected, and possibly also tested to a greater extent. The differences in positive tests vary greatly between age groups. For instance, in July 2020, for men, it differs between 0.5 to 11 percentage points depending on age, and among women between 0 and 27 percentage points. Because we also observed an age pattern of excess mortality in age groups with no difference in positive tests, we conclude that even if a different level of exposure to the virus is a likely explanation, it may not account for all of the difference in mortality.",

As the expectation for improved mortality in 2020 continues this trend, the difference between expected and observed may be especially inflated.

Also, a potential drawback of using excess deaths is that they mirror a net effect of both excess deaths and potentially saved lives during the pandemic.
