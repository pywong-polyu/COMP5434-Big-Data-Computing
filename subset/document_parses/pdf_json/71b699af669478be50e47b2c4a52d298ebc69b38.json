Job insecurity represents a critical intermediate between the economic ramifications of an economic crisis and work and stress outcomes, however, the underlying cognitive consequences of job insecurity and how to buffer those effects are not well understood. We examine how corporate cost-cutting announcements indirectly relate to employees' attention through their relationship with employee job insecurity and investigate supervisor support as a potential buffer of these relationships. We used multi-source data to test our research model, combining data on cost-cutting announcements (budget cuts, layoffs, and furloughs) in news articles for 165 organizations with survey data from 421 full-time employees from these organizations between March 26, 2020 and April 8, 2020. Cost-cutting announcements are positively related to job insecurity, which is related to employee's attention with supervisor support mitigating the effects of job insecurity on attention. Grounded in self-regulation theories, we contribute to and extend the theoretical understanding of the organizational context for job insecurity and cognitive outcomes. We discuss the implications for organizations to manage and prepare for future economic crises, specifically on organizational communication and supervisor interventions.",

Flight recorder data showed that the aircraft was mechanically sound and fit to fly. As the pilots approached the tarmac, they were discussing COVID-19 and continued their discussion even after prompts by air traffic control to focus on landing the aircraft (Shahzad, 2020) . Although a plane crash is a rare and extreme outcome for attentional deficits, the incident signifies the importance of understanding the many ways in which a global pandemic influences attention at work. Therefore, we use this paper to examine how, when, and why concerns induced by an economic crisis (i.e., , such as job insecurity, relate to employee attention and explore how organizations can mitigate the impact of company cost-cutting announcements and job insecurity on employee attention.",

COVID-19 has been particularly widespread and devastating from a public health and psychological perspective. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the current outbreak will create the worst economic recession since the Great Depression (International Monetary Fund, 2020) . More than 22 million individuals filed new jobless claims in the United States alone from March 2020 to the middle of April 2020 with new jobless claims in July 2021 starting to fall back down to levels last seen in March 2020 (Department of Labor, 2021). Job loss puts individuals at risk for adverse health consequences, including increased mortality (Roelfs et al., 2011; Strully, 2009 ). Individuals and employees alike do not know how long the pandemic will persist, have no control over future outbreaks, and have no way to anticipate the long-lasting effects COVID-19 will have on work (Fouad, 2020) . For those who were able to retain jobs during this economic crisis, awareness of company cost-cutting and job insecurity are widespread with likely deleterious consequences for work outcomes and employee health (de Jong et al., 2016; Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018; Keim et al., 2014; Schumacher et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Job insecurity is defined as \"a perceived threat to the continuity and stability of employment as it is currently experienced\" (Shoss, 2017 (Shoss, , p. 1914 . Job insecurity directs employees' cognitive and affective reactions to possible job loss and its consequences. As a result, job insecurity results in adverse emotional responses, such as anger and anxiety (Reisel et al., 2010; , in addition to effects on general well-being (De Witte et al., 2016; Van der Elst et al., 2014) . Prior research has incorporated organization-level events to study their effects on job insecurity and outcomes (e.g., bankruptcy; Mohr, 2000; mergers; Lam et al., 2015; van Dick et al., 2006) . The current study extends this growing literature by examining potential mechanisms for mitigating job insecurity's negative effects on attention during a widespread economic crisis in 2020 affecting numerous organizations. From a theoretical perspective, self-regulation theories provide a useful framework for understanding this phenomenon. One of the central tenets of these theories is that stress and rumination can result in an insufficient ability to regulate attention and reduce the ability of individuals to pay attention to their work tasks (Beal et al., 2005) . In the current study, job insecurity is conceptualized as worrying about one's job and the future of one's career. The widespread cost-cutting announcements stemming from the COVID-19 induced economic crisis likely exacerbates the rumination and stress resulting from job insecurity. In sum, the current study draws on self-regulation theories, such that employees may have an even harder time focusing on their job tasks if the stress and rumination stemming from job insecurity takes their attention away from their work. Given the critical role of cognition for efficient and safe task execution (Sneddon et al., 2013; Sundf\u00f8r et al., 2019; Wallace & Chen, 2005) , the limited focus on attention in the job insecurity literature represents a critical research gap. Hence, we use self-regulation theories as a foundation for exploring whether widespread company cost-cutting and consequent job insecurity during the pandemic is linked to attention as proposed by self-regulation theories (Beal et al., 2005) .",

First, we examine job insecurity from employees in numerous organizations in an industry hit hard by an economic crisis, whereas most research examines the effects of events on job insecurity at a single organization (e.g., Mohr, 2000) . Economic crises occur frequently around the world (e.g., Great Recession of 2007-2009). Our study examines how these events can impact employees in a multitude of organizations within the same industry. We expect that employees' job insecurity and outcomes will be worse during an economic crisis as they have fewer options if they are laid off. Moreover, our paper heeds a recent call from occupational health experts to study how supervisors can support workers at a time of economic stress (Sinclair et al., 2020) . Second, we extend self-regulation theories (Beal et al., 2005) to demonstrate how societal and organizational events shape employee perceptions of job insecurity and attention. Hence, this study expands the criterion space for job insecurity by examining its relation to cognitive mechanisms, specifically attention.",

We define these cost-cutting measures as organizations reducing their spending, including budget cuts, furloughs, and layoffs. COVID-19 induced unemployment has continued throughout the pandemic as control of the virus is still far removed in many countries. In some hard-hit industries (e.g., oil and gas), employees may be concerned about losing their jobs as they may not easily find employment if alternate employers are also cutting costs. Within self-regulation theories (Beal et al., 2005) , these cost-cutting announcements represent an event that may elicit job insecurity related stress and rumination.",

The backdrop of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of organizational cost cutting, especially for industries driven by consumer demand (e.g., oil prices). Further, COVID-19 has disrupted the global economy with organizations having to adjust their entire operations to ensure their workforce's safety and the long-term profitability of their organization. The remaining employees of an organization that announces cost-cutting initiatives must change their work and procedures to alleviate the loss of financial resources and human capital. Keim et al.'s (2014) meta-analytic work shows organizational change, such as downsizing and layoffs, has a modest, positive relationship with job insecurity. Selfregulation theories provide a useful framework for understanding this relationship. Cost-cutting announcements likely increase an employee's thoughts on the stability of their employment, which are represented as off-task attentional demands in selfregulation theories (Beal et al., 2005) . As COVID-19 has forced whole industries to enact cost-cutting measures, these events have grown more common. In the current study, employees in organizations cutting costs will likely view their current employment as more threatened.",

Conflicting motivations may play a part in job insecurity affecting attention (Cheng & Chan, 2008; Shoss, 2017; . Job insecurity could motivate individuals to focus on their work tasks to show supervisors that they deserve to stay in the company. Conversely, job insecurity could trigger thoughts of future career prospects or financial insecurity, limiting their ability to attend to work tasks. Although theoretical arguments can be made that job insecurity either improves or impairs attention, metaanalyses present enough evidence that job insecurity impedes work performance and safety (Cheng & Chan, 2008; Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018) . Employees likely cannot focus on their work tasks as they ruminate about their job being threatened. As a result, we align our hypothesis on the effect of job insecurity on attention with self-regulation theory and empirical evidence. An individual facing a threat to their employment will have less attention for changes in their environment as they will be ruminating about their employment situation. As self-regulation theories suggest, we hypothesize that job insecurity will reduce attention.",

Due to the serious implications of attention for work and health outcomes (Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018) , mitigation strategies are necessary. Supervisors represent one of the most critical features in an individual's work environment due to their control over important resources and personnel-related decision-making authority. Perceived supervisor support is defined as an employee's evaluation of how much their supervisor values them and cares about their well-being (Eisenberger et al., 2002) . During an economic crisis, the role of supervisors is even more critical due to their function as a gatekeeper to organizational resources, reducing their team's stress, and improving their employee's work outcomes (Sinclair et al., 2020) . A supervisor could schedule weekly check-in meetings to ensure their employees' well-being, or they could be flexible with when and how employees complete their work. Within the self-regulation theoretical framework, supervisors may influence the extent to which an event creates job insecurity related rumination and how much that rumination pulls the employee's attention away from work-related tasks. As a result, perceived supervisor support provides one potential mechanism for mitigating the effects of cost-cutting announcements during an economic crisis.",

The current study aligns with Lee et al.'s (2018) theoretical model to examine perceived supervisor support as both a buffer of cost-cutting announcements on job insecurity and job insecurity on attention. After organizations announce cost-cutting announcements, supervisors may help employees interpret the event as less of a threat to their employment. For example, the supervisor can specifically reassure them that their job is not in jeopardy and the cost-cutting announcement does not pertain to them. If employees still perceive the event as a threat, supportive supervisors can mitigate the effects on attention by helping employees pay attention to their job tasks and ruminate less.

(2014) . To examine the three-item adapted scale's reliability and validity, we conducted three analyses: reliability analyses, correlated the two scales, and correlated job insecurity with attention. The three-item scale (\u03b1 = .70) adapted for the industry associations and scale with three items from Van der Elst et al. (2014; \u03b1 = .87) were both reliable, and the two scales were strongly correlated (r = .72). These two analyses indicate that the adapted three-item adapted scale is reliable and closely related to the non-adapted items. Further, the correlation between the adapted three-item scale and attention (r = .32) and the Van der Elst et al.

They conducted Google searches and coded for the announcement of budget cuts, layoffs, or furloughs. We compared the date of the media article and the date the respondent took the survey. We only coded that the participants were exposed to a cost-cutting announcement if the respondent completed the survey after the date of the media article. To ensure the company costcutting was due to COVID-19, we only searched for public news releases from March 1, 2020 to April 8, 2020 as the pandemic was increasing in strength. The variable was coded as binary as yes (1) or no (0) if any cost-cutting announcement (budget cuts, layoffs, or furloughs) occurred before the participant completed the survey or if the company did not have a cost-cutting announcement. First, five raters were trained on the protocol and all five rated nine companies with 83% accuracy.

We included self-reported gender (0 = man, 1 = woman), partner (yes/no), the number of hours partner worked per week, and the number of children, as these variables were likely to covary with the variables of interest. Keim et al. (2014) note inconsistent findings in the literature with gender, so we include gender as a covariate to account for these potential differences. Employees with partners, especially partners working more hours, may experience fewer consequences of cost-cutting as their partners contribute to their family's income. Similarly, employees with children and more children may experience worse consequences with costcutting announcements as they have more financial commitments. We also included company size and sample source. Company size was manually coded using public information available online about the respondents' companies. The U.S. Department of Labor requires larger organizations to announce cost-cutting through the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) of 1988 (29 USC 2100 et. seq.), \"Protects workers, their families and communities by requiring most employers with 100 or more employees to provide notification 60 calendar days in advance of plant closings and mass layoffs.\" Our survey was distributed through two industry associations, so including the source and company size allowed us to account for any systematic differences across the companies and two samples. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations. We used full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation throughout to deal with missing data given its superior performance to alternatives (e.g., listwise deletion; Enders & Bandalos, 2001) and missing data guidelines (Newman, 2014) suggest using all available data. Prior to testing our hypotheses, we performed a series of confirmatory factor analyses at the individual level to test the measurement model specifying job insecurity, perceived supervisor support, and attention.",

Hypothesis 3 proposed that company cost-cutting announcements are associated with attention indirectly through job insecurity. To estimate the indirect effect, we adopted the parametric bootstrapping approach using an R-web utility developed by Selig and Preacher (2009) to yield asymmetric confidence intervals (CIs). The 20,000-repetition Monte Carlo tests indicated that job insecurity mediated the relationship of company cost-cutting announcements with attention (Unstandardized Indirect Effect = \u2212.07, 95% CI [\u2212.12, \u2212.004]).

Instead, perceived supervisor support directly reduced job insecurity regardless of the organization's cost-cutting announcements, indicating that supervisors may be generally important for reducing job insecurity. Hypothesis 4b proposed lower perceived supervisor support as strengthening the relationship between job insecurity and attention. This hypothesis was not supported; job insecurity during an economic crisis may be too strong to be alleviated by general supervisor support. Individuals low on job insecurity had increased attention when supervisors supported them. Supervisor support may be less effective for employees with high job insecurity due to highly dissonant information. The organization signals that the individual's employment is threatened, yet the supervisor continues to be supportive. Thus, inconsistent messaging may limit the employees' ability to attend to their work environment.

First, organizations can help employees in the sensemaking process to interpret their employment situation as secure. When organizations announce cost-cutting measures, employees will be more likely to interpret their current job as threatened, resulting in reduced attention and likely worse work and health outcomes (e.g., de Jong et al., 2016; Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018) . Potential solutions include providing effective organizational communication with an emphasis on transparency with employees about the reasons behind the cost-cutting (Keim et al., 2014) . Our study did not find perceived supervisor support to be effective in increasing attention when job insecurity is high. Employees may be particularly affected by the widespread economic crisis, such that general supervisor support may not ease their concerns. Although this finding is unexpected, future research could focus on more domain-specific supervisor support and trainings. For example, family supportive supervisor behavior training (Odle-Dusseau et al., 2016) and supervisor mental health training (Dimoff & Kelloway, 2019) provide evidence for domain-specific supervisor training to impact outcomes and general frameworks for future interventions that specifically target attention. Second, organizations need to be prepared to mitigate the potential impact of reduced attention to ensure the best outcomes for their employees and the organization. One potential mechanism would be an online employee workplace mindfulness intervention, which could help minimize job insecurity related rumination (Aikens et al., 2014) .",

A strength of the study was our ability to obtain rapid access to respondents during a two-week timeframe as COVID-19 cases were quickly increasing, large numbers of employers were cutting costs, and obtain researcher-coded data on cost-cutting initiatives in 165 organizations. Future research should include self-report data on employee awareness of company cost-cutting practices to provide additional evidence for coding news reports.",

            "text": "Third, our study did not include all possible cognitive mechanisms and focused only on attention. Future research is needed to better understand how other cognitive components are important for task execution (e.g., working memory and decision making) are affected. The nomological network of attention needs to be clarified as attention is a narrower component or precursor of similar constructs, such as cognitive functioning (Fisher et al., 2019) and self-regulation failure (Baumeister & Heatherton, 1996) . Fourth, we did not distinguish between quantitative job insecurity (i.e., job loss) and qualitative job insecurity (i.e., losing features of the job). Given previous research on the importance of distinguishing between the two dimensions (e.g., Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018) , future research should include both to delineate any potential differential effects on attention. Lastly, several of the relationships we tested were cross-sectional, limiting causal inference. However, the detection of interactions is not affected by the cross-sectional nature of the data and may even be harder to detect in cross-sectional data (Siemsen et al., 2010) , strengthening our finding of supervisor support as a buffer between job insecurity and attention. Previous research has identified the quality of the leader-member relationship as important for job insecurity (e.g., Wang et al., 2019) , which may also impact the efficacy of supervisor support for reducing job insecurity and should be incorporated in future research examining economic crises.",

(2004) suggested that when forming the indicators of the latent variable interaction factors, 1) each of the multiple indicators of the independent variables should be used only once; and 2) all of the multiple indicators of the independent variables should be used. Given that cost-cutting only has one indicator, we used the indicator of supervisor support with the highest loading to meet the first recommendation from Marsh et al. (2004) . However, this could violate the second recommendation.As such, we tested the model where the indicator of cost cutting was multiplied with each of the three indicators of the perceived supervisor support scale to create three indicators of the latent interaction factor. We got very similar results. Specifically, we found cost-cutting was significantly related to job insecurity (b = .28, SE = .14, p = .044). Also, perceived supervisor support moderated the relationship between job insecurity and attention (b = \u2212.15, SE = .07, p = .036) but not the relationship between cost-cutting and job insecurity (b = .11, SE = .18, ns).Moreover, Marsh et al. (2004) noted that there are many situations where their two recommendations may not be easily incorporated. They compared different matching strategies including the one-pair strategy, which is the strategy we adopted in the manuscript for the interaction between cost-cutting and supervisor support. They reported that the results of different matching strategies did not make much difference unless there were substantial differences between the factor loadings for different items on the same factor and the sample size is small (Marsh et al., 2004, p. 296 ). Since we have a large sample size and the factor loadings of the three perceived supervisor support items are similar to one another (.88, .90, .92, respectively) , the results produced with using this one-pair strategy should be reliable.Publisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
