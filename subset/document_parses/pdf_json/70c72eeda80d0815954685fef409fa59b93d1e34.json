Our results may reflect the impact of one molecule only or both in combination, although according to the current literature we believe both could be responsible for the effects we have seen. 7, 11 We are aware of other clinical trials in Iran using sofosbuvir/interferon, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and these may shed light on which molecule(s) appear to be active. With any small trial, the outcome of a single patient can impact the results. For example, in the two deaths observed with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir one patient was 74 and the other 96 years old. It would not be unreasonable to argue that this 96-year-old patient might well have died, regardless of which treatment was offered.

On the other hand, the safety of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir is well proven, even in advanced cases of renal failure. 13, 14 So both the possible effectiveness of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 and the potential increased mortality due to its side effects might have impacted on our results. In the case of benefit from ribavirin, the observed relative advantage of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir would have been diminished. Conversely, the putative success of sofosbuvir/ daclatasvir may have been impacted by excess deaths due to adverse effects of ribavirin. The observation that the relative risk of ICU admission was 0.36 for the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group versus ribavirin could be possibly explained by ribavirin conferring excess risk. That said, the long half-life of ribavirin (12 days), particularly with respect to the treatment duration and the knowledge that steady-state does not occur for five half-lives, suggests it could equally well be argued that the outcome occurred well before steady-state, and perhaps even before clinically relevant blood levels of ribavirin were reached.",

Hence, we recommend that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir should be compared with a placebo in a fully blinded and randomized study with a large sample size in order to accurately determine whether the benefits suggested by this pilot study can be duplicated elsewhere.

Favipiravir has shown antiviral effects and trends for improved clinical recovery in pilot studies, but these results need to be confirmed in larger randomized trials. 18 In a recent in vitro study daclatasvir consistently inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in Vero cells, in the hepatoma cell line HuH-7 and in type II pneumocytes, with EC 50 of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 lM, respectively. The antiviral effects of sofosbuvir were seen only at high drug concentrations in this study. It is not clear whether these concentrations can be achieved during standard dosing. 11 If sofosbuvir/daclatasvir was proven to be effective in larger randomized clinical trials, this treatment would be cheap to provide and the drug supplies are widely available in many countries for the treatment of hepatitis C. The safety profile of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir has been well described from 12 to 24 weeks of treatment for hepatitis C. In future studies, it would be worth checking whether the sofosbuvir needs to be included in this combination. It is possible that daclatasvir is the only active antiviral at standard doses. In addition, the antiviral effects of daclatasvir might be improved by more frequent dosing (for example three times per day).",

Only having ribavirin-treated patients as controls leaves open the possibility that the higher mortality rate seen in this group was a function of ribavirin use, and that without its use the mortality in this group may have been lower. On the other hand, ribavirin might have had a positive effect on COVID-19 and thus have diminished the beneficial effect we observed with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir. In either case, a study with a non-ribavirin arm is required.",
