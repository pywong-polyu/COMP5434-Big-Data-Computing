Novel human viruses have been reported at the rate of one to two per year, a trend epidemiologists expect will continue (Woolhouse et al., 2008) . Several interrelated issues emerged during the COVID-19 epidemic. First, healthcare facilities experienced shortages of respirators because of a limited capacity to manufacture the electrospun filter materials used in their manufacture (Wu, Huang, Zhang, He, & Ming, 2020) . Second, social distancing and isolation were used as physical barriers to reduce transmission, but social distancing is not always practical, and isolation brings significant economic and social costs. Authorities faced the challenging question of how to end lockdowns without triggering successive waves of infections (Lawton, 2020) . Third, guidance from health authorities regarding the use of masks in public varied widely. Some countries mandated the public use of masks while others asked people not to wear masks out of concern that doing so would reduce the supply of masks for healthcare workers (Javid, Weekes, & Matheson, 2020) . What if countries used local resources to produce effective masks for the public? How could these masks be made, and how effective would they need to be? Addressing these questions requires insights from epidemiology, virology, biochemistry, physics, mathematics, environmental science, material sciences, building engineering, psychology, and public policy. This article draws on current research in these fields to propose the development and public use of more effective cloth face masks during pandemics. The article does not provide medical advice but offers information to professionals who advise governments on public policy.",

Based on the relationships provided by Holterman (2003) and the characteristics of saliva described by Liu, Wei, Li, and Ooi (2016) , however, it can be calculated that at 20\u00b0C and 50% RH, 10 \u00b5m droplets of saliva evaporate to 3.5 \u00b5m residual droplet nuclei in under a second, which would then require more than an hour to settle in still air. Under real life conditions, these droplet nuclei are more likely to travel with air currents than to reach the ground directly. Although some medical scientists and physicists may discuss the upper size limit of aerosols differently, these differences are unimportant to the question of how respiratory droplets from asymptomatic individuals behave. These droplets are smaller than 10 \u00b5m, and their behavior is well understood.",

The calculations are based on the relationships provided by Holterman (2003) and the characteristics of saliva described by Liu et al. (2016) . The calculations ignore the initial speed of droplets, and assume they are spherical and electrically neutral.

In contrast, a light outdoor breeze of 6 km/h moves 400 times faster. Higher air change rates in buildings can remove contaminants more quickly, but can also move aerosols more rapidly toward others (Ghia et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2020) .

A confusion regarding certified surgical masks is that while they are made with materials having a high filtration efficiency, their effectiveness in actual use is lower. The reason is that the filtration efficiency of surgical mask material is measured by devices that do not allow air to bypass the material, but in use surgical masks cannot provide a tight fit. The incoming filtering effectiveness of surgical masks has been measured as 53-74% (Mueller, Eden, Oakes, Bellini, & Fernandez, 2020) , 20-80% (Ba\u0142azy et al., 2005) , 16-80% (Ba\u0142azy et al., 2006) , and 10-86% (Oberg & Brosseau, 2008) . The U.S. FDA (2020) states: \"While a surgical mask may be effective in blocking splashes and large-particle droplets, a face mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures. Surgical masks also do not provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of the loose fit between the surface of the face mask and your face.\" 3M (2020), the Milton et al. (2013) , U.S. CDC (2020), and Oberg and Brosseau (2008) give similar descriptions of surgical masks. Surgical masks are unsuitable for public use during pandemics because they are needed by healthcare workers for their intended purpose.",

During processing, cotton fibers twist arbitrarily in a left-handed or right-handed direction, causing approximately five convolutions per millimeter. Cotton fibers are 90% cellulose, and their surfaces include pectins, proteins, minerals, and waxes. Each beta glucose monomer in cellulose has several hydroxyl groups, which cause hydrogen bonding among cellulose molecules in cotton fibers. Surface hydroxyl groups in cotton may attract and hold small particles though dipole-induced-dipole forces. Cotton batting also gives particles more time to interact with and adhere to fibers. For example, a surgical mask is typically 0.4 mm thick (Leonas & Jones, 2003) . For a given mask area and breathing rate, a particle would spend twelve times longer moving through 5 mm cotton batting than it would moving through a surgical mask. Konda et al.

For example: a Are people more likely to voluntarily wear a mask if they believe it can not only reduce the risk that they will infect others, but also the risk that others will infect them? b What are the pros and cons of mandating mask use? Do mandates help by removing social judgements regarding mask use? Alternatively, could enough people be persuaded to voluntarily wear masks that mandates become unnecessary? c While masks interfere with nonverbal communication and can somewhat muffle speech, effective masks may allow people who would otherwise be isolated to interact with others.
