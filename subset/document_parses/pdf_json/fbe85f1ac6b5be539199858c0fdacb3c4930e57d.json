COVID-19 also causes clinical and subclinical cardiovascular injury that may be detected on electrocardiography (ECG), which is easily accessible. Method: For ECG-based COVID-19 detection, we developed a novel attention-based 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) model with residual connections (RC). In this paper, the deep learning (DL) approach was developed using 12-lead ECG printouts obtained from 250 normal subjects, 250 patients with COVID-19 and 250 with abnormal heartbeat. For binary classification, the COVID-19 and normal classes were considered; and for multiclass classification, all classes. The ECGs were preprocessed into standard ECG lead segments that were channeled into 12-dimensional volumes as input to the network model. Our developed model comprised of 19 layers with three 3D convolutional, three batch normalization, three rectified linear unit, two dropouts, two additional (for residual connections), one attention, and one fully connected layer. The RC were used to improve gradient flow through the developed network, and attention layer, to connect the second residual connection to the fully connected layer through the batch normalization layer. Results: A publicly available dataset was used in this work. We obtained average accuracies of 99.0% and 92.0% for binary and multiclass classifications, respectively, using ten-fold cross-validation. Our proposed model is ready to be tested with a huge ECG database.",

More than 5 million people have died as a result of the virus [2] , which can cause complications in the lungs and other organs. COVID-19 pneumonia may be diagnosed on chest X-rays and CT scans, while echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) may unveil clinical or subclinical cardiac involvement. Several studies using artificial intelligence (AI) for COVID-19 detection via chest X-rays and CT scans have been published in the literature. Toga\u00e7ar et al. [3] presented a DL approach for diagnosing COVID-19 in which chest X-ray images were preprocessed with fuzzy color, and features collected using MobileNet2 and SqueezeNet were fed to support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The authors attained 99.72% accuracy. For COVID-19 detection on chest X-ray images, Ismael et al. [4] compared machine learning (various texture features extracted from chest X-ray images were classified with SVM classifiers) and DL (end-to-end learning and transfer learning) approaches, finding that deep features and SVM classifier yielded 94.7%, and binarized statistical image features (BSIF) features and SVM classifier yielded 90.5% accuracy. Toraman et al. [5] used convolutional CapsNet to determine the COVID-19 on chest X-ray images. The method was fast and accurate, yielding 97.24% and 84.22% accuracy rates for binary and multiclass classifications, respectively. To diagnose COVID-19, Ozturk et al. [6] used chest X-ray images as input for a DL network. Using a real-time classifier in their DarkCovidNet model, 98.08% and 87.02% accuracy rates for binary and multiclass classifications, respectively, were attained. Ismael et al. [7] decomposed chest X-ray images with various multiresolution approaches (Shearlet, Wavelet, and Contourlet transform) and utilized the entropy and normalized energy features for detection of COVID-19.99.29% accuracy was attained by feeding Shearlet features to the well-known extreme learning machines (ELM) classifier. Karakanis et al. [8] developed a model that constructed synthetic images for increasing the number of chest X-ray images for efficient COVID-19 detection. The obtained synthetic images were used to train the model. Two DL models lightweight and ResNet8 models were used for binary and multiclass classification tasks, respectively, which attained 98.7% and 98.3% accuracy rates, respectively.",

            "text": "In addition to the respiratory system, COVID-19 infection may affect the cardiovascular system [9] . Several cardiovascular abnormalities can be seen in COVID-19 patients [10, 11] that may manifest as cardiac arrhythmia, conduction problems, ECG abnormalities, myocarditis, and pericarditis [12] . ST changes on ECG offer clues to COVID-19 diagnosis that may denote subclinical or clinical cardiovascular injury [13] . Indeed, there has been a burgeoning interest in detecting COVID-19 on ECG with and without incorporating AI. Ozdemir et al. [14] applied hexaxial feature mapping to 12-lead ECG recordings, and attained 96.2% accuracy for COVID-19 detection. Wang et al. [15] used univariate and multivariate regression models to correlate serum indexes as well as ST-T changes and atrial fibrillation on ECG with COVID-19 positive status, and found ECG ST-T changes to be significantly correlated with COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Pavri et al. [16] studied the ECGs of 75 admitted COVID-19 patients acquired before and during the index hospitalization. In 49.3%, they found paradoxical PR interval prolongation or lack of physiological PR shortening with increased heart rate, which connoted impaired atrioventricular conduction. This was associated with increased mortality with the need for mechanical ventilation. Angeli et al. [17] studied the ECGs of 50 COVID-19 and reported that 30% had ST-T abnormalities and 30% left ventricular hypertrophy. In the course of the hospital stay, anomalies such as atrial fibrillation, tachybrady syndrome, and acute pericarditis were observed. Li et al. [18] analyzed the ECGs of 113 COVID-19 patients, 50 of whom had died. The presence of ventricular arrhythmia and sinus tachycardia were independent risk factors for dying from COVID-19.",

Segmented 12-lead ECG images were channeled into 12-dimensional volumes and input to the model, which comprised 19 layers and was trained in an end-to-end learning model. We also separately explored using various texture image analysis methods to extract features that we then fed to standard classifiers.

The ECG data had been acquired using an EDAN SE-3 series 3-channel ECG with the sampling frequency of 500 Hz, and processed using either 0.67-25 Hz band-pass filter (BPF) or 0.5-100 Hz BPF with a 50 Hz notch filter.

            "text": "Also, in Table 7 , we compared the performance of our proposed method with recently published hexaxial mapping method [14] and Attallah et al. [23] . In Ref. [14] , authors have used hexaxial mapping and gray level co-occurrence matrix features to form color images from the ECG leads. These images coupled with the AlexNet model and their developed CNN model attained an average accuracy of 93.6% and 96.2%, respectively with 5-fold cross-validation. In Ref. [23] , the authors used five different deep learning models of distinct structural design called ECG-BioNet. Two levels of feature extraction from the different layers of each deep learning model were carried out. The features that were extracted in the higher layers of the deep models were fused using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), after which they were integrated with lower layers' features for an effective representation of the inputs. Furthermore, [24] studied six deep learning algorithms for diagnosing COVID-19 in binary and multiclass problems. A comparison of our proposed method with state-of-the-art method using the same database for binary and multiclass classification is shown in Table 7 . Of note, while we used ECG images from the abnormal heartbeat class as the third group for multiclass problem, the third group in in Refs. [23, 24] were composed of patients from three group: abnormal heartbeat, myocardial infarct, and prior myocardial infarct (the exact proportions were not mentioned in the manuscripts). Hence, while our method's 92% accuracy may not be directly comparable with the slightly lower values in Refs. [23, 24] .",

The proposed architecture is a shallow network that neither demands prolonged training duration nor large number of training samples. The model yielded superior average accuracy rates of 99.0% and 92.0% for binary and multiclass classifications, respectively, compared with published DL approaches ( Table 7) . The main limitation of this work is the manual placement of windows to isolate the region of interest, which requires technical experience and the use of a small database to develop the model. In the future, we plan to automate the placement of windows to isolate the region of interest and use the huge diverse database to develop the model. Besides, more deep learning approaches will be investigated to incorporate for the proposed COVID-19 detection task [27] [28] [29] .",
