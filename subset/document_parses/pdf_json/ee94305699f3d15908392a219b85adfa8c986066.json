We aimed to compare the outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with high-flow oxygen administered via nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV), initiated outside the intensive care unit (ICU) in 10 university hospitals in Catalonia, Spain. We recruited 367 consecutive patients aged \u2265 18 years who were treated with HFNC (155, 42.2%), CPAP (133, 36.2%) or NIV (79, 21.5%). The main outcome was intubation or death at 28 days after respiratory support initiation. After adjusting for relevant covariates and taking patients treated with HFNC as reference, treatment with NIV showed a higher risk of intubation or death (hazard ratio 2.01; 95% confidence interval 1.32-3.08), while treatment with CPAP did not show differences (0.97; 0.63-1.50). In the context of the pandemic and outside the intensive care unit setting, noninvasive ventilation for the treatment of moderate to severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 resulted in higher mortality or intubation rate at 28 days than high-flow oxygen or CPAP. This finding may help physicians to choose the best noninvasive respiratory support treatment in these patients.",

All participating hospitals belong to the National Health System of Catalonia, Spain, and attend a population of around 4.3 million inhabitants. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed through reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays performed on nasopharyngeal swab specimens. From a total of 419 candidate patients, we excluded those with: (1) respiratory failure not related to COVID-19 (e.g., cardiogenic pulmonary edema as primary cause of respiratory failure); (2) rejection or early intolerance to any NIRS treatment; (3) pregnancy; (4) nosocomial infection; and (5) PaCO 2 above 45 mm Hg. A total of 367 patients were finally included in the study (Fig. 1) , which was approved by the research ethics committee at each participating hospital (study coordinator centre, Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona; protocol No. PR(AG)265/2020). Research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The requirement of informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. Treatment strategies. The NIRS treatments evaluated were high-flow oxygen administered via nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and noninvasive ventilation (NIV). According to current Spanish recommendations 8 , criteria for initiating respiratory support were moderate to severe dyspnoea, respiratory rate > 30 bpm, or PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg, screened either at hospital admission or ward admission. The decision regarding the choice of treatment was taken by the pulmonologist in charge of the patient's care, with HFNC usually as the first step after the failure of conventional oxygen therapy 8 , and taking into account the availability of NIRS devices at each centre.",

First, in the Italian study, the mean PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio was 152 mm Hg, suggesting a less severe respiratory failure than in our patients (125 mm Hg). In the stratified analysis of our cohort, planned a priori, patients with a PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio above 150 responded similarly to HFNC and NIV treatments, suggesting that the severity of the hypoxemia might predict the success of NIV, as previously reported in non-COVID patients 4, 28, 29 .

            "text": "There are several possible explanations for the poor outcome of COVID-19 patients undergoing NIV in our study. First, NIV has been reported to produce overdistension, compounded by the respiratory effort itself 30 , which could result in ventilation-induced lung injury due to the excessive increases in tidal volumes 28, 31 . This risk would be avoided in CPAP and HFNC because they improve oxygenation without changing tidal volume 32, 33 . Unfortunately, tidal volume measurements during NIV were not available in our study to support or reject this hypothesis. Second, patient-ventilator asynchronies might have arisen in NIV-treated patients making more difficult their management outside the ICU setting and thereby explaining, at least partially, their worse outcomes. Third, a bench study has recently reported that some approaches to minimize aerosol dispersion can modify ventilator performance 34 . In short, the addition of intentional leaks, as in our study, led to a lower maximal pressure without a significant impact on the work of breathing and without increasing patient-ventilator asynchronies 34 . Table 3 . Inpatient characteristics and treatments according to non-invasive respiratory support group. P-value from Chi 2 test. *Anticoagulation had 1 missing value. \u2020 Systemic corticosteroids included prednisone (n = 6), methylprednisolone (n = 223), dexamethasone (n = 21) and hydrocortisone (n = 1). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Then, in the present work, we believe that the availability of trained pulmonologists to adjust ventilator settings may have overcome this aspect. Fourth, non-responders to NIV could have suffered a delay in intubation, but in our study the time to intubation was similar in the three NIRS groups, thus making this explanation less likely. Fifth, we cannot exclude the possibility that NIV implied a more complicated clinical course than HFNC or CPAP. Patients undergoing NIV may require some degree of sedation to tolerate the technique, but unfortunately we have no data on this regard. Furthermore, NIV and CPAP may impair expectoration which could contribute to www.nature.com/scientificreports/ bacterial infections, although this hypothesis remains unknown with the present data. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that NIV was tolerated worse than HFNC or CPAP, which would have reduced adherence and lowered the effectiveness of the therapy. However, the number of patients abandoning their original treatment was nearly twice as high in the CPAP group than in the NIV group.",

However, the inclusion of patients was consecutive and the collection of variables was really comprehensive. Moreover, NIRS treatment groups exhibited only minor differences which were accounted for in the multivariable and sensitivity analyses thus minimizing the selection bias risk. Although treatment received and outcomes differed by hospital, this fact was taken into account through adjustment. Second, we must be cautious before extrapolating our results to other nonemergency situations. Our study was carried out during the first wave of the pandemics when the healthcare system was overwhelmed and many patients were treated outside ICU facilities. As mentioned above, NIV might have better outcomes in a more controlled setting allowing an optimal critical care 39 . However, the scarcity of critical care resources has remained along the different pandemic surges until now and this scenario is unfortunately frequent in other health care systems around the world. Thus, we believe that our results may be useful for a great number of physicians treating COVID-19 patients around the world. Third, crossovers could have been responsible for differences observed between NIRS treatments but their proportion was small (12%) and our results did not change when these patients were excluded. Fourth, it could be argued that changes in treatment strategies over the timeframe of the study may have led to differential effects of the NIRS. Nevertheless, we do not think it may have influenced our results, because analyses were adjusted for relevant treatments such as systemic corticosteroids 40 and included the time period as a covariate. And finally, due to the shortage of critical care ventilators at the height of the pandemic, some patients were treated with home devices with limited FiO2 delivery capability and, therefore, could have been undertreated 41, 42 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ However, as more home devices were used in the CPAP group (81.6% vs. 38% in the NIV group; Table S3 ), and better outcomes were recorded in the CPAP-treated patients, our result do not support this concern.",

These data are complementary and still useful later on by including some patients usually excluded from randomized studies; patients with do-not-intubate orders are an example and, obviously, they represent a challenge for the physician responsible to decide the best therapeutic strategy.",
