Despite healthcare providers and medical societies advocating for firearm injury risk and safety discussions with patients, 2 a minority of providers report initiating these conversations. 3 Given concern for rising numbers of violence-related injuries, 4 increased social isolation, and prevalence of mental health problems, 5, 6 as well as escalating firearm and ammunition purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic, 7,8 these discussions are more critical now than ever. In fact, physicians and other healthcare providers are uniquely positioned to address this issue, as other potential avenues for intervention are limited due to social distancing and other lockdown measures.",

The 2015 National Firearm Survey (NFS) used a nationally representative, web-based sample to estimate that 54.7 million people in the US own guns. 9 Additionally, two-thirds of non-firearm owners and over one-half of firearm owners felt it is \"at least sometimes appropriate\" for physicians and other healthcare providers to discuss firearm safety with patients. 10 Another study using the NFS sample examined the responses of veterans. They concluded that half of veterans own at least one firearm, with the majority owning both handguns and long guns, citing personal protection as the primary reason for ownership. 11 These findings provide an important glimpse into firearm ownership and potential translational healthcare applications. However, the NFS was not designed solely for healthcare-based intervention and thus did not sample from patients in a clinical environment and did not expand upon potentially relevant healthcare-focused variables. Assessing patients' degree of openness to firearm discussions with different healthcare provider types in specific clinical scenarios is an important next step in firearm injury prevention research.",

The number of firearm-accessing patients who had been shot, pistol whipped, or had accidentally shot themselves or others merits further analysis and research attention. Patients claim personal protection as their primary reason for ownership across all firearm types, which has implications for future intervention counseling, especially when considering the potential for history of violent victimization.

Additionally, the inherent nature of survey-based methodology introduces the potential for sampling bias, participant response bias, and question-order bias. Efforts to reduce the effects of these biases were made in constructing the survey based on prior national, validated survey instruments and validating the new survey instrument through extensive piloting and expert review.

Unfortunately, the survey length could have resulted in answer fatigue and bias in survey responses. Encouragement prompts were used in the survey instrument in an effort to pace participants, as were RAs trained to assist if interruptions occurred. The extensive questioning also poses its own limitation in that the vast amount of data for potential review limited the ability to present all interesting and potentially relevant findings and will require subsequent analyses to further explore the population nuances in future research.",
