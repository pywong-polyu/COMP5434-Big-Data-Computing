The risk associated with false-positive PCR results posed a challenge in clinical application. First, the primer dimers and non-specific amplification, in which probe sequences participate, might interfere with experiments. Second, SARS-CoV-2 assays might crossreact with other viruses. In this study, we used 6 human coronaviruses (NL63-CoV, 229E-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and influenza A to test the cross-reactivity. Consequentially, the ORF1ab and N gene-based assay were the most specific, exactly matching target genes of SARS-CoV-2. The E gene was cross-reacted with B lineages of the beta-coronavirus (such as SARS-CoV). We propose that the E gene could be used as a broadspectrum screening gene for B lineages of the betacoronavirus, such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like coronavirus, et al. Therefore, we currently prefer to recommend the ORF1ab and N gene-based rRT-PCR assays for detection of COVID-19 infection.",

For example, the effectiveness of rRT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens had been shown to be greatly influenced by the quantity, type, and timing of specimen collection (11) (12) (13) . In addition, falsenegative results due to poor quality nucleic acids or presence of rRT-PCR inhibitors could also be a concern. False-negative results could also potentially arise from mutations occurring in the primer and probe target regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome. We included multiple genetic targets in our assay based on analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available. Finally, to avoid false-positive results, steps should be taken meticulously to prevent introduction of contaminating viral RNA or previously amplified DNA during preparation of nucleic acid extracts and amplification reactions.
