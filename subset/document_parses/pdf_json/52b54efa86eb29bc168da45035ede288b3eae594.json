A sample of 639 comments written on the Italian National Consumer Union website and related to the airline industry was assessed through an automated sentiment analysis in this study. The achieved results showed that travelers' concerns were directed mainly towards compensations, cancellations, and COVID-19 and at the same time, they had mixed and unpredictable feelings. This element suggests that consumers may have understood that airline companies are facing unsustainable cash-flow and revenue situations. Moreover, all our hypotheses, grounded on existing literature, were refuted. Accordingly, we argue that the actual context prevents assessments based on previous assumptions, and studies related to the impact of COVID-19 need to be conducted anew.",

Therefore, sentiment analysis has been extensively applied within tourism and hospitality literature to understand tourists' perceptions from online comments (Guerreiro & Rita, 2020; Moro et al., 2019) . After recognizing its importance and extensive development in existing literature, Tiwari et al. (2019) ran a sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset related to the airline industry. They highlighted that passengers had negative comments regarding delayed and canceled flights, booking issues, and customer service. Indeed, as the increase of COVID-19 cases and consequent travel bans that led to a reduction of flights (Chinazzi et al., 2020) prevented prospective travelers from actually traveling, the concerns regarding boarding and on-time departures were less, while the concerns toward cancelation issues increased. Thus, we have proposed the following hypotheses:",

Vogiatzis et al. (2021) stressed the importance of assessing risks and having a contingency plan to ensure air travel business sustainability in the face of causes of force majeure that may affect air flights, such as weather conditions. Furthermore, Liau and Tan (2014) , while studying customers' comments towards low-cost carriers (LCC) through text mining, pinpointed that LCCs' customers negatively perceive flight cancellations, despite the attempt by companies to please them with monetary compensation. However, in this peculiar context, the numerous cancellations led to an unsustainable cash-flow and revenue situation for the transport and travel sectors (European Commission, 2020). Airlines have thus been struggling to issue immediate refunds due to the lack of financial resources, as operational costs keep accumulating without any return on investment. Some countries (e.g., Australia) and companies (e.g., Singapore Airlines), obliged to issue a full refund or, at consumers' discretion, to issue a voucher for future use, have offered their prospective travelers bonus advantages and long voucher expiration dates to attract consumers to choose the voucher over the refund option (Ramsay, 2020) . However, in other countries such as Italy, a special exemption of full refunds was allowed by governmental authorities due to the extreme and unexpected nature of the pandemic crisis (Ramsay, 2020) . As a matter of fact, to support operational costs by preserving their liquidity, the carriers were offering primarily vouchers instead of refunds (Suau-Sanchez et al., 2020) . This practice seems to be not in line with customers' expectations since they do not know when it will be possible to fly and are afraid to do so (Riefa, 2020) . Governments became trapped between the need to comply with consumers' justified claims and the need to support airlines' business continuity to avoid bankruptcy. Such a dichotomy led to different reimbursement solutions by European Union countries, despite the recommendations issued by the European Commission (Grigorieff & Erotokritou, 2020) . Consequently, the following hypothesis was also assessed:",

Nevertheless, with the hospitality staff's assistance aimed to bolster guests' confidence by setting a 'home environment,' the pressure was released. Moreover, Mao et al.

Also, as Mao et al.

It should be noted that the references highlighted in Table 1 are related to studies that analyzed the corresponding categories in the airline industry, which are the focus of our approach, regardless of the adopted methodologies or data sources. The approach is cyclic to allow incremental improvement of the underlying expressions that denote each category and that were not found in the previous iteration. First, a set of categories and related terms was developed based on existing literature. Then, the sentiment analysis algorithm detailed in Fig. 1 was executed. It consisted of searching if a sentence contained any of the expressions related to each category in every comment and every sentence in each comment. If a match was found, then the sentiment score was computed using the \"sentimentr\" package. The sentiment score is a numeric variable, with the two polarities denoting negative or positive sentiments, respectively. The absolute numeric value denotes the sentiment intensity (with zero meaning a neutral sentiment and higher absolute values implying stronger sentiments) (Pang & Lee, 2008) . Such a procedure enabled capturing the sentiments perceived by prospective travelers about each category as the epidemic turned into a pandemic and spread globally and, specifically, to Italy during the analyzed period. The iterations through the cycle were needed since the common language used by travelers in online posts was not fully captured in the initial dictionary matching terms to each category. In each iteration, a small set of randomly selected comments was evaluated to assure if those contained any word that was not captured as belonging to a given category (e.g., 'toll-number' was not initially captured within the 'Customer Service' category; it was included later after the described tuning process). Consequently, the dictionary was enlarged to the version shown in Table 1 , and the analysis was re-run in each new iteration of the cycle. online. By assessing the volume of comments during the peak of the pandemic in Italy, it is possible to highlight that compensation and cancellation were the prevalent motives of concern.",

Only after April did the sentiment became neutral and even positive as the weekly new cases plummeted. Table 2 shows there is no support for a relation between cases/ deaths and the sentiment score towards boarding issues as the COVID-19 numbers increased over the analyzed period. As for boarding issues, Fig. 4 highlights that there was an increase in the sentiment generated for boarding when the outbreak hit Italy exponentially hard. It can be hypothesized that this resulted from most flights to, from, and within Italy being grounded from March 10 onwards. Thus, as observed in Fig. 4 , despite the pandemic striking hard since the end of February, the travel sector's media coverage and preannounced flight bans might have triggered a positive effect on travelers for actually being able to travel in that situation.

The considerable variation shows that consumers experienced very different feelings.

While the results in Tables 4-6 support the existence of a relation between COVID-19 numbers and sentiments towards cancelation/compensation/customer service, a rise in the number of cases has a negative influence, whereas a rise in deaths has a positive influence. It seems as if more deaths make customers more sympathetic towards impacted airline services. Thus, H2 is not supported. One can argue that the COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented impact generated mixed feelings in citizens in present times. Some travelers are also workers in small and medium enterprises (some are owners) and understand that airlines are currently facing enormous difficulties and may not be able to refund travelers at all. On the opposite side, if citizens are facing financial difficulties and see that airlines may never be able to recover fully, people will complain heavily and demand to be refunded. In this unprecedented time, when airline companies are experiencing unsustainable cash-flow and revenue situations (European Commission, 2020) , to preserve their liquidity, they are offering vouchers instead of refunds (Suau-Sanchez et al., 2020) for canceled flights. Vouchers would help ease the liquidity problems and could lead to better protection of passengers' interests (European Commission, 2020). However, European regulation Nr. 261/2004 guarantees the right of the passengers to be refunded. Considering that companies were initially omitting the refund option and according to Forbes (2020), some airlines have been accused of actively hiding the steps to get a cash refund, one can assume that the improper management of the cancellations and related compensations acted by the carriers (i.e., highly advertising vouchers as a form of compensation for the canceled flights rather than offering the refund option) caused incredible frustration (i.e., constant negative score related to compensations and cancellations) among prospective travelers. Furthermore, taking into account that the Employment Expectations Indicator plummeted to its lowest level on record in April 2020 (Directorate-General Financial and Economic Affairs of the European Commission, 2020), those passengers may have suffered the economic impact of the pandemic and have seen their income cut following the reduction of the economic activities (European Commission, 2020); indeed a monetary compensation would be much needed.",

Most likely, travelers whose destination was Asia were already concerned about the matter occurring at the destination. Later, at the beginning of the outbreak, as soon as the first cases were detected in Italy, the mention of the disease rose incredibly (Fig. 9) . A similar pattern occurred with the diffusion of MERS in South Korea: according to Yongsu (2016) , once the first case was registered, the number of related tweets increased and surged when the first death case was reported. As stated for MERS (Yongsu, 2016) , it can be argued that the knowledge of the actual number of victims increased the feeling among travelers that COVID-19 could threaten their safety (consequently generating a negative score). Indeed, with the decrease of new cases, the feeling towards the disease should be more positive.",

Also, little was known about the matter at that time; travel bans were not in place, and the WHO had not yet declared it a pandemic. Later, during the outbreak, the sentiment alternated between slightly negative and neutral scores with large variations, showing again that people had mixed feelings. The only exception occurred at the end of March, when the lowest average score towards the disease and the smallest variations were detected, concurrently with the number of deaths reaching its peak. Moreover, with the number of cases decreasing, starting from a slightly negative position, the sentiment score first decreased (becoming more negative), and then returned to almost neutral. Mao et al. (2010) taught us that a reduction of SARS infected cases made the authorities consider the removal of travel bans, predisposing travelers to think about future journeys and 'virtually' escape from their lockdown situation, generating an overall positive feeling. Furthermore, Mao et al. (2010) highlighted that as soon as the travel bans were removed, the number of incoming visitors from two out of three countries analyzed bounced back, showing that people were eager to travel and feared the disease less.",

Moreover, it can be contended that cancellations and compensations are linked and showed similar patterns at different levels. Although the carriers initially improperly managed cancellations by highly advertising and offering vouchers instead of refunds, sentiment toward cancellation was slightly negative when the casualties started to arise and then remained neutral, while the one related to compensation was on average positive. Specifically in Italy, companies were not required to fully refund their customers immediately since an alternative issued voucher maintained the same monetary value. Additionally, the Italian government released a plan to nationalize Alitalia, the largest Italian airline, which might have calmed down concerned customers. This nationalization was a backup solution that many national governments have announced, with many already issuing refunding plans to major national companies such as Air France (in France), British Airways (in the UK), and Lufthansa (in Germany). We believe the national governments' support of airlines during this troubled period was mandatory to enable the survival of existing airlines. This measure is vital for a quick resume of travel when the pandemic hopefully begins to be under control.",

Based on existing literature, we assumed that delay issues would be nonexistent since air fleets were grounded. However, there were some negative comments regarding delays. Those may have been related to the numerous repatriation flights, which were especially scheduled to bring home travelers caught by the confinement rules suddenly applied worldwide (Pongpirul et al., 2020) . Such travelers included both tourists and foreign workers who wished to return home. Some of the latter unexpectedly found themselves unemployed, while others were concerned with their families (Liao, 2020) . Hence, a first recommendation stemming from such finding is the need for national contingency plans, that address unexpected crisis situations such as a pandemic, to repatriate nationals to their home countries, in association with national airlines.",

Thus, as country-level lockdowns started to be lifted, a recommendation to the nation-level bodies that regulate the travel industry is to adopt different strategies to address tourists and traveling workers. For example, the former will not accept to be under quarantine due to the usually small duration of a vacation period of just a few days, while the latter may be willing to accept it. Thus, for tourists, additional COVID-19 tests may be required as an alternative to quarantine. As of December 2020, some nations (e.g., the UK) started to approve the first vaccines and huge logistic efforts are on the way to distribute them at an unprecedent worldwide scale. We can foresee that air traveling resume will require a certificate of vaccination instead of COVID-19 test or quarantine period. However, these are still crucial since vaccines will likely take a while before reaching the worldwide population.",

(2020) , innovative tourism research remains low even in top-tier journals. Our study attempts to answer the challenge raised by Zenker and Kock (2020) to assess if existing knowledge is still valid under the \"new normal\" driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Novel research unarguably needs to address this pertinent pressing issue. Notably, special issues are requesting submissions related to the impact of COVID-19 in tourism, and the top-tier Journal of Travel Research only accepts new submissions that assess such impact since pre-COVID-19 research may have become obsolete 1 The analysis of online comments for research has limitations (Moro et al., 2019 ) that need to be mentioned. As with any secondary data source, data is limited to what is available. For example, it is not possible to assess if a consumer has some concerns about the airline's difficulties to struggle with the pandemic or if (s)he is only concerned due to individual motivations. To deal with such limitations, we propose a primary data-based study using a specifically designed questionnaire to assess individual motivations versus understanding airline difficulties when expressing consumers' concerns as future follow-up research. Such future research could also aim at analyzing guests' expectations in the face of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",
