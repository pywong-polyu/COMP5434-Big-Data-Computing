It has also disrupted the organization of work in companies: remote work, physical distancing, etc. The question that now arises is to know the sustainability of these developments, their influence on working conditions, and the associated occupational risks. To do this, a prospective study was conducted involving the reference body for occupational risk prevention in France (INRS), a prospective think tank (Futuribles), representatives of a dozen French companies, and a number of experts on these issues.",

This information can help them in the choice of directions to take. The second objective is more immediate. The mutual social and technical learning processes involved in foresight work can help political decision-makers, as well as INRS researchers, to define a common vision of public policies [1, 2] .",

The techniques used are numerous and varied [3] , but the objective remains the same: to develop the ability to project oneself into the future in a rational way, taking into account the evolution of the main parameters that have a significant influence on the subject studied. This is summarized very well by Martin [4] : \"Foresight is the process involved in systematically attempting to look into the long-term future of science, technology, the economy and society with the aim of identifying the areas of strategic research and the emerging generic technologies likely to yield the greatest economic and social benefits. \" It is important to keep in mind that foresight is not forecasting but, first and foremost, a way of influencing the future by preparing for major eventualities [5] .",

Given its missions, all these studies focus on occupational risk prevention. INRS therefore had the expertise to consider possible adjustments to its policy and activity programs in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Indeed, the Covid-19 pandemic has greatly disrupted the daily lives of almost all of humanity. Work conditions have also been strongly impacted: remote work, maintaining physical distance, disinfection of workstation surfaces, etc. Companies have also been confronted with supply disruptions and have had to adopt activity management 10:11 systems requiring continuous adaptations, sometimes on a daily basis [9] . Foresight studies integrating the Covid-19 health crisis are still rare. Some are devoted to questions of the sustainability of the post-pandemic society [10, 11] , others to public health issues [12] , or to changes in human resource management policies in the field of work [13] . We did not find any specific foresight study on the changes in work following the Covid-19 pandemic. However, outside the field of foresight, articles are beginning to be published on this subject. They often concern remote work [14, 15] but may also offer a broader view, for example, on changes in the organization of production [16, 17] .",

This association then proposed to INRS to conduct a specific foresight study focusing on the question of work organization after Covid-19 (to 2025) . The aim of the study was to provide companies and public bodies with elements that would enable them to orient themselves in the medium term to the changes in work organization brought about by the health crisis. This work was carried out between June and September 2020. It was followed by a second study at the initiative of INRS; the results of the first study were used to reflect on possible changes in working conditions and the associated occupational risks. This second study, focusing on occupational health and safety, was carried out between October 2020 and March 2021.",

Given the upheavals that the Covid-19 pandemic has brought about, reflection on its medium-term consequences on the world of work and occupational health seems useful.

They have a protective effect on workers' health, in that they encourage consideration of real work (all the actions carried out and strategies deployed by the employee to carry out his or her activity) rather than prescribed work.",

In some cases, solidarity and a common understanding of work appear over time, when external workers remain for a significant period of time in the subcontracting company, but this phenomenon is not automatic. Similarly, automation, also mentioned above, can also cut workers off from contact with their fellow workers when the relationship with the machine becomes exclusive; this is a situation in which it is often difficult to give meaning to one's work, with possible consequences in terms of occupational risks. All these situations are likely to result in an increase in occupational risks: PSRs, of course, but also all other potential risks (chemical, physical, biological, mechanical accidents, falls, etc.).",

If the post-Covid period was to see the perpetuation of a certain number of measures taken during the crisis, such as easier recourse to temporary workers or an acceleration in the use of new technologies or automation, the risk would be that if these changes are too rapid, the real importance of this issue of interface management might be ignored.

The qualification of workers is also a factor that should ideally have been taken into account. These shortcomings are due to the time frame for this first study, which was very short (3months) and did not allow for in-depth sectoral studies. This can also be explained by the composition of the group, the majority of whose members came from large companies, with a profile more oriented towards a broad vision of work organization issues rather than a sectoral vision by activity. During the second exercise, devoted to occupational health and safety issues, sectoral details were proposed, but without seeking to be exhaustive. It therefore remains for the users of the materials resulting from this work to transpose and adapt the issues to their activity, their environment, etc. These two studies were carried out precisely for this purpose. These reflections will benefit from being conducted collectively, with other companies in the same sector, but also with actors in their ecosystem: suppliers, subcontractors, local authorities, etc. To be truly resilient, reflection on work organizations will have to integrate the issues of interdependence and interfaces between players.",

Users of our studies must also consider the overall environment, taking into account the dependency of companies on each other, including for future developments in the next 5 years; foresight is a good tool for this purpose.",

The health crisis will act as an accelerator of changes that have often been initiated in recent years: automation in both industry and services, the presence of algorithms in work activities, employment contract flexibility, and, thanks to these elements, the relative reshoring to developed countries of certain activities that were previously relocated to countries with low labor costs. 2. All these changes will also have the effect of accelerating the hybridization of the gig economy with the more traditional forms of business (brick and mortar); a number of mergers that were already underway before the health crisis have accelerated and are likely to continue in the postcrisis period. The consequences in terms of work organization and occupational risks are therefore going to be significant, since the initial models are very different. The real novelty of these changes is their acceleration. Indeed, the growing importance of automation, the influence of the gig economy on the operation of other companies, and the changes in workers' status had already been identified in previous studies [7, 26, 27, 34] . The results of the present study constitute an incentive to reinforce the documentary monitoring carried out on these subjects by the INRS, in particular to identify new consequences for occupational risks. The combination of monitoring and foresight is an effective tool for identifying, in advance, changes in working conditions that will result in significant changes in terms of occupational risks. On one hand, the results of monitoring (e.g., weak signals) help guide the choice of new foresight topics. On the other hand, the results of foresight provide elements for selecting topics of monitoring on working conditions that are likely to have an impact on health and safety.",

Until now, in the majority of European countries, this social protection (of which occupational risk prevention is part) was associated with work and financed by a contribution from companies. The development of self-employment, if it continues, could contribute to calling this model into question. In the case of occupational risk prevention, it is not only a question of financial balance but of the capacity (or inability) to sustain a system designed on the basis of an ambitious conception of health and safety at work involving the treatment of problems based on the pooling of knowledge and actions. Although this system obviously has imperfections, it has the merit of identifying responsibilities and involving them in the implementation of solutions that are valid for all stakeholders, regardless of their status. The generalization of the transformation of employment contracts into economic service contracts would radically change the situation.",
