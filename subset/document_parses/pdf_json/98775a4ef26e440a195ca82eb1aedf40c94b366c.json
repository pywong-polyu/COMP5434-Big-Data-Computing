Whole-blood RNA sequencing was done on samples from participants with subsequently confirmed viral, bacterial, or no infection diagnoses. Differentially expressed host genes that met additional filtering criteria were subjected to feature selection to derive the most parsimonious discriminating signature. We validated the signature via RT-qPCR in a prospective validation cohort of participants who presented to an emergency department with undifferentiated fever, and a second case-control validation cohort of emergency department participants with PCR-positive COVID-19 or bacterial infection. We assessed signature performance by calculating the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs), sensitivities, and specificities.",

In the validation cohort of 200 participants, the signature differentiated bacterial from viral infections with an AUROC of 0\u00b7976 (95% CI 0\u00b7919\u22121\u00b7000), sensitivity of 97\u00b73% (85\u00b78\u221299\u00b79), and specificity of 100% (63\u00b71\u2212100).

Molecular diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 were not widely available at the start of the pandemic, 4 underlining the value of a readily available agnostic blood test (ie, does not require previous knowledge of any specific pathogenic agent) to detect viral diseases, such as COVID-19, by host response. As the pandemic developed, notwithstanding delays in test availability, COVID-19 posed additional challenges, because the clinical features and routine laboratory diagnostic tests greatly overlapped with those of bacterial sepsis. 5 Perhaps the greatest challenge has been the association of COVID-19 with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Although molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 appear robust, the phenomenon of the SARS-CoV-2 PCRnegative participant who manifests disease consistent with COVID-19 is well reported. 6\u22128 There is the possibility that viral genetic variation in the future could render PCR or antigen-based tests for SARS-CoV-2 unreliable. Further more, as the pandemic recedes, COVID-19 could be considered less probable in the differential diagnosis. There is a pressing need for a ready-to-use test that is available to all and can discriminate viral infections, such as COVID-19, from other infections.",

Several molecular diagnostic biomarkers to distinguish between viral and bacterial infection have been proposed but none are in routine use.

There is an expanding menu of biomarker and gene expression signatures that can differentiate infection from inflammation, and viral from bacterial infection. Viral infection is characterised by a unique host gene expression profile that is highly specific and is unlikely to be affected by variation in viral genome. Our study has shown that such profiles can be reduced to a simple three-gene, rapid PCR-based signature that can distinguish non-SARS-CoV-19 and SARS-CoV-19 viral infections from other emergency sepsis presentations. Few gene expression signatures enable easy translation to point-of-care test. Our work provides a roadmap to a fingerprick test that could ultimately distinguish COVID-19 from other viral and bacterial disease presentations in adults, providing an important asset in the current pandemic and a tool to guide future antimicrobial prescribing. The three-gene signature we discovered could allow for improved stratification of anti-infective prescribing among participants with respiratory illness, contribute to earlier diagnosis, and provide more targeted infection control strategies in the COVID-19 era.",

Although much attention has focused on the need to definitively identify bacterial infections and rationalise antibiotic prescribing, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the value of a readily available test that can indicate the strong likelihood of viral infection. Here, we describe a novel three-gene blood transcriptional signature that can discriminate between bacterial and viral infections in adults presenting to an emergency department in the UK. We externally validated this signature against previously published case-control data and a new observational validation cohort, in which the signature discriminated proven bacterial and viral infections with AUROC of 0\u00b7976, sensitivity of 97\u00b73%, and specificity of 100%. Notably, our signature also discriminated between bacterial infection and COVID-19 with an AUROC of 0\u00b7953, sensitivity of 88\u00b76%, and specificity of 94\u00b71%, whereas CRP levels demonstrated considerable overlap between these groups. Such a test would have been invaluable in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when specific virology tests were not available. RT-qPCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs is the current mainstay of COVID-19 diagnosis. Despite widespread use, multiple studies have questioned its reliability as the gold standard owing to low sensitivity when the clinical index of suspicion is high, but also when the time of testing was either too early or too late during the infection course. These doubts led us to explore the use of host gene expression assays. 19, 20 The three-gene signature we discovered could allow for improved stratification of anti-infective prescribing among participants with respiratory illness, contribute to earlier diagnosis, and provide more targeted infection control strategies in the COVID-19 era.",

The three-gene signature was derived using a cohort of adult participants who presented to the emergency department with suspected acute infection, and samples were obtained at the point of presentation, before any treatment or interventions were started. We, therefore, are confident that the signature has been derived at the most relevant timepoint (the point of presentation to secondary care), when a point-of-care test can be of greatest value. By undertaking RNA sequencing on the initial cohort, we were able to exploit the data to design optimised primers for a PCR-based point-of-care test that was validated in two different cohorts, including participants presenting with acute COVID-19 symptoms. The combination of discovery and validation of a signature, including in COVID-19-positive participants, using a tractable PCRbased approach is, to our knowledge, unique. Regarding the genes in the signature, NAGK is a salvage enzyme responsible for amino acid metabolism, 21 HERC6 belongs to the HERC family of ubiquitin ligases that have been reported to exhibit different antiviral activity when induced by interferon, 22 and IGF1R is an insulin signalling transmembrane tyrosine kinase protein, which is reported to act as an entry receptor for respiratory syncytial virus and also to activate macrophages and redirect phagocytosis. 23, 24 Each gene showed consistent amplification in RT-qPCR, underpinned by RNA sequencing data to inform probe design. Although HERC6 has been identified as one of a large number of genes that were upregulated in influenza, 25 to date, the three genes have not been validated nor included in minimal diagnostic signatures.",

All 200 participants in the validation cohort were considered to have infection, had blood cultures taken, and received empiric antibiotics. We used robust clinical and pathological criteria to categorise the 6-month cohort of participants into definite, probable, indeterminate, not infected, and other infection groups to assess the three-gene signature performance in a series of participants with a wide range of diagnoses. We then tested the clinical utility of the signature using decision curve analysis. Consistent with the hypothesis that the three-gene signature primarily reflects the host immune response to viruses, decision curve analysis showed that the signature offered the greatest net benefit (vs CRP and leukocyte count) to guide targeting of additional diagnostic tests, antiviral treatment, and infection control measures for proven or probable viral infections, whereas CRP offered the greatest net benefit for targeting of antibacterial treatment for proven or probable bacterial infections. Combining existing and novel biomarkers might, therefore, provide a useful asset in infection management decisions. There is some evidence to suggest that rapid point-ofcare testing has little effect on overall antimicrobial prescribing. 26, 27 However, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic shows, the rationale for rapid diagnostic testing goes well beyond antimicrobial stewardship. Indeed, using antimicrobial prescribing as a metric of success undervalues the importance of making a diagnosis and targeting treatments. We believe that a rapid and definitive point-of-care diagnosis of a viral infection could effectively serve as a rule-out for bacterial infection; such a diagnostic test is, therefore, more likely to prevent unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and will target antiviral treatments more effectively, as shown for influenza. 27 There are some limitations to our study. At the time of recruitment, adults presenting to the emergency department in the UK rarely received a full array of microbiological tests, particularly if viral infection was suspected, contrasting with other settings, such as intensive care. As such, low numbers of confirmed viral infections necessitated a 3-year recruit ment period. The signature we discovered differentiated between infections in a UK-based emergency department; we do not know how the test might perform in non-UK settings, or if it could be used in primary care. Whether the test might be of value in co-infections could not be addressed.",
