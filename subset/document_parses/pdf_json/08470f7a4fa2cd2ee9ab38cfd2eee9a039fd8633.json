            "text": "Recent breakthroughs in gene-editing technologies that can render individual animals fully resistant to infections may offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling future epidemics in farm animals. Yet, their potential for reducing disease spread is poorly understood as the necessary theoretical framework for estimating epidemiological effects arising from gene-editing applications is currently lacking. Here, we develop semistochastic modeling approaches to investigate how the adoption of gene editing may affect infectious disease prevalence in farmed animal populations and the prospects and time scale for disease elimination. We apply our models to the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), one of the most persistent global livestock diseases to date. Whereas extensive control efforts have shown limited success, recent production of gene-edited pigs that are fully resistant to the PRRS virus have raised expectations for eliminating this deadly disease. Our models predict that disease elimination on a national scale would be difficult to achieve if gene editing was used as the only disease control. However, from a purely epidemiological perspective, disease elimination may be achievable within 3 to 6 y, if gene editing were complemented with widespread and sufficiently effective vaccination. Besides strategic distribution of genetically resistant animals, several other key determinants underpinning the epidemiological impact of gene editing were identified. gene editing j PRRS j CRISPR/Cas9 j mathematical model j infectious disease N ovel genomic technologies such as gene editing offer promising opportunities to tackle some of the most pressing global challenges humanity faces today. They provide new prospects to solving emerging threats such as the global COVID-19 pandemic (1) as well as to long-standing global health issues such as the HIV/AIDS crisis (2) or malnutrition (3, 4) , with minimal side effects. Besides the medical field, food production stands to gain most from widespread use of genome editing technologies. Currently 11% of the human population suffers malnourishment (5) , and this is expected to increase with the projected growth of the human population to 10.9 billion by 2100 (42%) (6) . Meeting the 60% increase of agricultural production needed to provide sustainable and nutritious diets will likely require transformative innovations to existing production methods (7) . While genome-editing technologies have been applied widely in plant breeding to simultaneously improve production and resilience to diverse stressors (see ref. 8 for examples), their application in the livestock sector is still in its infancy, primarily due to technical limitations associated with the gene-editing process itself and the safe and fast dissemination of edits, as well as ethical and societal concerns (9) . Nevertheless, breakthroughs in genetic modification of farm animals through genome editing start to emerge with drastic improvements in efficiency traits (10, 11) , animal welfare (12) , and disease resistance (13, 14) . Improving disease resistance in livestock seems particularly pertinent, as infectious diseases affect the entire food production chain and its economic viability (15) .",

Although many countries currently lack specific regulations covering the application of genome-edited animals in the food chain, this technology currently falls under genetically modified organism legislation in countries that have such processes. Reflecting this, we are seeing the rapid development of gene-editing regulations worldwide [see the Global Gene Editing Regulation Tracker (16) for an up-to-date status of gene-editing regulations per country]. Specifically, some countries have identified that some genome-editing strategies are exempt from regulatory approval. This is reflected in the recent announcement in Japan that a genome-edited seabream does not need to be regulated as no gene has been introduced into the genome (17, 18) . These developments make it realistic that application of gene editing to help control infectious disease is likely in the near future. This prospect evokes pressing questions concerning the theoretical and practical feasibility of Significance This proof-of-concept modeling study offers quantitative insights into the potential epidemiological benefits of geneediting technologies and how these may be most effectively implemented to control one of the most harmful pig diseases to date. In the future, the epidemiological benefits will need to be complemented by systematic assessment of economic and technological feasibility to enable balancing these against ethical and societal concerns.",

In this study, we focus on a particular disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), for the development of a mathematical modeling framework to investigate the feasibility of the application of gene editing to achieve disease elimination. PRRS represents one of the most important infectious disease problems for the pig industry worldwide, with economic losses estimated at $2.5 billion per annum in the United States and Europe alone (19, 20) . Despite extensive global control efforts, the disease continues to persist in national commercial pig populations, largely due to high genetic heterogeneity of the PRRS virus, PRRSV (21) , and the associated limited effectiveness of all PRRS vaccines (22, 23) and limited reliability of diagnostic tests (24, 25) . There is considerable natural genetic variation in pigs' responses to PRRSV infection, but evidence to date suggests that no pig strain is naturally fully resistant to it (26) . However, recent advances in gene editing of porcine macrophages, in which a simple disruption of the CD163 gene confers complete resistance to infection with PRRSV, may revolutionize future PRRS control (27) (28) (29) .",

This optimum distribution leads to a significant reduction in disease prevalence even under higher average R 0 (Fig. 1A) and could achieve disease elimination when less than half of the national pig population is genetically resistant for relatively high average R 0 (i.e., average R 0 <3). For a moderate average R 0 of 1.5, as estimated for PRRS (33) (34) (35) , the required proportion of genetically resistant pigs drops to 30% (Fig. 1A) . While this ideal situation would provide the best environment for PRRS elimination using genetically resistant animals, it is unlikely to occur in a real pig production system, where the herd-specific R 0 is unknown and farmers can be expected to differ in their willingness and capability to invest in adopting the new technology. A perhaps more realistic distribution scenario, hereafter called comprehensive distribution, assumes that all herds are supplied with an equal proportion of available genetically resistant animals, and the sourcing of resistant pigs is managed by the supplying breeding companies rather than the farmer (Fig. 1B ). Under these circumstances, disease prevalence only decreases considerably when the available proportion of genetically resistant individuals in the population is high. In particular, disease elimination is only possible if the majority of individuals are genetically resistant (e.g., 74% for average R 0 of 1.5; Fig. 1A ). The third alternative model scenario, hereafter called concentrated distribution, considers that not all farmers may embrace gene- Table 1 and main text for details). (A) Optimum distribution, (B) comprehensive distribution, (C) concentrated distribution, (D) unregulated distribution. Shaded areas correspond to confidence intervals comprising 95% of the predicted values from 100 simulated replicates (note that in A-C these are too narrow to be visible). Note that in the unregulated distribution scenario (D) the actual proportion of genetically resistant animals across all herds may be lower than the available proportion (presented on the x axis), explaining why elimination is not possible even if there is unlimited supply of genetically resistant pigs. editing and splits farmers into \"adopters\" and \"nonadopters.\" Randomly chosen adopters are supplied with an equal fixed proportion of genetically resistant animals (where the proportion may or may not be based on national or regional estimates for R 0 ), whereas nonadopters opt out of this supply entirely. In contrast to the other scenarios, this concentrated distribution leads to a linear reduction in disease prevalence with increasing proportion of genetically resistant animals. Disease elimination is, however, unachievable unless the supply is based on reasonably accurate estimates of R 0 . For moderate average R 0 of 1.5 this implies that most herds (>98%) would need to contain a large proportion (\u223c75%) of genetically resistant animals (Figs. 1C and 2A). In contrast to all regulated scenarios, the fourth scenario simulated an entirely unregulated distribution of genetically resistant animals, where adoption of these animals was assumed to be entirely optional to the farmer. Thus, from a modeling perspective, arbitrary herds are supplied with arbitrary proportions of resistant animals independent of herd size or herd-specific R 0 . This scenario leads to a relatively small reduction in disease prevalence with high uncertainty, as represented by the wide confidence intervals in the simulations (Fig.  1D ). Disease elimination through gene editing alone is out of reach for this unregulated distribution scenario. The above model scenarios assume a pessimistic situation where all herds are exposed to PRRSV-infected pigs. Reducing the exposure probability of each herd to 50% had, however, little effect on the overall model predictions: Unless the baseline transmission potential R 0 is known and the distribution of genetically resistant pigs is regulated accordingly, PRRS elimination through gene editing alone is only achievable if almost all herds (>95% for R 0 = 1.5) consist primarily (>70% for R 0 = 1.5) of genetically resistant animals (see Fig. 2 D-F for moderate R 0 = 1.5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S1 for high R 0 = 5).

The second question we therefore sought to answer is how gene editing can effectively complement existing disease control measures.

The proportion of edited animals in the concentrated scenarios is chosen at the smallest possible proportion for elimination under each scenario, resulting in a P e of 0.75 for scenarios A, B, D, and E (green bars), a P e of 0.5 for scenario C (green bars, purple fill), and a P e of 0.1 for scenario F (green bars, red fill).

However, even in a severe scenario corresponding to average R 0 of 5 and 100% exposure, the model predicts that disease can be eliminated when all herds are supplied with a set proportion of 53% genetically resistant animals and all susceptible pigs are vaccinated (see SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). Impact of vaccine effectiveness on disease elimination. Whereas gene editing and vaccination with vaccines of relatively high effectiveness (\u226570%) emerges as a highly effective PRRS elimination strategy in our models, vaccination with poorly effective vaccines is predicted to contribute relatively little to disease elimination. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 (and SI Appendix, Fig.  S2 for higher R 0 ), which also shows that for a voluntary distribution scheme disease elimination is no longer possible when vaccine effectiveness is 50% or less. Time scale for achieving disease elimination. With the required proportions of genetically resistant animals under different strategies defined, the third question surrounding the feasibility of gene editing can be addressed: How long does it take to produce the required numbers of genetically resistant animals using current breeding techniques within existing technical constraints? Given the potentially limited shelf life of gene editing caused by the emergence of escape mutants, fast dissemination of genetically resistant pigs into the commercial level is crucial. This could be hampered by the fact that gene-editing technology will be limited to the top tier of the multitier pig production pyramid (Fig. 4) and that the PRRS resistance allele is recessive (14) . Genotyping of pigs to trace resistance genotypes could help to identify both resistant and heterozygous carrier selection candidates and propagate the resistance allele efficiently through the production pyramid. However, genotyping is costly and not usually applied in the lower tiers. Despite these and various other technical limitations, which were considered in our gene flow simulation model (see Methods for details), we found that gene-edited resistance alleles can be efficiently disseminated through the tiers of the population without continuous genotyping of selection candidates in lower population tiers. Through selective mating of both homozygous resistant and heterozygous carrier animals in the top two tiers where genotyping is conventionally carried out, the resistance allele effectively propagates through the whole production pyramid, eventually resulting in genetically resistant animals carrying two copies of the resistance allele in the commercial tier (Fig. 4) .",

If gene editing was the only disease elimination tool, this would, however, require a highly regulated distribution scheme that supplies the majority of herds with a disproportionally large percentage of genetically resistant pigs. Given that adoption by farmers remains one of the biggest barriers to implementation of biotechnology (39) , this blanket distribution of a novel genomic technology seems unlikely under current conditions. Nonetheless, we found PRRS elimination still to be feasible for a more realistic scenario where gene editing and mass vaccination are used conjunctively, allowing individual farmers to choose their management tool. Effective application of both control strategies simultaneously drastically reduces the required number of genetically resistant pigs and herds needed to adopt these and can achieve elimination even without stringent regulations concerning their distribution. Since PRRS has proven difficult to combat with conventional disease control (22, 40) , this finding is encouraging, as it illustrates that effective combination of existing control tools with novel genomic technologies may achieve the so-far-impossible outcome of much desired disease elimination.",

In practice, the implementation of effective disease control is hampered by the fact that R 0 typically varies across subpopulations and that precise estimates of R 0 are rarely available (41, 42) . Our model accommodates for heterogeneities in R 0 implicitly by drawing herd-specific R 0 values from normal distributions. The results highlight the importance for obtaining precise subpopulation-specific estimates of R 0 , as such estimates allow for more effective targeted disease control with minimum wastage of valuable resources, such as genetically resistant pigs. The optimal distribution scenario in our model, which assumes that herd-specific R 0 values are known, required up to 60% fewer genetically resistant pigs for disease elimination compared to other distribution scenarios with less precise or no knowledge of R 0 . However, given the high uncertainty in herd-specific R 0 values in practice (42), we incorporated different degrees of knowledge about R 0 in the modeled distribution scenarios, ranging from full knowledge of herd-specific R 0 represented by the optimum distribution scenario to partial knowledge (e.g., national or regional average R 0 estimates) accommodated within the concentrated scenario to potentially zero knowledge represented by the other scenarios. Based on our model predictions, PRRS elimination through gene editing was only possible if R 0 was at least partially known or complemented by mass vaccination of all susceptible individuals with a sufficiently effective vaccine.",

The proportion of edited animals in the concentrated scenarios is chosen at the smallest possible proportion for elimination under each scenario, resulting in a P e of 0.75 for scenarios A and C (green bars), a P e of 0.5 for scenario B (green bars, purple fill), and a P e of 0.1 for scenario D (green bars, red fill). An average transmission potential of R 0 = 1.5 was assumed. Modeling suggests gene editing combined with vaccination could eliminate a persistent disease in livestock unlikely to be met in practice as it not only assumes that herdspecific R 0 values are known but also that PRRSV-resistant pigs are identifiable, and that no obstacles for providing each herd with the required number of genetically resistant pigs exist. Identifying PRRSV-resistant pigs would require either tracing the parentage across the production pyramid or genotyping all commercial pigs, neither of which is current industry practice. Unless adoption of genetically resistant pigs was made compulsory (comprehensive scenario), only a fraction of herds is therefore likely to contain these pigs in practice. Furthermore, the proportion of genetically resistant pigs that each of these herds receive could be either controlled by the supplier (concentrated scenario) or by the farmer (see unregulated scenario). Either of them could base their decisions on estimates of R 0 , which are realistically only available on a national or regional level. Our choice of distribution scenarios aimed to capture this wide spectrum of potential scenarios and to provide useful quantitative estimates of the associated impact. To accommodate the common lack of herd-specific R 0 estimates, all distribution scenarios except for the optimum scenario assumed that the proportion of genetically resistant pigs per herd is independent of the herd-specific R 0 . It should be noted that predictions for all alternative scenarios to the optimum scenario also apply if the resistance genotype of pigs was not exactly known, as long as the overall proportion of genetically resistant pigs in the population was known by the suppliers and pigs were distributed randomly to the receiving herds. Our model provides quantitative estimates of how each distribution scenario may affect PRRS prevalence and importantly reveals that gene editing can substantially reduce the prevalence even if adopted in restricted, suboptimal capacity. However, PRRS elimination would realistically require a widespread uptake of genetically resistant pigs and a regulated distribution of these across a significant proportion of herds (i.e., over 50% for average R 0 = 1.5), coupled with a disease surveillance and vaccination program.",

In our model, elimination of PRRS falls out of reach for the less stringent unregulated and concentrated distribution scenarios if vaccine effectiveness drops below 50%.

Here we deliberately made the strong assumption that mass vaccination is applied either in all herds that do not adopt gene editing or in all herds altogether. Although PRRS vaccination is widespread in practice, these assumptions are obviously unlikely to be met in reality. Incomplete vaccine coverage would prevent disease elimination when the adoption of genetically resistant pigs is sparse and exposure risk is high, as indicated by the high proportion of resistant pigs needed when vaccines with lower effectiveness are being used (see SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ). This highlights the need to consider additional determinants that may underpin the success of gene editing for disease control in future studies, such as natural genetic variation in pigs' PRRS resistance. Indeed, genetic selection of pigs for increased natural PRRS resistance has been advocated as a viable complement to existing PRRS control (51, 52) . Combined application of these complementary genetic disease control strategies may effectively eliminate PRRS even under restricted vaccine usage. Determinant 4: Exposure Risk. It is unlikely that all herds are simultaneously and equally exposed to the PRRS virus. Heterogeneity in exposure was included in our model through a random uniform exposure probability distribution. While reduction of the average exposure risk from 100 to 50% had little influence on the model results associated with gene editing as sole disease control strategy, it drastically reduced the requirements for genetically resistant animals when gene editing and vaccination were used in conjunction. In reality, exposure risk will likely depend on PRRS prevalence in herds that are in close spatial proximity or linked through, e.g., transport or trading (53, 54) . While spatial factors were not explicitly considered in our model presented here, exploration of these is an important avenue for future modeling studies as they would allow more strategic and targeted distribution of genetically resistant animals in epidemic hotspots. Furthermore, some countries or regions contain high frequency of smallholder farms with small herd size, which are unlikely to adopt gene-editing technologies or even vaccination. The impact of these farms on the overall exposure risk and subsequent prospects for elimination warrants further investigation.",

This alarming evolutionary rate, together with observations that the virus evolves toward increased virulence with ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity (36) , raises concerns about how long the current gene-editing process confers complete resistance to this virus. Hence, ambitious goals such as disease elimination would need to be achievable within a short time frame. Coupling the epidemiological model with a gene flow model suggests that PRRS can be potentially eliminated through use of gene editing within 3 to 6 y. Although it is impossible to predict whether this is sufficiently fast to win the race against virus evolution, this time scale fits well within the anticipated time scale of current national or regional elimination programs for PRRS and other livestock diseases (45, 56) .",

Our model describes the national pig industry by a five-tier breeding pyramid originating from three pure breeds. Although this structure is common for modeling pig breeding schemes (57, 58) , it does not take into account the multitude of different breeding companies and different breeds that often form part of the cross-breeding schemes behind hybrid pig production. Furthermore, we assumed that all selection candidates for selection in the top pyramid tier are also candidates for gene editing, thus ignoring the possibility that some breeding companies may not apply the technology to all selection candidates, or not apply it at all if this meets best their costumers' demand. Our model could easily accommodate this increased complexity by increasing the proportion of gene edits carried out to a subset of selection candidates in the top tier. In the current model gene editing of 20% of animals in the top tier was sufficient to satisfy the demands for genetically resistant animals in the lower tiers. Increasing this proportion in a subset of breeds composing the top production tier would generate the required number of genetically resistant animals in the commercial population in a similar time frame. An additional limitation of the current model is the absence of a strategy for the management of inbreeding, which could be incorporated alongside the implementation of separate breedspecific populations.",

            "text": "Finally, it is important to remind readers that this study focused purely on the epidemiological impact of gene editing. Implementation of this controversial technology into practical disease control will also largely depend on economic and societal aspects. Estimated annual economic losses due to PRRSV range between $24 million and $664 million in European countries and the United States alone (63, 64) . Future studies are therefore required to assess the economic feasibility of the approaches presented here and to weigh the associated economic costs against the considerable potential economic benefits of eliminating one of the costliest livestock diseases to date. A thorough cost-benefit analysis is beyond the scope of this study. However, one major cost factor flagged by our models concerns the investment into routine genotyping of commercial pigs, which would allow identification and targeted distribution of genetically resistant pigs, thus increasing the chance of disease elimination. In addition, economic assessments should consider potential trade-offs arising from selection for gene-edited pigs with selection for other important livestock traits in multitrait improvement programs. Preferential selection of animals carrying the resistance allele likely results in a loss in genetic gain for other traits in the breeding goal, as do selection decisions due to inbreeding avoidance. While these weighted selection decisions are expected to have a limited impact on the time needed to reach sufficient numbers of genetically PRRSVresistant individuals for PRRS elimination, the scale of these trade-offs will greatly influence the willingness of livestock breeders and farmers to produce and adopt genetically resistant animals. This willingness may drop considerably when PRRS prevalence has reduced to low levels, or if elimination has been achieved. As such, including scale of adoption over time in a cost-benefit analysis framework would inform a feasible level of investment in gene editing for PRRS resistance. In the context of adoption, an important aspect to consider, with epidemiological and economic consequences, is the likelihood that reducing the number of genetically resistant pigs in the national population increases the risk of reintroduction of PRRSV through international trading of domestic pigs, and possibly also through natural reservoirs such as wild boars infected with PRRSV (65, 66) .",

It particularly highlights the continued need to develop vaccines with high effectiveness and to consider additional control options such as genomic selection for natural (yet incomplete) PRRS resistance. Effective combination of these alternatives increases the chance for disease elimination and reduces the requirements for stringent regulations concerning the application of each of these measures.

Note that this excludes countries or regions in which pigs are predominantly reared in smallholder or backyard farms.

Detailed epidemiological modeling of PRRSV transmission dynamics that considers these demographic characteristics as well as within-and between-herd contact structures affecting disease transmission will be an important avenue for future predictive modeling, but as a first step we here sought to gain initial qualitative and quantitative understanding about the potential impact of gene editing on PRRS control. To achieve this, we simply assumed that in the absence of gene editing or vaccination the baseline PRRSV transmission potential R 0 for the different herds follows a normal distribution \u223cN(\u03bc R0 , \u03c3 R0 ), which is independent of the herd size, i.e., PRRS transmission was assumed to be density-dependent (69) .",

Specifically, for the optimal, concentrated, and unregulated distribution scenarios (Table  1) , herds were selected at random to receive the required proportion P \u00c3 e (optimal), or a given fixed proportion P e (concentrated) or arbitrary proportion P e (unregulated) of genetically resistant animals, respectively, until the available stock of genetically resistant animals was either depleted or the demand was satisfied, whichever was achieved first.

This specific pathogen-free (SPF) nucleus tier typically consists of purebred animals (here from three distinct breeds) that are selectively bred at high health and management level and of which a proportion are then sold or provide semen to farms in the lower tiers of the pyramid, as outlined in Fig. 4 . Pigs in each tier are produced through mating (or artificial insemination) a fixed proportion of males and females from the same or upper pyramid tiers that have been selected to act as parents for the next generation (see SI Appendix, Table S3 for selected proportions and mating ratios), To assign a time scale to the natural propagation of the resistance alleles through the production pyramid, offspring in each tier are produced in the simulations in discrete monthly batches to represent a management system that is aligned with the natural reproductive and life cycle of pigs (see assumed parameter values in SI Appendix, Table S4 ).",

Specified proportions of individuals were then selected for mating within the nucleus based on their genetic merit (for proportions, see SI Appendix, Table S3 ). Once a stable base population was obtained within the nucleus (after about 18 mo), individuals (or semen) were selected for transfer to subsequent tiers as shown in Fig.  4 . The burn-in phase was then run for an additional 33 mo to create base populations in all pyramid tiers. The maximum numbers of sows in each tier were back-calculated based on the number of commercial piglets produced annually (12 million), the selection proportions, and the underlying pig life-cycle parameters (SI Appendix, Table S4 ).
