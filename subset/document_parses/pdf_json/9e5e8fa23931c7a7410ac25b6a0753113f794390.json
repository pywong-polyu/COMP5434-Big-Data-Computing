Objectives: In this study, we aimed at evaluation and recognition of the ethical challenges of pharmacy practice in community pharmacies. Methods: This exploratory study was conducted as a qualitative study consisting of open-ended in-depth interviews and focus group discussions followed by content analysis. The study participants were chosen from pharmacists with PharmD degree who had at least 4 years work experience and were the founders or technical managers of community pharmacies, either as governmental or private. Interviews continued until data saturation and transcribed verbatim. The content analysis was done by Graneheim and Lundman method. The codes were generated, and categorized. After assessment and final modifications, the results of the study were discussed and confirmed in a focus group discussion conducted by 7 experts who teach medical ethics and/or pharmacy ethics. Results: Overall, 40 pharmacists were interviewed (mean age 46 \u00b1 11.3 years). The extracted ethical challenges of pharmacy practice were categorized into 3 main themes, 11 subthemes and 102 codes. The themes were achieved as challenges related to professionalism and professional practice, challenges related to professional communications and challenges related to regulations and policies. Conclusion: Taken together, it seems that most of the challenges of pharmacy practice are related to professionalism and professional commitment; however, the regulations and policies provide serious obstacles for pharmacy practice and pharmaceutical care. More efforts towards teaching professionalism and modification of regulations and policies are recommended.",

The Code of Ethics for the National Pharmaceutical System of Iran stresses the ethical and professional principles consisting of eight tenets including respect for autonomy of the patient, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, empathy, excellence, integrity, and collaboration (Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

The governmental pharmacies are community pharmacies affiliated to the school of pharmacies or the Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Because, governmental pharmacies are economically related to government and the economical issues and financial profit is not a concern for pharmacists while in private community pharmacises financial profit of the pharmacy is one of the main concerning issues. Customers of both types of pharmacies are the same but the payment system is completely different and the final monthly income of the private pharmacies may have negative impact on the remuneration of the pharmacists.

The financial problems of pharmacists, public unawareness about the pharmacists' responsibility, insufficient teaching of professional ethics in the school of pharmacies, paternalism in the health system and giving gifts by companies were indicated as factors of creating the ethical challenges in pharmacy practice (Javadi et al., 2018) . A study in Jordan indicated pharmacists' ethical dilemma because of barriers such as lack of time, lack of ethical knowledge, non-expertise in ethical decision making, and not following the code of ethics (Al-Qudah et al., 2019) . Pharmacy practice and consultation is the most important professional responsibility of pharmacists that results in the improvement of patients' quality of life; without that pharmaceutical care is not achievable.

Another challenge that was achieved in this study, is patients unwilling to get consultation and pharmaceutical care that is unique and specific to our country and a major barrier in pharmaceutical care. This behavior seems to root in our perspective on health. In contrast, in a study in England, 92% of patients indicated that they are 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with their appointment with the pharmacist and 97% showed that they were 'very comfortable' or 'comfortable' discussing their medications with the pharmacist. Besides, 95% of patients were strongly agreed or agreed with the clinical recommendations of the pharmacist (Nabhani-Gebara et al., 2020).",
