The fragility of Yemen's situation has led to a widespread conflict in 2015, resulting in the world's largest humanitarian crisis. Amid the humanitarian catastrophe and the collapsing health system, a platform for coordinating humanitarian health response, called the National Health Cluster, has expanded its operations across the country. The study aims to evaluate the performance of the National Health Cluster in Yemen between 2015 and 2019. A qualitative research design was employed, and ten semi-structured interviews with key Health Cluster stakeholders were conducted. The study applied the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in Humanitarian Action (ALNAP) guide to evaluating humanitarian action using the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria. Six evaluation criteria were selected: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, effects, connectedness and participation. Inputs from interviews were manually transcribed and then analysed using NVivo 12 software. The study results indicate that the Health Cluster in Yemen has contributed to saving lives and strengthening the local health capacities in diseases surveillance. In addition, its positive effect was evident in improving the humanitarian health response coordination.",

Exit strategies were lacking, while services to address mental health, non-communicable diseases, senior citizens and people with disabilities were not prioritised in the Health Cluster strategic plans and partners' response. To ameliorate Health Cluster performance, revising its objectives and establishing a cluster-specific rapid response funding mechanism are pivotal. Furthermore, preparing the national health system for recovery and actively engaging all stakeholders in the Health Cluster' response and strategic decisions would maximise its positive impact on Yemen's health system and population.",

The Cluster Approach was one of the pillars of the so-called humanitarian reform agenda, which came into effect following the inadequate and poorly coordinated humanitarian response to the crisis in Darfur and the Indian Ocean earthquake (OCHA 2007 ; International Council of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA) 2013). There are eleven clusters specialised in different humanitarian disciplines, i.e. preventing emergencies and mitigating their risks, preparedness and response to disasters and working in recovery and reconstruction phases (Inter Agency Standing Committee (IASC) 2015).

Transition to development: which is required to sustain the current health services and prepare the health system for the next phase, i.e. health system recovery. Participants, mainly from Health Cluster and international experts, urged that it is inevitable to invest in the public health sector and national NGOs to build their capacities and to improve the cost-effectiveness of health interventions, especially in areas with no current conflict. Some informants stated that there is a need to find an approach to retain senior and qualified ministerial staff in their positions within MoPHP. 4. Cross-cutting recommendations: One informant supported mainstreaming gender equality in the Health Cluster by recommending a female staff for the position of Cluster Coordinator. This informant stated that considering gender issues within the Health Cluster management will ensure that maternal mortality, gender-based violence (GBV) and local cultural sensitivities that affect health are taken care of effectively. \"We should consider that the Cluster Coordinator (is a female), at least.

This approach, of ensuring connectedness, is in line with the Global Health Cluster, WHO and IASC recommendations (WHO 2016, 2017a; IASC 2019) .

The study fills an important gap in the scholarly, peer-reviewed work related to the Health Cluster in Yemen. Overall, this study stresses the importance of effective health coordination during emergencies to save lives and strengthen local health systems. The response coordinated by the Health Cluster was adequate, with room for improvement. Despite the ongoing conflict, constrained access and division within the government, the Health Cluster's response has succeeded to reach many populations in need and was in line, to a considerable extent, with the essential, life-saving health priorities. Moreover, despite the tremendous constraints faced, the Health Cluster has effectively coordinated a joint response with other clusters (Nutrition, WASH and FSL). For example, the cholera outbreak response and the integrated famine risk reduction response. Finally, the Health Cluster has worked closely with both governments to maintain the minimum health service package. However, the package was not comprehensive enough to fully include mental health services or respond to specific population groups' needs, such as disabilities, chronic diseases or senior citizens.Authors' contributions SA wrote and developed the topic, collected the data and analysed and wrote the full manuscript.
