Significant operational challenges were noted at our institution using this approach. In this report, we describe our experience with routine collection of paired URT and LRT sample testing. Our results revealed a high concordance between the 2 sources, and that all children tested for SARS-CoV-2 were appropriately diagnosed with URT testing alone. There was no added benefit to LRT testing. Based on these findings, our institutional approach was therefore adjusted to sample the URT alone for most patients, with LRT sampling reserved for patients with ongoing clinical suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 after a negative URT test.",

SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed universally on admission and prior to any procedure involving an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) throughout this time. Artificial airways included a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube. URT specimens included nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and aspirates. LRT specimens included tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages. URT and LRT specimens were classified as paired if the 2 specimens were collected within 24 hours. We excluded additional pairs performed within 72 hours of the index pair because these would represent duplicative information. Tests were classified as diagnostic versus screening based on the testing indication selected in the order and confirmed through medical record review performed by 3 investigators (E.K., K.C., and K.O'C.). During the study period, 2 RT-PCR tests were performed: a locally developed assay and the XPERT XPRESS SARS-CoV-2 test (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). The maximum cycle threshold required for a positive result in both of these tests is 40. Statistical analyses were limited to descriptive statistics, with categorical variables summarized by number and proportion and continuous variables summarized by median and interquartile range. Stata version 15 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and Excel software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) were used for the descriptive analysis.

[3] [4] [5] Wang et al 5 reported a higher test positivity rate in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens than nasal or pharyngeal swabs. However, interpretation of these findings is limited by small sample size, with only 15 patients undergoing BAL testing, as well as a lack of clinical data available to correlate indication for and timing of testing relative to symptom onset. This latter limitation is particularly relevant because prolonged RT-PCR positivity may not always indicate transmissibility; therefore, PCR positivity is of unclear clinical value. 6 Further limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from this study, only 1 patient undergoing BAL sampling had a simultaneously collected URT specimen. 5 In a larger study of 79 adults with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 lower respiratory tract disease and negative or indeterminate nasal or nasopharyngeal swab, only 2 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR from BAL fluid, for an overall agreement between the 2 sources of 97.5%. 7 Overall, our results are consistent with these published data and provide additional support that URT specimens are the preferred sample for SARS-CoV-2 testing. 1 However, our work was limited by the small number of positive tests that occurred in this population as well as an overall small sample size. Furthermore, our sample was a convenience sample with URT and LRT testing sent at the discretion of treating providers, though both specimen types were routinely recommended at our institution throughout the study period. Despite these limitations, our results build upon existing data and provide \"real world\" data specific to the pediatric population.",

Furthermore, this approach reflects value-based care by facilitating optimal allocation of valuable testing resources in a high-utilizing population.",
