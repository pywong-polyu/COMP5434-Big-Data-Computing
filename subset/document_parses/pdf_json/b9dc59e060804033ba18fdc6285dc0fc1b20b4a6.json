            "text": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung disorder with a high morbidity and mortality which affects all age groups. Despite active research with intense, ongoing attempts in developing pharmacological agents to treat ARDS, its mortality rate remains unaltered high and treatment is still only supportive. Over the years, there have been many attempts to identify meaningful subgroups likely to react differently to treatment among the heterogenous ARDS population, most of them unsuccessful. Only recently, analysis of large ARDS cohorts from randomized controlled trials have identified the presence of distinct biological subphenotypes among ARDS patients: a hypoinflammatory (or uninflamed; named P1) and a hyperinflammatory (or reactive; named P2) subphenotype have been proposed and corroborated with existing retrospective data. The hyperinflammatory subphenotyope was clearly associated with shock state, metabolic acidosis, and worse clinical outcomes. Core features of the respective subphenotypes were identified consistently in all assessed cohorts, independently of the studied population, the geographical location, the study design, or the analysis method. Additionally and clinically even more relevant treatment efficacies, as assessed retrospectively, appeared to be highly dependent on the respective subphenotype. This discovery launches a promising new approach to targeted medicine in ARDS. Even though it is now widely accepted that each ARDS subphenotype has distinct functional, biological, and mechanistic differences, there are crucial gaps in our knowledge, hindering the translation to bedside application. First of all, the underlying driving biological factors are still largely unknown, and secondly, there is currently no option for fast and easy identification of ARDS subphenotypes. This narrative review aims to summarize the evidence in biological subphenotyping in ARDS and tries to point out the current issues that will need addressing before translation of biological subohenotypes into clinical practice will be possible.",

In survivors, quality of life is severely impaired [7] , causing unsustainable human and economic burden. Considering the significant impact in health and economical terms, major research efforts have been conducted in the past 5 decades to more accurately characterize ARDS pathophysiology and to find an effective treatment. Unfortunately, research thus far has been largely unsuccessful in providing conclusive evidence of treatments that provide improved outcomes [8, 9] , aside from supportive care to reduce ARDS mortality [8] .

Since it is now known that a non-protective ventilation strategy causes an additional inflammatory reaction [12, 13] , a potential benefit of these applied treatments may therefore have been masked. Considering that the human ARDS population is highly heterogenous, it seems very likely that a uniform therapy non-selectively applied to all patients may further dilute any potential effect. These two factors could have been the main culprit of failure in previous studies.",

The Berlin definition [6] itself provides a prognostic enrichment as it divides the ARDS population into three severity subphenotypes according to the PaO2 to FiO2 ratio (PF ratio) with discriminative mortality rates [5] . From autopsy studies, we learnt about the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) [21] [22] [23] , that was mainly found in moderate to severe ARDS [23] indicating a specific biological mechanism. Imaging studies reported that ARDS patients with diffuse radiological patterns displayed a higher mortality as compared to patients with focal patterns [24, 25] ; these findings were associated with differences in pulmonary [26] but failed to result in different outcomes when applying a targeted ventilation approach [27] .",

The novel concept of biological subphenotyes, two distinct subphenotypes, defined by specific functional and biological parameters, offers a novel and potentially more targeted approach to the very heterogenous population of ARDS. These biological subphenotypes were identified by latent class analysis (LCA), a novel statistical method for identifying unmeasured class membership among subjects, assuming that the data contains a certain number of unobserved groups (or classes). LCA uses an iterative algorithm by using mixture modeling, that identifies the best fit of number of classes between 1 and n for a data set and assigns each subject to a specific class [28, 29] .",

The group retrospectively analyzed two randomized controlled trials (RCT) from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) ARDS Network by LCA: the ARMA trial (Ventilation with Lower Tidal Volumes as Compared with Traditional Tidal Volumes for Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) [11] that contributed 473 patients from the low tidal volume (VT) ventilation group (429 patients with high VT's were excluded) and the ALVEOLI trial (Assessment of Low tidal Volume and elevated End-expiratory volume to Obviate Lung Injury) [31] which assessed different positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings and contributed 549 patients to this analysis. Blood samples were taken at the time of randomization, < 36 h since fulfilling ARDS criteria. In the ARMA population as the derivation cohort, a two-class model was found to be the best fit and divided the population into a hyperinflammatory (named P2) and a hypoinflammatory subphenotype (named P1). One-third of patients were assigned to P2 (Fig. 2) , with a significantly higher fraction of these patients being in shock. Dominant discriminating biomarkers were Interleukin (IL)-6 and -8, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), bilirubin, bicarbonate, protein C (PC), PaCO 2 , platelets, albumin, and glucose. The clinical variables heart rate, minute ventilation, vasoactive use, plateau pressure, PEEP, and systolic blood pressure were shown to discriminate best between the subphenotypes (Table 1) . Interestingly, neither the severity of ARDS as defined by the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (PF) [6] , the severity of renal or hepatic failure, nor the extent of leukocytosis distinguished the two subphenotypes from each other. Risk factors for P2 were sepsis, pneumonia, and aspiration (in decreasing order), whereas in P1 it was pneumonia, sepsis, and aspiration. In comparison with the hypoinflammatory subphenotype, P2 displayed a higher 90-day mortality (44% vs. 23%, p = 0.006) (Fig. 2 ) and significantly less organ failure-free (9.8% vs. 16.8%; p < 0.001) as well as ventilator-free days (9.1% vs. 14.0%; p < 0.001). The same results were confirmed in the ALVEOLI cohort with remarkably similar characteristics of subphenotypes. Regarding outcome, the difference in 90-day mortality was even more pronounced with 51% and 19% in the P2 and P1 subgroups, respectively (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2 ).",

No difference in mortality at 60 days was found with either intervention, but significantly more ventilator-free days occurred in patients randomized to the fluid-conservative group. Famous et al.

Authors founds evidence for stable classes over the first 3 days with the majority of patients being in the same class at day 0 and day 3 respectively. Only 5% of patients had a change in class (more frequently from P1 to P2), whereas the clinical outcome was associated with the later class. These important findings add further evidence to the hypothesis that there are fundamental biological and clinically relevant differences in subphenotypes in ARDS, concluding that these are not manifestations of different stages of the same disease as the subphenotype patterns are not affected by the measurement time point.",

In this analysis, ARDS was clustered according to biomarkers only and then associated with outcome. A total of 700 patients were available for analysis, divided in 454 for the training and 246 patients for the validation group. A reactive and an uninflamed subphenotype was defined with an ICU mortality of 36.4% and 15.6% accordingly (Fig. 2 ). The reactive subphenotype was characterized by higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores (APACHE), more severe multi-organ failure and indirect causes of ARDS. The dominant discriminant biomarkers between the two subphenotypes were IL-6, -8, -10, interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3), Ang-1/-2, and PAI-1 (Table 1) . A 5-factor model, consisting of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, Ang-1/2, and PAI-1, provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 (95%CI 0.97 to 0.99) for discrimination between subphenotypes. Even though the class assignment to the reactive subpenotype was twice as high than reported previously [30, 33, 34] , mortality and defining biomarkers of the two subphenotypes were quite comparable, suggesting that a similar cluster exists across all these cohorts.

P2 experienced less ventilator-free days (2 vs. 18 days), fewer non-pulmonary organ failure-free days (15 vs. 27 days), and a higher 90-day mortality (47 vs. 22%; all p < 0.001) than the P1 subphenotype (Fig. 2) . The most common ARDS risk factors sepsis, pneumonia, and aspiration were highly prevalent in both groups.",

The SAILS cohort was retrospectively analyzed [39] , using LCA for clinical variables and biomarkers, and consistently, a two-class model was found to be the best fit. Further, 227 patients (37%) were assigned to P2 and 448 patients (63%) to the P1 subphenotype. The 60-day mortality of 36.5% and the 90-day mortality of 37.6% was significantly higher in the P2 group than in the patient group assigned to P1 (20.9% and 21.4% respectively, all comparison p < 0.0001) (Fig.  2) . Furthermore, the P2 group experienced fewer ventilator-free days (15 vs. 23 days; p < 0.0001). The class defining features were consistent with the previous analysis of the three NHLBI cohorts (ARMA, ALVEOLI, FACTT): IL-6 and -8, sTNFR-1, ICAM-1, PAI-1, PC, PaCO 2 , platelets, bicarbonate, albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, systolic blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate, vasoactive use, minute ventilation (Table 1 ). In addition, the P2 group had a higher white cell count, lower urinary output, and more pulmonary risk factors for ARDS. Also consistently with the results from the NHLBI ARDS Network datasets, respiratory variables including the PF-ratio performed poorly in discriminating between classes. The prominence of biomarkers as class defining variables suggests that subphenotypes may primarily be governed by basic biological factors. The authors concluded that these 4 NHLBI ARDS network datasets consistently reveal the same subphenotypes. This underlines their contemporaneous relevance despite changing demographical patterns and clinical practice in ARDS [40] . The replication of the results in ARDS cohorts from the UK/ Ireland [37] and the Netherlands [35] proves the robustness and generalizability of the subphenotype model intercontinentally.",

The mortality at 30 days was specifically lower in nonpulmonary ARDS after PS-matching and in the P1 subphenotype before and after PS-matching (Fig. 2) .

Analyzing leukocyte expression profiles in the MARS cohort [47] was the first attempt to more fully understand molecular pathways in subpenotypes in ARDS by comparing differential gene expression that might be indicative of pathophysiologic changes within the subphenotype. The respective subphenotype was identified by the 5-factor-model [35] as previously derived in the MARS dataset [35] . Among 210 patients, 82 (38%) were assigned to the uninflamed (P1) and 128 (62%) patients to the reactive/hyperinflammatory subphenotype (P2). These were compared to 547 patients with sepsis but no ARDS and 42 healthy age-matched controls. Twenty-nine percent (3332/11443) of genes were significantly differently expressed between subphenotypes. In P2, 7 of 8 genes previously positively associated with ARDS [48] , were shown to be upregulated, with pathways of oxidative phosphorylation (indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction) as well as cholesterol metabolism and the innate immune system being the most enriched ones. Fifty percent of genes that were previously found to be negatively associated with ARDS were upregulated in P1. Specifically, pathways coordinating cell proliferation and differentiation, motility and survival as well as the adaptive immune system were enriched in P1. Interestingly, sepsis patients without ARDS were most similar to P1 subphenotypes expression. While these results provide a glimpse to potential revelation of different underlying biological factors, we are still far away from an in-depth understanding. Previous studies with whole blood gene expression studies failed to prove a consistent gene signature for ARDS patients [49] , assumingly because of a mixture in ARDS subphenotypes. In the near future, bioinformatic approaches like genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics will enhance our understanding of driving factors on a molecular level.",

A first attempt at solving this hindrance was recently published [50] . Machine learning algorithms were applied to 3 cohorts from the NHLBI ARDS Network (ARMA, ALVEOLI, FACTT) incorporating 2200 patients, to select the six most important classifier variables for development of nested logistic regression models. The logistic regression models with the highest predictive accuracy were then evaluated in the validation cohort (SAILS; n = 715). The most important classifier factors were IL-8, -6, PC, sTNFR-1, bicarbonate and vasoactive use. A 4-variable model, incorporating IL-8, bicarbonate, PC, and vasoactive use, resulted in an AUC of 0.95 (95%CI 0.93-0.96) and performed best as compared with the LCA classification as the gold standard. Similar to the LCAderived subphenotypes, P2 derived from the classifier model was shown to have a higher 90-day mortality than P1 (39% vs. 23%, p < 0.0001) and fewer ventilator-free days. However promising, so far there is no point-of-care test to identify subphenotypes in the clinical setting.",
