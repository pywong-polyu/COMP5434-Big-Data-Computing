Outpatient clinics were stopped for non-urgent patients: it became a priority to manage hundreds of fragile neurological patients who suddenly had less reference points. In Italy, before the pandemic, Televisits were neither recognized nor priced. Methods At the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico C. Besta, we reorganized outpatient clinics to deliver Neurotelemedicine services, including Televisits and Teleneurorehabilitation, since March 2020. A dedicated Working Group prepared the procedure, tested the system, and designed satisfaction questionnaires for adults and children.",

It included prescription, booking, consenting, privacy and data protection, secure connection with patients (Teams Microsoft 365), electronic report preparation and delivery, reporting, and accountability of the services. During the March-September 2020 period, we delivered 3167 Telemedicine services, including 1618 Televisits, to 1694 patients (972 adults, 722 children) with a wide range of chronic neurological disorders. We successfully administered different clinical assessment and scales. Satisfaction among patients and caregivers was very high. Conclusions During the dramatic emergency, we were able to take care of more than 1600 patients by organizing Neurotelehealth in a few weeks, lessening the impact of the pandemic on fragile patients with chronic neurological disorders; this strategy is now stably embedded in our care pathways. In Italy, Telehealth is at present recognized and priced and is becoming a stable pillar of the health system.",

In March 2020, Lombardy became the centre of the SARS-CoV2 epidemic in Italy. Since the 8th of March, during the lockdown period, people were confined at home and could go out only for important and proven needs. Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta is a research institute placed in Milan, providing care to adult patients and children with neurological and neurosurgical diseases coming from all regions of Italy. Many of our patients are frail patients, affected by rare neurological disorders and/or by diseases with great complexity, requiring monitoring and follow-up visits as well as high specialization for proper management, and about 60% of them live outside Lombardy. The Lombardy Health Regional System suspended all non-urgent medical visits to concentrate efforts on fighting COVID-19 in several hospitals and to avoid the spreading of the contagion to patients, caregivers, and health-system personnel. During the first wave, hospitals were a place of diffusion of the disease and many health-workers became infected.",

In 2014, the Italian Health Ministry issued a document for providing address lines for Telehealth development [1]. However, since then, no formal decision had been taken and until March 2020, there was no formal recognition and no reimbursement for clinical services such as Televisits and Teleconsultations. Therefore, there were many different problems to be solved to provide care using Telehealth to our patients. During the epidemic, on the 18th of March 2020, the Lombardy Region issued a circular to allow delivery of all mental health services for paediatric patients and their families remotely by voice or video-call, using protected video conferencing platforms in accordance with the Decree of the General Director of the Welfare DG of Lombardy Region N. 2906 of the 8th of March and N. 3553 of the 15th of March 2020 [2] , in addition to the national recommendation of Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 in Italy [3] . These were important steps and we kept such guidelines as the basis for developing Telehealth in our Institute during the COVID-19 emergency phase. In particular, all the Units of the Department of Paediatric Neuroscience (DINEP) were largely reorganized to maintain continuity of care and manage the new needs of families and of children that were also at home from schools [4] [5] [6] .",

The Questionnaire for adults included 47 questions related to patients' and caregivers' satisfaction as well as to technical issues and visit efficacy; we used the TSQ [7] and the client satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ) [8] as bases for selecting or designing the questions. It was administered to a subset of 78 patients with rare neurological diseases and multiple sclerosis.

The pandemic has greatly accelerated the Telehealth development in several countries [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] : in Italy, over a 10-week period progresses occurred which would have otherwise required possibly 10 years [9, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Telehealth allowed us to provide medical services to >1600 patients with chronic neurological diseases who suddenly found themselves with limited medical reference points. During the first weeks, we were overwhelmed by emails, phone calls, WhatsApp and text messages requesting consultations, opinions, support from patients and families, but none of these means could be considered a secure way of providing care. We needed a rapid solution to ensure patients' care and define a standardized care pathway. In few weeks, we rapidly re-organized outpatient virtual clinics by using existing tools, integrated and structured in a workflow, to perform synchronous Televisits. We developed a written procedure taking care of privacy, data protection, interaction with the booking system, using a secure connection, a system for writing and delivering clinical reports and for provisionally accounting the services by using a Telemedicine flag. We could administer many Televisits and other neurological services (Table 1) , limiting the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health of hundreds of patients followed by our Institute (Table 2) [4] [5] [6] 30] . We also confirm that neurological examination is feasible and useful during the follow-up Televisits [22, [31] [32] [33] , though with limitations related to evaluation of sensation, deep tendon reflexes, muscle tone, vestibular function, visual field, and minor strength defects. Cognitive assessment is also possible and effective. We could successfully administer clinical scales to patients with neuromuscular disorders.",

We encountered relatively few technical problems and the Televisit, Teleneurorehabilitation, and all health procedures were successfully carried out in almost all cases. Patients need proper equipment, good quality webcam, high-speed connection, and-not infrequently-the support of a caregiver. Overall, Telehealth was very well received by doctors and also by other healthcare personnel, as confirmed by the high number of them involved in the process and by the number of Telemedicine services provided.",

Therefore, we have now a platform certified as a medical device according to the European Community requirements to provide Neurotelehealth and are stably delivering services of Televisits for adults and children and Teleneurorehabilitation for children, and we are organizing Telecooperation, Teleconsultation, Telemonitoring, to face the still ongoing pandemic phase and the post-COVID period. Although this paper reflects the experience of one Institute only, the global increased need for Telemedicine due to the pandemic requires that more and more case studies are reported, to show that despite the disruption of services there are ways in which health services can provide efficient mitigations for guaranteeing care for patients of any age and with any diagnosis.
