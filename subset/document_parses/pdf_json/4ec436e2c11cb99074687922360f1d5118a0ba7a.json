It has several key points that will make it increasingly relevant in the current climate. A high mortality has been reported in elective general surgery patients who are COVID positive [10] , which is concerning for the vascular patient population who are at increased risk of succumbing to a COVID-19 infection owing to their older age, high levels of smoking and background respiratory conditions, and comorbidities including diabetes. These factors have all been linked to significantly reduced rates of survival in those that have contracted the SARS-CoV2 virus. Preexisting conditions also mean that if our patients are admitted to hospital, they are less likely to be considered candidates for invasive ventilation due to the associated mortality reported [11] . In addition, COVID-19 associated coagulopathy is emerging as a presenting complaint for COVID-19 infection and will impact on vascular been observed; however it is unclear if this is a reduction in self-referrals to primary care due to fear of coming into hospital, or gatekeeping being performed by referring teams.",
