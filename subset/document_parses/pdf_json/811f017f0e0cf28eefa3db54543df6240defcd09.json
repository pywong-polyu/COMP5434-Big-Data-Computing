As businesses evolve, questions on its past performance is beside the point but its anticipated functions and relevance in the future. With the use of software in commerce at the core of every business today, the overlook of how omnichannel transactions operates is an awe with the 4th industrial revolution and its societal impact. This chapter explains how commerce has currently evolved in the advent of technology elaborating on the current state and challenges of systems, its architecture, and the innovations of cyber physical systems in electronic commerce. It further expounds on the application of omnichannel systems in communication through the fifth-generation network, in transaction through blockchain and in composition through Social Internet of Things. We believe that this study will benefit all stakeholders in commerce from governments, supply chain organizations and consumers to understanding the forthcoming drivers of omnichannel systems in the 4th industrial revolution, its prospects, and its anticipated challenges.",

This intern demand high network connectivity speed, scalable communication between systems and devices in storage and architecture as well as decentralization of transaction process. Figure 4 describes a typical progression of e-commerce systems interoperability. A sensory detection of wearbles (smart watch) would detect Person A's low heart rate and share information to a medical application on a mobile phone. The mobile phone communicates to check availability of medication on the SMART medical cabinet. On detection of none/low medication, the SMART medical cabinet requests medicine replenishment on blockchain platform from a health practitioner (medicine providers). The figure outlines how systems can share information without the inception of person A. Figure 4 further outlines how efficient digital transactions are, for systems are able to communicate and establish a commercial transaction through blockchain. Lastly, the communication of information from medicine providers to the delivery with autonomous delivery systems capable of locating person A geographically through sharing information with the smart watch once the transactions is verified and approved.",
