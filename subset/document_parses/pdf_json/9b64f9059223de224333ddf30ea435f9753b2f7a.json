Observance of these terms, as well as the procedure for obtaining the status of a lawyer (successful completion of the qualification exam and a positive conclusion of the qualification commission of the lawyer's education in the Russian Federation) is sufficient to obtain the status of a lawyer. Throughout the entire period of advocacy activity, it is necessary to obtain knowledge in the field of law in the form of professional development. This means that the list of knowledge and skills that a lawyer should have, does not include those related to working with information and legal systems, Internet resources, including the Commercial Case File, and GAS-Pravosudie. Failure to work with these resources does not allow the lawyer to be as effective and informed as the people who use them, and most importantly-increases the risk of clients receiving poor-quality and ineffective legal assistance. This is especially important in connection with the restriction of access to the courts to comply with protection measures against the spread of COVID-2019 coronavirus infection, the introduction of remote procedural actions in the practice of courts (familiarization with the case materials, obtaining audio clips of court sessions) and even holding online sessions.",

Of course, this inequality of two lawyers gives one of them the opportunity to provide better and more effective legal assistance to their principal. This may affect the results of the legal dispute consideration, the possibility of its prevention, or even deprive the principal of the possibility of obtaining judicial protection, for example, if the lawyer incorrectly calculates the statute of limitations for the raised claims. But the consequence of the lawyer's information and legal inexperience is not only his personal professional failures. First of all, this is a negative, property and possibly penal consequences of receiving poor legal assistance for the lawyer's client, the decline in the overall level of legal protection of the population, that is, failure to perform nonadvocacy functions assigned to it by the state. Someone may say that this argument cannot be used as a counterweight to the requirement of the legal competence level of the lawyer, since the possession of the necessary knowledge is a part of the professional requirements for a lawyer. We cannot disagree with this, since having a lawyer's degree and the necessary work experience does not guarantee the ability of a lawyer to obtain the latest knowledge and information from existing reference legal systems, which is especially relevant for Russia, where the practice of applying the law is formed based on the legal positions of courts that tend to change over time.",

Part 1 of article 807 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation defined the content of the money loan between citizens: the lender transfers or undertakes to transfer it to the borrower ownership, and the borrower shall return to the lender the loan on the terms and conditions specified in the contract, and the contract shall be considered concluded from the moment of transfer the loan to the borrower or the specified person [3]. Statutory requirements for lender or borrower, such as income, sufficient for granting the loan or purpose of the loan, do not exist, but these circumstances are to be proved in the collection of the loan or the inclusion of creditor requirements in the register of requirements of competitive creditors of the debtor in the legal positions of the Supreme Court, current regulatory enforcement. In the refusal justification of the recovered loan, courts have argued impecuniousness of the loan agreement, but a special entity (the borrower) is often absent (loan disputes arbitration official receiver, the competitive creditor), and the prohibition of challenge of lack of money of the contract, made in writing (part 2 of article 812 of the civil code) is ignored. The basis for challenging the loan agreement is also the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 61.2 of the bankruptcy law, which provides for the possibility of invalidating a transaction made by the debtor in order to harm the property rights of creditors (suspicious transaction), but often the restrictions established by law (including the suspicious period) are not taken into account by the courts when considering a dispute on recovery of borrowed funds from the debtor [9] . As a result, the claims of the lender, who provided the court with a receipt in order to support the claim for recovery of the loan and loan agreement, are refused even if the debtor admits the fact of receiving money from the lender if the lender does not prove that it has sufficient funds to issue the loan and that the borrower actually incurred some expenses by applying the borrowed funds (for economic disputes, see, for example, the Ruling of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of June 11, 2020 No. 306-ES18-10093 (2) in case no.A55-10923/2017 [16] , for cases considered by courts of General jurisdiction, see, for example, the decision of the Soviet district court of the city of Samara of 25.05.2017 in case No. 2-917/2017 [6] , the decision of the Samara regional court of 31.07.2017 in case No. 33-9616/2017 [4] ).",

The convenience of working with the Commercial Case File is supplemented by the ability to classify various information: on the participation of specific individuals in court proceedings, categories of such cases (civil, administrative, bankruptcy), etc. In addition, there are services \"Strazh\" (tracking the progress of consideration of a specific dispute), \"Calendar\" allows you to track the dates of disputes consideration by individual courts, judges, and participants in the dispute, and you can also contact the Bank of judicial decisions and work in the \"My Arbitrator\" system, which allows you to remotely post scanned copies of procedural documents in a case in which it provides representation, informing it of changes in cases to which it has subscribed.

In order to achieve the goals set by the law and society, the lawyer, legal education and the community of lawyers have to develop skills related to the possibility of providing legal assistance through the latest information technologies. Recent events related to the adoption of measures by many states to protect the population from the danger of coronavirus infection (COVID-2019) have confirmed the need to develop the involvement of the legal community and each of the lawyers individually in the process of digitalization. The ability to work with tools for obtaining information and participating in court proceedings, provided through special electronic files, databases, is necessary for a modern lawyer to provide effective and high-quality, that is, qualified legal assistance.",
