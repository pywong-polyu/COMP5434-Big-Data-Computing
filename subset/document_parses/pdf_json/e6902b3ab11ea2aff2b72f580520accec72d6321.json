            "text": "Although most incarcerations in the US-including those for PLWH-occur in jails [1] , most research examining HIV care during incarceration has been conducted in prisons. Yet, the HIV treatment challenges in these two settings can differ. Jails are usually locally resourced and managed and hold individuals awaiting trial, parole, or serving sentences of less than one year [8] . Prisons, on the other hand, are under the jurisdiction of the state or federal government and hold individuals sentenced to more than one year [9] . As such, jails tend to have fewer healthcare resources than prisons, and jail incarcerations typically last a few days or weeks [8] , as compared to prison stays, which are typically much longer [9] . Studies including jails typically have been set in unified systems (i.e., in states which combine their prison and jails systems) or in massive urban jails which are unrepresentative of most of the 3200 jails across the US [10] . In addition, prisons and jails are often conflated in research, making it difficult to parse findings specific to jails. Much of the limited research about the impact of jail incarceration on HIV care focuses on short-term and long-term linkages to care post jail release [11] [12] [13] . However, research in the prison context suggests that PLWH may face significant challenges in accessing HIV care while incarcerated in jails. Access to HIV healthcare resources, including specialists and medications, vary within and across prison systems, affecting the care received [14] . Considering that jails are in most cases managed independently, at the county level, the quality and availability of healthcare across these facilities are likely to be much more heterogenous than in prisons.",

In contrast to prison [16] , universal or opt-out HIV testing in most jails is uncommon [17, 18] ; therefore, access to HIV care in jail depends on individuals' selfdisclosure of HIV status to jail healthcare providers. Correctional officers often mediate communication between incarcerated individuals and healthcare staff, and their relationships with incarcerated individuals can influence an individual's comfort in disclosing their status and when they receive care [19, 20] . Fear of discrimination by correctional officers or other incarcerated people can result in delayed disclosure or in not disclosing one's status at all to healthcare providers. Some incarcerated people in both jail and prison settings have expressed concerns about involuntary disclosure of HIV-status to peers and correctional officers through gossip, perceived stereotypes, or medication distribution [21, 22] . Fears of physical harm, alienation, and the inability to engage in supportive and protective relationships with other incarcerated people because of disclosure can override the desire to access care [19] .",

Interviews included a series of questions focused on personal experiences with HIV care in jail settings. Interviewers used a semi-structured interview guide that included questions focused on HIV disclosure in jail, the type of HIV care received during jail incarcerations, and overall experiences with HIV care in jail (See S1 and S2 Appendixes). Participants had to meet the following eligibility criteria: HIV positive, 18 years old or older, English speaking, and either transferred from jail to prison or released from jail into the community in the last six months. The study protocol was approved by the Wake County Human Services Institutional Review Board, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, and the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Nevertheless, most participants reported that they were able to keep their HIV status confidential from detention officers and other incarcerated people while in jail, and that their privacy-related concerns did not ultimately affect their HIV care. Only four participants reported that privacy and stigma concerns negatively impacted their HIV care, and for one of them, the jail's resource limitations had a larger impact on his care. Other challenges mentioned by participants included not seeing an HIV provider while in jail due to cost and a lack of non-medical resources, such as a restroom or empathy among detention officers. These findings suggest that eliminating copayments for doctor visits for PLWH and improving availability of non-medical resources could have a positive impact on HIV management in jail.",

Considering the multitude of possible detrimental consequences of incarceration (e.g., loss of employment and housing, family separations), the experiences of this population raise questions about how best to intervene so that HIV and substance use services are more readily accessed in the community, potentially avoiding further incarcerations.",

As part of the re-linkage process, patient needs are assessed and efforts are made to address barriers to HIV care, such as substance use or transportation. Expansion of community D2C services has the potential to preempt or at least alleviate jails' roles as de facto HIV safety net providers. Additionally, our previous research suggests that PLWH and other stakeholders (e.g., HIV providers, privacy experts, community advocates) generally support extending D2C services to jails to help ensure that PLWH who do become incarcerated have access to HIV services during incarceration and after release [28] .",

First, participants included PLWH who had been recently incarcerated in jails in North Carolina; the findings may not be generalizable to jails nationwide. Second, while our sample reflects the demographics of PLWH in North Carolina [29] and people incarcerated in jails [30] . we were unable to recruit a balanced sample of men and women due to restrictions on face-to-face research generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our interviews with women as well as transgender individuals suggest that these groups may have distinct experiences when accessing HIV care in jail, suggesting the need for further research of the gendered aspects of incarceration experiences. Finally, we recruited participants from a local case management organization, HIV clinic, and prison infectious disease clinics, locations where PLWH were receiving HIV care or services. Thus, our study is missing the perspective of PLWH who were not currently engaged in HIV care and, by extension, may not have been engaged in care during their time spent in jail. Despite this limitation, we also adopted this recruitment strategy anticipating that most of our participants would have multiple incarcerations, and while they were all currently in care, some were not in care previously, and thus were able to speak to the perspectives of those not in care.",

The diverse experiences conveyed in our interviews reflect not only the role of jails' resources and environments in shaping HIV care, but also the importance of patients' individual circumstances. Although most participants reported receiving HIV medications and seeing providers while in jail, many also reported significant challenges accessing HIV care in jail. Findings from this study suggest that jail leadership should review internal policies regarding HIV medications to ensure that PLWH can receive them quickly upon entry into jail. Findings also suggest that more external resources are needed, for example from state and local health departments, so that jails can provide timely HIV medications for PLWH incarcerated in their facilities. More research is needed to understand how to improve access to HIV care in jails, especially among people incarcerated in rural and suburban jails. Moreover, the breadth of experiences reported by participants in this study underscores the value of qualitative research to give voice to this too-often marginalized population. ",
