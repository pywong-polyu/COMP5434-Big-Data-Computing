            "text": "Background: Several studies have recently suggested that liver disease and cirrhosis were risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. However, no large data study has reported the clinical course of COVID-19 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. This study investigated whether HBV infection had negative impacts on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study with 19,160 COVID-19-infected patients in 2020 from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. The clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with chronic HBV infections were assessed and compared to those of non-HBV-infected patients. Results: Of the 19,160 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 675 (3.5%) patients had chronic HBV infections. The HBV-infected patients were older and had more commodities than the non-HBV infected COVID-19 patients. During the observation period, COVID-19-related mortality was seen in 1,524 (8.2%) of the non-HBV-infected 18,485 patients, whereas 91 (13.5%) in HBV-infected 675 patients died of COVID-19 infection. Compared to patients without HBV infections, a higher proportion of patients with chronic HBV infections required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and had organ failures. However, odds ratios for mortality, ICU admission, and organ failure were comparable between the two groups after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbid diseases including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion: COVID-19-infected patients with HBV infections showed worse clinical courses than non-HBV-infected COVID-19 patients. However, after adjustment, chronic HBV infection itself does not seem to affect the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which is an RNA virus first reported in humans in December 2019 that rapidly spread worldwide and has resulted in a pandemic crisis. It was already well known that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease had poor prognoses. 1,2 Relatively, data on the effect of COVID-19 in patients with underlying liver diseases have been scarce. However, several studies on COVID-19 and chronic liver disease were published recently. [3] [4] [5] Most studies showed that patient prognosis was poor in the presence of chronic liver disease. 6, 7 The clinical course of COVID-19 was influenced by the causes of chronic liver disease including viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic fatty liver, the use of immunosuppressive agents in liver transplant recipients, and autoimmune hepatitis. 8, 9 As for viral hepatitis, most studies have focused on patients with hepatitis C virus. 10 However, there are very few reports on the prognosis of COVID-19 in hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. 9, 11 In addition, there are no reports on whether there is a difference in the prognosis of patients undergoing treatment for HBV. Although many studies are underway to develop a treatment for COVID-19, no treatment has been proven effective yet. Recently, several experimental studies reported that nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for HBV treatment were effective against COVID-19 through potential antiviral treatment mechanisms. 11 Unlike Western countries, the prevalence of chronic HBV patients in Korea is high (4%), and there are many chronic HBV patients taking antiviral drugs for HBV. Therefore, the relatively greater number of HBV patients in Korea made it a favorable situation in which to confirm whether HBV infection status and antiviral therapy for HBV infections affected the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.",

[15] [16] [17] The findings could indicate that the human liver can be used as a habitat for SARS-CoV-2 replication and activation. The histological examination of livers from deceased COVID-19 patients showed widespread vascular abnormalities, steatosis, and mitochondrial abnormalities, which were thought to be caused by SARS-CoV-2. 18 Several studies reported that the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 infections was worse in patients with accompanying chronic liver disease, which lead to reduced liver function. 3, 18, 19 This study also showed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 infections in HBV carriers was significantly higher than that of non-HBV-infected patients during the observation period. Compared to the non-HBV group, more patients in the HBV group were admitted to the ICU, progressed to liver failure, and required CCRT, mechanical ventilation, and ECMO.",

Therefore, the study data were analyzed by adjusting for HBV-related complications and other comorbidities. The results confirmed that HBV infection itself did not affect the prognosis of patients infected with COVID-19. This was also confirmed by the fact that there was no difference in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients receiving and not receiving current HBV treatment. Thus, it is thought that there is no direct relationship between HBV and the COVID-19 virus. This is consistent with the other studies with a relatively small number of patients that HBV itself did not affect the clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 after adjusting for comorbidities. 9,11,18",

Several COVID-19 treatment attempts have recently been made, one of which is drug repositioning. 20 This is used to check the feasibility \"of treating patients by recycling a drug that is expected to have a therapeutic effect on the COVID-19 virus by considering the mechanisms of drugs used in the treatment of other viruses. Antiviral drugs for HBV could be a drug repositioned for COVID-19 virus treatment. HBV treatment drugs are based on the mechanism of inhibiting viral RNA synthesis. Many clinical studies have shown that the mechanism is effective in the treatment of the COVID-19 virus, and related research is ongoing. 21,22 However, in this study, there was no difference in the clinical course of patients taking hepatitis B antiviral drugs compared to patients not taking antiviral drugs. Although there was no statistical significance, the patient group taking antiviral drugs for HBV had a worse mortality rate. This result seems to be because expense of antiviral drugs are covered only in chronic HBV infection patients with abnormal liver function tests, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma by national health insurance system in Korea. These patients are more likely to progress to liver failure.",

Many studies have suggested that anti-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) drugs can be used for COVID-19 virus treatment. NRTIs, such as tenofovir, abacavir, and lamivudine used for HBV treatment are potent inhibitors of RdRp. The drugs can tightly bind to the RdRp of the COVID-19 virus strain and thus, may prevent severe acute respiratory distress. Therefore, as in our study, patients taking antiviral drugs for HBV seemed to have fewer respiratory complications. However, further research is needed to confirm the causal relationship.",

And there may be diagnostic errors or claims code errors in this kind of data. For these reasons, it seems that the mortality rate in our study was rather higher than the mortality rate known so far. Data on HBV medication compliance and HBV DNA titers were also not provided. So, since we do not know about the activity of HBV, it seems that it cannot be seen as showing the exact relationship between HBV infection status and COVID-19. In addition, we did not fully take into account other various liver disease, such as chronic hepatitis C virus infection, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which may affect liver-related adverse outcomes of COVID 19. Future studies should investigate the effect of HBV on clinical outcome of COVID-19 after adjusting chronic liver diseases caused by other causes.",
