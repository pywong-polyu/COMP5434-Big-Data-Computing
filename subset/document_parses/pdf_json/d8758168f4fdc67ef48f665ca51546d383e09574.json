However, a rigorous management system can support the enforcement of preventive measures, and in turn, reduce incidence and deaths. Here, we model a trustable and reliable management system based on blockchain for vaccine distribution by extending the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model. The model includes prevention measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, vaccination rate, and vaccination efficiency. It also considers negative social behavior, such as violations of social distance and attempts of using illegitimate vaccination proofs. By evaluating the model, we show that the proposed system can reduce up to 2.5 million cases and half a million deaths in the most demanding scenarios.",

COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is highly contagious and has been fatal for millions of people [1] - [5] . COVID-19 is transmitted through droplets of nasal secretion and saliva that are expelled when a person coughs, heavily breaths, talks, or even normally breathes. Detection of saliva is difficult as multiple of its components may need to be detected. Therefore, face-covering is considered a pivotal prevention measure as it provides a high degree of protection to both the wearer and the surrounding people. However, it is not 100% protective. Therefore, there is hope that vaccinations will mitigate or even stop the spreading of this disease [6] .",

As more of the world population is now getting vaccinated, the management of the rollout and verification of vaccination records require not only accurate bookkeeping but also ubiquitous and secure access while maintaining user privacy. Accurate and accessible vaccination records are critical to provide an effective vaccination rollout and to support the execution of preventive measures, such as social distancing [2] , [7] . COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers are being administered to the world population [8] - [10] aiming to vaccinate people rapidly and thus to leverage restoring normalcy, minimize health and economic damage, and reduce virus mutation opportunity [11] . The speedy distribution has to be carefully managed to avoid suboptimal benefits. However, the desirable synchronization and coordination of electronic vaccination records may be difficult to achieve in such a large vaccine distribution as it requires compatibility and administrative agreements among vaccination sites and upper administrators. Furthermore, the lack of secure processes to record vaccination events may make it difficult to enforce prevention measures at the rollout time and in the future. Vaccine verification could help to quickly restore daily social activities and traveling, as it may allow us to identify the susceptible and the potential source of infection. This verification requires reliable vaccination records that are secure, private, and accessible.",

With SEIR-VB, a policy of social distancing can be encouraged by enabling vaccination verification as a passport to activities that may require reduced social distancing. This paper shows that blockchain not only facilitates the management of vaccinations but also decreases the incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths as compared to a system without blockchain.",

            "text": "We classify the variables into two groups: prevention measures that decrease the incidence, such as vaccination efficacy, vaccination rate, and social distancing, and negative social behavior that increases the incidence, such as infected individuals who are aware or unaware of their infections and unvaccinated individuals claiming being vaccinated, all ignoring social distancing. Fig. 2(c) shows that the number of deaths decreases as individuals become aware of their infection and quarantine themselves. These results show that the adoption of blockchain could reduce more than 30,000 deaths for 70% of infection awareness with 50% of the population wearing masks. The difference in the number of deaths increases as the percentage of the wearing-mask population decreases because blockchain enables the detection of high-risk individuals as more individuals are exposed. The blockchain system may reduce about 3,000 deaths with 90% of the population wearing masks and 100% of infection awareness. Fig. 2(d) shows that the blockchain system may reduce about 27,000 deaths with 10% of the infected individuals concealing their infection and 50% of the population wearing masks. On the other hand, this system may decrease about 3,000 deaths with 90% of the population wearing masks. The blockchain system also shows benefits against false vaccination claims. Fig. 2(e) shows that the blockchain system may reduce about 70,000 deaths for a 90% false vaccination claim rate with 50% of the population wearing masks and about 6,700 deaths with 90% of the population wearing masks. Its smallest impact is a reduction of about 2,700 deaths for a 10% rate of false vaccination claims with 90% of the population wearing masks. The blockchain management system also reduces the number of cases and deaths when individuals neglect social distancing. It reduces about 60,000 deaths when each individual practices unsafe social distancing with 50% of the population wearing masks, as shown in Fig. 2(f) . The smallest impact can be seen by a reduction of about 5,000 deaths with 90% of the population wearing masks. Fig. 2(g) shows that a 100% effective vaccine alone would be insufficient to avoid as many deaths as the combination of vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing would. The blockchain system combined with a 100% effective vaccine would reduce more than 40,000 deaths with 50% of the population wearing masks and about 4,000 deaths with 90% of the population wearing masks. A lower efficacy vaccine may increase the number of deaths and that may increase the role importance of the blockchain system. Fig. 2(h) shows that at a daily vaccination rate of 1% of the population, the blockchain system would reduce 3,700 and 35,000 deaths with 90 and 50% of the population wearing masks, respectively. Table II shows that the blockchain system can reduce the number of cases as the contagion level increases. For example, the proposed system may reduce 15 and 47 million cases under no social distancing but with 50% of the population wearing masks and a low vaccination rate of 0.1%, for virus reproduction numbers of 2.5 and 3.5, respectively. Also, the blockchain system could reduce 1.3 and 1.9 million cases for a high vaccination rate of 0.5%, with 50% of the population wearing masks, and individuals socializing with 90% restrictions with reproduction numbers of 2.5 and 3.5, respectively. With the vaccination rollout, the number of individuals wearing masks may decrease but that could increase the number of cases and deaths. Table II shows that with a low daily vaccination rate of 0.1%, with 50% of the population wearing masks and no individuals keeping social distance, the system could reduce more than 80,000 deaths for a (virus) reproduction number of 2.5 and more than 230,000 deaths for a reproduction number of 3.5. On the other hand, at a daily vaccination rate of 0.5%, 90% of the population wearing masks, and individuals socializing with 90% restrictions, the system could still reduce 1,300 and 1,850 deaths for reproduction numbers of 2.5 and 3.5, respectively. Even though these numbers of deaths are small in comparison with the initial population, decreasing incidence and mortality is deemed significant.",
