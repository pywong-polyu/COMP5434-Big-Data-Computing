The present study investigates the impact of trade and digitization on health in 12 selected Asian economies for the period 1991-2019. The study applied FMOLS and DOLS approaches for confirming the panel and economy-wise findings. The core findings of the panel FMOLS confirm the significant negative impact of trade and digitization on mortality rate, and trade and digitization have significantly positively contributed to life expectancy in selected Asian countries in the long run. The study deduces some imperative policy implications related to trade, digitization, and health, specifically for Asian economies.",

Health has become the most primary concern for individuals and governments all around the globe. A healthy mind and body can contribute to the well-being of society with much more efficiency and become an asset for society. On the other side, a physically and mentally ill person can become a liability for society. As a result, demand for good health facilities has become a basic necessity alongside food, shelter, and education. Since 1950, the provision of good health services has added 3 years per decade to the life expectancy of people worldwide. However, the situation of health and its related indicators size life expectancy, has not improved in my developing economies. This argument can be fortified because a drastic disparity in the minimum and maximum life expectancy scores can be observed worldwide. The average maximum and minimum life expectancy scores are recorded at about 81.49 and 39.54, respectively. Likewise, the maximum and minimum average infant mortality rates are recorded at about 147.86 and 3.89, respectively. Low health status is becoming a serious problem in the context of universal health, with a growing proportion of the world's people suffering from some sort of physical or mental health issue. Given the consequence of poor health as a vital promoter to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and immobilizing conditions, there is an urgent need to comprehend how international and national health strategies and agendas may improve this burden.",

It also supports economies to generate exports and imports of goods and services through opening borders for economic flows. Trade globalization can affect the health sector through various channels, either positively or negatively. For instance, policies of trade can influence beverages, nutritional consumption, and pharmaceutical drugs consumption. It is also possible that the consumption of beverages, food items, and tobacco through trade agreements between Europe and Asia can form a macroeconomic structure that can either generate benefits or risks to health. For instance, obesity in children can be associated with foreign trade in terms of food consumption, accumulation of formula for infants, and less nutritional food for children.",

It is estimated that almost 700,000 people have died in Western Europe due to pollution linked with goods imported from China. The high spread of a tropical illness such as malaria in lower-income economies deteriorates health and trade (7) . This indicates that traders are not ideal in disease-prevalent areas because these areas can create risks for both health and trade segments.

In the literature, it is also argued that trade liberalization directly harms people's health by increasing economic insecurity and income inequality, by raising the accessibility of harmful processed foods, and by damaging the environment (11, 12) . Academics of public health usually condemn bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements as encouraging a \"neoliberal agenda\" that enforces obligatory privatizations of health services and improperly stringent standards of rational property protection on the poor people (13) .

In a bid to answer this question, a debate has erupted among the ranks of economic policymakers and health officials on the positive outcomes of ICT on health status. Consistent with this view, there has been substantial development in internet availability in cities and metropolitans.

This is the first-ever study that has tried to analyze the nexus between trade, digitalization, and health outcomes to the best of our knowledge. The core findings of our research will provide some important policy implications, mainly for Asian countries. The study highlights the health outcomes from the development of trade and digitalization and a policy that values sustainable development.

Moreover, the panel data provide more variability, more information, and a higher degree of efficiency in a data set than simple time-series and cross-sectional data (27) . Accordingly, panel data techniques are used to get the estimates of the variables. However, the basic panel data techniques such as fixed effect (FE), random effect (RE), and generalized methods of movement (GMM) are appropriate when T is small, and N is large. Whereas, when T is large, we need to apply panel cointegration methods. Hence, to investigate the impact of bilateral trade on health outcomes in the Asian region, we have taken recourse panel data techniques such as pooled ordinary least square (POLS), fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), and dynamic ordinary square (DOLS).",

Pooled OLS is a good technique for employing a different sample in panel data (28) . However, in POLS, the results are inconsistent due to the problem of unobserved heterogeneity because POLS cannot account for it (29) . Subsequently, the study used FMOLS and DOLS, which are very efficient estimators in the presence of endogeneity among independent variables, and can also manage the problem of serial correlation in the error terms. To control endogeneity and serial correlation, the method used by FMOLS is non-parametric, whereas DOLS include the lead as well as the lag values of the independent variables, which is the parametric approach as opposed to non-parametric, to control the problems of endogeneity and serial correlation (30) . Another advantage of DOLS is that it can also produce efficient results even if the size of a sample is small (31) . Further, in the case of cross-sectional dependence, which is a serious problem in panel data, DOLS is an efficient method and provides consistent and unbiased results. To handle cross-sectional dependence, the DOLS relies on obtaining the country-specific coefficients, which help to achieve unbiased and consistent estimators. In the panel data, another problem is the problem of heterogeneity in the long-run variance, and cointegrated panel and FMOLS and DOLS with the help of their weighted criteria can also control the problem of heterogeneity.",

We used trade and digitization as our independent variables in empirical analysis. Trade openness can affect health through economic growth and technology transfer (26) . ICT can improve health outcomes by reducing poverty alleviation, geographical constraints and improving knowledge diffusion and economic development (25) . The trade variable is measured via imports and exports, and digitization is measured through the internet. The trade variable is measured as a proportion of imports and exports to GDP.

This discloses the existence of cross-sectional dependence among economies. The study applied a cross-sectional dependence test developed by Pesaran (32) . In the presence of crosssectional dependence, conventional panel unit root tests provide insignificant and ineffective results. In this regard, the applied IPS and LLC methods for the purpose of panel unit root testing. Table 2 displays the outcomes of the cross-sectional dependence test, and Table 3 shows the findings of panel unit root and cointegration tests.

            "text": "In Table 4 , group-wise estimates of FMOLS reveal that trade liberalization exerts a significant and negative impact on infant mortality, and a positive and significant impact on life expectancy. The coefficient estimates reveal that a 1% increase in trade liberalization leads to a 2.000% decline in infant mortality and a 0.670% increase in life expectancy. Our study showed that trade liberalization contributes significantly to reducing the infant mortality rate and improves life expectancy in selected Asian economies. These findings are in line with previous studies (26, 33, 34) . Trade liberalization can affect public health through technology transfer, more specifically importing processed foods and pharmaceutical products. Studies reveal that trade liberalization can influence public health through several pathways. Trade liberalization generates high income that contributes to economic development. Higher incomes help people buy nutrition, foods, prevention & treatment for disease, clean water access and raise living standards through better housing (35) . Trade contributes significantly to technology transfer that influences public health through pharmaceutical R&D (36) . It infers that public health can improve from developed technological innovation in pharmaceuticals and medical treatment through imports. Thus, the linkage between health outcomes and trade openness can activate through drugs and medical supplies, immunization rates, population, health expenditures, and income (33) . Another benefit of trade liberalization is that it upsurges associations between economies and transfers knowledge regarding standard health practices and disease treatments, raising health programs and their related organization (33) . In terms of digitalization, internet use also has a significant and negative impact on infant mortality and produces a significant and positive impact on life expectancy. It is obvious from coefficient estimates that a 1% increase in the use of the internet tends to reduce infant mortality by 2.980% and increase life expectancy by 2.000%. The general meaning of these findings is that the internet can help promote public health in Asian economies. ICT, whether internet or mobile, is an important source to spread the knowledge related to different diseases and their remedies as well. Moreover, any new research related to the field of medical science done in developed economies can be disseminated to developing economies quickly with the help of the internet and cellular services. Internet and mobile technologies have connected people from all around the globe, and people in the developing world are now aware of the health care facilities available in the developed economies; thus, the demand for good health care facilities is also on the rise in developing economies (37) . Over the last three decades, the growth of ICT has been witnessed, and it has exerted a positive impact on almost every sector of the economy, and health is not an exception. The availability of doctors has increased, and people can consult doctors online. Even the physical trip of a patient has been made easier by the ICT because they can make appointments online and save a lot of time. Online lectures and courses regarding medical care programs have become popular and support the speedy diffusion of medical-related knowledge. ICT can be utilized to raise the level of awareness, and health literacy among the people, which would be beneficial in improving the health status. Bukachi and Pakenham-Walsh (20) and Bankole (38) pointed out that hospital staff can use the ICT as a source of communication and a vital channel through which they can spread health care programs worldwide and form a global partnership against ailments. The impacts of GDP and public health expenditure are negative and significant on infant mortality and positive and significant on life expectancy. The study also reports the findings of the DOLS model for confirming the robustness of the results. Almost all the coefficient estimates of DOLS models are quite similar to the findings of FMOLS models except public health expenditure in the life expectancy model.",

It is observed that trade and digitization should remain important tools, not just for economic purposes but also for improving health globally. Trade and digitization have been long debated at the center of policy. Aside from their impacts on economic growth, trade and digitization policies could leave an important mark on health. This study investigates the impact of trade and digitization on health in a sample of 12 Asian economies for a time period ranging from 1991 to 2018. The study used infant mortality and life expectancy variables to measure health. We applied the panel technique to investigate the regional and economy-wise estimates empirically.",

Subsequently, trade and digitization have a significant positive impact on life expectancy, revealing in the long run. The findings of control variables demonstrate that GDP and health expenditure have a significant negative effect on infant mortality in the long run. The findings also infer that GDP and health expenditure play a significant role in enhancing life expectancy in Asian economies. The economy-wise results show that trade had a significant negative impact on infant mortality in China, India, Japan, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. At the same time, the internet exerts a significant negative impact on infant mortality in China, Japan, Indonesia, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines. Trade exerts a significant positive impact on life expectancy in eight of the economies and exerts a significant negative influence in only one economy. However, the internet has a significant positive impact on life expectancy in just nine of the economies.",

Authorities should include health professionals in future trade agreements and negotiations to help public health. Asian countries should remove import duties and trade barriers on health-related products. To improve the health of the Asian people, more free trade is needed, not less. Policymakers need to redesign economic policies which ensure inclusive ICT usage in society because it improves health by improving health literacy and information, health care services, and communication between patients and health care systems. Asian policymakers should increase ICT investments to improve population health. Policymakers and authorities should bring comprehensive trade and technology policies that reduce human suffering from COVID-pandemic.",
