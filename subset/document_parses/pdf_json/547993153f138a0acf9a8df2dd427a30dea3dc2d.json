To contain the spread of its contagious effect, India imposed a stringent lockdown, and then the stringency was relaxed to some extent in its succeeding phases. We measure social benefits of the lockdown in terms of improved air quality in Indian cities by quantifying the effects with city-specific slope coefficients. We find that the containment measures have resulted in improvement in air quality, but it is not uniform across cities and across pollutants. The level of PM 2.5 decreases from about 6 to 25% in many cities. Moreover, we observe that partial relaxations do not help in resuming economic and social activities. It should also be noted that counter-virus measures could not bring levels of the emissions to WHO standards; it highlights the importance of role of green production and consumption activities.",

Spotted in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has infected almost every country around the globe since then. The contagion has created a conflict between human-health and economic well-being. Governments have to resort to unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as complete lockdown of cities, among others, to contain the spread of the virus. India went for complete lockdown of the whole country (Yoo and Managi 2020) . While there are enormous social and economic costs of enforcing these measures (Purcel 2020) , there could be some unintentional social benefits in terms of improved environmental quality. About 900 deaths are linked to hardships of containment measures imposed during the lockdown in India. 1 Increased incidences of mortality and morbidity are associated with decreasing air quality (Brauer 2010) . Globally, 4.6 million deaths annually could be attributed to illness and diseases related to air pollution . Indian cities seriously suffer from air pollution; they are among the worst polluted cities in the world. About 1.25 million deaths are attributed to air pollution in 2017 in the country (Balakrishnan et al. 2019) . 114,700 deaths from the five causes (IHD, Stroke, COPD, LRI, and LNC) could be attributed to PM 2.5 exposure in 29 million-plus Indian cities using integrated exposure response model (Saini and Sharma 2020) . 2 The first COVID-19 case was marked on January 30, 2020 in India. The Government of India initiated serious containment measures in March 2020 after its declaration as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Following some European countries, India initially imposed a complete lockdown on the entire country for 21 days beginning on March 25, 2020. The lockdown was further extended to May 31, 2020 in different phases. In the successive extensions of lockdown beginning April 20, 2020, some relaxations in performing economic activities was provided in staggered manner. Therefore, it is expected that in the later phases of lockdown, the realized benefits of improved air quality might have reversed to some extent. It is worth to note that terms and conditions of the lockdown were common throughout the country, but differentiated enforcement might have produced differing impact on air quality across cities. We measure the extent of heterogeneous improvement in air quality in Indian cities caused by the containment measures.",

Jain and Sharma (2020) study the effect of first phase of the lockdown using information for criteria pollutants for five big cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru and Kolkata. Similarly, using observational data for 22 cities between March 16 and April 14, Sharma et al. (2020) conclude that strict air quality control plans works even in the presence of unfavorable meteorology. Attributing the entire improvement in air quality to lockdown could be misleading. Variation in the level of pollutants is governed by meteorological and socio-economic factors. Meteorological factors such as temperature and wind-speed are negatively associated with the concentration of criteria pollutants (Jain and Sharma 2020) . Also note that these earlier studies are confined to the effect of first phase of the lockdown on air quality.",

Similarly, using quasi-experimental difference-indifference approach, He et al. (2020) find that in Chinese cities air quality improved remarkably as a result of counter COVID-19 measures. Stringency of the lockdown differs between countries and within countries over time and space. In India, the stringency varies from 100points in first phase of lockdown to 79-points in the fourth phase of the lockdown, and the enforcement also varies across states or cities.

Ahmedabad, Indore, and Jodhpur has only one monitoring stations. There are 10 monitoring stations in Bengaluru. 6 To contain the spread of COVID-19 contagion, governments across countries imposed differing restrictions on the functioning of social and economic activities. Hale et al. (2020a) introduced an index known as OxCGRT providing a systematic track of government responses to COVID-19 across countries and time. They use 8 ordinal indicators in the making of this index: school closing, workplace closing, cancel public events, restrictions of gathering size, close public transport, stay at home requirements, restrictions on internal movements and restrictions on international travel. The index value varies from zero to 100; zero indicating no restrictions and the score of 100 signals complete lockdown. Hale et al. (2020b) provide the index data. 7 Table 1 provides average levels of criteria pollutants and OxCGRT index for the prelockdown period and during various phases of the lockdown. We consider the period of March 1-24, 2020 as pre-lockdown period. The average value of OxCGRT index for the prelockdown period was 41.5, which increased to a score of 100 for first phase of the lockdown. In later phases of the lockdown, the average score reduced to 96, 82 and 79 for second, third and fourth phase of the lockdown, respectively, demonstrating presence of some relaxations for resuming non-essential economic activities. Table 1 shows that the movement in average levels of criteria pollutants during various phases of the lockdown also. We observe that average level of each of the criteria pollutants declined significantly relative to pre-lockdown phase. But in later phases of the lockdown, we observe that the change in average levels relative to its preceding phase is not much different. In second phase relative to first phase, increase in the average levels of pollutants is not statistically significant, but decrease in average level for the pollutants of SO 2 and CO is significant. Similarly, we find that in fourth phase relative to third phase, increase in the levels of PM 10 and CO is statistically significant, but the change in average levels for other pollutants is not statistically significant. Table 2 shows heterogeneity in average level of PM 2.5 across cities during various phases of the lockdown.",

We find that in case of most of the pollutants in many cities the relaxation could not raise the level of emissions but the emissions further declined. It implies that though officially some relaxations were provided for resuming selected non-essential activities, but the enforcement of the lockdown was more stringent or people were not ready to take advantage of the relaxations due to fear of the virus. However, in some cities such as Nasik, Pune and Indore, the level of PM 2.5 emissions increased relative to first phase of the lockdown by 19, 6, and 13% respectively. In phase three of the lockdown, the restrictions were further lower down to 82 (Table 1) . In third phase relative to second phase, we find mixed results. In some cities, the emissions are further declining even through there are relaxations in the restrictions. For example, in the cities of Thane, Sholapur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Chennai, Kolkata, we find that a further decline in the level of most of criteria pollutants in this phase ( Fig. 2c and Appendix Table 7 ).

To contain the contagious effect of COVID-19 countries have adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions, essentially restricting economic activities. These counter-virus measures cause enormous costs in terms of socio-economic factors on the one hand; on the other they are supposed to be socially beneficial in terms of improved air or environmental quality. India imposed the most stringent lockdown in the world with a score of 100-opoints of OxCGRT index. The lockdown remained in force for more than 2 months; in later phases some relaxations were provided for resuming economic activities. The lockdown costs Indian economy and society enormously in terms of income and employment losses; there were more than 900 deaths caused by the lockdown hardships. This paper made an attempt to measure social benefits of the lockdown in terms of improved air quality in Indian cities that are most affected by the pandemic.",

Moreover, the results suggest that level of air pollution will increase again when the businesses go back to normal. We should also note that levels of the emissions are significantly higher in comparison to WHO standards during the lockdown periods.
