COVID-19 has become a global pandemic affecting people around the world and causing mortality in 0.5%-3% of infected individuals (2) . The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and radiographic evidence of viral pneumonia (2) . In addition, COVID-19 has been associated with a hypercoagulable milieu leading to thrombosis, particularly pulmonary embolism (3). These thrombotic events have been reported in patients without any known risk factors (4). We report our first case of COVID-19 associated with portal vein thrombosis.",
