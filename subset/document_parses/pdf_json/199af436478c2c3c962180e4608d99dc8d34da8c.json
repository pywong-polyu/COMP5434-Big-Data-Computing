            "text": "Despite the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological control of the virus is still challenging due to slow vaccine rollouts, incomplete vaccine protection to current and emerging variants, and unwillingness to get vaccinated. Therefore, frequent testing of individuals to identify early SARS-CoV-2 infections, contact-tracing and isolation strategies remain crucial to mitigate viral spread. Here, we describe WHotLAMP, a rapid molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. WHotLAMP is simple to use, highly sensitive (3.6 viral RNA copies per microliter of saliva) and specific, as well as inexpensive, making it ideal for frequent screening. Moreover, WHotLAMP does not require harsh chemicals or specialized equipment and thus can be performed in point-of-care settings, and may also be adapted for resource-limited environments or home use. While applied here to SARS-CoV-2, WHotLAMP can be easily modified to detect other pathogens, making it adaptable for other diagnostic assays, including for use in future outbreaks.",

Several protocols to detect SARS-CoV-2 from saliva have been described 28, 39 .

Inspired by work from Liu et al. 42 , we sought to develop an inexpensive, sensitive and simplified test that did not require potentially dangerous chemicals, and would be suitable for frequent use at POC and adaptable for home use. We initially tested saliva spiked with naked SARS-CoV-2 control RNA and found that a short exposure of Whatman No. 1 filter paper to saliva, followed by brief washes, could capture sufficient SARS-CoV-2 control RNA to be detected in a LAMP reaction with primers directed against SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1A) . Amplification of the target sequence leads to a drop in pH, which is detected with a pHsensitive dye as a color change from pink (negative) to yellow (positive) 32 . We next tested whether we could capture encapsulated SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles that were spiked into saliva, using Whatman paper and an established lysis buffer 40 . This procedure can detect as few as ~4 SARS-CoV-2 particles per \u03bcL of saliva ( Figure 1B) . This level of sensitivity is notable, as it has been determined that 90% of COVID-19 patients carry more than 5 copies of SARS-CoV-2 per \u03bcL of saliva 28, 38 . These findings suggest that a strategy using Whatman paper is a viable approach for isolating RNA from SARS-CoV-2 virions in saliva.",

In this test, viral RNA is preserved using a non-hazardous RNA stabilizing solution and is extracted by a brief Proteinase K digestion. Heating the sample at 95 o C inactivates both Proteinase K and SARS-CoV-2 virions 43 , thereby increasing the biosafety of the sample. It was critical to include a wash step to remove both RNAlater solution and saliva that were soaked up by the filter paper, as well as particulates bound to the filter paper. We designed LAMP primer sets throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome (see Methods), and focused on the primer set (ZI-1, targeting ORF 1a) with the lowest predicted propensity for primer-dimer formation. To evaluate the specificity of the ZI-1 primers, we tested a panel of 22 inactivated respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-1, MERS, H1N1 influenza, and common respiratory coronaviruses. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples containing encapsulated SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles, but not in samples containing only the other respiratory pathogens ( Figure 2B-E) , indicating that the primers were specific to SARS-CoV-2.",

Through interpolation to a standard curve (R 2 = 0.99) using a dilution series of a standard (IDT N-gene), we determined that the LoD of WHotLAMP with ZI-1 primers corresponds to ~3.6 viral RNA copies/\u03bcL saliva.

Its low false-positive rate allows for deployment under conditions of low prevalence, where a high test specificity is particularly important to achieve high positive predictive values. The current assay design is already applicable to test at POC settings. Moreover, its single-tube format that requires no centrifugation, is conducive to scaling to 96-well formats, but can also be adapted for home use for frequent self-administered monitoring.
