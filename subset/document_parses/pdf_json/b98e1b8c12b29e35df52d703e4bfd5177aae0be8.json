Due to the rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact, it is paramount to find effective treatments against it. Human neutralizing antibodies are an effective method to fight viral infection. However, the recent discovery of new strains that substantially change the S-protein sequence has raised concern about vaccines and antibodies' effectiveness. Here, using molecular simulations, we investigated the binding mechanisms between the S-protein and several antibodies. Multiple mutations were included to understand the strategies for antibody escape in new variants. We found that the combination of mutations K417N, E484K, L452R, and T478K produced higher binding energy to ACE2 than the wild type, suggesting higher efficiency to enter host cells. The mutations' effect depends on the antibody class. While Class I enhances the binding avidity in the presence of N501Y mutation, class II antibodies showed a sharp decline in the binding affinity. Our simulations suggest that Class I antibodies will remain effective against the new strains. In contrast, Class II antibodies will have less affinity to the S-protein, potentially affecting these antibodies' efficiency.",

The up level serves as the basis to expose the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 protein for binding to the receptor.

Subsequently, the S-protein undergoes large conformational changes to expose its fusion peptide to diffuse through the cell's lipid membrane for posterior fusion 9 . It is known that SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via at least two different mechanisms 10,11 , i.e., via endocytosis 10,12-14 , or direct fusion to the cell membrane assisted by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) 10 .

For instance, Barnes and co-workers 18 have classified hNAbs relative to their binding strategy and have elucidated four antibody classes. Class I describes all antibodies that link to the RBD in the up configuration. This antibody corresponds to the gene VH3-53 and blocks the binding to the ACE2 receptors.

Class II groups all antibodies that link to the RBD motif blocking the binding with the ACE2 receptor in the up and down configurations.

For instance, the discovery of rapidly spreading new SARS-CoV-2 lineages with mutations in the S-protein, particularly in its RBD, has raised concerns among the health authorities and scientific community. These variants of concern have motivated the experimental study of the effect of mutations in the S protein on the binding energy of ACE2 receptors and in hNAbs. Even though deep mutational scanning can be used to investigate the effect of the mutations on antibody response, the molecular mechanisms for antibody binding and escape cannot be understand using these techniques 17, 21, [29] [30] [31] [32] . Moreover, it is also unknown if the new strains propagate faster due to an easier attachment to the receptors or other biological factors. Finally, the different hNAbs classes' detailed binding mechanisms remain unavailable. This information is vital because it can enable researchers to understand what type of antibodies are more efficacious to bind to the S-protein and aid effective therapeutics with antibodies against COVID19. Molecular simulations can be used to answer some of these questions and identify key molecular binding mechanisms between SARS-CoV-2's new strains and hNAbs. This information can be used to understand how viral mutations impact vaccine developed immunity and to generate treatments that are robust against virus evolution 17, 29 .",

We also noted that the binding energy between WT RBD and ACE2 receptor is close to reported values reported in literature.

The RMSF is shown in Fig. 1b ,c for = 0 and 3 nm, respectively. The shaded zones represent residues in contact with ACE2. We observed that there were only Table 1 . Details of the simulations used in this work, including the antibody name and PDB file used in the simulations. Total number of atoms in the simulation includes the proteins, and solvent used in the different simulations. Number of Cl \u2212 ions used to balance the charge in the simulations. The Class of the antibodies is also specified. The symbols indicate whether the antibody links to the RBD in the up ( \u2191 ), up/down ( \u2191\u2193 ), or up/ down from the side ( \u2191\u2193\u2190 ). The last three columns indicate if the antibody was modeled with mutations MT1: N501Y, MT2: E484K, N501Y, and MT3: K417N, E484K, N501Y. For other residues, the RMSF remained lower around 0.1 nm. The agreement in the RMSF is remarkable, despite having used different models. The higher binding energy between RBD containing MT2 and MT3 can be explained by analyzing the residues in contact. Besides having fewer contacts, MT2, MT3 and \u03b4 have a considerably larger binding energy than WT and MT1. We observed the introduction of K417N eliminates the salt bridge between RBD (K417) and ACE2 (D30). The introduction of E484K generated another one between K484 and E35 in ACE2. When looked carefully, we observed that the distances between the new bridge are much smaller ( \u223c 0.13 nm for MT3 compared with \u223c 0.3 nm in the MT1, see Tables S1-S4). The significantly lower distance makes stronger bonds, explaining the higher binding affinity between MT2-3 and ACE2.",

The WT S-protein and the three mutations MT1, 2, and 3 were included in the analysis. Let us first describe the residues in contact between the WT S-protein and the hNAbs shown in Fig. 2a . The red letters correspond to the amino acid residues in contact with the different hNAbs. The underlined letters show the positions of the mutation. Figure 2b shows the location of these residues in the RBD for each antibody with the locations of the selected mutations placed on the RBD. We observed that the mutations were placed on strategic locations of the S-sequence, with the only unaffected binding site unaltered for C135. In particular, K417 generated interactions with three antibodies (B38, C102, C144), E484 interacted with two antibodies in Class II (P2B-2F6 and C144). In contrast, N501 interacted with Class I hNAbs (B38 and C102). The analysis allowed us to strategically make simulations with the mutated RBD with antibodies as detailed in Table 1 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Let us now focus on the analysis of the binding energy between Class I hNAbs and the RBD. As shown in Fig. 2c , the binding energy between the WT and B38 increased to \u223c 66 \u00b1 3.3 kJ mol \u22121 when all contacts were lost at approximately = 1.5 nm (see Fig. S1b ). For MT1 and MT3 the last contacts were lost around = 2.0 nm reaching a maximum PMF value of \u223c 84 \u00b1 4.4 , and \u223c 114 \u00b1 4.4 kJ \u00b7 mol \u22121 , respectively.

Like B38, MT1 increased the binding energy for C102. However, the combination in MT3 significantly reduced the binding energy to levels below those found for the WT and ACE2. Thus, while C102 remained active under MT1 (e.g., B.1.1.7 strain), it might lose efficiency against MT3 (e.g., B.1.351 strain). An evolution of the PMF for C102 is shown in Fig. S1c .",

The binding energies and PMF are shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S1d ,e, respectively. The binding energy between the WT S-protein and P2B-2F6 was measured to be \u223c 77.7 \u00b1 2.4 kJ mol \u22121 . The significantly higher binding energy compared with the ACE2 receptor indicates a strong binding configuration-as denoted in the PMF plot shown in Fig. S1d -and illustrates why P2B-2F6 is a potent hNAb. On the other hand, we observed that MT2-which includes mutation E484K-had a deleterious effect on the binding energy for P2B-2F6, reducing it to \u223c 51 \u00b1 2.3 kJ mol \u22121 . This reduction of the binding energy \u2212due to removing a salt bridge between RBD and P2B-2F6 (see next section)-rendered the antibody much less effective to bind to the S-protein. The 'x' symbol indicates that the binding energy was not computed for that combination since the mutation did not affect the binding residues. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ For C144, another Class II hNAb, we found a similar behavior. The binding energy between WT RBD and C144 was \u223c 76.1 \u00b1 5.25 kJ mol \u22121 , and the PMF (see Fig. 2d; Fig. S1e ) was characterized by a strong binding configuration. The similar binding level between WT and Class II hNAbs was remarkable. It illustrates why these types of antibodies were effective against WT SARS-CoV-2. However, the impact of the mutations was drastic for C144. We observed that both MT2 and MT3 produced harmful effects on the binding of the antibody and S-protein. The binding energy was reduced to minimum levels of 41 \u00b1 3.9 and 33.5 \u00b1 3.9 kJ mol \u22121 for MT2 and MT3, respectively. Unfortunately, the severe reduction in the binding energy suggests that C144 will not be effective against the S-protein's mutated version (e.g., against the B.1.351 strain).",

The lesser number of contacts found in C102 explains the lower binding energy for C102 compared with B38.

We also observed no overlap between residues in Class III and Class I-II, suggesting that combined strategies for neutralization are possible. C135 uses seven residues (five in the HC and two in the LC) to bind to five residues in the RBD (see Table S25 and inset in Fig. 4 ). All these bonds were H-bonds, without any salt bridges. However, since the mechanism for detaching is due to sliding on the surfaces of the RBD, it generated long-lasting contacts (and even new ones-e.g., G97 with T345 and R346 with E50\u2212 as shown in Table S25 ).

            "text": "We have investigated the mechanisms and strategies for antibody binding and escape in SARS-CoV-2. On the one hand, analysis of the WT and MT1 of the RBD and the ACE2 receptor indicated that the binding energy remains at similar levels and between our simulations' margin error. On the other hand, for MT2, MT3, and \u03b4 RBD versions involving mutations K417N, L452R, E484K, T478K, and N501Y, the binding energy increased compared to the WT. This observation suggests that the strains B.1.351 36 and B.1.617.2 37 could have a better binding avidity with the ACE2 receptor and better effectivity to enter host cells than the WT virus. This observation seems to agree with recent works where the effect of the mutations have been analyzed. In particular, several experimental works using mutated RBD have shown a more pronounced effect of the mutation E484 17 16, 17 reported that the binding between SARS2 and ACE2 increases when the following mutations K417N, E484K, L452R, T478K, and N501Y are present, in good agreement with our findings. We also observed that the mutations increased the RMSF near the mutation zone, suggesting more motion of the residues near the mutation. The larger values of the RMSF indicate contacts that are on and off at the interface in the mutated versions. However, the biological effects on the overall higher RMSF near residue #501 are unclear since larger fluctuations leads to more exposure of the residues. The binding mechanisms between RBD and hNAbs are vast, and various classes of antibodies use different strategies. Based on our study, Class II and III hNAbs were the most effective to bind to the WT RBD. Considering that Class II and III link to different RBD areas, therapeutics strategies combining Class II and III could be very effective to stop viral infection as suggested by others 18 . Unfortunately, we observed that Class II hNAbs show a sharp decline in the binding energy to MT2 and MT3 and are due to two main factors. First, the loss of the salt bridge made by residue E484 and Class II hNAbs that use gene VH3-53 as a germline (and the same strategy has been seen for P2B-2F6 that is different gene). Second, the reduced number of contacts between Class II and RBD (see Tables S21-S23 ) makes the binding energy decay to low levels. This renders Class II antibodies inefficient to bind to the RBD. This observation suggests that Class II hNAbs are less effective in binding to the S-proteins within the B.1.351 strain 17, 30, 42, 43, 45, 46 . The results are in agreement with experimental observations. For instance, recent experimental work on mutated RBD with E484K has shown a 100-1000 fold increase in antibody dose for C144 17, 30 . This effect is more drastic in C144 since it uses the HC to make contact with the RBD, while P2B-2F6 uses both the HC and LC (see Fig. 3c,d) . A key contribution of our work is that, in addition to be in close agreement with the aforementioned experimental works, it provides a molecular explanation for the mechanisms of binding between RBD and hNAbs, that is not available through current experimental works 17, 30, 42, 43, [47] [48] [49] [50] .",

The binding energy between B38 and C102 had different behavior when analyzed with MT3. B38 had shown higher binding energy 114 kJ mol \u22121 . On the other hand, C102 showed binding energy significantly below the value found for the ACE2 receptor and MT3, indicating less effectivity to bind to the mutated S-protein.

            "text": "Our all-atom MD simulations also have several limitations. For instance, to reduce the computational cost, only part of the S-protein was modeled in this work. Previous studies have shown minor differences in the PMF plot for one single RBD and the full trimeric S-protein 6 . In our study, we have also ignored glycans that attach to the S-protein and can help in the binding to receptors/hNAbs. For instance, Watanabe et al. 52 reported a highly glycosylated S-protein with 22 glycans. They reported that the vast majority of these glycands were mainly placed outside the RBD, with the exception of two glycans located at residues 331 and 343, and this has been used to investigate their role in shielding and modulating the conformational dynamics of the RBD 53 . As shown in Fig. 2a , the only hNAbs that is close to these residues, is C135, while others are far way from these residues. Thus, it is unlikely that the glycans have a large impact on the PMF reported in this study, as the interactions between molecules are short range. Additionally, the mutated RBD has been modeled, but cryoEM mutated molecular structures can differ from those used in this work. As far as the authors are concerned, there is not cryoEM of mutated RBD available yet. Differences in the geometry could affect the equilibrium position and, thus, change the energy path. While these limitations can change the actual values found in this work, the mechanisms for molecular binding will remain mostly unaffected and our conclusions will be unaffected.",

Of tremendous interest, we found that Class III hNAbs \u2212that link in the up and down states outside the RBD motif\u2212 have the largest binding energy to the wild type (WT) RBD ( \u223c 80 kJ mol \u22121 ). Class II antibodies, that link in the up and down states in the WT RBD motif, followed ( \u223c 75 \u2212 80 kJ mol \u22121 ). Class I hNAbs produced slightly smaller binding energies ( \u223c 60 \u2212 70 kJ mol \u22121 ). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ These binding energy levels are well separated between different classes and all hNAbs produced similar or higher binding energies than the RBD/ACE2 receptor ( 66.9 \u00b1 3.7 kJ mol \u22121 ) 6 . We also investigated the effect of mutated S-proteins. We found that mutation N501Y marginally enhanced the binding energy between RBD and ACE2, while mutations MT2 (E484K/N501Y) MT3 (K417N/E484K/ N501Y), and \u03b4 (L452R/T478K) enhanced the binding avidity between RBD and ACE2. This result could help to partially explain the rapid propagation of the B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and \u03b4 strains in different parts of the world. We also investigated the mutations' effect on the binding affinity to several hNAbs, including B38, C102 (Class I), P2B-2F6, and C144 (Class II). The impact of the mutations is antibody-dependent. However, in general, we found less affinity between mutated S-protein and these antibodies, except for B38. Of particular interest, Class II antibodies showed a sharp decrease in their binding energy when mutations MT2-3 were simulated. This result indicates a much lower efficiency to stop the viral infection. Future directions of this work include the computational modeling of hNAbs with better binding affinity to the mutated RBD using data-based approaches and the estimation of antibody dose using mechanistic models.",
