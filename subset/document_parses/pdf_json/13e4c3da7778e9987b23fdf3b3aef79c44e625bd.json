The potential use of estimands to improve trial research and reporting has been underpinned by the recent publication of the ICH E9(R1) Addendum on the use of estimands in clinical trials in 2019. We set out to assess how well estimands are described in published trial protocols. Methods: We reviewed 50 trial protocols published in October 2020 in Trials and BMJ Open. For each protocol, we determined whether the estimand for the primary outcome was explicitly stated, not stated but inferable (i.e. could be constructed from the information given), or not inferable. Results: None of the 50 trials explicitly described the estimand for the primary outcome, and in 74% of trials, it was impossible to infer the estimand from the information included in the protocol. The population attribute of the estimand could not be inferred in 36% of trials, the treatment condition attribute in 20%, the population-level summary measure in 34%, and the handling of intercurrent events in 60% (the strategy for handling non-adherence was not inferable in 32% of protocols, and the strategy for handling mortality was not inferable in 80% of the protocols for which it was applicable). Conversely, the outcome attribute was stated for all trials. In 28% of trials, three or more of the five estimand attributes could not be inferred.",

However, readers might be surprised to learn this effect does not represent what they might expect, namely the anticipated benefit of cabazitaxel if introduced as part of usual care. Instead, it is an estimate of what the treatment effect is expected to be in the hypothetical setting where men with metastatic prostate cancer never experience disease progression or death. This is due to a quirk of the study methods: first, investigators stopped collecting quality of life data after patients experienced disease progression, and so data after progression was set to missing (as was data for patients who had died), and secondly, they then analysed the available data using a repeated-measures mixed-model, which implicitly imputed what the missing data would have been had patients been alive and not progressed [2] .",

This lack of clarity is particularly problematic, as even with expert statistical knowledge, it can be challenging to understand what treatment effect is being estimated ( Table 1 ). Many factors can change the interpretation of estimated treatment effects in subtle ways, including the trial design [7] [8] [9] , how the data are analysed [10] [11] [12] [13] , and how issues such as treatment discontinuation or treatment switching are handled [14] [15] [16] . A reader might reasonably expect that if a protocol indicates the analysis population includes all randomised participants, then the resulting treatment effect should equally apply to all participants. However, this is not necessarily the case; some statistical methods will include all randomised participants in the analysis, but the treatment effect will only apply to a subset of participants (e.g. complier-average causal effects are undertaken on the full trial population, but apply only to the subset of participants who would comply under either treatment strategy [17] ). The converse can also be true, where some patients may be excluded from the analysis, and yet the estimated treatment effect still applies to the entire trial population under certain assumptions [18] .",

An estimand is a precise description of the treatment effect to be estimated (i.e. it can be thought of as the precise question that the analysis method is trying to answer). It involves specification of five attributes: (i) population of interest, (ii) treatment conditions to be compared, (iii) outcome measure of interest, (iv) population-level summary measure denoting how outcomes under different treatment conditions will be compared (e.g. by a risk ratio, odds ratio, or difference in proportions), and (v) how intercurrent events not addressed in aspects (i)-(iii), which may affect the interpretation or the existence of outcome data, such as treatment discontinuation, use of rescue medication, or death, will be handled. Importantly, these five attributes are defined in relation to the treatment effect we want to estimate and are distinct from how these attributes may be handled in the actual statistical analysis (for instance, our population of interest for the estimand may be all trial participants, even though our statistical analysis may exclude participants with missing data [18] ).",

However, despite the publication of the draft ICH E9 Addendum in 2017 and the final version in 2019, we found no evidence of uptake in our review of protocols published in October 2020. No protocols referenced the ICH E9(R1) Addendum, used the term \"estimand\", or attempted to formally describe the estimand for their primary outcome. Further, in 74% of trials, there was not enough information to infer the estimand, leaving it unclear as to what precise treatment effect the trial was estimating. The one attribute which was well described was the outcome, which was mentioned as part of the trial's objectives in each of the 50 protocols. However, none of the other four attributes was explicitly described in any protocols, and there was often insufficient information to infer them. In particular, the handling of intercurrent events could not be inferred in 60% of protocols. The main reasons for this were that it was often not stated how intercurrent events would be handled in the analysis or it was simply stated that participants with intercurrent events would be excluded, but with no clarification as to whether a hypothetical or principal stratum approach was intended. In particular, the handling of mortality was very poorly described. Of the 16 trials in which mortality was a potential intercurrent event but was not part of a composite outcome, none of them described how it would be handled in the analysis. This was likely driven by the fact that a treatment policy strategy cannot be used for mortality (as the relevant outcome data no longer exist), and so handling of mortality must be explicitly stated in the text, instead of being inferred based on an intention-to-treat analysis, as Unclear how mortality will be handled in the analysis 16/16 (100%) can be done for other (non-truncating) intercurrent events, such as treatment discontinuation or use of rescue medication.",

In fact, many statisticians may not fully understand the mechanics behind the methods they use. As such, understanding of what treatment effects are being estimated by the people using the trial results is likely to be lower than what we have found here.",

However, the implication of this analytical choice is to estimate the effect of treatment in the hypothetical setting where patients do not die. Although in some cases this may be what investigators want to estimate, in many cases, it is not, and so the use of estimands can help them to assess whether their planned analysis approach corresponds to the desired treatment effect.",

The ICH E9(R1) Addendum was a collaboration between global regulatory bodies and the pharmaceutical industry and was aimed primarily at pharmaceutical trials being used for regulatory submissions. Our review contained mostly academic trials, and there are, to our knowledge, no current guidelines aimed at academic trials that promote the use of estimands. As such, many academic trialists may simply be unaware of the concept of estimands (although it should be noted that none of the four industrysponsored trials in our review did not report the Reason not inferable (n = 3)",

It is also likely that some of the protocols included in our review were written before the final ICH E9(R1) Addendum was published and have not been updated since. However, this does not explain the poor description of the methods which meant we could not infer the estimand in almost three quarters of protocols. Further, Mitroiu et al. [23] reviewed documents relating to applications for drug authorisations to determine how well estimands were described and which strategies to handle intercurrent events were being used. They found that the estimand was rarely explicitly described and usually had to be inferred based on the statistical methods section and other parts of the protocol. They also found there was often a mismatch between the estimand strategies being used and those recommended by disease guidelines.",
