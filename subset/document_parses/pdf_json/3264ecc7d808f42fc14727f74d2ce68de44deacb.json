[2] [3] [4] The pandemic has nevertheless had huge impact on the lives of patients with rheumatic diseases. Fear of infection has reduced well-being and impacted daily activities including self-isolation strategies. 5 6 Lock-down and lower access to counselling at the rheumatology clinics potentially cause misconceptions regarding medication risk and may induce self-protecting strategies such as non-adherence to DMARDs. 5 7-9 Previous studies of behavioural changes by the use of questionnaire or telephone interview have so far been fairly small (<500-900 patients), monocentric or with low response rates. Few have aimed to identify risk factors for anxiety and selfisolation (eg, diagnosis, gender, age, DMARD use, socioeconomic status), 5 and behavioural changes from the initial phase in March 2020 to the gradual reopening of society are unexplored. 9 To understand the full impact of the pandemic on rheumatologic patients, such knowledge is needed to identify risk groups that may need specific information or guidance.",

In the following, the first period is denoted March and the later period June 2020. Although SARS-CoV-2 is the infectious agent causing the COVID-19 disease, the term 'COVID-19' was used in the questionnaire in alignment with the terminology used in the media. The questionnaire was developed in collaboration with four patient representatives. The full Danish version is available on request. The invitations were sent during week 21 (May 2020), and reminders to non-respondents during week 24 (June). Response was allowed until 1 July 2020.

            "text": "The study had challenges to be addressed. Previously, patients entered their patient-reported outcomes (PROs) into DANBIO using touch screens in the rheumatology clinics. As part of the present project, an online solution for routinely reporting PROs from home was implemented, which patients were not familiar with. This may have affected response rates. We have previously reported that online reporting of PROs from home versus in the clinic is valid. 14 Recall bias regarding the initial phase in March-April cannot be excluded, because the questionnaire was distributed in May-June where society was gradually reopening. This could potentially cause underreporting of medication compliance. Selection bias was a risk, since fewer eligible younger patients (\u226439 years) participated. Furthermore, elderly patients with comorbidities and lack of IT competences were underrepresented due to no access to the E-boks system. On the other hand, more than 500 patients above 80 years of age participated in the study. It could also be speculated if patients with more anxiety and self-isolation were more motivated to answer the questionnaire.",

Among risk factors were female gender, not working, current bDMARD treatment, having comorbidities and poor quality of life. Medication compliance was high, but fear of COVID-19 was the main reason for nonadherence in the early phase of the pandemic. Attention to anxiety and self-isolation is important during the ongoing pandemic.",
