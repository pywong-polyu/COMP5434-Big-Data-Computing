By the end of the year more than seventy-seven million cases of COVID-19 had been reported around the globe. Due to it being a highly contagious disease, the recommended measures adopted by most nations to prevent infection include social distancing and quarantine. How did these measures affect people's relationship with alcohol consumption in cultures where alcohol plays an important social role? A questionnaire-based study, designed to follow the drinking behaviour of people before and during lockdown was applied to two different cultural groups impacted by the pandemic during the strict phase of lockdown. These are the British and Spanish populations (179 participants from each country were interviewed). Considering the frequency of consumption of the alcoholic beverages evaluated (wine, beer, cider, whisky and spirits), the results showed that a significant lockdown*country interaction was observed. Overall, Spanish participants consumed alcoholic beverages less frequently during lockdown than before, while British participants reported no change in their consumption habits. Spaniards' decrease in alcohol consumption is related to the absence of a social contexts while Britons seems to have adapted their consumption to the modified context. Results suggest that, alcohol consumption is a central core of the British culture, while for the Spanish, socialization is more a cultural characteristic than the alcohol itself.",

            "text": "Paradoxically, exactly hundred years ago, at the beginning of the 1920 s, the world also experienced drastic changes: but they were different to now, in a reconstructive way 1 . The world had just suffered the evils of the Great War and the devastation caused by another mortal pandemic: the Spanish flu, which from its beginning in 1918 until its end in 1920, claimed more than 50 million lives worldwide (Taubenberger & Morens, 2006) . Rosner (2010) reviewed the state of public health before the epidemic of Spanish flu of 1918, seeking to place the reaction to the disease in the context of the evolution of public health. The author demonstrates that much of public health was rooted in the experiences and practices developed over the previous century in responding to often dramatic outbreaks of cholera, yellow fever, typhoid, and a host of other infectious diseases. He reports that the adopted measures of some US states in 1918, for example, to prevent the spread of contamination were prolific and included early, broad isolation (i.e., closing of schools and churches, banning of mass gatherings, mandated mask wearing, lockdown and disinfection). It is important to stress that, nowadays, even with contemporary tools of surveillance and technology, the central core of the measures adopted by the nation's governmental policies around the globe have followed these essential tenets: viz; social distancing, lockdown, and other primarily sanitary measures. The question is: How do these measures of social distancing and lockdown affect people's daily lives in the context of this new pandemic?",

Specifically, understanding how these governmental sanitary measures have modified the mechanisms of alcohol consumption and social interaction in two cultures highly affected by the pandemic: the British and the Spanish.

Crossing cultures was used as a strategy because \"culture\" is one of the most important aspects that shapes drinking patterns 2 (see Stimson, Grant, Choquet & Garrison, 2007 for a review).",

Alcohol consumption has long been an important part of traditional culture in the UK and drinking is a widely accepted feature of social life, this being reflected in the low proportion of abstainers (\u00d6sterberg & Karlsson, 2003) . United Kingdom is considered a beer country (Room & M\u00e4kel\u00e4, 2000) , having a long history of breweries, with a diverse variety of beers, produced mostly for domestic consumption (\u00d6sterberg & Karlsson, 2003) . Its consumption per capita per year (73 L in 2018) is one of the highest amongst the European countries (Statista, 2020) . According to the Pub Statistics of the House of Commons Library (2021) there were approximately more than 47,200 Public Houses or pubs in the UK in 2019, half of which are independent. Pubs are an important part of the British culture: according to the House of Commons Library (2021), they improve community engagement and are the third most popular activity for tourists. In regards to spirits, whisky and gin are the most consumed, with a long history of production in the UK, and are drunk straight or as part of alcoholic cocktails. Commercial wine production, however, is relatively new in Great Britain, beginning in the 1990 s (WineGB, 2020). However, the British have incorporated wine with their meals and traditions, and spread this culture across the burgeoning British Empire (Parr & Rodrigues, 2020) . Its consumption is so important that a recent report declared that on average, a Briton consumes the equivalent of 108 bottles of wine a year: far more than the rest of the Western world (O. E. C. D., 2017).",

Spain is considered a traditional wine country (Room & M\u00e4kel\u00e4, 2000) with a diversity of wine regions grounded in culture. Interestingly, following \u00d6 sterberg and Karlsson (2003) , alcoholic beverages (especially beer and wine) have been an important source of nutrition and in the social and dietary habits of the Spaniards, where drinking during mealtimes and mixing with both work and social habits are very common and remain very important (e.g., consumption at bar de tapas). Beer has become popular especially among young people, being a symbol of casual and modern life, a beverage mostly drunk in bars, on holidays and at leisure events (\u00d6sterberg & Karlsson, 2003) , in place of the traditional home consumption of wine (Gordon, Heim, & MacAskill, 2012) . Beer has greatly increased in popularity over the years, with 52 L per capita consumed in 2018. When compared to other categories where the consumption is decreasing, for example, wine with 8.3 L per capita and spirits with 2.6 L of per capita per year (Statista, 2020). These changes in consumption patterns could be attributed to the degree of urbanisation that European countries such as Spain have experienced during the last 70 years (Karlsson & Simpura, 2001) .",

Some of the research in the field of consumer science is dedicated to understanding the relationship between lockdown and alcohol consumption. Faced with a difficult situation each person has her/his own way of dealing with stress, anxiety, fear, boredom\u2026 (Torres and Nowson, 2007) , as in Covid-19 pandemic period (Elbay et al., 2020) . Two of the negative outcomes, for almost all people all around the world, are isolation at home (lockdown) and social distancing. Increased food consumption (Mattioli et al., 2020) , or alcohol misuse (Clay & Parker, 2020) are two significant consequences of these socially modified outcomes. Smith & Randall (2012) demonstrating that one of the most detrimental consequences of anxiety is increased alcohol consumption. However, there are few studies dealing with the effects of long-term isolation on alcohol use and misuse (Clay & Parker, 2020) . A risk factor for the onset and maintenance of alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder is trait impulsivity (i.e., the tendency to take risks or act without adequate forethought or reflection). Impulsivity can moderate stress-induced consumption of alcohol and is also associated with relapse in addicted individuals. Thus, this period of isolation might lead to a spike in alcohol misuse, relapse, and potentially, development of alcohol use disorder in at-risk individuals, thereby placing further strain on addiction and drug and alcohol services, and the health service in general, during and after the pandemic (Clay & Parker, 2020) . Thus, there is an emergence of drinkers at risk of establishing potentially dangerous patterns of alcohol consumption during lockdown. In the UK, which went into lockdown after a national announcement by Prime 2 At a general level, drinking patterns describe three important aspects of alcohol consumption: population (gender, age, social and economic factors, genetic and biomedical factors); context (culture, noncommercial alcohol, settings and venue); and behaviors that may accompany drinking and have bearing on outcomes (leisure, heavy drinking episodes) (Stimson, Grant, Choquet & Garrison, 2007) . It is important to note that culture, as a large concept, may affect these three aspects of alcohol consumption, acting as an umbrella concept, being able to cover them in its different levels.",

            "text": "Minister Boris Johnson on March 22nd 2020, data from the Office for National Statistics shows that sales from alcohol stores in March had increased in month-on-month volume by 31.4%. The total sales of wine, beer and spirits in the four weeks leading up to 22nd March increased by \u00a3199 million compared with the same period in 2019 (Nadkarni et al., 2020) . Research by Alcohol Change UK conducted between 8th to 14th April 2020, found that one in five people (8.6 million adults) were drinking alcohol more frequently in the lockdown (Quinn, 2020; Thomas & Drummond, 2020) . However, more than a third of the 1555 people surveyed who reported drinking alcohol before lockdown stated that they had stopped drinking or reduced how often they drank in the two weeks after lockdown commenced. And while about half of the drinkers declared they were consuming about the same amount on a typical drinking day, 15% said they had been drinking more per session since lockdown began (The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology, 2020). Perhaps this is the reason why some countries have announced a complete ban on the sale of alcohol during the lockdown period, such as South Africa and India. The sale of alcohol in some municipalities of Mexico, for example, is limited to certain hours (e.g. Los Cabos and Canc\u00fan), and in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, beer production and distribution has been suspended, during the peak period of COVID contagion in 2020 (Nadkarni et al., 2020) .",

Cluster 4, being the least numerous cluster with 12% of participants, presents the highest proportion of consumers with <40 years (73%, 55% of them with <30 years) with higher education (86%) and the least proportion of participants with children (14%). Participants of Cluster 3 drink mainly at home before lockdown, differently from Cluster 4, which consumed alcohol with similar frequency at home or in pubs and restaurants (Fig. S3 of Supporting Information). Notwithstanding, both clusters, which represent almost 60% of respondents, present common consumption patterns affected similarly by lockdown. Fig. 7a shows that both clusters are frequent consumers of wine (average score = 3.8 and 3.7 for Cluster 3 and 4, respectively; almost 2-3 days/week). However, while participants from Cluster 3 consumed beer only occasionally (average score = 1.6; between less than once a month and at least once a month) participants of Cluster 4 frequently consumed beer in addition to wine (average score = 3.2 between once week and 2-3 days/week). For both groups of participants, the consumption of whisky experienced a significant increase during lockdown (Fig. 7b) , with a frequency of never or less than once a month before lockdown to at least once a month for Cluster 3 (average score = 2.2) and to at least once a week for Cluster 4 (average score = 3.0). This increase occurred at the expense of spirit consumption, which drastically decreased with lockdown, especially for Cluster 4 (Fig. 7c) . As observed for the other two clusters, significant decreases in the consumption of alcoholic beverages with friends during lockdown is observed (Fig. 8b) and increases in the consumption during virtual meetings with friends (Fig. 8c) (Fig. S4 of Supporting Information). As observed, for UK consumers, the first dimension (30.9% of original variance) shows a clear difference between frequent and occasional consumers occurring regardless of lockdown. Interestingly, living in flats with patio or balcony seems to be related to higher frequency in the consumption of alcoholic beverages than living in flats with no patio or balcony. Besides this main dimension, other dimensions appear to be important such as Dimension 2 (9.5% of original variance) and Dimension 3 (6.9% of original variance), which oppose social (drinking with friends eating snacks or without food in pubs or in virtual meetings, before and after lockdown, respectively) to less social (drinking at home with family during main meals in weekdays regardless lockdown) consumption patterns. Dimension 4 is linked to the type of beverage, opposing frequent beer drinkers regardless of lockdown, to eminent social consumers that used to drink wine before lockdown, and decreased their consumption during lockdown.

The authors concluded that it seems that during this period of lockdown, in which health was even more important than usual, people may be trying to adopt healthier lifestyles. For the British, the results of this study were in part similar to The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020) which pointed out that 50% of the participants of the study declared they were consuming about the same amount on a typical drinking day, and 15% said they had been drinking more per session since lockdown began. These lasts do not correspond to the consumers who answered the present survey. This might be due to a limitation of sampling, by which heavy drinkers did not answer our survey, and could be mainly responsible for the overall increase in the sales of alcoholic beverages in UK during lockdown, as showed by Quinn, (2020) and Thomas & Drummond (2020) . Regarding the healthier lifestyle adoption during COVID, it has already been discussed how consumers also made positive changes in their food habits and choices. For example, in a recent study, Jaeger et al. (2021) concluded that Covid-19 was a catalyst for positive dietary changes for 44% of the participants of a survey carried out in the United States, with a sample of 904 adults.

This result leads us to conclude that beer really has an important social role for this group of consumers and that the determining lever which drives the consumption of this type of drink is social context. Interestingly, this conclusion does not hold for wine. Whilst wine was consumed in social contexts (in pubs with friends during weekends) by young consumers of Cluster 3 it was consumed in non-social contexts (at home alone or with partner while eating main meals) by the most numerous cluster of older Spanish consumers (Cluster 1).

Other forms of cultural communication through drinks are emerging, as is the case of beer consumption by young citizens in a social context. Likewise, the traditional classification of the UK as a \"beer country\" is not consistent with the consumption declared by British participants in the present study. When we observe Britons' responses, both wine and beer seem to have an ambivalent social role. Contrary to what we observed for Spanish participants, no distinction between the consumption of beer and wine in social context or private life was observed for British participants. This is not surprising, because these results follow several econometric and historical data that show that the UK has accounted for a major share of the world's wine imports for centuries (Anderson & Wittwer, 2017 ). An interesting study developed by Simpson (2004) , who analysed the British wine market between 1860 and 1914, pointed out that historically the consumer demand both for spirits and for beer were similar to that for wine. These historical data of similarity in the consumption of different categories of drinks may be responsible for the non-distinction between what is consumed in a private context and what is consumed in a social context, as it was for Spaniards.",

            "text": "However, lockdown has impacted the patterns of consumption of whisky and other spirits for British participants. The frequency of consumption of whisky increased in the group of British participants during lockdown differently from Spaniards, whose consumption is negligible regardless lockdown. According to Barefoot et al (2002) and Valencia-Mart\u00edn et al (2009), a preference for distillates is usually associated with excessive alcohol consumption. This does not mean that the consumption level of spirits is high, but that the proportion of total alcohol consumed in the form of spirits is high. Our results on whisky consumption, as previously highlighted, seem to show a tendency of the Brits to consume more alcohol relative to Spaniards during lockdown. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore that whisky is a part active of British culture and consumption. \"Scotch whisky is part of Scotland's heritage and folklore\", as cited by Bower (2016) citing the words of Bill Walker MP in 1987, during the reading of the Scotch Whisky Bill in the UK Parliament. This is markedly visible when we look at other spirits, where a decrease in consumption was observed in both cultures, but being much sharper for Britons. Thus, this aspect could be what culturally differentiates UK and Spain consumption on the decrease of other spirits because, the drop-in consumption in both countries seems to have been the result of the closing of nightclubs and bars (i.e., drinking in a social environment episode). This is supported, for instance, by data from the Office of National Statistics (2018). In the section \"adults drink habits in Great Britain\" is visible that the greater consumers of this category of beverages are young people (16-24 years old). In the United Kingdom, this type of drink is mostly consumed in the format of cocktails, like the \"Pornstar Martini\" 6 , while \"Gin Tonic\" is widely consumed on the Spanish nightlife.",

            "text": "Interestingly, as shown in the results, a new scenario of alcohol consumption (drinking virtually with others) has emerged strongly among British participants during the pandemic. According to Lo Monaco et. al., (2020) the act of drinking alcohol, may play a positive role improving social relations, printing a \"lifestyle\" character, highly grounded in social environment (Stimson, Grant, Choquet & Garrison, 2007) and being observed as playing an important social role in cultures for generations (Ariz\u00f3n, Escario, & S\u00e1nchez-Ventura, 2014) . Regarding this virtual social interaction, our results go in the same direction as a very recent study developed in the COVID-19 period by Sun et al. (2020) which showed that in United Kingdom and Spain, along with Italy, Denmark and The Netherlands the lockdown significantly altered lifestyles -because people spent more time at home, travelled much less, and were more active on their phone, they interact with others by using social apps. This characteristic could be in part explained by the herd character of human being (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1979) . Along with the idleness aspect of lockdown, it seems that the isolation caused people to seek to interact with their friends, colleagues and family, trying to maintain a type of \"normality\" in their daily lives. This explains why, for example, the alcohol consumption habits of some UK participants have remained the same, in terms of number and type/form of consumption (e.g., wine and beer).

Our findings show that Spanish consumers are more social drinkers than UK consumers, and consequently, lockdown induced a decrease in consumption for Spanish participants, while UK participants maintain their frequency of consumption during lockdown and increased it for a proportion of participants interviewed. In other words, the decrease in alcohol consumption in Spanish participants is linked to the limitation of social interaction.",
