[1] [2] [3] In the past, the term \"idiopathic\" has been reserved for canine and human epilepsy of presumed genetic etiology. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Confusion in terminology arose when this term was applied to describe seizures in cats because genetic epilepsy has never been recognized in client-owned cats. Description of presumed genetic epilepsy in this species so far has been limited to 1 report in an experimental breeding colony. 9 Consequently, the present article follows the recent suggestions of the Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), which differentiates between genetic epilepsy and epilepsy of unknown cause. 10, 11 Similar guidelines recently have been established in veterinary medicine. 12 The reported prevalence of epilepsy of unknown cause (EUC) in cats with seizures ranges from 25 to 54%. 1, 3, 13 There is ongoing discussion as to whether the prevalence of EUC has been overestimated because of the inconsistent application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postmortem examination (PME), or use of low-field MRI. 1, 3, 14 Thus, some cases that previously were included as idiopathic possibly were caused by structural brain disease that had been missed. It was recently postulated that complex partial seizures (CPS) with orofacial involvement in cats might be associated with feline hippocampal necrosis (FHN) and immune-mediated limbic encephalitis with voltagegated potassium channel (VGKC) complex antibodies. 15, 16 There are few reports describing these entities in cats, applied MRI diagnostic criteria varied, and histologic correlates of altered hippocampal MR signal intensity were rarely assessed.

This frequency is less than previously reported (25, 1 38, 3 41, 14 and 54, 13 66% 24 ) by other authors, who had called this entity idiopathic or presumed idiopathic seizures, 1 suspected idiopathic epilepsy, 2,24,25 probable symptomatic epilepsy, 14 or primary epilepsy. 3 However, in this study, all cats with epilepsy of unknown cause and structural epilepsy were examined by 1.5 T MRI or underwent PME. The remainder had ASS, which were attributed to severe metabolic disturbances or poisoning. Epilepsy of unknown cause must be diagnosed by exclusion of intracranial lesions and other causes. The application of advanced diagnostic imaging appears to be crucial for this diagnosis, and its use was limited in previous studies. 1, 3 The term \"feline epilepsy of unknown cause\" has been used in this investigation in accordance with the recent report of the ILAE Commission on Classification and Terminology. 10, 11 Epilepsy of unknown cause was supported by the fact that none of the cats had a family history of epilepsy. However, cats, especially domestic shorthaired cats, often are acquired from shelters or farms and therefore pedigree data are less commonly available for cats than for dogs. Yet, only 1 report describes presumed genetic epilepsy in an experimental breeding colony. 9 Craniocerebral trauma was an unlikely cause because of a lack of supportive history. Furthermore, none of the owners reported exposure to potential toxins. Recently, head trauma has been reported to be associated with a substantial risk of developing epilepsy in dogs. 26 In contrast, recent studies failed to demonstrate a link between previous mild to moderate head trauma and the development of epilepsy in cats. 27 A high proportion of the cats with EUC in this study showed CPS with orofacial involvement and a good outcome, similar to what has been described recently in correlation with FHN. 15 FHN previously has been described as a frequent etiology for seizures in cats 3, 17, 25 whereas others only observed it infrequently. 1, 28 When reviewing and comparing the MRI scans from cats with EUC and cats without seizures, we were unable to confirm hippocampal signal alterations in any of the cats in the study. This observation may imply that EUC either is a distinct disease entity in cats or that imaging of the feline hippocampus is severely limited using current imaging protocols. 18, 29 Recently, FHN has been suspected based on T2-weighted hyperintensitiy only and concurrent contrast enhancement was not a requested feature. 15 In contrast, bilateral T2 hyperintensity in the hippocampus and piriform lobe has been interpreted as focal edema by others. 30 Hence, there is ongoing discussion whether reported hippocampal changes represent the cause or consequence of seizures. In human medicine, hippocampal sclerosis is the most common pathology underlying drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. In order to make a diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis, a standard MRI protocol is used. Common MRI features are decreased hippocampal volume, increased signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging as well as disturbed internal architecture of the hippocampus. 31 Attempts have been made to evaluate the use of volumetry and to define an MRI protocol for assessment of the canine hippocampus. 32, 33 Nothing comparable has been published for FHN. Consequently, the diagnosis or exclusion of FHN must be based on postmortem histopathologic findings in the absence of unequivocal MRI features. Future investigations of MRI and histopathologic correlates in the same patients are needed, but may introduce bias because they focus on nonsurviving cats.

[36] [37] [38] In this investigation, cats with seizure remission were treated earlier in their disease course. Research in human patients has shown that in addition to underlying cause (and possibly age), early seizure control also is an important indicator of outcome. 39-41 Our data indicate that an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach may improve prognosis and may be associated with favorable outcome as suggested previously. 1, 34, 42 However, it is still possible that EUC follows a self-limiting course, which is either defined by complete seizure remission or low seizure frequency with interictal periods >1 year.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 544, "end": 546, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 958, "end": 960, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1572, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1577, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1582, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2012, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2016, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, many cats in the seizure remission group had a short initial seizure period of <1 month. One could therefore consider other self-limiting conditions (eg, inflammatory or vascular disease, ASS) as possible underlying causes. The role of inflammation as a predisposing cause for seizures has been the focus of recent epilepsy research. [43] [44] [45] Hematology and CSF findings including cytology were not suggestive of inflammation, and other evidence for inflammation was only present in 1 cat, as indicated by neutrophilia and an enlarged mesenterial lymph node. However, 1 cat did not have CSF analysis or PME performed, and therefore inflammation might have been missed in this cat. Limbic encephalitis associated with antibodies against VGKC recently has been proposed in cats with CPS with orofacial involvement and suspected hippocampal pathology. 16 The clinical features and the outcome of cats in this study are very similar to those of cats with CPS and orofacial involvement. However, in our case series we were unable to confirm hippocampal signal intensity changes and thus were reluctant to use the terms hippocampal necrosis or limbic encephalitis. However, because VGKC antibodies were not measured in this study, limbic encephalitis cannot be excluded as a potential cause of seizures. Therefore, future studies of feline epilepsy should not only include detailed imaging investigations, but also measurement of VGKC antibodies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 354, "end": 358, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 359, "end": 363, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Inherent limitations of this study include the small number of cats, the heterogeneity of the group, the retrospective nature of the study, lack of video documentation of the seizures, and the fact that outcome was partly based on owner treatment decisions.
