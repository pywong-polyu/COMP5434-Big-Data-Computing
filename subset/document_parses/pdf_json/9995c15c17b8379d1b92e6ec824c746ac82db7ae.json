As of September 2020, \"people in long-term care facilities were 8 percent of coronavirus cases, but 45 percent of all COVID-19 death.\" 4 There is a limited amount of COVID-19 research seeking to identify treatments or detection steps associated with reduced mortality. While randomized controlled clinical trials can be used to establish whether a treatment causes a reduction in mortality, such studies are often difficult to conduct or may be unethical. A recent study of mortality rates among nursing home residents concluded that mortality risk \"declined for residents with both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for residents with both high and low clinical complexity.\" 5 The authors surmised that a change in the transmissibility and severity of the virus may have caused this shift and did not find any interventions that were associated with reduced mortality. 6 Other studies have attempted to identify specific treatment regimens or detect strategies that might have conveyed such a benefit. A Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis found that \"based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out COVID-19. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for COVID- 19 . The presence of fever or cough, given their high sensitivities, may also be useful to identify people for further testing. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID-19, are still urgently needed.\"",

For each patient, treatment specific models were trained to predict constant marginal average treatment effects and constant marginals for mortality with a minimum leaf size of 50 and a maximum depth of two. 12 We then developed and calculated a propensity score for causal relationships for each patient to establish the conditional probability of observed variables. This was accomplished by using treatment specific logistic-regression models to predict constant average treatment effects and constant marginals for specific therapies across the entire patient population. The internal treatment predictions were fit by logistic regression with 3-fold cross-validation. The internal outcome model also implemented 3-fold cross-validation with a ridge classifier with 2 exceptions, the morphine and sennosides outcome models were fit with weighted LASSO. 13 Analysis was conducted using Python 3.9.0 and the EconML and Scikit-Learn packages. 14 We measure survival as a Boolean feature representing whether a COVID-19 patient or former COVID-19 patient \"died\" or \"survived\". If a patient died within 120 days of a covid diagnosis the mortality outcome target was \"1\", otherwise it was \"0\". 15 .

Using DAGs to eliminate confounders allowed us to estimate that the ATE was a function of the observed data distribution. 18 Counterfactual analysis of the data was conducted to identify interventions with the greatest average treatment effect (ATE) and predict patient level response. We found that the administration of dextromethorphan, prednisone, apixaban, cholecalciferol and omeprazole, at any level of dosing reported in the EHRs reduced the risk of mortality. Table 5 shows that the use of dextromethorphan, prednisone, apixaban, cholecalciferol and omeprazole had average treatment effect estimates across all COVID-19 positive residents of 23.2%, 15.5%, 11.5%, 10.5% and 10.4% and reductions in risk of mortality, respectively.

We can more effectively control for the confounders (a variable, often hidden, that influences the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variable) and collider bias (a third variable is caused by the relationship between an intervention and outcome) using causal inference. Electronic medical records (EHRs) often miss data for one or more variables as was the case in this study. The use of DAGs allowed us to identify when 'missingness' might be hiding variables that could bias estimate. However, when we were unable to fully account for missing data in every patient record, for which conditional independence evaluation identified the existence of latent variables, causal relationships were not assessed. However, we showed that causal inference, combined with existing machine leaning methods is an efficient and reliable tool for establishing the causal relationships needed to optimize treatment and personalize medicine. It is possible to do so at scale using automated causal structure learning and to eliminate confounders and selection bias more rapidly and effectively. 20 Considering the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and the fact that anti-viral medications and vaccines may not be effective in preventing or controlling the disease in all cases, identifying .

At the outset, we need tools to identify changes in the type, timing, and frequency of care that may have a causal effect on well-being. For example, Marie Davidian pioneered the development of individualized dynamic treatment regimens and created software to allow the use of average treatment effects to estimate optimized treatment outcomes at an individual level. 22 Finally, there is a need for the deployment of technologies that allow people to create fully integrated health records that can be updated over time. Such data could be collected from electronic medical records, genomic information, wearables, remote monitoring devices and patient surveys.
