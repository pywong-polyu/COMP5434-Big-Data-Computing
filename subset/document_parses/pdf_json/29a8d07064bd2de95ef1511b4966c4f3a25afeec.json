To provide a quick, in the moment analysis of the social and political aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic to preserve the possibly ephemeral aspects that might be overlooked in future historical studies. Methods. Qualitative and a statistical analyses of real time information. Results. The clustering of former imperial powers as states suffering extreme initial impacts, combined with a brief qualitative commentary on the domestic politics related to the pandemic response, suggests that colonial imperialism has lingering domestic political effects. Conclusion. The domestic political power bases that enabled colonial imperialism may be a significant and previously unrecognized factor in politics both in the context of disaster response and more broadly.",

From the challenge that leaders faced in securing reliable data and interpreting them in the moment when decisions had to be made, all the way down to the emergence, growth, and sometimes deadly consequences of snake-oil scams and conspiracy theories, there are countless, often intangible, aspects of the pandemic that could be lost to the academic perspective as \"the fog of war\" dissipates and the clarity of hindsight alters our perspectives.",

By definition, a disaster is a catastrophic event that is beyond a community's ability to respond to, and that displacement into what might only be described as communal helplessness can defy even the most concerted and determined analytical efforts. For example, the irrational local resistance to building DRR elements into postdisaster rebuilding efforts was a puzzle that persisted for nearly half a century before an accidental observation led to a possible explanation. It was the \"in the heat of the moment\" language used by the most passionate and vocal opponents of the DRR efforts being included in the recovery from the 2011 Christchurch earthquake that was the key. The wording indicated that the psychology of loss-framing and the instincts behind prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) were a huge factor. Building the way that loss-framing would lead a significant minority of individuals to overvalue the previous status quo into an aggregated rational choice model then offered an explanation for the phenomenon where affected communities resist including even externally funded DRR efforts in the rebuilding process (Van Belle, 2015) .",

Total Deaths per Million and Total Cases per Million in Democratic States (Log Scale) rationalized in ways that obscure or transform them. For example, a variation of Coser's social psychology of the group response to threats (Coser, 1956) is probably the best explanation for why Hollywood's obsession with the drama of panic and looting is simply not found in the reality of a disaster (Van Belle, 2012). Many who have personally experienced those first few hours after a catastrophe strikes can offer anecdotes of unexpected combinations of people coming together in amazing ways to act as a group, but it has so far proven impossible to find a way to measure and analyze that group response outside of those real-time observations. This brief analysis, and the discussion that follows, are offered as a way to engage the context from within the moment of crisis, with the hope that it might help contextualize future academic studies by providing a foundation for at least some degree of comparison between post hoc and in vivo perspectives. The idea is to provide the social science equivalent of the real-time modeling and analysis of epidemiological data that many expect will provide a panacea for future study. The currently available data are a mess, the analysis is simplistic, and the discussion is highly speculative, but we still offer them as a representation of how theories, ideas, and our backgrounds in the social and political aspects of disaster response and DRR enable our understanding of the pandemic as it unfolds, on May 8, 2020.",

We use countries that built empires through the active colonization of external territory, starting with Portugal in the 17th century, as our definition of colonial empires. Sweden might be considered a borderline case. The use of democracies rather than all states reflects what is the most appropriate set of cases for the discussion. Using all states changes little. It adds Russia as an imperial power, but Russia is right up among the colonial empires that have become democratic powers, and it adds a significant number of additional data points in the lower left quadrant, but what is visually apparent here is just as clear in that more cluttered chart of the data. A chart with a logarithmic scale is offered here as an example because it best shows how Japan lies right in the middle of the scatter of noncolonial democracies, but the pattern shown here is clear regardless of how the data are charted.",

As is the case with visually charting the currently available data, the simple correlation is robust and substantial regardless of whether all, or just democratic, states are examined. This confirms what is apparent in charting the data, but the R 2 of 0.589 also quantifies just how much of the variation is explained by this single factor. While clarifications and refinements of the data are expected, and other factors are undoubtedly going to be found to be statistically significant, the odds are that a history of imperial colonialism, or some close proxy measure, is going to be a critical element in understanding this first wave of the pandemic.",

In the United States, the Republican Party has found significant and salient political support for prioritizing wealth over human life. In stark contrast, in New Zealand a similar call to risk, or indeed sacrifice, lives to quickly reopen the economy fell flat and was ridiculed to such an extent that it immediately stoked speculation in the news media that the leader of the largest conservative political party, the National Party, would be ousted for even suggesting that path forward, and shortly after this article was written, he was replaced.",

Public approval for that approach to the pandemic response, which has been clearly, repeatedly, and pointedly expressed by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, has found support of over 90 percent in polling. Voluntary public compliance with one of the most extreme lockdowns in the world has been extremely high, and the extent of the peer-policing of the lockdown rules has been notable, leading to a near elimination of lockdown defiance after only a few days. Both support and compliance have remained so high that after six weeks of lockdown, even minor incidents of rule breaking are newsworthy. The contrast to the United States, where the president openly encouraged heavily armed mobs to storm state houses to demand the end of far less restrictive measures, could not have been greater. Clearly, there is a significant, politically powerful, and highly motivated set of powerbases in the United States that do not just prioritize the pursuit of wealth over human life, they do so to an extreme. While it may not be as extreme in other former colonial powers, something similar does seem to be at work even in Sweden, which can only be considered a marginal case as a colonial imperial power.",
