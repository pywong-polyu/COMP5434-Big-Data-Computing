In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and strategy, through the comparative experiment of NSGA and PSO, it can be seen from the experimental results that the three-level network allocation model and the improved NSGA-II algorithm (nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II) proposed in this paper can not only solve the existing postdisaster relief material allocation and scheduling problem but also reduce the space-time complexity of the problem.",

            "text": "In recent years, many countries around the world have experienced different types of severe natural disasters, such as the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Haiti earthquake, the snowstorm in southern China, and the US Hurricane Katrina. is has caused severe economic losses and casualties in the affected areas and has made it particularly important to optimize the allocation of emergency supplies after disaster, reduce the incidence of secondary disasters, and reduce the cost of relief materials. Emergency relief materials allocation means that after a disaster occurs, according to the degree of demand for shortage materials in the disaster area, effective response measures are taken in the shortest time to reasonably allocate various types of emergency relief materials (drinking water, food, medicine, etc.) from different emergency relief centers to different relief points in the disaster area. However, in the actual process of emergency supplies allocation, there will be asymmetry between material supply and demand information, imprecise demand prediction, real-time disaster information acquisition, and so on. is will lead to excess (or shortage) of emergency relief materials, increased allocation costs, and low relief efficiency. Such problems not only aggravate the loss of people in the disaster-stricken areas but may also cause secondary disasters. In order to effectively solve the problems of redundancy, waste, low efficiency, and high cost of emergency relief materials configuration, an improved NSGA-II is proposed in this paper, which builds an emergency relief materials configuration mode based on big data and real-time information updates to achieve the goal of precise configuration of disaster emergency relief materials. e overall structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, some previous works are introduced, and the difference from the previous works is stated. In Section 3, a mathematical model for emergency relief materials allocation for disaster is established, and the detailed problem description is summarized. In Section 4, the improved NSGA-II algorithm under emergency management is proposed. In Section 5, the algorithm and the fairness of relief materials allocation are verified through the simulation model of emergency relief materials allocation in the disaster area.",

            "text": "e key to the rational allocation of relief supplies by emergency management departments is to resolve the imbalance between the scarcity of relief supplies and the excessive demand in disaster areas. Relevant scholars at home and abroad have conducted exploratory research on the allocation of emergency medical supplies from different perspectives. For example, Dodo et al. [1] used loss estimation models to comprehensively evaluate regional risks and used the evaluation results to provide guidance for emergency rescue resource allocation decisions. A linear program supporting systemic regional disaster mitigation analysis was developed and verified by real earthquake cases in Los Angeles. Davidson et al. [2] further studied the allocation of emergency relief supplies on the basis of this procedure and put forward the view that both timeliness and fairness should be taken into account in the allocation process. At the same time, it is analyzed that the emergency department needs to allocate emergency rescue materials reasonably and quickly according to the principle of the first emergency and then delay in order to maximize the effectiveness of rescue materials [3] . In the emergency management process, the way to obtain disaster big data is mainly based on online social media, which can generate massive information [4] . Yates and Paquette [5] have shown that social media big data has the characteristics of timeliness, multisource, and interactivity, which can effectively serve disaster emergency response and plays an important role in disaster emergency management and emergency material allocation. DAbner [6] pointed out that the use of big data for emergency material allocation can effectively reduce the loss and impact caused by disasters. Based on the Chinese Sina Weibo platform, Zhu et al. [7] used text mining technology to construct an instant disaster detection system capable of extracting big data information in a timely manner to reduce disaster losses through scientific material allocation. Ning et al. [8] collected big data information about sudden disasters through Baidu Index, compared and analyzed the social response stage characteristics of different types of disasters and the reasons for their differences, and then proposed emergency management strategy based on different types of sudden disasters that could effectively reduce disasters loss. Ning et al. [9] proposed the prediction and identification strategy of dynamic material demand based on big data, which provided an effective basis for emergency relief materials allocation. Li et al. [10] used big data from Twitter tweets during the 2011 Japanese earthquake to find that the demand for relief materials in the disaster area changed dynamically during the different relief phases after the disaster. Based on the concept of disaster big data information, Ning et al. [11] established a disaster emergency material demand prediction model based on the safety stock model and adopted the radial basis neural network method, which provided a reference for the scientific configuration of emergency materials. Acar and Muraki [12] found that the relevant geographic location information carried in online disaster big data can effectively improve the efficiency of disaster relief and material allocation. Ning et al. [13] analyzed the big data in Twitter and extracted the geographic location information of disaster relief to understand the latest disaster progress in the disaster area. Feldman et al. [14] pointed out that sudden disasters usually cause serious damage to infrastructure such as telecommunications, and most affected groups will choose to use relatively solid network social media to seek help or publish relevant latest disaster information after the disaster. Other scholars conducted research from the perspective of the distribution of disaster emergency relief materials. For example, Liu et al. [15] studied the improvement of the organization and management capabilities of the distribution of relief materials from the actual situation of the distribution of emergency relief materials after the disaster and provided professional equipment and technical support for the distribution of relief materials. Ning et al. [16] studied the transportation of the wounded after a sudden disaster and designed the shortest ambulance allocation model for the overall rescue time when the number of ambulance vehicles is limited and the corresponding relaxation algorithm. Mete and Zabiny [17] designed a stochastic planning model by using disaster scenarios to capture disaster-specific information and the possible impact of disasters, which was used to select the storage location of emergency medical supplies and the required inventory level of each kind of medical supplies. Ning et al. [18] proposed the allocation method of emergency rescue resource for regional assistance in public health emergencies. Ruan et al. [19] designed a large-scale disaster relief material allocation method according to different disaster situations. Yarmand et al. [20] designed a simulation model to capture the epidemic dynamics in each region under different vaccination levels, defined the vaccine allocation problem as a two-stage stochastic linear programming problem, and proposed and verified an easy-to-implement heuristic vaccine distribution method. Xiang et al. [21] proposed a queuing network model to simulate the deterioration of the victim's health after a disaster, gave the analytical and numerical solutions of the queuing network, and then established two resource allocation models, each with the minimum total expected mortality and the minimum total waiting time as the optimization goals.",
