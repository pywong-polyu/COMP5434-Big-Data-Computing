In addition to the most common and proven pharmacological methods, nanomaterials can represent alternative resources to fight viruses at different stages of infection, by selective action or in a broad spectrum. A fundamental requirement is non-toxicity. However, biocompatible nanomaterials have very often little or no antiviral activity, preventing their practical use. Carbon-based nanomaterials have displayed encouraging results and can present the required mix of biocompatibility and antiviral properties. In the present review, the main candidates for future carbon nanometric antiviral systems, namely graphene, carbon dots and fullerenes, have been critically analysed. In general, different carbon nanostructures allow several strategies to be applied. Some of the materials have peculiar antiviral properties, such as singlet oxygen emission, or the capacity to interfere with virus enzymes. In other cases, nanomaterials have been used as a platform for functional molecules able to capture and inhibit viral activity. The use of carbon-based biocompatible nanomaterials as antivirals is still an almost unexplored field, while the published results show promising prospects.",

            "text": "The Covid-19 viral infection, which has become one of the most signi\ue103cant threats to human health since the 1918 \ue104u pandemic, has urgently increased the need for antiviral drugs and vaccines. The times required to develop them are, however, quite long and several phases are required before being approved for use in humans. As a result, it is important to develop innovative and long-term strategies to complement the existing pharmacological approaches to \ue103ght infections and speci\ue103c viruses. Despite the great advances in technology, human beings o\ue09den \ue103nd themselves helpless in the face of new dangers arising from the emergence of new viruses. Viruses are the cause of about one third of deaths from infectious diseases. 1 The lack of tools to \ue103ght virulent infections or a slow response to the outbreak of a pandemic can have catastrophic economic and social implications. Unfortunately, the only resource to counteract the development of viral infections is the use of vaccines, o\ue09den employed when the infection is already widespread. Besides that, the few strategies we possess are antiviral drugs, symptom treatment, and isolation. Beyond the urgency to reduce and stop the pandemic, it is also necessary to develop a new generation of antiviral tools that are as \ue104exible as possible and show broad range antiviral activity. Viruses are characterized by well-de\ue103ned shapes and dimensions, which are in the nanoscale, and as such they could also be considered as a kind of nanomaterial themselves. Highly symmetric nanostructures, such as fullerenes, have, for instance, extraordinary geometric affinity with icosahedral viruses. 2 The possibility of creating nanomaterials on the same scale and with similar geometry is a fascinating possibility. The similarities can be used to foster interactions and build smart nanostructures that can inhibit or inactivate virus replication. Antiviral substances can generally be divided into virostatic and virucidal, depending on the counteracting action against a particular virus. 1 The former are substances that act in the early stages of infection by inhibiting viral replication and the proliferation of the virus. They are based on a binding mechanism and can, therefore, o\ue09den be ineffective if they detach and leave the viral particles untouched. 1 Virucidal medicines, on the other hand, can permanently deactivate the virus, with effects that remain even a\ue09der dilution. However, many of the molecules that have such an effective antiviral action are toxic. 1 Research on the antiviral properties of carbon-based nanomaterials is still in its embryonic state. The main interest in these systems lies precisely in their potential low toxicity 3 and innovative virus inhibition mechanisms. The ambition of using nanoscale systems is to combine virostatic properties with virucidal inactivation processes.",

            "text": "Among the nanomaterials that have been tested in nanomedicine and biotechnology, nanoparticles are certainly the most important to date. [4] [5] [6] Their antiviral activity is exerted through multiple mechanisms. The small size and tailored functionalization of the surface favour drug delivery and entry through the cell membrane (negatively charged). They can also have biomimetic properties as in the case of dendrimers. 1 The possibilities of using nanomaterials for nanomedical purposes are potentially vast and take advantage of the \ue104exible synthesis, biocompatibility, surface tunability, and design of the chemical and structural composition. 4 In this perspective review, we have considered the most signi\ue103cant results in the \ue103eld of carbon-based nanomaterials for antiviral applications. In general, carbon nanomaterials show low cytotoxicity and present speci\ue103c antiviral activities. Although relatively new in the nanomedical \ue103eld, they have stimulated intense research activity aimed at controlling the synthesis and functionalization of their surfaces. The related surface engineering has allowed effective tuning of the surface properties for speci\ue103c applications. Graphene-based systems have proven to work well both via direct interaction with the virus (also through photoinduced mechanisms) and as platforms for other particles or molecules with antiviral properties. In addition to graphene, carbon dots, systems smaller than 10 nm, have also been shown to have speci\ue103c antiviral properties and broad-spectrum responses. The other class of carbon nanomaterials that we have considered is fullerene and its derivatives. They were the \ue103rst ones to be tested as antiviral carbon materials and have shown remarkable antiviral properties as an inhibitor of viral activity or as a photoactivator. It can be envisaged that in the future, the need for antiviral materials will attract more attention towards carbon-based nanomaterials and new \ue103elds of application can be expected to be developed.",

It has been observed that GO produces damage to the membranes of bacterial cells, causing the exit of the cytoplasm. It has also been observed that E. coli cells respond to GO or rGO exposure in a different way. The E. coli cells are singularly wrapped by GO layers, while in the case of rGO they are embedded into large aggregates. GO shows, in general, the highest antibacterial activity, which depends on time and concentration. The origin of this effect has been attributed to oxidative stress. In fact, GO and rGO oxidize glutathione, which acts as the redox state mediator in bacteria, and physically disrupt the membrane via direct contact with the sharp parts of the GO layers. 16 ",

            "text": "The antibacterial activities of GO and rGO sheets suggest that these nanomaterials could also have a direct antiviral action. An evaluation of this activity has been performed using RNA (porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, PEDV) 17 and DNA (pseudorabies virus, PRV) viruses as a model. 18 PEDV is a coronavirus that infects pigs causing severe diarrhoea and dehydration, which results in signi\ue103cant mortality in piglets. PEDV cannot be transmitted to humans. PRV is, instead, a herpesvirus of swine, belonging to the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, which causes Aujesky's disease. Both of these viruses are responsible for worldwide severe economic losses. 19 Fig . 1 shows the antiviral effect of graphene oxide at noncytotoxic concentrations. Experiments have shown that GO inactivates the virus before it enters the cells. The virus is inactivated by physical disruption of the structure through direct interaction with the sharp edges of the GO layers. Images taken by TEM have shown that the glycoprotein spikes in the virion envelop, a\ue09der incubation with GO for one hour, have been destroyed. The antiviral activity was effective on both DNA and RNA viruses, and dependent on concentration and incubation time. Interestingly, it has been observed that rGO and GO show a similar antiviral activity, which suggests a minor role of the surface functional groups. Because GO and rGO have a similar negative charge and layered structure, the physical interaction of the viruses with their sharp edges should be at the origin of the antiviral activity. GO has been found to inactivate the virus before it enters the cell. Another important factor is the negative charge of GO, which favours electrostatic interaction with the positively charged viruses. The higher interactions result in the destruction and inactivation of the virus. A con\ue103rmation of the role of the negative charge of GO can be found in the experiments performed by Sametband et al. 20 They tested the antiviral activity of GO layers and partially reduced sulfonated GO (rGO-SO 3 ). Both of these nanomaterials have a negative charge, due to carbonyl and sulfonate surface groups, and can inhibit the infection from the herpes simplex virus type-1, HSV-1 (Human Alphaherpesvirus 1) (vide infra). HSV-1 is a double-stranded DNA virus, and is a member of the Human Herpesviridinae family. It is an enveloped virus with a spherical pleomorphic structure whose diameter is around 200-250 nm. HSV-1 causes oral herpes or cold sores in a large portion of the world population.",

GO derivatives, obtained by binding on the nanosheet surface heparan sulphate (HS), have been shown to compete with HSV-1. 20 HS is a linear polysaccharide which is negatively charged. HSs are attached to the cell surface as proteoglycans (HPGs) and may become cellular receptors for different viruses. To mimic the surface of the cell, GO layers have been functionalized by sulfonated groups (GO-SO 3 ), as previously discussed. 20 Other examples that mimic the extracellular cell matrix have been reported, which include GO functionalization with polyglycerol sulfate, 32 b-cyclodextrin 33 and polyglycerol sulphate in combination with alkyl chains. 34 A main issue regarding the functionalization of GO is controlling the density and distribution of the groups attached to the surface. Gholami et al. 35 developed a one-pot [2 + 1] nitrene cycloaddition reaction to functionalize graphene by 2-azido-4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazine (Fig. 5) . In a second step, the GO surface was covered with sulphonate groups using polyglycerol with a few amino functional groups, PG(NH 2 ) 4% . This method allowed a platform with a uniform distribution of hyperbranched polyglycerol on the surface to be obtained. In a further step, the surface was sulphated to obtain a heparin sulphate mimetic 2D material. The nanoplatform is highly negatively surface charged and has a very good dispersibility in an aqueous environment. The capability of this platform to bind viruses has been tested using Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as a model. VSV is an enveloped virus belonging to the Rhabdoviridae family and Indiana vesicolorum species. It is a zoonotic virus which is commonly used for laboratory studies of viral evolution in Rhabdoviridae viruses. GO layers with only hydroxyl groups have shown a small affinity towards VSV in comparison with the GO with a high density of sulphates. In physiological conditions, the sulphate groups are considered the main cause of the interaction between GO and viruses under physiological conditions. The virions do not show any change a\ue09der binding to the sulphonated GO platform. The authors have, therefore, excluded any disinfection activity on VSV from the action of the reactive oxygens generated by GO. 16 A GO-based 2D platform composed of 6% graphene and 94% sulphated polyglycerol has been found to be able to trap 20 virions.",

Alkyl chains of different lengths (C 3 -C 18 ) have been tested. Longer alkyl chains have been found to have the highest antiviral activity, but they are also toxic against Vero cells.

C-dots have been tested against Herpes simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) with encouraging results. The experiments were performed under classical in vitro conditions on monkey kidney cancer cells (Vero) and human lung cancer cells (A549), and cytotoxicity and antiviral assays were performed. The properties and functionality of three different types of C-dots, made with the hydrothermal technique, have been investigated. The precursors of C-dots have guaranteed the formation of different functional groups, revealed through vibrational spectroscopy techniques. Phenylboronic acid (PBA), 3-aminophenylboronic acid (3-APBA), or 4aminophenylboronic acid hydrochloride (4-APBA) have been used as precursors.

Moreover, PBA and 4-APBA derived C-dots showed no cytotoxicity to Vero cells, although 3-APBA based C-dots were moderately cytotoxic. As shown in Fig. 9 , at a concentration higher than 5 mg mL \u00c01 of 3-APBA/C-dots and 4-APBA/C-dots, no infection was detected with 100% cell viability. On the contrary, PBA/C-dots have shown no effectiveness against virus infection. Interestingly, the role of Cdots can be revealed by a morphological study of the cells. As a result of virus presence, the cells undergo an important change in shape and dimensions, while being unaltered under treatment with C-dots. The contrasting mechanism of C-dots to the virus is not completely understood. Indeed, it has been con\ue103rmed that boronic acid is not involved in the inhibition of HSV-1, in contrast to other boronic acid-modi\ue103ed nanostructures. C-dots have a signi\ue103cant impact at the early stage of virus entry by interacting more with Vero cells than with viral entities, interfering with the interaction between cell receptors and the virus. 48 The effect of virus inhibition of C-dots has also been tested with Human Immunode\ue103ciency Virus HIV-1 infections.

            "text": "C-dots with a hydrodynamic diameter of about 3 nm have been prepared by carbonization of anhydrous citric acid at 200 C for 30 min and dialyzed therea\ue09der. The obtained C-dots have also been functionalized with 4-carboxy-3chlorobenzeneboronic acid (CBBA/C-dots). In this case, the role of boronic acid groups has been pointed out. C-dots and CBBA/C-dots have been mixed with MOLT-4 cells to assess the cytotoxicity. Both dots appeared safe, up to a high concentration of 300 mg mL \u00c01 , with cell viability over 80% even at 300 mg mL \u00c01 . The corresponding CC 50 values were 2901.2 and 1991.9 mg mL \u00c01 . The antiviral role of C-dots and CBBA/C-dots has been studied by evaluating syncytia formation. Indeed, one of the most efficient routes of virus transition from an infected cell to a normal cell takes place with direct contact. Counting the numbers of syncytia in the presence of dots can be a good way of evaluating the virus infection. As a result, C-dots have not prevented the formation of syncytia, while CBBA/C-dots have bonded to gp120 on the virus, blocking the infection by preventing the MOLT-4 cells from binding (Fig. 10) . Although hydroxyl and carboxylate surface groups on C-dots can inhibit HIV infection by the formation of hydrogen bonding with the molecules of the viral envelope, the boronic acid tends to enhance this effect, by interacting with 1,2-cis diol sites on gp120. 49 PEG-diamine and ascorbic acid derivate C-dots have shown encouraging results as viral inhibitors by active functionality. The dots, showing a low level of cytotoxicity with cell viability of 72% a\ue09der 48 h incubation at the concentration of 0.250 mg mL \u00c01 , have been tested on Monkey kidney (MARC-145) and Porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. In particular, MARC-145 cells have been infected by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and PK-15 by Pseudorabies Virus (PRV). The virus titers were reduced in the presence of C-dots in comparison with the control groups (Fig. 11 ). PRV has also been studied by indirect immuno\ue104uorescence assay of PRV-gD and PRV-VP16, which is responsible for binding with host cell receptors and is a component of primary enveloped virions, respectively. The samples treated with C-dots showed a signi\ue103cant decrease in \ue104uorescence in accordance with the titer count. The experiments on PRRSV gave the same conclusions, with remarkable inhibitory effects of CDs. At the same time, the investigation of type I interferons (IFNs) a, antiviral innate immune molecules, and the IFN-stimulated genes (IFGs) has indicated a possible inhibitory mechanism of C-dots via the activation of IFN-a and production of ISGs. 50 Similar results have been obtained for curcumin derived Cdots, exploiting the antiviral activity of herbs. 51,52 They have been applied to porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) as a coronavirus model. Ting et al. have treated a mixture of citric acid and curcumin at 180 C for 1 h under hydrothermal conditions (CCM/C-dots) and compared the resulting C-dots with the more common ethylenediamine-based dots (EDA/Cdots). It was found that CCM/C-dots display a great efficacy against the replication of PEDV in comparison with EDA/Cdots. In fact, CCM/C-dots can modify the structure of the surface proteins in viruses, suppress the negative-strand RNA of the virus and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and stimulate the production of ISGs and cytokines. The inhibition of PEDV in Vero cells at the CCM/C-dot concentration of 125 mg mL \u00c01 was studied by monitoring the titer counts and green \ue104uorescence signal of PEDV N proteins. The CCM/Cdots present a positive charge, and so strongly interact with PEDV and the cell membrane, competing with the virus to bind to the cell surface. The z-potentials of CCM-CDs, PEDV and CCM-CDs pre-treated with PEDV were +15.6, \u00c06.42 and \u00c00.18 mV, respectively. Therefore, the positive potential of the C-dots can promote the aggregation of the virus and reduce the infectivity, as veri\ue103ed by \ue104uorescence and Raman measurements. 52 Although the mechanism of action of carbon dots is still far from being fully understood, it has been well established that the role of functional groups deriving from the appropriate choice of different precursors is a fundamental parameter. This is what emerged from the experiments of \u0141oczechin et al., 53 where different C-dots were tested as a countermeasure to the proliferation of HCoV-229E Human Coronavirus in Huh-7 cells. HCoV-229E is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA coronavirus. It is one of the viruses that cause the common cold with a 120-160 nm diameter (Coronaviridae family, Human coronavirus 229E species). As in previous works, the primary role of C-dots is to act at the early stages of infection, inhibiting the interaction of the S-receptor protein with the host cell (Fig. 12) . However, not all C-dots have shown the same effectiveness, underlining the importance of molecular groups resulting from synthesis. In this work, the \ue103rst group of C-dots was synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric acid and functionalized according to the scheme in Fig. 13 .",

The C-dots were then tested against EV71 virus in RD cells. C-dots can hinder the interaction of the virus with RD cell membranes. In addition, they can suppress the ROS (reactive oxygen species) by working as radical scavengers and inhibit PGE 2 production. Furthermore, it has also been reported that curcumin C-dots can decrease the expression of p38 kinase. 50 A further step forward is represented by C-dots from benzoxazine. Contrary to the previous examples, where an important role of boronic acid was highlighted, in this case the effectiveness of boron-free C-dots has been demonstrated. In addition to the well-known biocompatibility, these hydrothermally synthesised C-dots made from the monomer benzoaxine BZM have demonstrated broad spectrum efficacy in blocking virus infectivity. Unlike other systems, where multiple mechanisms can intervene in antiviral activity, in this case the C-dots have shown a direct interaction with virions. C-dots have been employed against \ue104aviviral (JEV) infections in BHK-21 cells. 54 To investigate the broad-spectrum potential of C-dots, different viruses have been treated, both enveloped and non-enveloped. Although the dots present a marked effect on JEV and ZIKV, they have been demonstrated to be suitable for other viruses. The EC 50 of BZM/C-dots against different viruses is 18.63 mg mL \u00c01 (JEV), 3.715 mg mL \u00c01 (ZIKV), 37.49 mg mL \u00c01 (DENV), 40.25 mg mL \u00c01 (AAV), and 45.51 mg mL \u00c01 (PPV). 54 Finally, it is worth mentioning that carbon nanoparticles with 2,2 0 -(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) and 3-ethoxypropylamine have been proved to inhibit the interaction of human norovirus virus-like-particles (VLPs) with HBGA receptors, leaving intact the morphology of the VLP particles. 55 Additionally, VLPs have been hampered in interacting with their respective antibodies.",

            "text": "Unlike the other carbon materials within the C-dot classi-\ue103cation, whose optical properties are mainly governed by the presence of \ue104uorophores or functional groups produced during the synthesis, the photoluminescence of GQDs originates from quantum con\ue103nement effects, related to their size. Thus, the \ue104uorescence emission can be tuned through changing the size of the graphene monolayers. GQDs can be obtained by thermal oxidation of graphene oxide, where epoxy and hydroxyl groups operate as cleavage sites and promote the cutting of GO into smaller fragments. 56, 57 Mixtures of acids, e.g. nitric and sulphuric, are o\ue09den employed for oxidative cleavage of graphitized carbon-based materials, although there are nonacidic alternatives such as oxone and H 2 O 2 . In addition, the electrochemical cutting of graphene, graphite, coal and so on, and ultrasonic exfoliation, allow for high yield GQD production. 58, 59 GQDs have attracted a lot of attention because of their extraordinary potential in the biomedical \ue103eld. In particular, they have been proven to be efficient and biocompatible emitters, 60 which can be used for the detection of Hepatitis C Virus core antigen 61 and hepatitis B virus, 62 and cancer-targeted \ue104uorescent imaging. 63 GQDs have shown remarkable antiviral activity against HIV-1 infections. The most important experimental evidence of this efficacy has been reported by Iannazzo et al. 64 and it remains the most signi\ue103cant so far. In their work, GQDs were synthesized by acid oxidation and exfoliation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The activity of pristine dots has been compared with the antiretroviral agents CHI499 and CDF119. Furthermore, GQDs have been conjugated with CHI499 and CDF119 as drug delivery systems. The systems were tested as inhibitors of HIV in cellular and enzyme assays, whilst the cytotoxicity was studied in MT-4 cells. GQDs have shown antiviral activity with an IC 50 of 37.6 mg mL \u00c01 , and an EC 50 value in cells of 19.9 mg mL \u00c01 . Among the different candidates, the GQD/CHI499 system displays the most encouraging results. Indeed, the conjugated platform showed improved antiviral properties, with an IC 50 of 0.09 mg mL \u00c01 and an EC 50 of 0.066 mg mL \u00c01 and a selectivity index of 362. Accordingly, it has been supposed that the efficacy as drug delivery relies on the imide bond in GQD/CHI499. A\ue09der drug release in the infected cells, both GQD and CHI499 can synergistically act as inhibitors. On the contrary, the amide bond in GQD/CDF119 prevents easy drug release. 64 Although the results open new opportunities for antiviral applications, GQDs have displayed more signi\ue103cant potential in bioimaging and sensing. 58,65",

A diamido diacid diphenyl fulleroid derivative was speci\ue103cally designed to inhibit an HIV enzyme. Since then several research groups have worked on tailoring the synthesis of fullerene derivatives to inhibit the activity of HIV enzymes, HIV-1 RT and DNA polymerase. The general strategy is the same, developing a fullerene derivative able to inhibit the HIV enzymes. Different antiviral effects have been observed depending on the fullerene functionalization. [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] A comparative table with the main results can be found in ref. 78 . The main problem is balancing the cytotoxicity with the antiviral activity. In general, low cytotoxic effects have been observed for fullerene derivatives but the data still need more experiments to fully address some critical points, such as the presence and the effects of C 60 derivative isomers.",

An example of antiviral application of highly water-soluble fullerene derivatives was reported by Troshima et al. in 2007. 80 Using chlorofullerene, C 60 Cl 6 , as a precursor substrate, polycarboxylic fullerenes in high yield were obtained. The fullerene derivatives in the form of alkali metal salts have a high solubility in water (50-100 mg mL \u00c01 at pH < 7.5) and a signi\ue103cant anti-HIV activity with a low cytotoxicity. Another question to be addressed is the potential antiviral activity of water soluble derivatives of fullerenes with larger carbon cages, such C 70 . In comparison to C 60 , because of the lower symmetry, the synthesis of C 70 water soluble derivatives is more difficult. Kornev et al. prepared highly soluble C 70 compounds whose antiviral activity and cytotoxicity were tested. 81 A signi\ue103cant antiviral activity against HIV and in\ue104uenza virus, H1N1 and H3N3, was detected. In\ue104uenza A virus subtype H1N1 is a subtype of In\ue104uenza A virus, belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family (80-120 nm in diameter). H3N3 is another type of Avian in\ue104uenza virus of the same family. Interestingly, a new antiviral mechanism, through the interaction of the C 70 derivatives with the envelope gp120 protein from HIV-1(III B ), has been observed. This protein is used by the virus to enter the cells via speci\ue103c surface receptor recognition.",

            "text": "The request for antiviral solutions has recently drawn the attention of the scienti\ue103c community towards innovative solutions. Nanomaterials, because the scale and surface properties can be speci\ue103cally engineered, are potentially disruptive new antiviral tools. Many of these materials are already leading players in nanotechnology, with a key role in several research \ue103elds, such as photocatalysis, photonics and optoelectronics. Metallic and oxide nanoparticles, in particular, have been widely tested as antiviral materials, 102 but several questions remain to be solved, such as the cytotoxicity, which still needs to be fully assessed. This is the reason why we have not included in the present review another important class of carbon-based nanomaterials, the carbon nanotubes. Their potential toxicity still represents, in fact, a major issue. Carbon-based nanomaterials are, however, interesting candidates for antiviral applications, in particular graphene, carbon dots and fullerenes. Table 1 shows a summary of the main carbon nanomaterials that have been tested as antivirals. The large variety of combinations suggest that the studies in this \ue103eld are still in the exploratory phase and much work needs to be done. In particular, an important general question which has to be studied and assessed is the relationship between the C-dot dimensions and shape and that of the virus. The possibility of fabricating Cdots that simulate the virus shape and surface is a very challenging issue, but speci\ue103c and systematic studies have to be carefully performed.",

            "text": "In addition to the carbon-based nanomaterials considered in this overview, it is worth mentioning the nanodiamonds (NDs), which, with their particular surfaces and dimensions, are potential candidates of importance in nanomedicine. 103 NDs are among the smallest carbon-based materials and are, conventionally, crystalline nanoparticles of about 5 nm in size. 104 Their unique characteristics derive from the physicochemical properties of the particle facets. NDs can be obtained by the detonation of explosive carbon-based materials. Some of the particles are crystalline carbon objects below 10 nm. 105 This procedure suffers from several drawbacks, including the high quantity of impurities, which requires puri\ue103cation work. Among the most common impurities are metals and carbon-based systems with a different structure from that of the diamond. Over the years, numerous puri\ue103cation processes have been implemented, including oxidative treatments in the liquid or gaseous phase and acid treatments. 103, [106] [107] [108] [109] One of the most severe drawbacks that can be encountered in the use of NDs is their tendency to aggregate, leading to the formation of clusters of hundreds of nanometres. This phenomenon is facilitated by the presence on the surface of functional groups (carboxylic, hydroxylic, etc.) capable of generating hydrogen or covalent bonds, determining high adhesion forces. NDs can be easily functionalized for speci\ue103c biological applications. The surface functional groups determine the chemical environment of use and the interactions with tissues, and can improve the biocompatibility. Among post-synthesis processes, graphitization to obtain sp 2 carbon on the surface, hydrogeneration, silanization and reactions with amines or PEG 103 are the most common. To date, no studies have investigated the antiviral activity of NDs. However, considerable efforts have been made to study the toxicological properties and biocompatibility of NDs. In particular, it has been demonstrated that puri\ue103ed NDs do not show signi\ue103cant toxicity. Ivanova et al. 110 reported the effects of ND interaction with in\ue104uenza viruses. This study highlighted the absorbency of NDs against viruses. Viruses such as In\ue104uenza A H1N1 and H3N2 were concentrated and placed in a solution of NDs. Hemagglutination tests with erythrocytes were used for virus detection. Absorption and desorption studies have highlighted the possibility of using NDs as antimicrobial \ue103lters. NDs have shown encouraging results in attaching to the envelopes of E. coli and as an antibacterial. The most promising results highlight that NDs have relevant properties as potential drug delivery systems, with numerous engineering and functionalization possibilities. 104 As an antiviral, the current literature does not show emerging opportunities and a greater effort has to be made to improve current knowledge about the cytotoxicity and puri\ue103cation of such systems.",

Graphene oxide has antibacterial activity and, to a lesser extent, also antiviral properties, well documented for pseudorabies viruses. However, the characteristics of low toxicity and surface functionalization allow graphene to be thought of as a useful platform in combination with other antiviral systems acting on the nanoscale. For this reason, most of the experiments have used GO to exploit the possibilities of surface functionalization. GO and graphene have high potential for virus detection, but their direct use as an antiviral is also more difficult to forecast because their dimensions and shape are large on the nanoscale and difficult to control. However, to date, there are no systematic studies that allow clear identi\ue103cation of the antiviral mechanism to be achieved, and speci\ue103c studies have to be performed to understand the graphene-virus interaction. It has been suggested that the virucidal activity is due to physical disruption of the virus by the sharp edges of graphene. It is not clear, however, if this mechanism works in general or only for speci\ue103c types of virus.",

Although carbon dots have revealed signi\ue103cant antiviral activity, the success rate of most C-dots is remarkable in the early stages of the infection, when the nanoparticle seems to have a role in interfering with the interaction mechanism between the virion and cell. To date, one of the main obstacles to an improvement in antiviral properties against a speci\ue103c virus is the lack of knowledge of the mechanism of action. In fact, as we have seen, the dependence of antiviral activity on some surface functional groups of the nanoparticles is contradictory and not fully demonstrated. Moreover, it is not clear whether C-dots are able to attack the virus directly, playing a virucidal role. Finally, there are many in vitro experiments, while in vivo ones are still scarce, and they are necessary to know the real potential of such systems. Another advantage of C-dots is the possibility of tailored surface functionalization, but on the other hand their structure is only de\ue103ned in terms of properties and a speci\ue103c control is still difficult to achieve.",
