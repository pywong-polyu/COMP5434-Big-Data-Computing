Approximately 3-4 thousand new cases were confirmed daily, among which 19% were severe and required intensive care [1]. However, there was a large gap between critical care delivery and demand. We only had 3.6 intensive care unit (ICU) beds per 100,000 capita compared with 34.7 in the US and 29.2 in Germany, which made it difficult to meet the needs of a large number of critically ill patients during the pandemic [2] . The lack of professional critical care staff was another important shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic. We rapidly repurposed more than 9000 ward beds in 10 hospitals (including two urgent established hospitals) to critical care beds for critically ill patients in Wuhan. More than 42,000 medical staff, including 19,000 (44.6%) critical care physicians and nurses, were recruited to Wuhan. The national critical care expert team went to Wuhan to guide medical management and infection control. These experiences were used to control later outbreaks in other cities.",

In our previous study, a majority of severe patients received combined antiviral treatment, such as arbidol, alpha interferon, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Almost every patient received antibiotic treatment recommended by the first version of the surviving sepsis campaign (SSC) guidelines [4]. According to the results of clinical trials, the management of COVID-19 became much simpler in several late outbreaks in China (Fig. 1a) . For example, no patient received combination therapy with antiviral agents, and only approximately 4% of all patients and 30% of critically ill patients received antibiotics in Xinjiang and Heilongjiang provinces.",

Patients who could get out of bed were asked to walk for 10 m under SpO 2 monitoring, which we called the \"oxygen stress test\". If the SpO 2 dropped below 93% during or after walking, a high risk of developing severe conditions was noted. Unfortunately, the test is empirical. We do not have sufficient data to support this hypothesis, and further studies are encouraged. Additionally, an early warning system, including an oxygen stress test, lymphocyte count, and D-dimer levels, was established to identify severe patients.",

The RECOVERY study showed that glucocorticoids could reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 [9] . Approximately half of the patients received glucocorticoids in Wuhan; however, we found that glucocorticoid treatment was not associated with better outcomes in a cohort study [10] .

The prone position can recruit collapsed alveoli in gravity-dependent regions and reduce pulmonary shunting in patients with ARDS. Sun et al. first recommended awake prone position ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19 [11] . Later studies showed that awake prone position ventilation could significantly improve oxygenation but not avoid the rate of intubation [12] . We found that prone positioning substantially improved overall V/Q matching by decreasing dead space; however, this effect was lost after reverting to the supine position in patients with COVID-19. A prolonged prone position is associated with better outcomes. Most of our patients tolerated more than 12 h or longer in the prone position every day. In the critical care expert consensus, we recommend that spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 who need oxygen therapy or have rapid deterioration in chest images should assume a prone position for at least 12 h per day [13] .",

However, delayed intubation will lead to higher mortality in patients who receive HFNO therapy. We found that intubated patients after HFNO or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) failure had significantly higher mortality than patients who received directed invasive mechanical ventilation (Fig. 1b) . It is difficult to assess the respiratory drive during HFNO therapy. However, under a certain pressure support level during NIV, a higher tidal volume reflects higher respiratory effort. Every patient who received HFNO therapy should switch to NIV for a short time. We performed an expiratory occlusion maintained for the duration of a single breath during NIV to measure expiratory occlusive pressure (NIV test), which also reflects respiratory effort. However, during NIV, occlusion pressure may underestimate inspiratory driving. Chinese expert consensus suggested that when the tidal volume was continuously greater than 9-10 ml/kg PBW, patients need intubation and should receive lung-protective ventilation [13] .",

However, Gattinoni et al. reported that COVID-19 pneumonia is categorized into two phenotypes: type H and type L [14] .
