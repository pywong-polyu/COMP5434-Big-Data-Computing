Materials and Methods: Only patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), who had a cup-disc ratio (CDR) of 0.9 or a near total cupping on maximum tolerated medical therapy for at least 4 weeks and yet could not meet the target IOP were included. Target IOP was defined as \u226412 mm Hg. A total of 30 patients were enrolled. All patients in study cohort were started on E/D Ripasudil BD. Patients were followed up at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and then monthly for 6 months for their best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), disc changes (slit lamp biomicroscopy), perimetry, and retinal nerve fibre layer analysis using optical coherence tomography (OCT-RNFL). Results: Mean pre-treatment IOP on five drugs was 18.3 \u00b1 2.1 mm Hg (range 14 to 22mmHg) on maximally tolerated medical therapy. At 1 week follow-up, mean posttreatment IOP was 15.1 \u00b1 1.7 mm Hg (range 12 to 18mmHg) and at 2 week follow-up, mean post-treatment IOP was 12.5 \u00b1 1.9 mmHg (range 10 to 16mmHg). Thus, target IOP \u226412mmHg was attained in 28 patients at 2 weeks. This target IOP was maintained throughout the 6 months of follow-up period. Of the 2 patients who could not meet target IOP, 1 patient needed rearrangement of their fixed-drug-combinations to achieve target IOP at 4 weeks. The second patient required unfixing of all fixed-drug-combinations to achieve target IOP at maximally tolerated medical therapy at 6 weeks.",

Of these, it is estimated that more than 11 million individuals will be bilaterally blind due to glaucoma in 2021 (around 13% of the cases). 2 At least 50% of those with glaucoma are unaware that they are affected. In some developing countries, 90% of glaucoma is undetected and thus nearly one fifth of the patients become blind in either or both eyes. 3 Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the single most important modifiable risk factor for efficient glaucoma control. Conventionally, the initial standard of care for primary open angle glaucoma is medical with surgical options being reserved for instances when there is documented structural or functional progression despite adequate IOP control or inability to control IOP on medical management.",

Recent guidelines from National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence of UK as well as the American Glaucoma Society (AGS) recommend primary glaucoma surgery in such cases. 7 However, with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown starting March 2020, elective surgeries and procedures were halted and indefinitely deferred until it was safe for both the health care workers and the patients. In such a scenario, there was no option but to resort to alternative strategies including modifying fixed-drugcombinations within the tenets of previously existing maximally tolerated medical therapy. Ripasudil was FDA approved for the treatment of glaucoma in 2014 but the use was limited to Japan and Korea(PMDA) since then. However, the recent advent of its availability in India ushered in a new arena of opportunity that could be harnessed for lowering IOP via a new pathway, ie the selective Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) inhibition.",

At least 40% IOP reduction is required to prevent progression in advanced glaucoma cases. In the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) patients that did not show any progression had a mean IOP of 12 mm Hg. 12 Also, in patients with advanced glaucoma showing functional or structural progression in spite of achievement of target IOP, assessment and control of peak diurnal IOP and IOP fluctuations should be given equal importance as absolute reduction of IOP.

Since a randomised clinical trial comparing the outcomes of all three modes of treatment in advanced glaucoma patients is lacking, there is no uniformly, universally accepted best treatment option for these group of patients. Recently, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline of UK has suggested primary glaucoma surgery for patients presenting with advanced glaucoma 13 while a study conducted by King et al argued that the current evidence is not supportive of this recommendation. 14 Burr J. et al compared medical versus surgical interventions for POAG and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of surgery was superior as compared to recently available medications in patients of advanced glaucoma. 15 Amongst the newer glaucoma medications, Ripasudil has shown the most promising results. Ripasudil hydrochloride hydrate is the world's first Rho-associated coiledcoil-containing protein-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that lowers IOP by increasing the conventional aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal by decreasing outflow resistance. Ripasudil induces basic cellular changes such as cell contraction, cell motility, cytoskeleton rearrangement, cell adhesion and remodelling of cell to cell contact in the Trabecular meshwork-Schlemm's canal pathway. Another important aspect is that Rho-kinase inhibitors can potentially alter episcleral venous pressure which can bring down the IOP further given that the episcleral venous pressure acts as a maximum under which it is difficult to bring IOP down. The IOP lowering efficacy of Ripasudil has been well investigated in patients of POAG and OHT. In various studies, Ripasudil has demonstrated efficacy in lowering the IOP when used as monotherapy or in combination with beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues. According to a study carried out in Japanese patients, who were on 2or 3-drug medical therapy, IOP decreased from 2.6 mm Hg to 3.1mm Hg, ie approximately 20% to 30% IOP reduction from baseline after administration of Ripasudil. 12 Our cohort study included 30 patients with diagnosed advanced glaucoma, who had been receiving maximally tolerated medical therapy for a long period of time but failed to achieve the target IOP. These patients were advised Trabeculectomy with Mitomycin C and were ",

This target IOP was maintained during the 6 months of the study period. This additive IOP lowering effect of Ripasudil is attributable to the fact that its mechanism of action differs from that of other antiglaucoma medications and can be explained by two hypothesis. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Firstly, Ripasudil not only induces contraction and rounding of cell bodies in the trabecular meshwork but also decreases transendothelial resistance, thus increasing transendothelial flux. Secondly, it is supposed that it takes a few weeks for intraocular distribution of Ripasudil to stabilise and thus it takes time for Ripasudil to decrease the extracellular matrix accumulation and eventually increase the conventional aqueous outflow.",
