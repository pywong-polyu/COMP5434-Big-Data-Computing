This article provides experimental evidence about one potentially important driver of compliance with social distancing: social norms. We asked each of 23,000 survey respondents in Mexico to predict how a fictional person would behave when faced with the choice about whether or not to attend a friend's birthday gathering. Every respondent was randomly assigned to one of four social norms conditions. Expecting that other people would attend the gathering and/or believing that other people approved of attending the gathering both increased the predicted probability that the fictional character would attend the gathering by 25%, in comparison with a scenario where other people were not expected to attend nor to approve of attending. Our results speak to the potential effects of communication campaigns and media coverage of compliance with, and normative views about, COVID-19 preventive measures. They also suggest that policies aimed at modifying social norms or making existing ones salient could impact compliance.",

In particular, social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings have emerged as some of the most powerful and effective preventive behaviors [1] . Despite the strength of the evidence on the dangers of close social contact [2, 3] , many people continue to gather with friends and to participate in social events [4] [5] [6] , which has helped the virus to potentially spread even to the highest political circles [7, 8] . If the pandemic is to be contained, it is crucial to understand what drives people to engage in behavior that is inconsistent with the available scientific evidence and public health guidelines [9] .",

We do so by conducting a survey experiment on more than 23,000 individuals in Mexico. The experiment consists of a vignette, described in the form of a story, depicting a fictional individual, Mariana, who has been invited to attend a friend's birthday gathering and must decide whether or not to attend. This story portrays a situation that most Mexicans can relate to (birthday celebrations) and what the literature highlights to be individuals' relevant reference network during the current pandemic (family and friends) [12] . These social gatherings are also relevant because they have been shown to lead to super-spreading events [2, 3] . The treatments randomly assign respondents to different social norms prompts, providing information on Mariana's beliefs about: (i) whether other invitees will attend the gathering (empirical expectations), and (ii) whether other invitees approve of others' attending the gathering (normative expectations). After being exposed to the social norms prompt, respondents are asked to state whether they believe that Mariana will attend the gathering, and whether they believe that Mariana should attend the gathering.",

Descriptive norms indicate those cases in which you prefer to carry out an activity because you believe it meets your needs (unconditional preference) or because you expect others to do it (conditional preference). Injunctive norms indicate those cases in which you prefer to engage in an activity because you believe it is the right thing to do (unconditional preference), or because you expect others to engage in the activity and believe that others think that you should do so as well (conditional preference).

[33] find that an individual's perceptions about how many others abide by social distancing correlate with the individual's propensity to social distance herself, and the effect of social norms can be stronger on individuals lacking a sense of duty [34] . As people seek to conform or to imitate the behavior of others [13] , news coverage of celebrities or political leaders failing to abide by, or criticizing, preventive behaviors [35, 36] could in fact reduce public compliance with such behaviors, as they might be \"normalizing\" them in the eye of the public [37] [38] [39] . However, norm-based interventions and media coverage on events showing compliance with preventive behaviors can potentially help [40] . Still, it is worth noting that norm-based messages might not have any differential effect on the understating of COVID-19 guidelines [41] and that norm nudges need to include more than informative messages to be effective [42] . These findings make it even more important to investigate how and why social norms would change people's compliance with preventive behaviors in order to further refine future interventions and massive communication efforts.",

[43] run a survey experiment similar to ours where normative and empirical expectations are randomly varied in a 2-by-2 schema, and respondents are then asked to predict the compliance of a fictional third party with social distancing. That study, like ours, finds that assignment to the condition with \"high\" normative and empirical expectations promoted compliance. However, our approaches differ in three important dimensions. First, instead of asking whether the third party would abide by social distancing in general, we confront the respondent with a very specific scenario: whether or not to attend the birthday party of a close friend. We believe that our approach is more vivid and therefore less prone to eliciting abstract responses colored by social desirability biases or demand effects. Second, instead of using a Likert scale we force a dichotomic yes/no response that mimics many social distancing choices: one can either attend a gathering or refrain from attending. Third, we elicit both predicted behavior and respondent normative views, which allows us to study whether any effects on (predicted) behavior might be underpinned by, or correlated with, effects on normative assessments.",

Highlighting the risks associated with not following social distance have a larger effect than providing information [45] . \"Deontological\" messages, based on people's duty to do the right thing for their families and friends, seems to be more effective than utilitarian or moral messaging [46] . Along this line, [47, 48] , and [49] findings are also consistent with the idea that prosocial motivation is effective in promoting intention to comply with preventive behaviors, particularly if they are able to develop individuals' empathy towards those more vulnerable to being infected [50] .",

The questionnaire was pre-tested on a small sample of colleagues and acquaintances, and subject to the IRB's recommendations. Survey respondents were recruited through a Facebook ad campaign and a separate email campaign. The Facebook ad campaign targeted a general audience composed of individuals over 18 The Facebook ads directed respondents to a dedicated project webpage within the IDB website where respondents were able to access the baseline survey. The invitations from the government secretaries did not direct respondents to the dedicated project webpage within the IDB website, instead leading respondents directly to the baseline survey. The baseline survey itself stated on the welcome page that participation was voluntary and that respondents could end the survey at any time and for any reason. It also stated that only those who were at least 18 years of age should respond, even though neither the survey nor the treatments contain any age-inappropriate content. At the end of the survey, we asked respondents whether the individual recommended using her responses in our analysis or not according to how confident the person felt about the quality of the responses. We made clear that there were no consequences if the individual selected \"Do not use.\" A total of 52,507 people clicked on the Facebook ad, yielding 15,542 complete and usable surveys. 14,059 people clicked on the email ad, yielding 7,642 complete and usable surveys. For purposes of the present study, we pooled all usable survey responses from both recruitment channels, for a total of 23,184 respondents.",

It is also important to note that our vignette explicitly describes Mariana's \"type\" as somebody who complies with public health guidance. Making this information explicit could potentially dampen the effect of our treatments (since it provides information on Mariana's unconditional preferences for social distancing), but at the same time it controls for a potential source of unnecessary variation in respondent priors. Table 1 describes the 2-by-2 experimental design that results from randomizing the empirical and normative expectations prompts. The horizontal dimension varies the content of the empirical expectation (few or most will attend), while the vertical axis that of the normative one (friends consider it appropriate vs. not appropriate to attend). Following Bicchieri et al. Table 2 describes the balance on covariates measured before the experimental vignette was presented. Judging on the basis of balance on observables, the randomization was successful, as the hypothesis that covariate means are equal across treatment conditions is only rejected twice (p<0.1) out of 39 comparisons. Our outcome variables come from two questions immediately following exposure to the vignette: i) whether the respondent thinks that Mariana will or will not attend to the gathering, and ii) whether the respondent approves or does not approve of Mariana attending the gathering.",

Whenever either of these conditions fails to hold (or both do), predicted attendance rises significantly. In other words, both high empirical and high normative expectations appear to be necessary to increase compliance with social distancing. This suggests that norms-based information campaigns can be more effective by targeting both kinds of expectations. It also suggests that undermining compliance is easier than sustaining it, as reducing either empirical or normative expectations suffices-in our study-to discourage social distancing.",

On the one hand, comparing the effects of treatment branches T2 (high empirical, low normative) versus T3 (low empirical, high normative) suggests that empirical expectations matter more than normative expectations, as claimed in [56] . At the same time, the estimated effect of treatment T4 (high empirical, high normative) is smaller in magnitude than, and statistically different from, that of treatment T2. This is surprising, since one might expect that when normative and empirical expectations are aligned (T4), the effect on behavior should be larger-yet this is not what we find. We take our results on the mixed treatments (T2 and T3) as an indication that empirical and normative expectations may interact in ways that are poorly understood (perhaps some form of crowding out is at work) and merit further research.",

First, it is not obvious that the intensity of treatment is comparable across arms: it could be that changes in the perceived empirical expectations are greater than a change in normative expectations. Second, our results ought to be interpreted in the context of the fact that Mariana is said, in the vignette, to generally comply with public health guidelines. Therefore, respondents may infer that Mariana may care more about what her friends like her do (T1 and T2) than those friends who do not think like her (T3 and T4). Lastly, our estimations are based on the perception of participants on how others (Mariana) would behave in this scenario. We, therefore, cannot assure that participants would act similarly if they found themselves in a similar position.",

Highlighting that others are not complying is likely to reduce compliance, and this could be an unintended byproduct of news coverage about noncompliance. Politicization of the guidelines, and active and public repudiations of norms, can also lead to further erosion of compliance. Additionally, targeting normative expectations-what people ought to be doing-will likely not suffice to induce the desired behaviors unless people also expect others to comply. Thus, information highlighting others' compliance and targeting normative expectations at the same time are likely to play an essential role in any successful information campaign seeking to encourage individuals to adopt preventive behaviors.",
