Although the impact of shutdown mechanisms on traffic safety is still being studied, initial studies reveal a decrease in traffic flow and a rise in risky driving behaviors. On the other hand, it is important to investigate how the epidemic has influenced travel behavioral characteristics in order to design mobility regulations for the post-COVID-19 future. Considering numerous investigations, the present study attempts to provide an overview of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on road traffic crashes, deaths, and injuries, as well as road travel behavior. The magnitude of COVID-19 was found to result in fewer crashes and injuries, as well as a reduction in road safety performance, but substantially greater serious accidents.

The novel contagious coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has recently spread rapidly around the globe, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic in March 2020, following the discovery of the first verified case in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 (WHO, 2020; Pawar et al. 2020a ). As of September 29, 2021, the epidemic had spread to 223 countries and infected more than 233,569,801 people worldwide, resulting in more than 4,779,109 deaths (Worldometers, 2021) . To prevent the spread of the COVID-19, most countries imposed strict restrictions and laws, including lockdowns, traffic limitations, employment, educational institutions, shopping, all religious services and, prohibitions on all social gatherings (Alhajyaseen et al. 2021) . Several governments implemented these restrictions gradually, while others did so abruptly, resulting in partial or total lockdown (GCO, 2020a) . At the very same time, road crashes continue to be one of the most serious transportation issues worldwide, leading in property damages, financial losses, and personal deaths and injuries (Kopits and Cropper, 2005; Sekadakis et al. 2021) . Around 1.35 million people are dead on roads each year around the globe and, it is also the eighth major reason of deaths, with up to 50 million people injured each year (WHO, 2019) . The worldwide and local mobility restrictions imposed in response to the rapidly spreading COVID19 pandemic have resulted in significant changes in people's travel behavior also ). However, Transport demand and travel behavior are, in reality, heavily linked to societal interaction. Because of this pandemic, travel and work two of the most basic aspects of daily life, have changed dramatically.",

The reduction in traffic volume is thought to have contributed to an increase in speeding drivers. Lower traffic volume and congestion, especially during the start of the epidemic, combined with a decline in law enforcement created an environment where speeding was more likely (Shaik and Hossain, 2021; Wagner et al. 2020; Qureshi et al 2020) . Initial statistics indicates that, in addition to speeding, intoxicated driving is on the rise (Vingilis, et al. 2020 ). All public safety precautions implemented to counteract COVID-19 led to a reduction in traffic users (especially at peak weekday travel periods) also indicated an increase in unsafe road user activity, including speeding and driving while intoxicated. Moreover, initial road accident statistics indicate a reduction in both fatalities and non-fatal road traffic crashes, when others demonstrate a drop in total accidents but an increase in more fatal accidents (Katrakazas et al. 2020; Vanlaar et al. 2021) . Driver and pedestrian accident and mortality rates in the age group (80 years and older) would have been reduced during in the epidemic than it was before because a large percentage of the elderly would follow physical distancing suggestions. They would also have a lower proportion of driving and pedestrian injuries and deaths than younger individuals (Rapoport et al. 2021 ).",

Travel demand has decreased in overall, and vehicular traffic and public transportation use have decreased dramatically throughout many countries in the world. People stayed away from public transportation because it was thought to be a breeding place for viruses and a location where it would be hard to prevent interaction with other travelers (Troko et al. 2011) . Bicycle riding increased at the outbreak of the epidemic as people are seeking a secure, dependable mode of transportation, and it has been a common mode of transportation, particularly for small or recreational excursions, ever since.

Adults aged 80 and up would experience a correspondingly bigger decline than other motorists and pedestrians, according to these researchers. The overall rate of accidents in Qatar throughout COVID-19 was much lower than in the past five years, but the rates of severe and fatal casualties climbed substantially. Gupta et al.

The majority of research found that the number of road traffic accidents dropped as a result of the lower volume of traffic on the roads during the pandemic. According to recent statistics, there has been a rise in speeding and intoxicated driving, as well as fewer but much higher serious accidents (Hughes et al. 2021; Vanlaar et al. 2021) .

Those behavioral changes may have been influenced by public perception established by the news and social media.

The pandemic is still exploding in many regions of the world at the time of writing this article, and the effects on travel are continuously changing. There are certain limitations to this study that could lead to more research in the future. In truth, numerous contributing factors influence road traffic accidents. More advanced types of models could be used in forthcoming research with larger sample sizes to establish obvious road traffic safety features. More accident and fatality datasets, including the application of different time series approaches and deep learning, could potentially strengthen the findings of this research. It has opportunity to represent the holistic scenario of travel behavior change in the world by reviewing literature more in post COVID-19 period.

Extending sidewalks, establishing safe cycling routes, and implementing ITS systems aimed to construct smart pedestrian networks will be the most effective initiatives taken by governments (Cirianni et al. 2022) . Researchers can take these agenda to study to assist transport management after pandemics. Other variables, such as employment kind, must be explored in future studies to better understand the determinants of activity travel behavior change during the epidemic. Future research also looking into the influence of more demographic variables to better comprehend travel behavior. Future research should look at how the variables interact and how that affects travel behavior and modal share. More study, on the other hand, is required to address the prevalence of active forms of transportation and to fully comprehend the long-term ramifications. Future research should look into whether diverse geographies of the world might contribute new insights, especially for low-and middle-income countries.

Even throughout COVID-19 pandemic, safety consciousness, mobility, and mobility patterns are all tightly linked, and hence have an indirectly impact on the number of accidents.

Throughout the COVID-19 shutdown, total movement in Tarragona state decreased by 62.9%, whereas road fatalities decreased by 74.3%. Their results add to the growing body of information that the COVID-19 epidemic is wreaking havoc on transportation safety. Vanlaar et al. (2021) examined self-reported unsafe driving behaviors in Canada and the United States during the epidemic to see if there are any distinctions. The majority of participants stated that overall activity had not changed, while a minor percentage stated that they were less inclined to interact in such risky driving practices. When comparison to that before COVID-19, a large percentage of people said they were more inclined to engage in unsafe driving behaviors during the epidemic. Sekadakis et al. (2021) used three distinct Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series models to assess the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on road traffic crashes, fatalities, and injuries. The total number of road accidents, fatalities, and minor injuries fell as a result of the substantial reduction in traffic volume, according to the modeling results. Another conclusion was that the number of fatalities and minor injuries increased dramatically during the shutdown and the following month. To explore the total influence of COVID-19 on e-bike safety in China, Yan and Zhu (2021) built novel applications of multi-output linear regression and clustering-based multi-output regression models. At the national level, the number of COVID-19 instances has a considerable negative impact on the number of e-bike accidents and deaths. Hung et al. (2021) conducted a retrospective study in Suzhou, China, to highlight recent ideas in the epidemiological of road traffic crashes during the COVID-19 pandemic. These were accompanied by an increase in the number of electric bicycle-related accidents and an increase in the number of road traffic injuries with disturbance of awareness.

The regularity of mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic was significantly affected by approach behavior, according to this analysis. Working from home and e-learning, as well as views regarding COVID-19, all had a direct impact on activity-travel behavior modifications; however teleshopping certainly didn't help reduce out-of-home engagements during the COVID-19 epidemic.Huang et al. (2021) had been using a massive amount of human movement information recorded from Baidu Maps, a popular web map-based system in China, to look into the thorough attitude of the crowd there throughout the epidemic in order to truly comprehend the effect of COVID-19 on public transit behavior patterns and to provide more focused antiepidemic initiatives.Truong and Truong (2021) built time-series prediction model using the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARIMA) approach to identify possible patterns of regular visits by distance in the United States from November 30, 2020, to February 28, 2021. The findings demonstrated a feedback controller situation in which people' movement activity varies in an endless series depending on the risk assessment of COVID-19. Ku et al. (2020) used paired t-tests to compare the passenger capacity of personal automobiles in Seoul since the last epidemic to see if COVID-19 had an impact on traveler usage of transport. Due to COVID-19, it has been discovered that existing bus and train customers have converted to the personal car modes. Using an interactive electronic survey, Politis et al. (2020) investigated the effect of different socioeconomic criteria on the travel behavior of Greek residents, as well as whether various social groups were relatively less fortunate or suffering so much from the shutdown. The data show a considerable drop in travel rates as a result of the shutdown, as well as strong relationships between gender, wealth, and travel rates during the shutdown, which were not present in the pre-pandemic era. Rasoolimanesh et al. (2021) study the impact of media-shaped cognitively tourism destinations on commitment to embrace and post-pandemic traveling intentions during the COVID-19 epidemic. This study sheds light on the elements that influence traveling behavioural intentions and demand following a catastrophe. Parker et al. (2021) performed a study that focuses on traveling behavior and the rapid effects of the COVID-19 epidemic on transport users, using a combined of questionnaire and passive cell phone GPS data. Using a questionnaire survey, Abdullah et al. (2021) investigated the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on traveling patterns and mode choices in Pakistan. Before and during the epidemic, the volume of traffic made for non-commuting activities was distinct. People moved from public transportation to personal cars for longer journeys. Hara and Yamaguchi (2021) used mobile terminal entire network information to present factual information and conclusions on changes in behaviour during COVID-19 \"state-of-emergency\" announcements in Japan. The results reveal that without imposing tight restrictions imposed, a considerable decrease in travels and interprefectural travel was accomplished. The work by Zhang et al. (2021) examines variations in air traveler travel behavior, including ticketing duration, traveler demography, returns and ticket adjustments, and traveler estimated time of arrival at airports, based on aggregate traveler flow patterns. The behavioral alterations in airline passengers caused by the epidemic are investigated, with organizational and policy consequences for the epidemic's normalization and the restoration of the airlines industry in the post-pandemic era. In reaction to the COVID-19 epidemic and its negative impact on the transport and tourist business, Chua et al. (2020) was established. This research will help travel and tourism organizations better deal with the pandemic's negative effects on respective companies.

The majority of research work used a questionnaire survey to collect data, then compared the influence of COVID-19 on road safety and travel behavior to the pre-pandemic period using various statistical methods and analysis. Most previous studies only looked at data on traffic volume, crashes, and travel behavior over a short period of time. To understand the present status of traffic fatalities and mobility patterns, the majority of studies used limited parameters. All of the prior research has found that travel habits in pandemic scenarios change significantly from those in everyday life. No study compared model performance, validity, or excellence; instead, the majority of research focused on the impact of the pandemic on traffic safety and travel behavior. No previous study has attempted to forecast the evolution of accident and injury data in concert with the COVID-19's growth. The present study is motivated by this fact which aims to provide an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on road traffic collisions, deaths, and injuries, as well as road travel behavior, by building on past research work.",
