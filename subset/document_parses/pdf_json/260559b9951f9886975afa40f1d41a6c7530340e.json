HCPs are at high risk of not only contracting the infection but also spreading it unknowingly. It is of utmost importance to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) and the ability to assess the risks associated with the outbreak. A cross-sectional online survey involving physicians, pharmacists, and nurses was conducted. A 39-itemed questionnaire based on the World Health Organization (WHO)COVID-19 risk assessment tool was shared with healthcare professionals in three purposively selected key divisions of Punjab province. Out of 500 healthcare professionals, 385 responded to the survey. The majority (70%) were aged 22-29 years; 144 (37.4%) physicians, 113 (29.4%) nurses, and 128 (33.2%) pharmacists completed the survey. Overall, 94.8% of healthcare professionals scored adequately (>14) for COVID-19-related knowledge; 97.9% displayed an optimistic attitude (>42) and 94.5% had an adequate practice score (>28). Kruskal-Wallis and Jonckheere-Terpstra tests showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in KAP and risk assessment scores among groups; physicians and nurses scored higher as compared to pharmacists. Further research and follow-up investigations on disaster management and risk assessment can help policy-makers better tackle future epidemics.",

The first situation report by WHO issued on 21 January 2020 on the novel coronavirus reported 282 confirmed cases of the disease in China and other affected neighboring countries [4] . Since then, the disease transmitted to various parts of the world, and on 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the novel coronavirus disease to be a public health emergency of international concern. Soon after, the disease became a global threat to public health and economies, finally transforming into a pandemic disease. On 11 March 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic disease due to the alarming levels of an upsurge in the spread and severity of the disease [5] . The disease spread rampantly, and according to WHO reports, by 19 July 2020 the disease had shown its notorious presence in around 213 countries with more than 14 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and nearly 0.6 million deaths worldwide [6] .",

Preventing nosocomial infections and protecting healthcare workers posed great challenges to the healthcare system during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China [7] . Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at a high risk of infection from the patients if they do not have ample knowledge and awareness about the disease or if they do not take adequate precautionary measures. In China, 2050 cases of COVID-19 were reported in healthcare workers as of 20 February 2020; the majority of the cases were due to lower awareness and experience of handling the disease [8] . Avoiding cross-infection from patients along with effective care delivery can be achieved if the healthcare professionals, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other medical staff, have sufficient knowledge, a positive attitude, and better practices about COVID-19. In addition, better preventive policies and risk assessment of healthcare teams are crucial for an effective response to new emerging pandemics such as COVID-19 [9] .",

More than 91% almost always perform a hand hygiene and washing procedure before or after any medical intervention or procedures. About 89% of participants, in a majority of interactions, perform hand hygiene after touching a patients' surroundings such as beds, doors, tables, and almost 86% of healthcare staff observe social distancing in a majority of interactions and avoid unnecessary contact with the patients. From the remaining 14.0%, 7.0% sometimes avoid unnecessary contact while the other 7.0% rarely or never observe social distancing as it is difficult for them to do so because of the continuous exposure to patients (See Table 4 ). The Kruskal-Wallis test demonstrated significant differences (p-value < 0.05) in the scores on knowledge, attitude, practices, and risk assessment of different healthcare professionals (Table 5) . Overall, the physicians achieved significantly higher scores on knowledge and attitude as compared to pharmacists and nurses. No significant difference was observed on knowledge and attitude scores between pharmacists and nurses. However, the scores on practices and risk assessment demonstrated that the nurses and physicians scored significantly higher as compared to pharmacists (See Figure 2 ). The Jonckheere-Terpstra test confirmed that knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 were significantly associated (p < 0.001) with occupation. A positive trend was further reported, whereby physicians had more knowledge and carried a positive attitude towards COVID-19 as compared to nurses and pharmacists (\u03c4 = 0.411 and 0.398, respectively) (See Table 6 ).

The basic health measures such as washing hands regularly, staying at home, maintaining social distancing, and covering the mouth and nose during coughing and sneezing were effective in controlling and preventing a previously unfolded SARS epidemic in China [27] . Moreover, these measures have proved to be effective in preventing COVID-19 virus transmission [28] . Approximately 90% of participants in our study exhibited better practices of hygiene and handwashing before and after interacting with the patients, which is quite high as compared to the findings of a study conducted in Greece where only 1 in 4 HCPs had a hand-washing routine before and after the patient interaction [23] .",

A few recent studies suggested a supportive and symptomatic treatment approach for disease management and treating secondary bacterial infections [26, 32] . However, antibiotics do not work against any viruses and are only recommended against bacterial infections arising from COVID-19 and not as a preventive measure or a treatment for coronavirus infection [33] . Following the rumors about the possible use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine, the already existing debate about the role of antibiotics in COVID-19 escalated [34] . A randomized controlled trial conducted recently has shown that the use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine may be effective in eliminating COVID-19. However, the trial involved fewer patients [35] and warrants further research to collect evidence on the effectiveness of azithromycin and/or hydroxychloroquine to treat/prevent a viral disease [36] .",
