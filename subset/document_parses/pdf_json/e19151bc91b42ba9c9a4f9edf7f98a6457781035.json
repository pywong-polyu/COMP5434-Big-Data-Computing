In the context of limited resources and absence of a known treatment protocol, this change particularly affected healthcare system, doctors, and the distribution of a life-support therapy. One of the main bioethical dilemmas presented by coronavirus epidemic is the discrepancy between public health ethics, characterized by the fair distribution of limited resources and public safety orientation, and patient-specific clinical ethics. The COVID-19 pandemic forced health workers into tragic situations that they had never previously experienced, when lack of available health care workers, ventilators, or hospital beds creates a necessity to classify and prioritize patients to determine who will get (or will not get) what type of care and where. Another important issue is the digital control of citizens who must reduce their freedom for the sake of the health of other citizens. This caused great concern among many people, who fear that the current situation will lead to their manipulation in the future. There is also a question of responsibility among politicians and authorized organizations for the health of not only the population of their country, but also the entire planet. These and other current issues require bioethical expertise.",

The current epidemic suddenly and radically destroyed all existing ideas about the norm both in medical practice and in society.

One of the main bioethical dilemmas presented by the coronavirus epidemic is the discrepancy between public health ethics, characterized by the fair distribution of limited resources and public safety orientation, and patient-specific clinical ethics. Medical professionals operate under the \"rule of salvation\"-help everyone using all available means. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced health workers into tragic situations that they had never previously experienced, when lack of available health care workers, ventilators, or hospital beds creates a necessity to classify and prioritize patients to determine who will get (or will not get) what type of care and where. Who should be treated: a young person without an education, a driver or a pizza delivery man, a world-famous scientist or a prominent person of culture, whose future work can potentially benefit humanity? How does one decide who to save, who to support with artificial respiration, and who to condemn to death? An answer as informed by a doctor's moral duty would be to do whatever is necessary to treat each and every individual. This is a one-on-one relationship, however, and when there are hundreds and thousands of patients, as seen during war times and epidemics, another set of ethics starts to operate, which could seem callous from the point of view of ordinary moral norms.",

They created a new organization at Foch hospital in France that: -regularizes information from public health physicians (and epidemiologists) and academic recommendations to guide action in a new situation. -holds meetings for clinicians from various disciplines involved in the revision of therapeutic practices to encourage transdisciplinary thinking. -brings together all available scientists (biologists, sociologists, anthropologists, philosophers, lawyers) to develop an informed and legitimate decision, accepted with full responsibility by medical professionals.",

A study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) showed that despite the WHO recommendations, the world's largest megacities used different approaches in recording death rate of their residents from coronavirus. The study \"Moscow and other megacities and countries in the fight against the pandemic\" evaluated the data collection practice of 16 major cities, including Moscow, Berlin, New York, London, Madrid, Stockholm, Tokyo, and Beijing, of their respective pandemic victims [16] . Overall, there are three key approaches to recording and reporting COVID-19 fatalities. Following the first approach, cases where COVID-19 is the main cause of death form a separate group, as done by London and Beijing, and Moscow until April 2020, when it switched to the second approach, according to the BCG report. According to the second approach, cases where COVID-19 is the main cause of death are grouped together with the cases where COVID-19 infection was diagnosed but is not the main cause of death. However, cases with obvious external cause of death, such as injuries, even with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis are not included in this group. Thus, the main data in the BCG report was obtained from the 13 cities, namely, the majority. Finally, eight cities estimate mortality based on a monthly mortality rate data, allowing to estimate a rate of super mortality during the pandemic. BCG states that most cities publish combined data on COVID-19-related mortality among all patients with primary and concomitant diagnosis, with only Moscow providing a group-based mortality breakdown. Therefore, it is currently not yet possible to conduct a full international comparison of the effectiveness of different cities in the fight against coronavirus.",
