These data concur with a similar NSQIP analysis performed by Lu, et al. between 2016 and 2017. Furthermore, these results were in agreement with those established in prior reports that support a significant association between increased risk of malignancy and increasing age in patients who have undergone surgical appendectomy for presumed appendicitis [17] . The rate of appendectomy at Jacobi Medical Center and North Central Bronx Hospital for acute appendicitis was 94%, which also matched the United States NSQIP rate of 95%. The rate of appendiceal cancer at Jacobi and North Central Bronx Hospital of 1.4% was higher than the observed NSQIP rate of 0.53% for appendiceal cancer in acute appendicitis.",

Nevertheless, in patients with few or no risk factors for perforation, surgery can be safely postponed To date, the only gold standard confirmatory test for appendiceal cancer is appendectomy that is usually performed for the presentation of acute appendicitis [31] [32] [33] . In a recent prospective study of acute complex appendicitis, patients with complicated appendicitis who underwent either surveillance or interval appendectomy were found to have an exceedingly high rate of malignancy that even resulted in premature discontinuation of a prospective study [17, 29, 34, 35] . Our findings corroborate recent findings in prospectively collected data, analyzed post-hoc, from the MUSTANG trial [15, 16] . In our local study, 25 of 27 patients (93%) had an appendiceal diameter greater than 1 cm (Table 2) . Taken together we concur that age older than 40 and an appendiceal diameter greater than 1 cm on CT imaging must be considered risk factors for malignancy when considering appendectomy at initial presentation or at a later date [15, 16, 36] . Patients with acute appendicitis managed with nonoperative treatment should be followed with screening colonoscopy and interval, full-dosed contrast enhanced CT imaging based on recommendations from the World Society of Emergency Surgery [37] .",

Nonetheless, this incidence was lower than that observed in our urban, Bronx-based population (0.53% vs. 1.4%). There are several explanations for this discrepancy. NSQIP does not capture every case of appendicitis. This leaves open the possibility that cases of appendiceal neoplasm were missed. This deficiency combined with the larger sample size may lead to a decrease in relative percentages of appendicitis in the NSQIP sample. Another point of possible discrepancy involved the pathologic diagnosis of appendiceal cancer. In the local group, anatomic pathology was performed and reviewed by one group. In NSQIP the data input was entered at the time of initial diagnosis based on a pathology report. It is possible that diagnostic criteria may vary from facility to facility across a national database. Regardless, the overall trends were similar. The incidence of appendiceal neoplasm, in particular appendiceal adenocarcinoma, increased with age and highlighted the need to consider the possibility of underlying malignancy in acute appendicitis in adults over the age of 40.",

Our local data also suggest that the incidence of adenocarcinoma directly correlates with age. However, our local study was limited by its retrospective design and review of patient data from a now unmaintained, older electronic medical record. In the emergency surgery setting, patient followup was poor. Our municipal hospital system also serves underrepresented and an economically disadvantaged patient population with limited adherence in all surgical settings. Furthermore, the practice patterns at our institution, with inclusion of earlier data, reflected a surgical practice pattern that may be limited at other centers, especially outside the United States.",

The \"screening test\" for appendiceal cancer is appendectomy for patients who present emergently with acute appendicitis. Appendiceal cancer is rarely found by colonoscopy or as an incidental finding on CT scan or abdominal surgery for other reasons [41] . However, delayed diagnosis for appendiceal adenocarcinoma may have significant changes in staging and outcome. Further study of these tumors in the acute setting is required to adequately screen patients who may not be eligible for medical management or whose atypical presentation may highlight the need for further oncologic workup prior to surgical intervention.",
