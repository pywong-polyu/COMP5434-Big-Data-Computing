Identity verification, pre-employment screening and appraisals: the bureaucracy associated with each of these processes takes precious time out of a healthcare professional's day. Time that could have been spent focused on patient care. In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, it is more important than ever to optimize these professionals' time. This paper presents the synthesis of a design workshop held at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (RCPE) and subsequent interviews with healthcare professionals. The main research question posed is whether these processes can be re-imagined using digital technologies, specifically Self-Sovereign Identity? A key contribution in the paper is the development of a set of user-led requirements and design principles for identity systems used within healthcare. These are then contrasted with design principles found in the literature. The results of this study confirm the need and potential of professionalising identity and credential management throughout a healthcare professional's career.",

Over the years healthcare service providers have increased the minimum standard for identity verification and pre-employment checks in line with new regulations [1] , [2] . As a result, the time spent on these processes has increased. A House of Lord's report, for example, estimated that 25,000 junior doctor days a year were currently being spent on these administrative tasks [3] . In addition to this, digitisation of healthcare services has further increased the time and complexity associated with managing one's career. In a 2011 US survey, 87% of physicians stated that the leading cause of stress was down to administration [4] and a study of Finnish physicians found that poorly functioning IT systems continue to be a major cause of stress, particularly for those in highly time pressured roles [5] . Another major challenge is within doctors working across both in public health care and also in private practice [6] .",

            "text": "In a crisis like the COVID-19 outbreak, the need for a healthcare service to react to rapidly evolving, location specific, stresses at a Trust or Hospital level cannot be clearer. Different locations may hit their peak at different times, while some areas may only be minimally affected [7] . However, consultation with an RCPE trainee suggests that on-boarding into a new Trust or hospital can take up to two days. This is two days of precious time that could potentially have been spent saving lives. Technological solutions have regularly been heralded for their ability to reduce inefficiencies and streamline patient care. Blockchain technology is just one of the more recent innovations predicted to have a disruptive impact [8] . Often though, the reality in the hospitals is different to the design assumptions made by technologists and the productivity benefits are not always obvious [9] . This paper thus presents an initial set of design principles for any technical solution attempting to reduce the administrative burdens currently placed on healthcare professionals. An analysis of discourse about digital identities, verifiable claims and trust has led to a theoretical set of trust and design principles. These principles were validated in a workshop with healthcare organisations held at the RCPE. This research takes an initial step towards understanding the problem space from the perspective of those currently experiencing it and lays the foundation for future quantitative studies in this area.",

The implementation of the Federation Credentials Verification Service (FCVS) in 1996 [17] , a NCQA-certified platform providing a centralized service for obtaining primary source, verified education information for medical practitioners applying for licensing in the US. As the report [12] outlines, the FCVS reduced the time to obtain a license from 60 days to 25 days. A significant reduction. However, efforts to improve the FCVS highlighted the underutilization of technology in the process. Furthermore 66% of this time is driven by parties outside of the control of the FCVS [12] . These credential verification organisations are often redundant and increase the cost of the whole process.

Trust is harder to define, as there exist more than 70 definitions in academic literature [25] . Trust is seen as a human strategy to cope with uncertainty, such as those we face in relations, actions and innovation [26] . In a digital context, trust is often transferred to cybersecurity measures such as technological controls, certificates, and organisational compliance frameworks. In SSI systems, at least some aspects of this trust shifts from trust between people towards confidence that is placed in cryptographic systems. As Smolenski [27] frames it: trust is being depersonalized. Designing new digital identity systems means mimicking real-life situations in a digital way. Human values, such as ethics and trust need a digital equivalent that users need to accept and understand. How do we design trust from the start? Which design principles are most valued by users and most likely to establish trust in these systems?",

Therefore, he states: an identity system must balance transparency, fairness, and support of the commons with protection for the individual. The Sovrin Foundation [31] adopted Allen's principles and arranged them in three sections, but this causes some confusion as they used one principle twice and made another principle a section above other principles.

Similar work was done in a student project [34] where students compared eight blockchain-based (IDchainz, Uport, EverID, Sovrin, LifeID, Selfkey, Shocard, Sora) and three non-blockchain based SSI systems (PDS, IRMA, reclaimID) against each of Allen's principles with one additional principle [35] . They concluded that some of the blockchain based solutions fulfil all properties, but that some of the non-blockchain-based implementations meet most of the criteria as well. Interestingly, their conclusions as to whether the properties are met do not always match the conclusions of [33] for two systems (Uport and Sovrin) that both projects evaluated. Toth and Anderson-Priddy [36] validated nine prop-erties from earlier sources (e.g. Allen and Sovrin Foundation) and added new properties.

This can be generally summarised as being complex, fragmented; and time consuming in its current form. The process mapping session led to an increased understanding of the identity landscape within healthcare. We began the session with eight identity moments that we framed as being chronological, the idea behind this was to provide a rough skeleton for participants to expand on in their process maps. It came to light that we missed a key identity moment within a doctors career, namely appraisal and re-validation. A process whereby healthcare professionals must prove to relevant authorities that they have gone through the relevant training to keep their skills up to date such that they can still practice. This is a repetitive process that occurs every three years.

In order for this to happen it needs to be led on a national level and show the benefit to the entire ecosystem. It was also pointed out that while benefit to doctors is relatively easy to show it needs to be able to show benefit to the individual trusted entities.

This research as further reinforced the importance of developing user driven systems, ensuring that any solution that does get rolled out is meeting the actual needs of those it is designed for.

The ability to redeploy doctors to highly stressed areas within the service in minutes rather that days -See figure 2. While a portion of these induction processes can perhaps be ignored, trusts still have to meet strict legal requirements around identity verification [2] -this all takes time which could be spent saving lives. In addition to the staffing flexibility an SSI based solution could bring, it also has huge potential to cut costs and increase efficiency. A report from the McKinsey Global Institute estimate that institutions requiring high assurance identification for on-boarding could see a 90 percent reduction in costs [40] . The World Economic forum estimates savings of up to $205 Billion from seamless and secure sharing of medical information between healthcare organisations [41] .",
