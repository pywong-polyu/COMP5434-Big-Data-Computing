PIV are common respiratory pathogens known primarily to cause infection in children. However, immunity is incomplete and reinfection can occur [2] . PIV infection in immunocompromised patients, particularly in the setting of hematologic malignancy, solid organ transplantation, or HSCT [3] , is increasingly recognized and can be associated with a wide spectrum of disease, ranging from mild upper respiratory symptoms to pneumonitis and severe respiratory failure. The mortality rate of PIV lower respiratory disease has varied among studies, reaching more than 50% in some reports [2, 3] . When PIV infection is suspected, the diagnosis is made primarily by detection of PIV antigen by direct or indirect fluorescence antibody testing from a nasopharyngeal wash, swab, or BAL, a test with limited sensitivity but high specificity. Viral culture is also used, but it may take several days to return positive. PIV PCR is highly sensitive and specific, but it may not be readily available or may take more time than antibody assays [4] . Recently multiplex PCR testing has become available for multiple respiratory pathogens including parainfluenza viruses. The University of Chicago lab currently performs the PCR amplification method with analysis by automated nested multiplex PCR by a commercially available assay. The test is performed in house everyday with a 6-to 8-h turnover, and it detects the important respiratory viruses (influenza A; influenza A subtypes H1, H3, and H1-2009; influenza B; respiratory syncytial virus; parainfluenza viruses types 1-4; adenovirus; human metapneumovirus; coronavirus HKU1, NL63, and 229E; and enterovirus/rhinovirus) and three bacterial pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 84, "end": 87, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 233, "end": 236, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 376, "end": 379, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 673, "end": 676, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 677, "end": 679, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1124, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Parainfluenza Pneumonia in Immunocompromised Hosts"}, {"text": "CT scan of the lungs is usually the preferred imaging modality for identifying pulmonary abnormalities [5, 6] .

Many of the patients in these studies had other respiratory co-pathogens, which was associated with higher mortality. Organisms identified included mixed viral infection (e.g., CMV, adenovirus, or respiratory syncytial virus), superimposed bacterial or fungal infection (particularly aspergillosis), and mycobacterial infection [3, 8] . Dual infection with P. jirovecii and a respiratory virus has also been reported [9] . Recently, DAS181, a sialidase fusion protein that cleaves Neu5Ac alpha (2, 3) and (2,6)-Gal linkages of sialic acid from respiratory endothelial cell surfaces, has been used in 16 HSCT recipients with PIV infection (14 with pneumonia), with complete clinical response in 9 patients and partial in 4.
