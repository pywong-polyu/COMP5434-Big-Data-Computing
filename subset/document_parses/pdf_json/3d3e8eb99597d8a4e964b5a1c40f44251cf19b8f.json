This may be particularly detrimental for countries in sub-Saharan Africa that suffer from high burdens of other diseases, including HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria [4] . While no pandemic like COVID-19 has occurred in modern history, the Ebola epidemic in Guinea, for example, ultimately led to more deaths from malaria than those directly caused by Ebola, due to a lack of malaria treatment provision [5] .",

This is because a small fraction of those whose timely ART initiation is delayed until after the disruptions will have progressed to the point at which their CD4 count has fallen too low to be reconstituted or opportunistic infections have become unmanaged.

This would particularly true for disruptions lasting longer than three months. It is also notable that the number of life-years lost to each COVID-19 death may be fewer than those lost to HIV-related deaths, given the strong relationship between COVID-19 mortality and age [17, 18] . The analysis presented here is for four countries Table 2 ; no estimates from Cabore et al. were available for these scenarios [11, 12] . Deaths averted by implementing social distancing and enhanced social distancing are from Walker et al. Yellow bars represent HIV deaths in the 'interruption of supply' scenario; red bars represent HIV deaths in the 'managed disruption' scenario; blue bars represent HIV deaths in the 'managed pause' scenario (all from Table 1 ). Confidence intervals for the HIV mortality scenarios represent uncertainty in the mortality risk for individuals with interrupted ART, ranging from a mean monthly mortality risk of 0.10% to 0.44%. with different population sizes and levels of HIV prevalence, but it is anticipated that the overall direction of the results will be similar for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa with large HIV epidemics. Another study comparing different disruptions to HIV services across five models found broadly similar results for an interruption of six months for 50% of those on ART in sub-Saharan Africa, while our results provide a complementary exploration of the uncertainty in such mortality estimates [19] .",

First, we do not model any interaction between HIV or ART status and COVID-19 infection \u00c0 that is, PLHIV are not assumed to be more or less likely to acquire or die from COVID-19. This may need to be revised as more information becomes available and could influence outcomes, particularly in areas with large numbers of PLHIV who are not virally suppressed. Second, the effect of a disruption on the risk of motherto-child transmission is not included in this model and could result in further deaths and infections not represented here. Third, possible increases in drug resistance due to ART regimens being disrupted are not included, but these could also contribute to excess HIV deaths in the longer term [19] . Fourth, the monthly risk of death is likely to increase over time as individuals accrue time off ART; however, this is not represented in the model. In addition, there may be a great degree of heterogeneity among individuals experiencing an interruption of ART, with those having a history of low CD4 counts and opportunistic infections more likely to have a substantially higher mortality risk than those with many years of ART or high CD4 counts. Finally, disruptions could last longer than represented here and if this were to result in defunding of HIV programmes, the outcomes could be even more catastrophic.",

A reduction in sexual contacts could reduce incidence rates and hence new infections but would have a limited impact on the number of deaths over five years. Furthermore, interruptions to condom supplies could counteract any incidence decline. Reductions in condom availability could also have differential impacts on new HIV infections among different populations; for example, female sex workers might be at higher excess risk than women in stable partnerships. Ensuring support for community prevention programs during the COVID-19 epidemic will help to mitigate these potential effects.",

            "text": "There is also a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the extent of mortality due to COVID-19 in African countries. Three models have released projections of estimated deaths caused by COVID-19 in each country [3, 11, 12] . A model by Cabore et al. [12] from the WHO Regional Office for Africa projects substantially lower mortality (75\u00c094% lower than the Walker et al. projections and 86\u00c097% lower than the Pearson et al. projections with enhanced social distancing for the four countries in this analysis), due to an assumed lower risk of transmission compared to the other models. The relative strengths of the modelling approaches may be debated, but these varied projections show the range of impacts that are being discussed and such context is important: if COVID-19 deaths are closer to those predicted by Cabore et al., even a small proportion of individuals experiencing an interruption in ART, or a larger proportion for a short period of time, could lead to more deaths than from COVID-19 itself. Furthermore, HIV deaths resulting from an interruption in supply could exceed the number of COVID-19 deaths averted by implementing social distancing in both Walker et al. and Pearson et al. It is also possible that the number of COVID-19 deaths occurring beyond 2020\u00c021 could be higher than estimated by these models if a vaccine or effective therapeutic is not found or if suppression strategies delay an epidemic to a later time period.",

            "text": "The assumptions made in this analysis are not predictions of the future, but hypothetical scenarios designed to highlight the importance of maintaining different services during COVID-19 epidemics. The model itself has many limitations, as noted above. Outside of these, the major uncertainties in this analysis can be classified into four groups: (1) uncertainty about the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (both how far and fast will it spread and with what probability of death for those infected); (2) uncertainty into the extent to which HIV programs will actually be disrupted by the COVID-19 epidemic and the response to it; (3) uncertainty about changes to patterns of sexual risk behaviour in response to the epidemic; and (4) uncertainty about the mortality risk of those persons on ART who may suffer an interruption in the supply of drug. The range of mortality effects due to ART disruption will depend on the health and immune status of the person, the drugs they are using and their treatment history, as well as any steps that are taken to prolong supply (e.g., alternate day dosing). It is also possible that interruptions to services could be handled in a more nuanced way than assumed here, for example by prioritising maintenance of ART for those with treatment histories that indicate a greatest risk of opportunistic infections or death. For these reasons, we have repeated the analysis for a wide range of values, but even within this, it may be that the effect has been over-or under-estimated. Empirical data collection would help refine our analysis further, particularly data on ART stock levels in-country, anticipated supply chain issues, and the mortality risk for individuals experiencing time off ART. This analysis shows that the impact of disruptions to HIV services during the COVID-19 pandemic could be limited, if countries are able to maintain key services, but under worst-case assumptions could also be comparable with the range of deaths projected to be caused by COVID-19. Ultimately, ensuring the ART supply for individuals currently on treatment would minimise excess mortality among PLHIV in sub-Saharan Africa and should be a key priority for policymakers.",
