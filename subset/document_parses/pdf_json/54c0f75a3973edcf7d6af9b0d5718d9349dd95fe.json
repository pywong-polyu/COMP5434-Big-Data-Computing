Thirty-five patients were returning travelers with hypoxemic pneumonia due to COVID-19 and had recently returned from one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak (mainly from France and Comoros archipelago). Five patients (14.3%) were found to have pulmonary embolism and two (5.9%) were incidentally found to have deep vein thrombosis on CTPA. Patients with pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis had higher D-dimer levels than those without pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (P = 0.04). Returning travelers with hypoxemic pneumonia due to COVID-19 should be systematically screened for pulmonary embolism.",

            "text": "In the published literature, the incidence of thrombotic complications like pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is highly variable, ranging from 1% to 20%. [5] [6] [7] The incidence of thrombotic complications in our study population may seem relatively high despite that severity score was very low. The incidence that was reported in the retrospective study by Chen et al. 6 was lower (< 1%)-though it should be noted that only 25 of the 1,008 patients (2.5%) examined in that study had undergone CTPA. In the other studies published on the topic, the incidence of thrombotic complications was high because only patients hospitalized in intensive care were evaluated. 7, 8 Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are severe complications of COVID-19. It is important that they can be diagnosed early because delay in treatment can be lifethreatening in the short and long term. In our study, patients without pulmonary embolism had a median D-dimer level < 1 \u03bcg/mL. In the study by Chen et al., 6 the median D-dimer level of patients without pulmonary embolism was 2.44 \u03bcg/mL. In the study by Cui et al., 7 a level of D-dimer of 1.5 \u03bcg/mL was a good cutoff to predict venous thromboembolism (sensitivity of 85.0% and specificity of 88.5%). Last, retrospective studies suggest that preventive anticoagulation is associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, particularly in those with high D-dimer levels. 8 Enhanced preventive anticoagulation should be used in all patients with hypoxemic pneumonia due to COVID-19. 9 The main limitations of our study are that the number of evaluated patients and the number of events were relatively small. Moreover, it was not possible to perform a control group because the vast majority of COVID-19 patients came from Europe by long-haul flight (i.e., > 6,000 km). Reunion Island is located at a distance of 10,000 km from Europe. Air flight is a well-known risk factor for the occurrence of pulmonary embolism, and this risk increases with the duration of the flight. 10 In conclusion, the incidence of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in our study population was relatively high at 20%. Returning travelers with hypoxemic pneumonia due to COVID-19 should be systematically screened for pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis regardless of the level of D-dimers.",
