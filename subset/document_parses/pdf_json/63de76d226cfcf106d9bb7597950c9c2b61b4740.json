            "text": "Disruptions of varying severity often occur in the course of an organization's work to implement new programs or projects. These disruptions may slow their progress or even derail the work altogether. Resilient organizations must be prepared to respond in a thoughtful and timely way to disruptions. Readiness, Resilience and Recovery is an adaptable readiness assessment tool that organizations can use to proceed with their work with insight about their readiness status and how their readiness has been impacted by a disruption. The resulting information can then be used to guide the development of solutions for recovery and build the organization's overall capacity for resilience. Based on our early experience, the Readiness, Resilience and Recovery approach is emerging as a tool that can be useful when organizations face significant disruptions. We have found it to be adaptable to different types of projects, at various points in the implementation cycle, and with multiple types of disruptions. To demonstrate its use, this illustrative paper provides five examples from different projects and settings: Substance Abuse Treatment Services, Multi-Site Sexual Assault Prevention Initiative, Serve and Connect (a Police-Community Relationships Initiative), Carolina Family Engagement Center (family engagement in schools), and Action for Equity (an equity intervention). Practical uses of the tool and conceptualizing it within important implementation science concepts are discussed.",

            "text": "Readiness is an established construct in implementation science. In both the implementation science and organizational literatures there is consensus that readiness is a fundamental precursor to successful implementation of an innovation (a new program, policy, practice or process) (Drzensky et al., 2012; Greenhalgh et al., 2004; Hall & Hord, 2010; Weiner, 2009 ). R = MC 2 , or Readiness = Motivation \u00d7 Innovation-Specific Capacity \u00d7 General Capacity, is an evidenceinformed heuristic which illustrates that readiness requires being both willing and able to accomplish something (Scaccia et al., 2015) . The Readiness Building System, developed by the Wandersman Center, is a comprehensive process to delineate and improve an organization's readiness to implement innovative programs and practices with quality (Imm et al., 2020; Wandersman & Scaccia, 2018) . Organizational resilience has been defined as the ability of an organization to anticipate, prepare for, respond and adapt to incremental change and sudden disruptions to survive and prosper (Denyer, 2017; Xiao & Cao, 2017) . The RRR tool assesses an organization's readiness and identifies areas impacted by the disruption(s). The assessment results, together with action planning and implementation of the plan, can improve resilience by increasing the organization's motivation and capacity to respond and adapt to change when significant disruptions occur. It provides an adaptive approach to the engagement and assessment phases of the Readiness Building System by incorporating questions related to the impact of the disruption (e.g., . Additionally, the RRR tool is structured to encourage comprehensive understanding of readiness for change and to encourage generative thinking that will yield novel solutions which, if effective, may ultimately lead to recovery from the setbacks brought on by major disruptions. Recovery in this case may be a return to \"normal\" or a chosen and preferred \"new normal.\"",

By considering both the innovation and effects of the major disruption, participants are able to clarify readiness strengths and weaknesses.

Motivation refers to the degree to which an organization wants and is committed to the innovation taking place. Innovation-specific capacities are the conditions necessary for a specific innovation (program, policy, practice or process) to be implemented with quality. General capacity refers to the overall ability of an organization to function successfully on a day-to-day basis.

In today's era of rapid change, organizations must be resilient to be successful. Chien and Blachman (2013) described change and disruption on time and intensity dimensions as shown in Fig. 2 , which has been adapted. Figure 2 illustrates the need for readiness throughout the implementation cycle. In the case of the RRR tool, the importance of an enhanced readiness assessment tool is to address the significant disruptions signified by the \"tornado winds\" in the graphic. Organizations all endure some expected changes or disruptions, signified by the \"storms\" in the graphic, which organizations can anticipate and somewhat prepare for. While known or minor challenges are taxing because of their on-going nature, unexpected and severe disruptions can be even more taxing and challenging. In short, not every change requires the RRR tool; routine changes can be addressed through typical use of the Readiness Building System or Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles (McNicholas et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2014) . However, innovation does not occur in a vacuum and is typically accomplished in an environment where other significant and possibly disruptive changes are taking place. Determining those environmental changes and how they are impacting readiness is emerging as an important aspect of the Readiness Building System. Overhaul Resign",

For example, clinics that had unwavering support from leadership, despite being faced with other COVID-19 related challenges, were able to continue making progress. Alternatively, clinics that experienced a \"mismatch\" between the level of leadership support that was communicated and the actual level of support that staff received around the innovation were slower to regain their momentum. The approach allowed the technical assistance providers to see what issues all or most agencies were experiencing and provided valuable information to take back to the initiative's stakeholders. A report was created for the SATS stakeholders that included an overview of what the RRR was and its intended use, \"big picture\" items or what subcomponents seemed to be most affected by COVID-19 across all sites, and major themes in each subcomponent. For instance, big picture items included simplicity, as the perception of the initiative's complexity seemed to increase across all clinics in the context of COVID-19 compared to when the initiative started (see Table 1 for subcomponent definitions). An additional big picture item was staff capacity, as all agencies were reporting that they were understaffed as a result of COVID-19.

When selecting these subcomponents, the TA providers considered which subcomponents were most likely to change given competing needs related to COVID-19, such as priority, compatibility, staff capacity, program champion and resource utilization. Supportive climate was also included given the assumption that leadership's support of the interventions may need to shift as well to focus on COVID-19-related needs. Lastly, the TA providers knew that some sites would be receiving outside, innovation-specific support, such as the developers and trainers of selected interventions, and assumed that access to these support personnel may change.

Following assessment, Change Management of Readiness (CMOR) strategies supported by technical assistance are provided to guide practitioners in improving their readiness in areas of deficiency. The process is relatively sequential and utilizes a strong research base for the assessment and change management strategies for readiness, pulling from cross-disciplinary literature (e.g., Kotter, 2012; Langley et al., 2009; Powell et al., 2012) . It works for implementations that are experiencing normal conditions and routine challenges (Livet et al., 2020) . However, when there is a significant disruption or disruptions, the changes are volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous or VUCA. VUCA is an acronym coined by social scientists working with the US Army War College to describe anything that is not simple and straightforward at the strategic level (Gerras, 2010 , Horney & O'Shea, 2015 . It was necessitated by their understanding that leaders needed new skills to deal with VUCA challenges. Johansen (2017) states that we live increasingly in a VUCA world and particularly cites global climatic disruptions, cyber terrorism, and pandemics as examples.",

RRR serves as a tool where tools are defined as informational resources designed to organize, summarize, and/or communicate knowledge (Wandersman et al., 2012) . Wandersman et al. emphasize the benefits of quality tools, the detrimental effects of poorly designed tools, and the value of engaging tool users in the development and refinement of tools. The importance of tools to organizations experiencing disruptions is exemplified by a corporate VP's statement, \"Today every business is like a new arrival in a VUCA world, requiring different attitudes, skills, language and tools to survive.\" (Emphasis added.

We see it as guiding implementation in two key ways: first to improve readiness and second to make informed choices based on readiness status. As an example of the readiness building purpose, RRR might identify the need to clearly communicate short-term wins, a contributor to motivation, as staff are becoming beleaguered by the adversities posed by the disruption. In terms of making choices, an organization may decide (1) it should suspend an initiative because it just can't be a priority at the time or (2) it may choose to invest its time and efforts in a different improvement effort where there is greater readiness and therefore a greater chance of success.",

Instead, its utility should be studied to determine its usefulness for improving readiness and, in the longer term, its contribution to recovery.

Since utility is the key aspect of RRR's validity, a more structured approach to collecting perceptions and concrete evidence of impact will be needed to demonstrate its utility. These studies should include both qualitative and quantitative measures. Qualitative measures such as interviews and focus groups could be used to assess perceived effectiveness of RRR for improving readiness as well as their perceptions of its efficacy for sustaining, appropriately adapting, postponing or abandoning the innovation itself. Quantitative indicators should include measuring readiness improvement subsequent to using RRR to guide a readiness improvement effort and the extent to which the innovation was able to recover or adapt despite the disruption. The improvement in readiness could be measured by administering the Readiness Diagnostic Scale (Imm et al., 2020) to the larger implementation team pre-RRR and later, post-RRR, in the implementation cycle. Tracking the longer term goal of actually improving implementation progress could be accomplished by clarifying the implementation milestones for the innovation, establishing a measure of the extent to which they were completed on time, and determining whether they were completed with fidelity. In a related, but different aspect of exploring utility, the effect of using RRR to encourage collaboration and innovation as components of agility and resilience is of interest. Research from the management field shows that collaboration is a critical element for successful implementation (Hajar et al., 2020; Williams & Hummelbrunner, 2010) , and one of the characteristics of resilient organizations is that they respond to change and disruption by distributing responsibility for innovation (Cullem & Davis, 2020) . Given the importance of collaboration and stakeholder engagement in complex situations, the levels and diversity of stakeholder involvement in completing the RRR tool should be explored. These findings should be evaluated to assess the impact of such involvement on outcomes. These findings may also inform tool refinement, as well as how it is used, and who should participate in its use.",

Resilient organizations need to be able to respond to multiple disruptive incidents, which may occur simultaneously or sequentially (Sahebjamnia et al., 2018) . Since simultaneous disruptions are likely to occur, RRR development needs to be expanded to support guidance on how to address readiness in the context of multiple disruptions. For example, a school mental health project was expanding its work to include equity goals when COVID-19 hit. That left the organization impacted by two disruptions simultaneously: the challenges of COVID-19 and heightened national attention and sensitivity to racial justice and equity. In this case, the decision was to recommend using RRR twice in a group interview setting, once focusing on the mental health innovations and again focusing on the equity effort. While both initiatives were thought to be likely to be affected by both disruptions, it was anticipated that the disruptions would differentially impact them and that capturing those differences would benefit readiness improvement planning. (However, the approach has yet to be tried.) In the case of A4E, a different approach was taken. The readiness focus which was already underway to address the COVID-19 disruption shifted to a focus on the impact of the racial justice movement, which included elements of access to covid-related health care, but also capitalized on opportunities that were emerging as part of the national attention to racial justice and equity. Even our brief experience with RRR has evidenced that simultaneous disruptions happen and deserve further attention; resilient organizations need effective strategies to be ready for them and to overcome them.",

A more formal evaluation of the tool's use and impact will be needed to verify our preliminary findings.",

However, it can be viewed as a promising practice; our RRR applications demonstrate that RRR is emerging as a needed and adaptable approach to readiness for innovations when disruptions occur and for building capacity for organizational resilience. If the RRR tool's utility for addressing disruptions continues along its current trajectory and provides more substantial evidence of its utility, RRR and the approach it uses may make a significant contribution to the readiness and resilience fields of implementation science.",

RRR has been used in projects ranging from sexual assault prevention to family engagement in children's education. It has been employed in projects with extensive support from technical assistance providers to those with very little assistance. It has been introduced at points in the implementation life cycle ranging from early planning to sustained implementation. Change and occasional significant disruptions are a fact of life for most organizations. Using the Readiness, Resilience and Recovery tool is showing promise as a new approach to understanding readiness needs within the context of adverse disruptions.",
