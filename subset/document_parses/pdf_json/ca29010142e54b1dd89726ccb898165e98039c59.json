Almost all mothers are biologically capable Nutrients 2021, 13, 2884 2 of 16 of breastfeeding their children; there is only one contraindication to breastmilk in children, the classic galactosemia-a rare congenital disorder of galactose metabolism-and there are only few conditions where mothers are recommended not to give their children breastmilk (typically due to the use of medication contraindicated in breastfeeding) [4] . However, recommended breastfeeding practices remain sub-optimal globally [5] . Aggressive marketing of breastmilk substitutes (BMS) is an important barrier to successful breastfeeding and poses a danger to child survival and health [6, 7] . Previous studies have shown that inappropriate marketing of BMS affects breastfeeding behavior as well as the provision of breastfeeding support by health workers [8] [9] [10] .",

Four main categories of promotion were explored (1) the provision of advice or recommendations (virtual or in-person), (2) free samples, (3) coupons, and (4) gifts [26] . For women who were exposed to promotion, we asked about the source and location of promotion. For mothers of infants, we also asked about promotion during the perinatal period [26] . Although NetCode questionnaires use a recall period of 6 months, we asked about the exposure in the previous 30 days to reduce recall bias [26] . We added questions about CMF-PW to learn about marketing tactics relating to these types of products in Vietnam. Exposure to CMF promotion among pregnant women was defined when the women were exposed to either CMF-PW or BMS. We combined all types of CMFs for infants and toddlers to a category of BMS by stage and did not ask about CMF brands. Additionally, through the testing of the questionnaire, we found that women had difficulties identifying specialties or qualifications of the health workers. We combined them by the place the health workers worked (e.g., private or public health facility). These modifications helped us to have a manageable number of questions in the CMF promotion section in the 6-section questionnaires.",

Unlike in some other contexts [31] [32] [33] , we found that the promotion of BMS is not primarily done by health workers at health facilities where they work. Health workers and hospital managers demonstrate a clear understanding of the Code and are not common promoters of BMS; thus, our study suggests that policies have been effective in this regard. Based on the Code in Vietnam [15, 16] , recommended breastfeeding practices (Criteria E1.3) have been integrated as one of 83 criteria under the National Hospital Standards and Accreditation for both public and private hospitals [34] . A hospital found to have Code violations will receive the lowest score (1 out of 5) of the Criterion E1.3 regardless of their performance in any other sub-criteria of this criterion [34] . Conversely, a maternity hospital with a score of at least 4 (good) on Criterion E1.3 is designated as a Baby Friendly Hospital [35] and eligible to pursue designation as a Center of Excellence for Breastfeeding [36] accredited by the Ministry of Health, which can help hospitals to attract more clients and increase their revenue. The inclusion of Code-related indicators within the national quality assurance system may have incentivized hospitals to comply with the Code and penalized the ones violating it. However, we also found that health workers in some small, private clinics and private hospitals promote BMS. Clinics unaffiliated with hospitals are not regulated under the National Hospital Standards [34] while private hospitals might have low motivation to meet the standards under criteria E1.3. Nonetheless, they are regulated by the Code in Vietnam, and our findings suggest that Vietnam needs to strengthen mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing the Code in these types of facilities.",

First, we found that BMS industry representatives promote products within health facilities. The BMS industry employs representatives who are not hospital staff, but who have medical backgrounds and connections within the hospital, to promote products. Findings from the qualitative interviews showed that while BMS industry representatives wear company uniforms, their presence in the health facility is accepted, allowing them to access women, begin to build relationships, and to collect contact information starting during early pregnancy. We found that women are willing to share their contact information if they perceive that the representative assisted them during the hospital or clinic visit or advised them on infant feeding. This tactic has been used by the BMS industry globally to understand and build long-term relationships with the potential customers [18, 23] . The BMS industry leverages the power of association to increase its perceived respectability and connection to the medical field to promote products [23] by encouraging parents to associate BMS with medication and BMS industry representatives with health workers, most clearly evidenced by the employment of former government health workers as representatives or promoters [23, 37] .",

Promotion of CMF-PW is being used as an entry point for BMS promotion, as a part of a comprehensive strategy to build brand loyalty, cross-promote products, and drive sales across the life cycle-'womb-to-tomb' [18] , and across generations [23] . Decree 100 (Article 12.2.c) states clearly that \"Medical establishments cannot permit employees of establishments producing or trading in breastmilk substitutes to meet or contact nursing mothers and pregnant mothers in any forms\" [16] . Thus, by Vietnam law, BMS industry representatives are prohibited from having contact with women in health facilities, regardless of what specific product they are promoting and whether it is covered within the scope of the Code [38] .

Although the Code in Vietnam [15, 16] regulates all channels of BMS promotion, including social media, the monitoring and enforcement of irrelevant ads and information on digital platforms is a challenge [23, 38, 46] . For example, in Vietnam, as of August 2020, although Google and Facebook hold 70% revenue of online advertisements, only 45% of revenue for ads on Google and 30% from Facebook are registered through media agencies registered in Vietnam, which are legally required to comply with local media regulations [46] . Furthermore, conflicting guidelines, inadequate monitoring and enforcement, as well as low penalties for detected violations hamper effective enforcement, even on advertisements registered through local media agencies [46] .",

Similar to other studies in the region and globally [23, 32, 50, [52] [53] [54] , we found that the BMS industry aggressively markets BMS products to women during pregnancy, at the time of birth, and during the postpartum period both in-person and on social media. The fact that almost 90% of the women brought BMS to the maternity facility at the time of childbirth or purchased it at or near by the facility suggests insufficient self-efficacy and unsupportive social norms related to the sufficiency of breastmilk in the first days of an infant's life. The findings suggest the need for improving breastfeeding counseling for mothers and other family members during antenatal care, at the time of birth, and in the early days after birth, and for supporting breastfeeding through the provision of immediate and prolonged skin-to-skin contact, non-separation of the mother-baby dyad, and by reducing unnecessary cesarean sections [34, 35, [55] [56] [57] .",

Previous studies found that mass media campaigns, one-on-one and group counseling, and peer-support initiatives increased breastfeeding practices and improved social norms in Vietnam [62] [63] [64] . For at-risk newborns, including premature, low birthweight, and sick infants who cannot access their own mother's milk, human milk bank services can help to ensure access to life-saving pasteurized donor human milk in the first few days of life [4, 65, 66] .",

Enumerators were thoroughly trained and used hand-held devices, which helped to reduce errors during data entry and collection, facilitated data checking at the central level, and sped up analysis. Few studies have collected and analyzed both qualitative and quantitative data related to the Code from women in diverse provinces in Vietnam. Including in-depth interviews with health workers allowed us to gain insights about the promotion of BMS within the health system.",

The study design limits the generalizability of the findings on the inappropriate marketing practices in Vietnam or elsewhere. However, given that the BMS market leaders in Vietnam are multi-national companies, it is likely that the marketing tactics used in one context are also applied in other contexts, countries, and regions. In-person data collection occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which made some women hesitant to participate in the interview (non-response rate of 14.6% in the initial enquiry for the meeting). During data collection, restrictions on group activities, events, and access to health facilities could have led to an underestimation of the interpersonal, face-to-face promotion of BMS in the findings and an overestimation of the promotion on digital platforms.",
