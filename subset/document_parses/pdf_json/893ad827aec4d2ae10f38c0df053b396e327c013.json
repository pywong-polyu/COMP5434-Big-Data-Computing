Figure 3 presents the pseudo-code of the program that controls the PIP pressure. By using components (4) and (3) the equipment must provide in each ventilation a value previously set by the user to the patient (9) . It consists of a conditional in which it is verified that there is a ventilation or cycle, then in a loop it is verified that everything runs while there is an inhalation and also the pressure (6) that is delivered to the patient is measured. Moreover, through a PID control the values for the proportional valve (3) are obtained until meeting the objective that is the set PIP. In addition, minimum pressure values are verified to determine a minimum pressure alarm. Furthermore, it is established whether the patient circuit is connected or not, all with component (6) . Figure 4 presents the pseudo code of the program that controls the PEEP pressure that must be provided to the patient (9) and that is configured by the user. The algorithm consists of a conditional that verifies that the equipment is in an operating state. Through a loop it is checked that it is in an expiration period and by means of the measured value of pressure (6) it is compared with that configured in the interface. When the condition that the measured value is less than or equal to the set value is fulfilled, then the expiration valve (12) will close. Therefore, the desired residual pressure will be left in the patient circuit (8) . Figure 6 presents the pseudo-code of the control for the start of a ventilation cycle by means of the trigger or trigger sensitivity that is configured by the user. By checking a cycle, the pressure obtained or measured (6) is compared with the Trigger value. If this value is less than or equal to the Trigger, it stops the expiratory cycle (12) and starts a new inspiration (3). In addition, breathing apnea and patient alarms are activated and will be visible and audible in the equipment. The time is taken to compare it with the apnea time set in the equipment and when this is fulfilled the ventilation cycle is restarted by the configured ventilation parameters, that is, frequency, and normal inspiration and expiration times. This is done until a new respiratory effort is obtained from the patient (9). ",
