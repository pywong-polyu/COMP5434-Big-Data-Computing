There is a 50% chance it will arrive in Britain by October 24, 2014 (Reuters 2014f Taken as a whole, these reports are convoluted and often contradictory. For example, the media usually refers to Ramos as a nurse, though she appears to have been a nursing assistant (e.g., Wheaton 2014). The following represents the best effort to provide an accurate description and timeline of Ramos's activities. Ramos entered Brother Viejo's room twice, once to change his undergarments and once to collect his personal belongings after his death (Alexander H 2014; Phillip and Ferdman 2014) . She may have become infected when she touched her face with a gloved hand while removing her PPE (Independent.ie 2014) . However, the use of substandard equipment and poor operating procedures may have contributed to her infection. Hospital staff told the investigators that the PPE they were issued did not meet WHO standards (Kassam 2014a; Phillip and Ferdman 2014) . For example, gloves were simply sealed with adhesive tape. There were other problems with the care of Ebola patients at the hospital as well. For example, medical waste from Ebola patients was transported out of the hospital via the staff elevator (Kassam 2014a) . Ramos left for vacation on the Spanish coast soon after Brother Viejo died (Morris 2014) . On September 30, 2014, she developed a fever. She contacted occupational risk personnel at Carlos III Hospital about her condition. Because her fever was below 101.5 \u00b0F, she was advised to go to her local clinic (Kassam 2014b) . During the early stages of her illness, Ramos used public transportation, visited restaurants and shops, and spent time with friends (Nadeau 2014) . On October 2, 2014, she called Carlos III Hospital again to report that she still had a fever. She was directed [presumably meaning her call was routed] to a department of Madrid's regional health service (Botelho et al. 2014) . It is unclear what she was told, but no significant action was advised (Kassam 2014b) . She called the hospital again today to say she was severely ill (Kassam 2014b) . She was advised to go to the nearest emergency facility, which was Alcorc\u00f3n. She was transported to the hospital by paramedics. At Alcorc\u00f3n, she told the staff she thought she had Ebola, but she was kept in the general emergency ward (Kassam 2014b) .",

It was later revealed, however, that Vinson had sought CDC approval before her flight (NBC DFW 2014; WKYC 2014) . Vinson called the CDC on Monday. She explained her situation, and said she had a 99.5 \u00b0F fever. The person she talked with checked the CDC website for guidance. It said that it was ok for a person with uncertain risk to fly if their temperature was below 100.4 \u00b0F (NBC DFW 2014). Dr. Frieden was not aware of these facts when he made his initial statements. In the future, however, the CDC vows that anyone who has had contact with infected patients will not be allowed to travel on commercial airlines . It is unclear how this travel ban will be enforced, but it has been suggested that people under Ebola surveillance might be placed on the Transportation Security Administration's no-fly list (Sheets 2014) .",

Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia (all associated with Dulles International Airport) will not quarantine returning healthcare workers (Hsu and Henderson 2014) . Aid groups are very concerned that imposing mandatory quarantines will deter healthcare workers from volunteering to work in the Ebola zone (Hsu and Henderson 2014) . The nurse quarantined in New Jersey has identified herself as Kaci Hickox. She was detained at Newark Liberty International Airport after returning from Sierra Leone. She had been treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone with MSF. In a letter to the Dallas Morning News, Hickox described her arrival in the United States and her subsequent quarantine. She says she arrived at the airport about 1300 h on October 24, 2014. The trip from Sierra Leone had taken 2 days. When she told immigration she had come from Sierra Leone, she was taken to a quarantine office. She was there for 6 h. During this time, many people questioned her. At least one of the questioners was from the CDC. After 4 h, her temperature was taken with a forehead scanner. The reading was 101 \u00b0F. Hickox told the officer who took the temperature that she was very upset and the forehead reading was probably inaccurate. However, a more accurate oral temperature was not taken. Around 1900 h, she was told she would have to go to a hospital. Once there, her temperature was taken again, this time both orally and from the forehead. The oral reading was 98.6 \u00b0F, and the forehead reading was 101 \u00b0F. A blood test for Ebola came back negative (Hickox 2014) .",

Today there are three. So it is just a dramatic, dramatic change. And part of it is that there has been, since they set up the unit here, a place to take people who are very sick. That has meant that they are not at home where they're at risk of infecting other people. But they say the biggest change is probably that they have sent health workers out into the community, people from the community who know the people here, and they have told them that the people at Medecins Sans Frontieres are not the people bringing Ebola but the people who are here to help them with that. And they've taught them about hand washing about how not to have contact with bodies. And it has made just an enormous difference.
