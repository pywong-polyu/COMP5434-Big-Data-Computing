The urgent need for antibody detection tools has proven particularly acute in the COVID-19 era. We report a multiplex label-free antigen microarray on the Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry (AIR) platform for detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS, three circulating coronavirus strains (HKU1, 229E, OC43) and three strains of influenza. We find that the array is readily able to distinguish uninfected from convalescent COVID-19 subjects, and provides quantitative information about total Ig, as well as IgG-and IgM-specific responses.",

To address these goals, multiplex analytical techniques are required. A bead-based multiplex immunoassay for six coronaviruses infecting humans (pre-SARS-CoV-2) has been reported, 12 and more recently a 4-plex assay on the Quanterix platform focused on SARS-CoV-2 antigens has been described. 13 Despite these advances, there remains a significant need for analytical methods able to rapidly quantify antibodies not only to SARS-CoV-2, but also to other coronaviruses, and other pathogenic viruses. Most importantly, these must be able to discriminate among responses to different closely related viruses and different antigens from the same virus. To address this need, we have developed a prototype 15-plex array on the Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry (AIR) platform.",

By comparing the intensity of the reflected light to an experimentally validated model, the thickness change for each spot, and therefore the quantity of each analyte in the sample, may be precisely and sensitively determined. 15 We have previously reported the utility of influenza antigen arrays fabricated on the AIR platform for assessment of anti-influenza antibodies in human, animal, and avian serum, 16, 17 both as a tool for viral surveillance and for assessment of the efficacy of a candidate vaccine.",

During development, several printing concentrations and/or solution pH values of each antigen were tested, along with sugar additives (glycerol, trehalose) in order to optimize spot uniformity and morphology as well as initial probe thickness. 22 Preparation of arrays: Arrays were printed on amine-reactive silicon oxide substrates (Adarza BioSystems, Inc.) using a Scienion SX piezoelectric microarrayer (Scienion, A.G.) with spot volumes of approximately 300 pL. Six spots were printed for each antigen, the final layout of which is shown in Figure 1 . The number of spots arrayed was not critical to robust analytical performance or statistical analysis. Each spot consists of approximately 300 pixels when imaged by the CCD in an AIR chip reader (Adarza BioSystems, Inc.), with each pixel representing a discrete interrogation of a unique probe surface region. Therefore, averaging these pixel values together produces an inherently reliable measure of analyte-to-probe response. Dilutions of polyclonal anti-fluorescein (anti-FITC, Rockland Inc.), were printed as negative intra-array controls. After printing, chips were mounted onto adhesive strips at appropriate spacing for 96-well plates, and then placed into 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) for 5 minutes. Next, a 1.5% BSA solution was added to each well resulting in a final BSA concentration of 0.5% to passivate the remaining amine-reactive surface functionality. After blocking for 20 minutes, the chips were transferred to new wells containing 20% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) in PBS-ET as a secondary block, and incubated for 40 min. This step was required to reduce nonspecific binding from human serum at the assay endpoint. The chips were then rinsed briefly (5 min) in new wells containing PBS-ET, then transferred to wells containing Microarray Stabilizer Solution (Surmodics IVD). After a 30-minute incubation, the chips were dried at 40 \u00b0C in an oven for 60 min. This last step renders the sensors shelf-stable, until use in assays performed later.

Overall response to the polyclonal antibody was well-behaved, and titrated to zero as expected ( Figure 2C and D) . Quantitative data are presented in \u00c5ngstroms of build. At the highest concentrations, significant cross-reactive binding to the HCoV-229E spike protein was observed, as well as some binding to the HCoV-OC43 spike protein and MERS S1.

Convalescent serum array responses were compared to an ELISA assay ( Figure 5 ). As ELISA values were all IgG-specific, and AIR data discussed thus far (obtained in a \"label-free\" mode) was a combination of IgG and IgM-specific responses, these results would not be expected to match precisely. Differences in the expression system used for antigen production (baculovirus for commercial antigens used in AIR; HEK 293T cells used for antigens used in the ELISA assays) could also lead to differences. However, overall trends for SARS-CoV-2 antigens correlate well, as shown in Figure 6 . To provide further detail with regard to the response, AIR assays were run using secondary anti-IgG and anti-IgM antibodies to determine class-specific responses for a subset of samples ( Figure 7 ). was the case with assays run using the laboratory AIR assay, analysis using the ZIVA system readily discriminated between negative and convalescent samples (Figure 8 ). Three putative convalescent COVID-19 samples gave responses on all SARS-CoV-2 antigens that were below the threshold for a positive response (two standard deviations above the average of the 16 negative samples). This is analogous to the AIR and ELISA results obtained for sample HD2146, as described above. The remaining 12 convalescent samples gave strong responses on at least one SARS-CoV-2 antigen, with many responding strongly to both RBD and S2",

As such, methods for profiling antigen-specific antibody titers to a range of diseases in addition to the disease of primary current interest are of utility when studying the disease. To that end, we have presented preliminary data on a 15-plex array on the AIR platform, developed in response to the need to study SARS-CoV-2 but incorporating antigens for other coronaviruses and influenza. Responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens on the array effectively discriminated between serum samples from uninfected and COVID-19 convalescent subjects, with generally good correlation to ELISA data. Follow-up assays demonstrated that exposure of the arrays to anti-IgG and anti-IgM antibodies enabled discrimination of antibody isotype.",

F1, F2, and F3 are derived from spotting three different dilutions of anti-FITC. The image at right is a representative array exposed to Pooled Normal Human Serum (PNHS) Assay protocol: A sample diluent consisting of a proprietary buffer (Adarza BioSystems, Inc.), 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and in some cases (polyclonal antibody titrations; discussed later), pooled normal human serum (PNHS; 10% v/v, Innovative Research) was used to dilute monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies as well as donor human serum samples to appropriate standard concentrations. Wells in a 96-well plate to be used for target solutions were first treated with a preblock solution for 40 minutes (10 mg/mL BSA in 1x mPBS-ET, pH 7.4, 0.2 \u03bcm sterile filtered). This was then pipetted out, and replaced with target solution. Arrays were incubated with target solutions overnight at 4 \u00b0C with orbital agitation on a microtiter plate shaker (500 RPM). Chips were then removed after target analyte exposure and rinsed by transferring to wells containing PBS-ET for 5 min, twice. After washing, chips were rinsed under flowing 18-M\u03a9 water and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Finally, the substrates were imaged using a prototype AIR Reader and internally developed imaging software at several integration times with dark field subtraction. AIR assays run using the commercial Adarza Ziva instrument were incubated 30 minutes at room temperature before undergoing automated processing and imaging by the instrument. AIR antibody class assessment: To determine whether samples consisted of a primarily IgG-or IgM-based response, we performed an experiment including a secondary antibody incubation step. After overnight primary incubation with a selection of both positive and negative samples (based on prior AIR assays), chips were removed from sample wells and washed twice with PBS-ET. Then chips for each sample were placed in wells containing either anti-human IgG,",

With initial qualification of the array completed, we turned our attention to examination of a series of human serum samples. At the outset of our study, few samples from known COVID-19 patients were available. Thus, the first individual donor samples constituted a small group of healthy individuals with no known COVID-19 diagnosis. Later, a set of 15 samples were obtained from convalescent COVID-19 patients at least 14 days out of active disease, and acquired via the University of Rochester Medical Center's Healthy Donor protocol.Figure 3shows a comparison of array images obtained for FBS, PNHS, and a representative convalescent COVID-19 patient. Strong responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens are readily visible in the array exposed to the COVID-19 patient's sample. Differences in the response of the known positive sample to non-SARS-CoV-2 antigens relative to PNHS are readily visible, and discussed in more detail in the context of quantitative analysis, below.",

Quantification of responses was conducted for all arrays as described in the methods section, with results presented for 1:5 dilution samples in Figure 4 (A). Most samples from convalescent COVID-19 patients yielded robust responses to at least one SARS-CoV-2 antigen.Small negative \"build\" values indicate subtle difference in sample matrix relative to the control, and can be discounted. Sample HD2135 produced minimal signal on all coronavirus antigens.After unblinding the clinical details of these subjects, we discovered that this sample derived from a person self-reporting COVID-19, but with no recorded positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Sample HD2146 also was unreactive with SARS-CoV-2 antigens, despite having experienced COVID-like symptoms and receiving a positive PCR result. Similar results were obtained via ELISA with this sample (vide infra), suggesting the discrepancy was not technique dependent.Samples were also run at a 1:20 dilution; as shown inFigure 4(B), results were similar but not identical to the 1:5 dilution results. It is likely that nonspecific binding by serum proteins influences the results from more concentrated samples, and thus future experiments will focus on 1:20 and higher dilutions.",
