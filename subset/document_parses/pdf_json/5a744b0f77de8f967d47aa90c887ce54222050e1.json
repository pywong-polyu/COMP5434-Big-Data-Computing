The modeling approach can be used for the optimization of the delivery in a highdimensional parameter space. In the first part of the review, we present several approaches to the study of some limiting steps of gene delivery. A major limiting step remains the success of plasmid escape from an endosomal compartment. In the second part, we present models of viral entry, the endosomal step and trafficking in the cytoplasm.

            "text": "Gene therapy is a new therapeutic strategy that offers the promise of treating diseases through insertion, alteration, or removal of genes within an individual's cells and biological tissues. In general, any drug molecule must reach its intended site of action to exert its effect and to avoid non specific potentially dangerous interactions. A daunting hurdle of drug delivery is the large amount of charged molecules such as DNA that need to reach the cell nucleus. Indeed, the DNA molecule must initially pass through the cell membrane, traffic inside the cell cytoplasm to finally enter the nuclear pore in a form suitable for transcription to start. To overcome efficiently these barriers, the genetic material is usually associated to a viral or synthetic vector (see figure 1 ). Viruses have developed evolutionary tools to enter cells and get transported towards the different compartments such as the nucleus and finally to reproduce using the protein synthesis machinery of the host cell (see figure 1 -b). However their use presents several limitations: viral vectors are not safe and have been implicated in death during clinical trials [4] , they can trigger an immune response and thus cannot be administrated repeatedly. Finally, the size of the transferred genome is limited by the nucleocapsid architecture. To overcome the difficulties imposed by the use of viral particles as vectors, synthetic vectors such as lipids, cationic polymers, peptides or combinations thereof, have been developed in parallel. In particular, the most common used vectors for nonviral gene delivery are cationic lipids, first introduced in 1987 [5] and later on cationic polymers [6] , followed by improved [7] polycations such as the polyethylenimine (PEI) for transfection experiments. Cationic lipids are macromolecules consisting of an aqueous core enclosed in a spherical phospholipid layer with positively charged head groups, while polycations are positively charged polymers which can have different structures (linear or branched). Both molecules are able to condense and neutralize DNA molecules through electrostatic interactions between their positive charges and the negatively charged DNA phosphate groups. In both cases, polycations protect DNA from undesirable degradation and facilitate entry into cells.",

In particular, the endosomal escape remains a major barrier in gene delivery and prompt release from an endosomal compartment presumably constitutes one of the critical steps in determining the efficiency of transfection. In addition, the cytosolic motion of large DNA molecules is limited by physical and chemical barriers of the crowded cytoplasm [10, 11] : whereas molecules smaller than 500 kDa can diffuse, larger cargos such as viruses or synthetic gene vectors, require an active transport system [12] such as the microtubules (MTs). Consequently, to understand how molecular components of gene vectors can affect quantitatively their ability to pass through these two main limiting barriers of gene expression, we will present a review on our recent biophysical models for both viral and synthetic vectors. Indeed, while modeling the endosomal escape of viruses will help to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying their reliable escape at a given pH, a model of the free cytoplasmic step will allow to analyze the active transport along MTs, which increases the probability that a viral particle reaches a nuclear pore in comparison with a Brownian synthetic gene vector.",

To circumvent this barrier, an approach consists in transferring naked nucleic acids by inducing a membrane destabilization. An externally applied electrical field can temporarily disrupt areas of the membrane allowing polar molecules to pass, then the membrane can reseal quickly and leave the cell intact [13, 14, 15] . This method, commonly known as electropermeabilization or electroporation, provides versatility and efficiency, but it suffers from non specific transport across the membrane which can lead to ion imbalance and thus improper cell functions. It can also lead to irreversible cell damage if the electrical field is too strong. Microinjection also permits rapid delivery of genes to the cytosol or the nucleus by using a glass micropipette to inject genetic material into cells.",

Although the exact pathways leading to endosomal escape are not fully elucidated, they are limiting steps in gene delivery. Most viruses possess efficient endosomolytic proteins allowing them to disrupt the endosomal membrane, such as the VP1 penetration protein of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) [16] or the influenza hemagglutinin (HA), [17] . In addition, the biophysical mechanism leading to endosomal membrane destabilization and concomitant plasmids release for synthetic vectors is still poorly understood. However, in both cases, acidification of the endosome is needed to trigger endosomal escape. For viruses protons or low pH activated proteases bind viral endosomolytic proteins, triggering their conformational change into a fusogenic state [17, 16] . Polyplexes (DNA/cationic polymer) use a different strategy to escape endosomal compartments, based on the so-called proton sponge mechanism. Indeed some polycations have a high buffering capacity in a wide range of pH thus preventing the DNA from degradation and inducing an influx of chloride Cl \u2212 ions to maintain electrical neutrality. The osmotic pressure due to the influx of Cl \u2212 ions causes endosome swelling and eventually membrane disruption.",

While the cytoplasmic movement of viral particles towards the nucleus is facilitated by the microtubular network and viral proteins, very little is known about the fate of non-viral DNA vectors in the cytoplasm. However, trapping of large DNA particles (>500 kDa) in the crowded cytoplasm drastically hinders their cytoplasmic diffusion [10, 11] and subsequently diminishes the transfection rate of synthetic gene vectors. In addition, one of the critical barriers in polyplex-mediated gene delivery is the timely unpacking process of the complexes within the target cell to liberate the DNA for efficient gene transfer [18] . A desirable property of a gene carrier is that it strongly binds to DNA to form more compact structures that can provide better protection of genetic material against nucleases and efficient transportation through the cytoplasm. However stronger polycation-DNA interactions produce a counterproductive effect on the timely release of DNA for transcription. Therefore an ideal vector would be capable of binding strongly to the DNA during the early stages of intracellular transport and to release the DNA right before nuclear entry.",

Later on, the genetic material will be involved in the cellular transcriptional machinery. Some viruses such as AAV are able to transiently disrupt the NE [19] , delivering their intact capsid for disassembly inside the nucleus. However, most viruses translocate inside the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) by using nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). This facilitated nuclear import can accommodate the transport of molecules with diameters of up to 39 nm [20, 21] . Thus, small viruses such as hepatitis B virus [22] or baculoviruses [23] can cross the NPC and disassemble inside the nucleus. In contrast, larger viruses such as HIV [24] or influenza [25] uncoat inside the cytoplasm, or near a NPC, for the adenovirus [26] . The released components contain NLSs and are thereby able to cross the NPC. Viral derived NLS peptides associated to polycations have also appeared to enhance the nuclear delivery of genes [27] .",

Polyplexes with positive surface charges are formed when the number of positive charges of the polymer exceed that of the negative DNA charges. When a polyplex encounters the cell surface, it interacts with the negatively-charged cellular membrane and can be taken up into the cells via endocytosis. In the intracellular environment the polyplexes are located in endosomes that become acidified. In this case, DNA is prone to degradation by lysosomal enzymes. In order to transfer DNA cargo to the nucleus, polyplexes must escape from endosomes. This transmembrane mechanism or endosomolytic process remains unclear and it is believed that high gene transfection Protons bind to the polycation thus increasing its charge density and stiffness due to higher Coulomb repulsion between monomers.

            "text": "efficiency observed with PEI is due to its ability to avoid endosome acidification and to promote complexe's release through a mechanism called \"proton sponge\". This mechanism can be summarized as follow (2): the PEI contains amine groups, which can be protonated at low pH. Thus due to an influx of chloride ions Cl \u2212 to maintain the overall electroneutrality, and water molecules, the endosome starts swelling leading to an increased osmotic pressure, a destabilization of the endosome and ultimately disruption. It has not been proved yet whether the stress produced by the proton sponge effect and by the swelling are the only mechanisms responsible for the endosomal membrane disruption. However, recent experimental evidences argue in favor of this escape mechanism [36] . There are other possible mechanisms responsible for endosomal disruption such as swelling of the endosome due to internal charge repulsion triggered by an increased of ion concentration in the endosome. This effect implies a direct physical interaction between the DNA-PEI complex and the endosomal membrane. The PEI-DNA complex can escape an endosome through a membrane hole, probably due to direct interaction of polymers with membrane [37] . For example, the interaction between the cationic polymer PEI and cellular components [38, 39] lead to Gramnegative bacteria membrane disruption by free PEI, [40] . Furthermore, PEI also causes a liposomal membrane permeability to increase [41] . Thus, PEI is capable of destabilizing lysosomes and this suggests that it enables the DNA conjugated to the PEI to escape into the cytoplasm. Finally, a wide variety of nanoparticles, including different cationic polymers can physically disrupt lipid membranes by forming nanoscale hole and membrane thinning [42] . Cationic polymers contribute to expand existing defects or can directly induce small holes.",

            "text": "We used [58] the Metropolis algorithm [65] to sample the most probable states of x i and Fig.3 summarizes the configuration distributions for various pH. At physiological concen- tration C s = 0.15M and pH = 7.4, then pH \u2212 pK \u2243 2.7, that is 50% of monomers are protonated, higher than experimental measurements (20% of protonated sites [66] ). DNA-PEI complex seems to evolve to different configurations depending on the pH. In Fig. 4a , the DNA-polycation forms a complex. The polycation is only partially charged (indeed 20% of the amine groups are protonated [66] ). The polycation behaves almost like a flexible chain, while DNA monomers are subject to strongest Coulomb repulsion making it stiffer and more extended, and almost immobile during complexation. Fig. 4b and 4c show the DNA/PEI complex configurations respectively at pH = 6 and 5, during the endosomal acidification. Increased protonation could induce swelling [63] of the complex and consequently promoting endosome rupture. The result in [58] predicts that increasing attraction between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes lead to a more compact complex structure. Upon increasing the protonation state of the PEI, the positively charged chain condenses more tightly on the DNA, which become more flexible because its charged are now screened. The resulting complex resembles a typical toroid configuration found for DNA interacting with multivalent ions [67] . The same polyplex structure was previously obtained [68] by solving numerically modified Poisson-Boltzmann equations for the electrostatic potential and the polymer concentration. These results [58] suggest that two oppositely charged polymers condense upon lowering pH and thus this mechanism cannot be responsible for the swelling of the endosome and endosomal membrane disruption. We shall now review another simulation sets, aimed to better characterize an experimental procedure where the DNA molecule is mixed in solution with a fixed concentration of PEI, where the ratio r = N/P of the N amine to P phosphate groups is fixed. A value of N/P = 4 \u2212 10 has been reported from experiments [61] and we simulate a DNA molecule with N 1 = 100 monomers when it is complexed with 20 polyactions, each of length N 2 = 20, making the ratio r = N/P = 4. We use the same numerical method as described above with many polycations. Fig. 5a shows the equilibrium configuration of the DNA complexed with the small polycations at physiological pH with periodic boundary conditions, while Fig.5b and 5c represent the influence of acidification in a confined spherical microdomain. At physiological pH, the DNA complex is less compacted and more flexible due to an excess of positive charges resulting in additional screening, compared with the situation of two chains only (Fig 4a) . During acidification, at higher charge fraction of the PEI, some polycations are released from the complex and are free to diffuse in the endosome. The presence of free polycations has been also observed experimentally [69] . Recent experiments [70] have shown that purified polyplexes without free PEIs were less efficient in transfection compared to non-purified polyplexes. Hence interaction of free PEIs with the endosomal membrane, could play a role in endosomal escape, however a detailed model of membrane destabilizaton due to membrane-polymer interaction is currently missing.",

            "text": "To better understand how viruses can be used as gene vectors, we now focus on one of the fundamental step of early infection, where the viral particles travel inside an endosome. Indeed, most viruses enter cells in an endosomal compartment, after binding to specific membrane receptors. To undergo cytoplasmic or nuclear replication [71, 72] , and to avoid degradation in acidic lysosomes, viruses must then successfully escape the endosome. Enveloped viruses, such as Influenza, contain membrane-associated glycoproteins mediate the fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes. In particular, acidification of the endosome triggers the conformational change of the influenza hemagglutinins (HA) into a fusogenic state, leading to endosome-virus membranes fusion and genes release inside the cytoplasm. Developing a biophysical model of the influenza endosomal step offers a general framework to study the influence of several parameters such as the endosomal size, the number of viral particles or the molecular structure of glycoproteins on the efficiency of viral escape. In particular, fusogenic peptides derived from viral glycoproteins are increasingly used in cationic synthetic vectors [8, 9] , and the pH-sensitivity of fusogenic glycoproteins can now be tuned by modifying the electrostatic stability of the fusogenic complex [73] . These engineered glycoproteins shall serve to design efficient gene vectors and quantitative models will help optimizing glycoprotein molecular properties with respect to the endosomal escape efficacy of the vector.",

These models are based on considering the accumulation of discrete proton binding events, leading to the conformational change of HAs. This is the limiting step of genes release in the cytoplasm and the model was built into two steps: first, by fixing the concentration of protons, we used a Markov jump analysis to estimate the mean time for protons to bind the HA binding sites until a threshold is reached, triggering its conformational change into a fusogenic state. Interestingly, our analysis allow to extract from the HA conformational change kinetics measured experimentally at different pH [75] the binding rates and the number of bound sites that are needed for the protein to change conformation. Second, coupling the pH-dependent conformational change of HA glycoproteins with a linear proton influx rate, we analyzed the endosomal escape dynamics of influenza viruses. We predicted [74] that the size of the endosome drastically impacts both the escape kinetics and pH, which reconciles different experimental observations: while a virus can escape from small endosomes (radius of 80nm) in the cell periphery at a pH \u223c 6 in about 10 minutes [76] , it can also be routed towards the nuclear periphery, where escape from larger endosomes (radius of 400nm) is rapid (less than one minute) at pH 5 [77] . We shall now review in details the modeling of these two steps.",

In that case, they still have to travel through the risky cytoplasm to a small nuclear pore to deliver their genetic material. However, for viruses using the other pathway leading directly to the perinuclear area, the escape endosomal pH drops to \u2264 5, thus this exposure leads to possible HA degradation resulting in greatly diminishing the escape capacity. Consequently, it is not clear which pathway is more efficient for viral gene delivery. [88, 76] , where fusion occurs after 10 minutes at pH 6 [76] (orange pathway), or it can fuse with dynamic early endosomes (DEE) traveling along microtubules, to reach the perinuclear region and rapidly fuse from larger endosomes (green pathway) [77, 88] . In the second case, fusion time is decreased to 1 \u2212 2 minutes and the escape pH drops to 5.

In addition, fusogenic glycoproteins are increasingly used in many synthetic drug delivery systems such as siRNA delivery systems [94] or cationic synthetic gene vectors [8, 9] . Thus, the generic model developed in [74] for the influenza virus can be extended to this large class of viruses and synthetic vectors. Furthermore, the pH stability of influenza glycoproteins has been recently tuned by incorporating or removing electrostatic bonds into the fusogenic complex [73] . Consequently, developing biophysical models to quantify the endosomal escape kinetics and pH of viruses with respect to glycoproteins molecular properties is timely and could be further applied to optimize gene vector design. Indeed approaches developed in [74] can predict the endosomal time course of vectors or mutant viruses covered by these HA variants. In [74] , we have predicted that using stabilized forms of HA glycoproteins [73] shifts the escape pH in small endosomes from 6 to 5, which may prevent vectors to use the peripherical endosomal pathway ( figure 6 d-e) . Consequently, if genes degradation inside the cytoplasm is a limiting barrier to transfection efficiency, we predict that stabilized mutant viruses may increase the ability of vectors to deliver genes to nuclear pores.",

Interestingly large viral particles have developed nuclear targeting signals to be actively transported along microtubules, which resulted in drastically decrease their arrival time to the nucleus [12] . It remains a challenging question to analyze their associated viral trajectories, which consist of a succession of free or confined diffusion and/or ballistic periods [95, 71, 96] . The analysis of such random trajectories starts with the position X(t) at time t of the gene vector, which is a stochastic process [81, 98] and the dynamics depends on forces applied on the particle. When the motion of the gene vector is purely diffusive such as for cationic synthetic vectors, the overdamped equation for the velocity is simply dX/dt = \u221a 2D dW/dt, where W is the standard Brownian motion.

We believe that any understanding can lead to a rational method to optimize the construction of polycations. In the second part, we presented some general modeling approaches to quantify cytoplasmic trafficking of enveloped viruses, such as influenza. It remains to find strategies to design these new synthetic gene vectors and for that goal, viruses appear as optimal models. Hybrid vectors made of a mixture of viral glycoproteins and polycations seem to be a promising direction and physical modeling and numerical simulations are certainly seducing tools to optimize the construction of such nano-scale carriers.",
