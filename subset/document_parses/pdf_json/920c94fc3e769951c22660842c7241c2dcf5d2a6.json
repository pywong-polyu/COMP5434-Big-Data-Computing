This hydrophobic motif has been reported to constitute a Golgi-targeting signal or a second TM domain. However, no structural data for this or other extramembrane domains in CoV E proteins is available. Herein, we show that the E protein in the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus has only one TM domain in micelles, whereas the predicted \u2424-coil-\u2424 motif forms a short membrane-bound \u2423-helix connected by a disordered loop to the TM domain.

In the transmissible gastroenteritis virus, the absence of E protein resulted in a blockade of virus trafficking in the secretory pathway and prevention of virus maturation (21, 22) . In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), viruses lacking the E gene showed attenuation and did not grow in the central nervous system (23, 24) , whereas stress response genes were up-regulated and cell apoptosis increased (25) . These results suggested a role of E protein in both tissue tropism and pathogenicity, where modulation of stress responses contributes to viral attenuation. In fact, SARS-CoV \u232cE attenuated viruses constitute promising vaccine candidates (26 -28) .

SARS-CoV E protein and other CoV E proteins have channel activity in synthetic membranes (29 -31) . This channel activity is mediated by formation of pentameric oligomers (32) (33) (34) and is only very mildly selective for cations (35) . The only available structural data for CoV E proteins, obtained using synthetic TM peptides, is derived from the channel-forming TM domain in SARS-CoV E (32, 34, 36) . No structural data are available for the predicted N-or C-terminal extramembrane domains despite the latter being critical for viral assembly (37, 38) , although some results have been obtained using shorter synthetic peptides encom-passing this domain (39) . The C-terminal domain of E proteins contains a totally conserved proline residue, which in \u2424and \u2425-coronaviruses is at the center of a predicted \u2424-coil-\u2424 motif (Fig. 1A) , reminiscent of viral internal fusion peptides (40 -42) . In SARS-CoV E, this motif was found to be responsible for redirecting a plasma membrane protein to the Golgi region. Conversely, mutations designed to increase its \u2423-helical propensity disrupted localization to membranes (43) .",

The PRE effect was measured using 15 N HSQC spectra of the S60C mutant before spin labeling and after MTSSL and dMTSSL labeling. The titration experiments with HMA, Nsp3a, or SH(45-65) were performed with 15 N-labeled E TR in a 1:4 molar ratio of SDS/DPC micelles at 318 K. Chemical shift perturbation (CSP) values were calculated using the following formula.",

Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a Biacore 3000 system (GE Healthcare) using 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% n-octyl-\u2424-D-glucopyranoside, and 0.27% C14-betaine at 25\u00b0C.

Kinetic measurements of immobilized E TR association with Nsp3a and SH(45-65) (49 nM to 25 M in 10 2-fold serial dilutions) were performed with a 1-min association phase and 5-min dissociation phase at a 30 l/min flow rate.

However, the yield of pure protein was low due to the presence of truncations (not shown). Nevertheless, the pure sample obtained (Fig. 1, C and D) was sufficient for backbone assignment in SDS micelles, although not to produce a three-dimensional model. Therefore, a series of hexahistidine-tagged SARS-CoV E constructs were screened to obtain an expressing and well behaved sample. The best construct, encompassing residues 8 -65, was successfully expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography in milligram amounts without any enzymatic cleavage steps. This truncated construct (E TR ; see Fig. 1B ) has an N-terminal His tag and a 16-residue linker that connects it to residues 8 -65. The purified peptide appeared in MALDI-TOF MS as a single-charged peak at 8,997 Da and a double-charged peak at 4,512 Da, consistent with the calculated molecular mass of E TR , 8,995 Da, and a small proportion of larger (dimer to pentamer) oligomers (Fig.  1E ).

Upon the addition of 5-DSA, a slight intensity reduction was observed around residues 11-20 and 40 -55 (Fig. 2C) , suggesting that these residues are located at or near the micelle surface. The addition of 16-DSA caused pronounced intensity reduction in the stretch of TM residues 19 -40 and periodically in the stretch 48 -61 (Fig. 2D) . Together with the H/D exchange data (Fig. 2, A and  B) , these results again demonstrate the presence of a single TM domain and suggest that the stretch of residues 55-65 corresponds to a domain bound to the surface of the micelle. Finally, a 1 H-15 N steady-state heteronuclear NOE experiment (Fig. 2E) showed that the protein forms a well folded structure, with high 1 H/ 15 N NOE values. However, more dynamic regions (lower 1 H/ 15 N NOE values) can be observed (i) at the N terminus and (ii) at residues 46 -55, which connects the TM domain to the proposed membrane-bound domain. The latter is predicted to be \u2423-helical (Fig. 2F) . Table 1 were used in a calculation to obtain a total of 15 structures, with a root mean square deviation of 0.27 \u03ee 0.11 and 0.70 \u03ee 0.13 \u00c5 for backbone and all heavy atoms, respectively (Fig. 3A) . A longer \u2423-helix (residues 15-45) encompasses the TM domain, which is connected to another shorter C-terminal \u2423-helix (residues 55-65) by a flexible (see Fig. 2E ) linker domain (residues 46 -54), forming an L-shape. The short extramembrane helix may be partially bound to the micelle surface, as suggested by the pattern of intensity attenuation of paramagnetic reagents (see Fig. 2, B and C) .

When reconstituted in DMPC membranes, E TR and E FL produced an almost identical spectrum, with an amide I band centered at 1,655 cm \u03ea1 (Fig. 4B) characteristic of a predominantly \u2423-helical conformation. Overall, these data show that both E TR and E FL (i) are predominantly \u2423-helical and (ii) have a secondary structure that is not significantly affected by the reconstitution environment, supporting the relevance of the E TR structure (Fig. 3) . 13 C\u2423 Chemical Shifts-13 C\u2423 chemical shifts are highly correlated with secondary structure (72, 73) . Comparison of 13 C\u2423 chemical shifts of E TR and E FL in SDS (Fig. 4C) shows that E TR shifts (red) are almost identical to their counterpart residues (residues 8 -65) in E FL (blue). In E FL , the shifts for the last 10 residues (residues 66 -76) are predicted to correspond to random coil, which is consistent with results obtained previously with a synthetic peptide spanning residues 59 -76 (39) .
