To clarify the role of HCQ in Covid-19 patients, we carried out a retrospective observational study of 4,396 unselected patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Italy (February-May 2020). Patients' characteristics were collected at entry, including age, sex, obesity, smoking status, blood parameters, history of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and chronic pulmonary diseases, and medications in use. ese were used to identify subtypes of patients with similar characteristics through hierarchical clustering based on Gower distance. Using multivariable Cox regressions, these clusters were then tested for association with mortality and modification of effect by treatment with HCQ. We identified two clusters, one of 3,913 younger patients with lower circulating inflammation levels and better renal function, and one of 483 generally older and more comorbid subjects, more prevalently men and smokers. e latter group was at increased death risk adjusted by HCQ (HR [CI95%] \ufffd 3.80[3.08-4.67]), while HCQ showed an independent inverse association (0.51[0.43-0.61]), as well as a significant influence of cluster * HCQ interaction (p < 0.001). is was driven by a differential association of HCQ with mortality between the high (0.89[0.65-1.22]) and the low risk cluster (0.46[0.39-0.54]). ese effects survived adjustments for additional medications in use and were concordant with associations with disease severity and outcome. ese findings suggest a particularly beneficial effect of HCQ within low risk Covid-19 patients and may contribute to clarifying the current controversy on HCQ efficacy in Covid-19 treatment.",

            "text": "Despite these elements and initial suggestive evidence of efficacy based on daily clinical practice, in the last months, the potential benefit of HCQ for Covid-19 patients has been harshly debated [3, 5] . In particular, evidence supporting protective effects from observational studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] was in contrast with that suggesting no effect at all by recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . More recently, a meta-analysis combining both RCTs and observational studies over more than 44,000 patients supported a protective effect of HCQ, driven by the findings of observational studies [5] . A potential explanation for this discrepancy may be due to the usually high dosage administered in RCTs (800 mg/day), compared to lower dosages reported in observational studies supporting HCQ efficacy (\u2264400 mg/day), as hypothesized elsewhere [5] . As an alternative explanation, it is likely that the efficacy of HCQ treatment for Covid-19 may vary across patients and is influenced by subtypes of the disease, which in turn is largely dependent on patients' characteristics and their nonlinear combinations [19] . In this \"personalized medicine\" view, response to HCQ may not be the same across all patients of the same age, or with similar circulating inflammation levels. In order to identify these combinations, the use of big data like Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and of machine learning (ML) algorithms to interpret hidden HCQ response patterns is of fundamental importance. ML is an umbrella term covering different algorithms designed for the identification of hidden patterns, information mining, and variable classification/estimation through modelling complex (including nonlinear) functions, usually adopted in a big data setting. ese algorithms can be generally classified into supervised and unsupervised approaches. e formers are designed to learn to predict specific outcomes after proper training of the algorithm in independent datasets, trying to model relationships and dependencies between the input variables (or features) and the target prediction output (or label). In unsupervised algorithms, the machine simply learns to identify hidden patterns across a high number of observations over many features, without the need for labels, and is more descriptive-rather than predictive-in nature. ese algorithms have shown promising findings in public health, in the management of both chronic [20] and acute health conditions [21, 22] , but also during the current pandemics. In particular, useful ML applications have been reported in the prediction of Covid-19 diagnosis and prognosis [23] . Notwithstanding this, to the best of our knowledge, only one study attempted so far to predict response to HCQ treatment within Covid-19 patients, through the application of a supervised ML technique (gradient boosting). Interestingly, the authors reported a reduction of in-hospital mortality within patients treated with HCQ, which was even more Journal of Healthcare Engineering pronounced within those patients predicted to benefit most from the drug, in line with expectations [19] .",

Only patients with complete information needed in each model were included in the analysis (case-complete approach; see below). A preliminary check of the basic Cox PH assumptions revealed no influential observations based on dfbeta residuals ( Figure S3a ), while Schoenfeld residuals tests revealed a statistical violation of the proportionality of hazards assumption, although these did not show any evident trend at a visual inspection ( Figure S3b ). For this reason, we carried out Cox PH models both with and without including an interaction term with time-to-event, a strategy commonly used to overcome this violation [34] . Incrementally adjusted models were analyzed: i) a crude model including only patients' clusters (Model 1; N \ufffd 4,319); ii) a model testing additive influence of clusters and HCQ use (Model 2: Model 1 + HCQ; N \ufffd 4,212); and iii) a model testing both additive and synergistic influence of clusters and HCQ use (Model 3: Model 2 + clusters * HCQ; N \ufffd 4,212). Additional sensitivity analyses were carried out to rule out potential confounding effects of additional drugs in use for Covid-19 treatment (Model 4: Model 3 + other drugs). Risk estimates were computed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of dying, and HR with p values below \u03b1 \ufffd 0.05 were considered significant. To quantify the potential for unmeasured confounding effects, the E-value was calculated for all the HRs observed in Model 3, as described in [35] (https://www.evalue-calculator.com/). is represents the minimum association required for a potential unmeasured confounder with both the exposure and the outcome to explain away the observed association. In other words, the higher the E-value, the harder it is to attribute an association to an unmeasured covariate [36] .",

In this case, the resulting binary variable was assigned a value of 1. Conversely, the variable got \"0\" value if one of the following alternative conditions is applied: (i) none of the above mentioned outcomes was verified; (ii) a patient survived without recurring to intensive cares or (iii) without showing severe manifestations of the disease. Six patients with missing values on survival were removed. en, we modelled the risk of manifesting a bad outcome through a logistic regression (glm() function in R), modelling both additive and interactive models of Covid-19 patients cluster and HCQ use, as above. is analysis was motivated by the fact that the curse of disease often differs across patients, e.g., with some subjects with less severe forms suddenly worsening their conditions until death and others having severe manifestations but still surviving, possibly thanks to intensive cares. erefore, a composite outcome variable represented a robust way to measure potential risk/protective effects of patients' clusters and HCQ use.",

Moreover, survival analyses showed an almost four-fold increase of incident in-hospital mortality for the high risk compared to the low risk cluster. Although a previous study attempted to identify subtypes of Covid-19 patients, associating them with disease severity [37] , this represents the first attempt to use clustering in disentangling the effect of HCQ on different types of patients, by testing associations with incident inhospital mortality risk. Specifically, we tested and observed both additive and interactive associations of HCQ and Covid-19 subtypes. Indeed, the high risk cluster was consistently associated with increased mortality across all models, while treatment with HCQ was generally associated with a halving of death risk, in line with previous evidence from both observational [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and experimental studies [19] . While we already reported evidence suggesting a protective influence of HCQ against mortality in a largely overlapping sample [13] , here, we have further deepened this relationship by testing and reporting a significant association between cluster-by-HCQ interaction and mortality, which was driven by a differential association within the two clusters. Indeed, the low risk cluster showed a significant \"protective\" influence of HCQ on in-hospital deaths, while the high risk cluster showed a concordant but nonsignificant association. is represents an element of novelty of the present study, since, in our previous work, we observed a \"protective\" association between HCQ and mortality within the totality of patients (about 75% of the current sample size), and when stratifying by age, sex, and other characteristics [13] , but not within different subtypes of patients combining all these characteristics together in a nonlinear setting, as can be built through unsupervised ML algorithms. Moreover, here, our evidence is supported also by concordant associations with a composite and possibly more robust outcome of the disease, based on the occurrence of death, access to ICU, and severity of manifestations.",

HCQ treatment was associated with higher survival in the treated harm, and especially within those patients that were predicted to benefit most based on a supervised ML algorithm applied to their characteristics, which included blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, white blood cell and platelet count, lactate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and bilirubin levels [19] . Interestingly, lactate and creatinine levels were the most important features in this algorithm [19] , the latter representing an index of renal function, which was also a characteristic feature of the low risk cluster in the present study, where HCQ was more effective. Moreover, patients eligible for HCQ treatment as derived by the algorithm of [19] were shown to be younger and less comorbid than the whole population studied, in line with the evidence reported in the present work, suggesting that HCQ treatment may be more effective for younger patients with better general health conditions.",

As for drug therapy, we cannot rule out that assignment to specific treatments was driven also by clinical conditions of the participants, as usually found in common clinical practice. For the same reason, the protective association observed for HCQ may be hypothesized to be driven by other coadministered medications. However, here, HCQ and patients' cluster showed significant independent associations, which remained substantially stable across models and survived correction for other drugs in use for Covid-19 treatment. Lastly, our evidence is in contrast with RCTs published so far [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , which are commonly conceived as the gold standard for establishing drug efficacy and safety. While we generally agree with this view, we would like to underline that these studies did not randomize patients to treatment arms based on combinations of their features, but rather based on single characteristics such as age and sex. is may be the reason for this discrepancy, along with the hypothesis that the high dosage of HCQ administered in RCTs may be harmful for Journal of Healthcare Engineering patients, compared to lower dosages reported in observational studies supporting HCQ efficacy [5] . Of interest, a recent critical review underlined the aspect of suboptimal randomization methods of RCTs, which often do not take into account the whole patient profile and disease severity and may lead to misleading conclusions [38] .",

In the future, further studies on independent datasets are warranted, possibly using supervised ML techniques as in other clinical settings (e.g., [39, 40] ), to validate this hypothesis and test the feasibility of predicting responsiveness to HCQ before intervention. Ideally, a trial administering low dosages of HCQ (\u2264400 mg/day) and randomizing subjects based on their Covid-19 subtype profile rather than on single characteristics may be warranted to clarify the effects of HCQ on mortality risk in SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially within those patients with a \"low risk\" profile. is may help solving current controversies on the use of HCQ as a medication for Covid-19 and maximize the efficacy of treatment strategies for this yet largely unknown disease, especially in low-income and developing countries with poorer national health systems.",
