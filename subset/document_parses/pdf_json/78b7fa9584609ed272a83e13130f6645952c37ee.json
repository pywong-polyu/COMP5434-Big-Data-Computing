This represents a missed opportunity for monitoring and identifying gender-responsive, evidenceinformed solutions to address a key driver of the pandemic. In this paper we review the availability of national sex-disaggregated surveillance data on COVID-19 and examine trends on the testing-to-outcome pathway. We further analyse the availability of data according to the economic status of the country and investigate the determinants of sex differences, including the national gender inequality status (according to a global index) in each country. Results are drawn from 18 months of global data collection from over 200 countries. We find differences in COVID-19 prevention behaviours and illness outcomes by sex, with lower uptake of vaccination and testing plus an elevated risk of severe disease and death among men. Supporting and maintaining the collection, collation, interpretation and presentation of sex-disaggregated data requires commitment and resources at subnational, national and global levels, but provides an opportunity for identifying and taking gender-responsive action on health inequities. As a first step the global health community should recognise, value and support the importance of sex-disaggregated data for identifying and tackling an inequitable pandemic.",

For example, sex-disaggregated data, particularly if also disaggregated by age groups, can identify whether risks of poor health outcomes are higher in men or women in certain age groups (e.g. the elderly). Disaggregated data can also be used to monitor whether interventions/ services are reaching all sections of the population equally -for example keeping track of whether some groups in the population are less likely to be reached by vaccine programmes. The United Nations General Assembly considered disaggregated data as essential for the \"design, implementation and evaluation of effective policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\" (United Nations General Assembly, 2020). Moreover, disaggregated data contributes to human rightsbased accountability systems that monitor inequities across populations, and furnishes evidence for remedial actions to address and reduce inequities (Williams & Hunt, 2017) .",

Surveillance data from the United Kingdom have shown that exposure to COVID-19 varies by occupation, gender, class and ethnicity. Three out of four workers in the most highly-exposed occupational groups, including health workers and care workers, are women, 6 of the 16 occupational groups are paid less than the national median hourly wage, and people from minority ethnic populations are \"over-represented\" in these highly exposed occupations (Office for National Statistics, 2020).

Endler et al.

Other studies (Kumari, Mehta and Chaoudhary, 2020; Bisht, Sarma and Saharia, 2020) also point towards the difficulties faced by pregnant women in seeking regular check-ups.

Compared to women of a similar age, men appeared to have a higher risk of severe infection and death. This was not entirely unexpected-disease outcomes are frequently unequal in men and women. In the previous coronavirus epidemics (e.g. SARS (Karlberg et al., 2004) and MERS (Chen et al., 2017) ) similar differences were recorded. Such sex/gender differences are not limited to the coronaviruses but are seen in both communicable/infectious diseases and the non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease) (Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2020)-with variously men or women experiencing the highest burdens and impacts depending on the nature of the exact pathogen or the disease itself.",

Sex and gender interact across the lifecourse, and as Stefanick and Schiebinger (2020) point out, investigating the nature and extent of this interaction \"enhances the quality of science, health, and medicine and contributes to global human health\". In the case of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) analysis of sex/gender can provide important evidence on biological mechanisms influencing disease pathways in the human body (Takahashi et al., 2020) , as well as identification of the social/structural drivers that influence risk and vulnerability (Adams, 2020; Stefanick & Schiebinger, 2020) . It has been reported that immune system differences between males and females lead to differences in outcomes of COVID-19 infection (Scully et al, 2020) and may influence responses to vaccines (Gee et al, 2021) . In part this may be due to women's \"heightened [biological] immune response compared to men\"-something that may protect against severe disease and decrease risk of death (Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2020), but could potentially also lead to more adverse vaccine reactions being suffered by women. Meanwhile gender, embedded in institutions and systems in society (Agarwal, 2021b) , and embodied through behavioural norms and experienced at the level of the individual's gender identity-what Connell (2015) , refers to as the 'gender order' of any society-may drive differences inter alia in rates of exposure to the virus (and the power to isolate away from exposure), the likelihood of compliance with protective interventions (such as mask-wearing or vaccine uptake), patterns of care-seeking including testing uptake, and access to health services, including through characteristics such as service accessibility or affordability (Hawkes & Buse, 2020) .",

The total number of cases and deaths reported in the tracker may differ from the most recent numbers reported by a country for two primary reasons.

Secondly, these figures reflect only the total number of cases/deaths where sex-disaggregated data is available, which may only be a portion of total numbers in some countries. Reporting of data is also limited to what countries themselves make available, which, as noted, is categorised as male/female (i.e. no mention of transgender and/ non-binary categories). A major limitation is the lack of data that would allow a more in-depth intersectional analysis of the data and an absence of data on secondary health impacts. In the tracker we have found very few examples of country data that takes a more intersectional lens to the surveillance system (Kapilashrami and Hankisvsky, 2018) . While 55 countries do report both age and sex, no countries report specifically on rural/ urban distribution. Migration status is not recorded in COVID-19 surveillance data, although some countries (including those with high numbers of migrants) do report whether or not any individuals are considered to be nationals or \"other\" (including visitors, migrants, etc.).

This is congruent with other studies showing gendered patterns of healthcare-seeking and health protection: men generally have a lower use of health services, including for prevention and screening interventions, compared to women (Teo et al., 2016) . Reasons for men's apparent under-utilisation of testing services deserves further investigation, but highlights the need to have more gender-responsive public health communications and interventions. Identifying and addressing the social and structural barriers to low rates of access to testing services (e.g. such services are only open during formal working hours) has been shown to be more effective than simply increasing communications telling people to 'go get tested'. For example, to increase HIV testing among men in Tanzania, Conserve and colleagues (2019) report a range of changes that the health system could make to increase men's accessibility to services.",

In part this may reflect underlying biological vulnerabilities: men's immunological responses to viral infections are known to be less strong compared to women's responses (Klein & Flanagan, 2016) . But in addition to sex, gender may also be playing a role-including in providing explanations for women's possible under-representation in the data. For example, the lower rates of hospitalisation in women compared to men may reflect women's lack of power within families and across society resulting in unequal access to hospital services and to intensive (and costly) interventions within the health system. Such findings have previously been noted in the case of health-care pathways across a range of conditions (Saikia, Moradhvaj and Bora 2016) , and the sex-disaggregated results from the data tracker deserve further investigation and analysis of this potential source of bias and inequality.",

For the majority of the 55 countries men are at higher risk of death at all ages, but in a smaller number of countries there is evidence that women in the reproductive age groups have higher mortality rates (although this is reversed again in the older age groups). These findings do not currently provide any robust evidence of the potential adverse impact of COVID-19 among women of reproductive age, including on their pregnancy outcomes-as reported in the studies from cross-sectional surveys-but highlight both the importance of further investigation as well as the need to have more rigorous and comprehensive data disaggregated by age, sex and ideally by pregnancy status. Our analysis of the relationship between gender equality status of a country and male:female COVID-19 mortality ratios (Fig. 4) finds that the closer the country is to gender equality (as measured within the Gender Inequality Index of UNDP), the smaller the mortality gap between men and women. In highly gender unequal countries, the mortality gap is greater. This finding may not be as unexpected as it first appears. Although we did not see a relationship between GII and pre-COVID mortality ratios, other authors have noted statistically robust relationships between gender equality status and health behaviours (both harmful and protective) and health outcomes. For example, at aggregate national levels there is evidence of a relationship between gender equality/inequality and tobacco-smoking ratios (i.e. the ratio of female:male tobacco smokers in a population). Hitchman and Fong (2011) examined cross-national associations between the United Nations Development Programme's gender equality measure (GEM) and female:male smoking prevalence ratios. Adjusted for levels of economic development and income inequality, their models suggested that gender equality at national level is associated with a smaller female:male smoking prevalence gap-in other words, women forming a higher proportion of all smokers the closer the country moves to gender equality.",

Applying a gender lens to understanding the excess mortality in men, the role of gendered lifetime risk exposure to tobacco, alcohol, air pollution, and other environmental and behavioural risks requires further analysis. Analysis over several decades has shown that the non-communicable diseases are driven by the intersection of poverty, inequality and education, as well as gender (Barbeau 2004; Cortese & Ling, 2011; Williams et al., 2018 ). But at a structural level these exposures are also driven by commercial interests seeking to derive a profit from the sale of unhealthy products such as tobacco, alcohol and ultra-processed foods-exposures that may be more often experienced by men in many settings (Allen et al., 2017) . Adams (2020) in her cross-national analysis of the relationship between gender equality and COVID-19 mortality in OECD countries found that \"\"the percent of the full-time workforce comprised by women is positively related to the percent of female Covid-19 deaths across countries\". Our own analysis did not find a statistically significant association between the COVID-19 mortality ratio and women's labour force participation. We did, however, find that the mortality ratio was associated with the country income level and proportion of the country urbanised. The mortality ratio declines as countries become richer and more people live in urban areas-both variables which may, of course, be associated with increasing gender equality at the aggregate national level. Chant (2016) characterises (with reservations) cities as 'good for women' and highlights the widespread understanding that 'urbanisation is conducive to greater gender equality ' (p.21 ).",

The regulations do not, however, stipulate that surveillance data should be sex-disaggregated. Recognising the importance of sex and gender to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO COVID-19 monitoring and evaluation framework published in June 2020 and aiming to provide guidance to countries on systems indicators to \"monitor preparedness, response and situations\" recommends collection and reporting of sex-disaggregated data on testing, cases, deaths, hospitalisation, case fatality rates, and case rates in health workers (WHO 2020a).

By applying a more intersectional lens to addressing health generally and COVID-19 in particular our understanding of and response to this pandemic will be more equitable and effective. Despite the multiple benefits of sex-disaggregated data, however, our review of national surveillance system outputs has highlighted the relative absence of such fundamental data in many health systems. Unlike more intersectional data on other social and structural determinants of health and wellbeing, such as ethnicity, wealth, occupation or education, data on sex or gender (or sometimes both) are a core existing variable for much of clinical and public health practice. In our collective experience (across many economic regions), health system data-including data on hospital admissions and death certificates-at a minimum includes data on sex (and usually on age too). This puzzling absence of sex-disaggregation in an age of data surveillance, data harvesting and analysis on an unprecedented scale, likely reflects more on the low priority accorded to understanding and addressing sex and gender in health systems, rather than a failure to collect such data in the first place. It may also, of course, also reflect the inherent and long-standing biases within the health and medical systems and professions whereby the 'norm' of the male body has been the default for millennia and there has been a welldescribed lack of attention paid to issues of both sex and gender.",

We therefore encourage the independent expert committee established by WHO (UN News, 2020) to review the IHR, to on the one hand reinforce the call on countries to report sex disaggregated data and, on the other hand, to use the review as an opportunity to enshrine within the IHR a system, administered by WHO, to collate and centrally publish country-reported data. Second, while Global Health 50/50 have been able to fill in some of the sex-disaggregated COVID-19 data gaps over the past year, the pandemic reveals that a more formal and sustainable system for reporting sex-disaggregated data is long overdue-and not just for outbreak data. While this will require additional resources, if the global health community is committed to gender equality, then supporting sex-disaggregated data should be a central part of effective, evidenceinformed and equity-focused responses to this and other urgent health problems.",
