            "text": "The very first mortality has caused a shift in our policy priorities amid the pandemic, with more attention being paid to public health interventions and strategies to control the spread and impact of the coronavirus. Like most governments around the world, the current COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the Canadian government to implement some extreme measures including, for instance, banning public gatherings, imposing social distancing, mobility restrictions, isolation and quarantine as part of public health responses. However, the impact of such policy actions on the 'social isolation and loneliness' (SIL) of older people especially those living in LTCHs has been mainly overlooked. It is worth noting that before the COVID-19 pandemic, SIL was reported to be highapproximately 50%-among Canadians aged 65 and over, particularly those with comorbidities (eg, physical or mental illness, cognitive deficits) or in marginalised groups, and those experiencing life transitions (eg, loss of employment, or a spouse). 5 6 The pandemic has further exacerbated this problem by limiting social interactions between residents in LTCHs and their families or loved ones. Families play a fundamental role in caring for older persons, for instance, there is evidence suggesting that one in five Canadian families assist their older members for more than 10 hours/week. 7 The supportive and interactive culture of LTCHs also encourages families' participation in providing care, including emotional and social support and paying regular visits to their loved ones. 8 But since such interactions and visits have been enormously disrupted by the pandemic, the SIL of older persons residing in LTCHs is increasingly becoming a concern.",

According to the 2016 Canadian census, 6.8% of Canadians aged 65 years and above were living in a nursing home (NH) or residence for older adults. This proportion jumps to 30.0% among Canadians aged 85 years and older. 9 10 The majority of LTCH residents live with many chronic medical conditions and are more likely to be immune compromised. Thus, the LTCH settings are particularly vulnerable to the spread of infectious diseases such as influenza and other similar respiratory pathogens. 11 McMichael et al 12 have previously argued that navigating between multiple NHs was a significant contributing factor in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This was similar to the conclusion given by Chen et al after analysing the first large-scale geolocational data from 30 million smartphones 13 where 7% of smartphones appearing in an NH also appeared in at least one other facility, even after visits were restricted.",

But while doing so, more residents are being disconnected from friends and families resulting in perceived isolation and loneliness. As an outcome, SIL arises with a reduction in people's social contacts and networks. Thus, the reduced sociability of the older persons does not start only with age but is also linked first to the reduction of their professional networks, then to the shrinking of their relational networks. 14 This implies that it is not just age that, in itself, creates isolation but also the social context within which a person aged plays a significant role. Institutionalisation tends to limit individuals' movements leading to a decline in autonomy and contact with established social networks, hence it is considered one of the risk factors for SIL. 15 16 Other risk factors of SIL include, for example, living alone, being unmarried (single, divorced, widowed), not participating in social groups, having fewer friends and strained relationships. 17 SIL has been identified as a determinant of older people's health 18 and a risk factor of premature mortality 19 or for poor physical and mental health, for example, cardiovascular diseases as well as depression and anxiety disorders. 20 Therefore, the older persons in LTCH need to regularly interact with LTCH staff as well as connect with their families or loved ones. The positive resident-staff interaction involves any non-verbal or verbal exchange 21 22 that is meaningful for LTCH residents. 23 24 However, interactions like rushing residents during care, juggling concomitantly with several tasks, speaking rapidly and limiting interaction (giving a meal or clearing the table without wording) have the propensity to negatively impact the well-being of residents. 25 26 One recent descriptive cross-sectional study was able to quantify resident-to-staff interactions in 59 assisted livinglesser demanding housing compared with LTCH. 27 They observed that 39.7% of interactions occurred in residents' rooms, 31.9% were care related and 27.4% were one-on-one sessions. 27 They also found that as for the type of staff, nursing led accounted for 40.2% of interactions followed by support staff (eg, dining aide; 24.6%).",

            "text": "So far, there has been a dearth of literature on SIL reduction in LTCHs. The two existing reviews 28 29 were both published in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic and have focused on older persons from all settings. In their scoping review, Fakoya et al 28 identified six interventions that have the potential to reduce SIL in older people, namely (1) social facilitation interventions, (2) psychological therapies, (3) health and social care provision, (4) animal interventions, (5) befriending interventions, and (6) leisure/skills development. However, the systematic review by Chipps et al 29 has found inconsistent and weak evidence on using electronic interventions for SIL reduction. The activities offered in NHs to address SIL vary in their composition and the number of persons targeted. Most NHs use a group-based or one-to-one intervention approach 30 to reduce SIL. Additionally, Theurer et al 31 also identified the use of outings, but other studies also reported strategies such as supporting older people to engage in purposeful activities. 32 With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the activities previously used by LTCH to combat SIL (eg, games and outings) have become less effective. 33 Furthermore, some of the conventional information and communication technology (ICT) platforms (Skype, FaceTime, etc) used by LTCH to connect residents with their families 34 are not that effective either. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic reveals some successful interventions like the use of remote synchronous and asynchronous digital chattering systems, the telephone system or contact behind a glass screen, which allow older people to connect with their families or loved ones.",

What are the current PBPs implemented in LTCH to alleviate SIL in the older persons during the COVID-19 pandemic and over the previous pandemics, namely SARS and H1N1? 2. How does the use of these best practices reduce the SIL during the COVID-19, SARS and H1N1 among LTCH residents?

Stage 2: identifying relevant studies and the grey literature We will begin by comprehensively mapping academic publications and the grey literature to identify all sources of information relevant to our review questions. To facilitate this stage, we will use the three-step search strategy to retrieve both published and unpublished articles, as recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). 42 The search will be performed in the English language. A concept plan will be built with the identified keywords and descriptors to perform the query of the databases.

Our collaborative research built on the co-construction approach will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), 54 55 working closely with knowledge users (eg, older persons, LTCH managers, families/caregivers, frontline staff and researchers) to collectively create mitigation strategies against SIL in LTCH. By laying out their needs for the PBP, knowledge users have been and will continue to be involved in every step of the review to generate usable and practical findings. This integrated KT model is important for (1) identifying the key interventions arising from this research project; (2) determining the principal target audiences for each of these interventions; (3) seeking out the most credible stakeholders for these interventions and engaging their interest in becoming involved in disseminating and implementing the review findings; and (4) launching a KT strategy grounded in the best available search evidence. We will use a diverse range of approaches to validate and disseminate our preliminary findings to different stakeholders, including an interactive workshop that will bring together the key target audiences for our research. The workshop will explore appropriate strategies and implementation methods and will define success indicators based on the five CFIR domains (intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of individuals and process) and by integrating patientpartner aspects, and minorities. In addition, a virtual hackerspace 56 open to friends of older adults, LTCH users, older adult associations and interested members of the public will be also launched to complement the outcomes of the participatory workshop. This will also be an opportunity to gain insight into the various experiences of digital use interventions by stakeholders (eg, older adult experts, family caregivers, frontline staff) and identify additional practices which are socially acceptable or user-friendly and effective. These strategies will ensure that the research continues to reflect the relevant needs of the end users of this information and to facilitate the appropriate dissemination of outputs. Meanwhile, some potential challenges related to this scoping review might be anticipated. It might be difficult to categorise the data outcome measures accurately due to the heterogeneity of the interventions (eg, distinguishing between quantitative/qualitative or mixed/ hybrid approaches or those not formally categorised). Second, it might be challenging to interpret the effectiveness of the interventions and categorise them as 'significantly beneficial' or 'not beneficial'. However, we have a strong team with diverse experience in implementation science, nursing health service organisation, digital technologies and research methods, and are planning to hold stakeholder meetings to iteratively receive in-depth feedback from our end users.",

The LTCHs were given a little specific consideration in the establishment of measures aimed at countering the effects of a crisis like the COVID-19. [20] [21] [22] Furthermore, it appears that older adults residing in LTCHs, in the context of minority (eg, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning, and Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2S+), indigenous population, immigrants, veterans, etc), [17] [18] [19] are most affected by SIL. As an example, so far, in Ontario (Canada), white Ontarians have experienced the very lowest reported number of the COVID-19 cases, rates of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and death, compared with other groups (eg, Latino, Asian, Black\u2026). 57 The proposed scoping review will be performed to identify the PBP and policies of interventions designed to alleviate SIL in older adults in LTCH. It will draw on the evidence to create an inventory of operationalised practices to reduce the impacts of SIL among older adults in LTCHs during health crises. By mapping and grouping interventions, we intend to determine and propose the type of interventions that are more likely to be effective in LTCHs during future health crises. In doing so, we will discuss and highlight the positive and negative impacts of each selected intervention, as well as the barriers and facilitators that affect their use in LTCHs during a pandemic response. Moreover, we will provide insight into how the use of innovative technologies will be optimised in LTCHs. This review will allow us to produce a strategic action plan that is grounded in knowledge users' feedback and make recommendations on the PBPs and policies designed to alleviate SIL in older adults and provide safe and quality care in LTCHs during health crises.",

First, by including only the English and French literature, we might be missing some articles published in other languages. Second, as the current COVID-19 pandemic is still fraught with waves, by targeting COVID-19-related interventions, our review might not be exhaustive since some interventions are still being experimented. Nevertheless, the knowledge generated from this project will guide practices in engaging older adults, families, managers and knowledge users in health innovation research. This research project will ultimately contribute to the development of a solid knowledge based on the impacts and effects of stakeholder engagement in decision-making to mitigate SIL among older adults. Additionally, it will help in promoting the use of innovative technologies Open access to support healthcare and health services, while optimally integrating effective value-added technologies for older adults in the health system. The review will help build a strong partnership between knowledge users and researchers, which will be useful for further research. Furthermore, it will contribute to guiding the effectiveness of social interventions for alleviating SIL during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as in postpandemic.",
