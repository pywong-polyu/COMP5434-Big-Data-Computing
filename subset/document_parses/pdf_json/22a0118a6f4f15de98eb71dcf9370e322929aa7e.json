            "text": "As of late December 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has afflicted greater than 79 million people across the globe, with over 1.7 million deaths. 1 Approximately 5% of patients have required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) with prolonged periods of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. 2, 3 In certain patients, early tracheostomy provides significant benefit by reducing sedation, duration of ventilatory support and ICU stay, and rates of intubation-induced laryngotracheal injury. 4, 5 However, tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 has major clinical implications for risk of viral transmission to healthcare providers and other patients. 6 This has led to a spirited global debate about best practices and special considerations for perioperative care of patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies. 7, 8 Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract samples (i.e. nasal cavity, nasopharynx, or oropharynx) have become the current gold standard for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 infection. 9, 10 This is due to high test sensitivity and specificity as well as ease, safety, and reliability of specimen collection. 10 Though more difficult to collect, NAATs of lower respiratory tract samples are associated with lower false-negative test rates. 11 These include tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, and sputum samples. Clinicians have also seen variable SARS-CoV-2 shedding depending on anatomic site and time point of sampling. 12, 13 Patients with tracheostomies placed during their COVID-19 disease course have an anatomically altered connection between their upper and lower airways that could theoretically impact the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Multiple case reports have shown discordant detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx versus trachea for patients with a history of laryngectomy. 14,15 On the contrary, a recent prospective cohort study of 15 patients with tracheostomies either with or without underlying COVID-19 (experimental vs. control groups) reported greater than 90% correlation between nasopharyngeal (NP) and tracheal (TR) samples for their patients. 16 In this manner, there exists conflicting information in the literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 detection at different anatomic sites for patients with tracheostomies or laryngectomy stomas.",

Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) adults at least 18 years of age; 2) confirmed COVID-19 infection on hospital admission by positive NAAT on NP swab specimen; 3) tracheostomy placed after admission by percutaneous or open surgical technique; and 4) at least one set of posttracheostomy NP and TR specimens obtained within a 48-hour period. The 48-hour period was chosen based on high concordance of repeat testing within this window and practice guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 retesting in patients with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 but initial negative tests. 9, 10 Clinical documentation was reviewed to collect demographic information and pertinent clinical variables such as comorbidities.

In the few published case series with this framework, test concordance and accuracy were quite high. 13, 25 The optimal testing strategy for hospitalized patients with tracheostomies due to COVID-19 remains unclear. To de-escalate special pathogens precautions in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies, our institution requires either: 1) two negative NP swabs collected more than 24 hours apart plus one negative TR specimen; or 2) two negative TR specimens collected more than 24 hours apart plus one negative NP swab. 18 This testing framework allowed us to analyze the concordance rate of nearly simultaneous (i.e. within 48 hours) NP and TR tests in our population. The majority of patients (n = 32, 70%) in our cohort had concordant positive or negative NP and TR results (Fig. S1) .",
