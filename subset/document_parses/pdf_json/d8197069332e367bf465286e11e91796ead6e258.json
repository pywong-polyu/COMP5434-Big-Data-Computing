Evidence indicates that primary and tertiary prevention and improved treatment of somatic conditions in patients with SMI could reduce this excess mortality. This paper reports a protocol designed to evaluate the feasibility of a coordinated co-produced care program (SOFIA model, a Danish acronym for Severe Mental Illness and Physical Health in General Practice) in the general practice setting to reduce mortality and improve quality of life in patients with severe mental illness. Methods: The SOFIA pilot trial is designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial targeting general practices in two regions in Denmark. We aim to include 12 practices, each of which is instructed to recruit up to 15 community-dwelling patients aged 18 and older with SMI. Practices will be randomized by a computer in a ratio of 2:1 to deliver a coordinated care program or usual care during a 6-month study period. A randomized algorithm is used to perform randomization. The coordinated care program includes educational training of general practitioners and their clinical staff educational training of general practitioners and their clinical staff, which covers clinical and diagnostic management and focus on patient-centered care of this patient group, after which general practitioners will provide a prolonged consultation focusing on individual needs and preferences of the patient with SMI and a follow-up plan if indicated. The outcomes will be parameters of the feasibility of the intervention and trial methods and will be assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. Assessments of the outcome parameters will be administered at baseline, throughout, and at end of the study period.",

If delivery of the intervention, either in its current form or after revision, is considered feasible, a future, definitive trial to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing mortality and improving quality of life in patients with SMI can take place. Successful implementation of the intervention would imply preliminary promise for addressing health inequities in patients with SMI. ",

            "text": "People with a severe mental illness (SMI) on average die younger than the general population. It is projected that among people with SMI, defined as psychotic conditions, bipolar disorder, and severe depression [1] , between 10 to 20 life years are lost [2] . Unnatural causes of death, i.e., suicide, accidents, and homicide, considerably contribute to this disparity [3] , yet chronic somatic health conditions account for the majority of lost life years among people with SMI [4] . The majority of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . People with SMI are at higher risk of several chronic somatic conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases [10] , diabetes mellitus type II [11] , metabolic syndrome [12] , respiratory diseases, and liver abnormalities [13] as well as the risk of somatic multimorbidity [9] . The mechanisms connecting SMI and somatic conditions are complex. Contributing to the higher risk of somatic conditions in SMI patients are unhealthy living conditions, the adverse metabolic effects of long-term psychotropic medication use, and possibly shared genetic and metabolic vulnerability [14, 15] . Finally, lower adherence to treatment regimens and poorer medical treatment are at play. Preliminary evidence suggests that the mortality gap for people with SMI is amenable to intervention and that primary care may play a pivotal role in reducing this gap [16] .",

Furthermore, barriers for trans-sectoral treatment of patients with SMI, and potential solutions for these, were explored in a series of workshops, focus groups, and interviews as part of the co-design phase to help guide the development of an intervention [21] . This intervention essentially aims to improve the treatment of comorbid somatic conditions in persons with SMI through an enhanced educational training of general practitioners and their clinical staff, and by implementing strategies to better accommodate patients with a psychiatric background in primary care. It is hypothesized that a focus on the individual patient's needs and preferences will enhance the relationship between general practitioners and patients with SMI and thereby improve quality of life. Practically, this entails an active outreach to patients with SMI in the general practice setting, longer and holistic [22] consultations with attention paid to both quality of life and disease management, use of a conversation tool, an individualized care plan, and balancing treatment options against the patient's needs, abilities, and individual circumstances. We hypothesize that the enhanced relationship will encourage patients with SMI in the general practice setting to attend health consultations systematically and regularly, which in combination with patient-centered care will improve timely detection and treatment of somatic morbidity. Ultimately, following this, we hypothesize that this intervention will reduce excess mortality and enhance the needs-based quality of life in patients with SMI.",

Components of the design and intervention, similar to those from the SOFIA intervention, have been used and assessed in previous trials [23, 24] . However, none of these interventions were specifically aimed at patients with severe psychiatric morbidity in the general practice setting. Furthermore, few studies have looked into how general practice can improve the lives of people with multimorbidity or have investigated the efficacy of training doctors to manage people with multimorbidity [25] . Therefore, in light of this paucity of evidence regarding management of care in this patient group in the general practice setting, conducting an RCT raises significant practical concerns. Moreover, when developing a complex intervention, a scaled approach is recommended, i.e., from small-scale feasibility studies to larger-scale pilot trials before an RCT can take place to ensure that the intervention is sequentially optimized and is implementable, costeffective, and acceptable to patients and providers [26] .",

The general practitioners discuss adherence challenges related to treatment, possible side effects, and any possible considerations or wishes for medication changes with the patient.

It is the intention, in the definitive trial, that the general practitioners can use the MMQ1 as a conversation tool to help them identify issues that should be addressed during the consultation. In this scenario, in the intervention arm, the general practitioners have access to the aggregated patients' MMQ scores, and patients might have a different understanding of the questions after having discussed them during the consultation as opposed to the participants in the control group. This might compromise the validity of the MMQ1 as a primary outcome in the definitive trial. Within the pilot study, we aim to empirically test for this risk of bias. To this end, in randomly selected 50% of the intervention practices, the general practitioner will have access to the aggregated score of selected domains in the MMQ1. In the remaining 50% of the intervention practices, MMQ1 scores will be concealed for the general practitioner. This sub-study is designed as a small equivalence trial nested in the pilot study.

Preferential recruitment of these patients will limit the generalizability of our findings and may reduce the observed efficacy of our intervention in a future definitive trial. Preferential selection of trial participants with favorable prognostic characteristics is widely acknowledged, yet typically ignored in trials [31] . In our pilot study, we, therefore, examine the risk of selective recruitment. If the risk of selective recruitment is present, we will re-evaluate and, if needed, adjust the recruitment strategy. Another limitation of the study design involves the randomization at the level of the general practice rather than at the individual patient. In the definitive trial, outcomes will be measured at the individual patient level, yet the intervention is targeted at the general practitioner and the practice staff. As staff and general practitioners will not be able to adapt care provision on an individual basis depending on allocation, randomization at the patient level will inevitably introduce contamination bias and lead to underestimation of the potential effectiveness of the intervention. However, randomization at a cluster level might challenge the comparability of the intervention and the control group [32] . Analysis of the definitive RCT will therefore require correction for potential imbalances in patient and practice characteristics.",
