            "text": "Adults over the age of 50 comprise a growing proportion of the individual adult homeless population. 1 They have a high prevalence of geriatric conditions, including cognitive impairment, functional disability, and falls which indicate caregiving needs. 2 Homeless-experienced (i.e., currently or formerly homeless) individuals experience geriatric conditions approximately 20 years earlier than the general population. 2, 3 High prevalence of co-existing mental health problems and substance use disorders further contributes to their vulnerabilities. 4 Experiencing homelessness can have implications for disability and poor health outcomes even once individuals are housed. 5, 6 Homeless-experienced adults have difficulty accessing formal caregiving services, such as nursing or home health aide support. 7 Home and Community Based Services (HBCS) provide opportunities for Medicaid recipients to receive services in their home or community rather than in institutions. HCBS accounts for over half of overall Medicaid long-term care spending but access to services is limited for individuals without a home. 8 Homeless-experienced adults face barriers to informal caregiving (i.e., unpaid support from family or friends), due to disrupted social networks from frequent relocations, trauma, substance use, and mental health disorders. 9 Homeless-experienced adults' family and friends are often impoverished and struggle to provide care. 9 Homelessexperienced individuals' unmet caregiving needs may lead to disabilities that require costly long-term care. 10 Prior Presentations: Early findings from this manuscript were accepted as an oral presentation for the 2020 Society of General Internal Medicine annual meeting, but were not presented given cancellation of the meeting due to the coronavirus (COVID- 19) pandemic.",

Given their high risk for institutional care, homeless-experienced adults can benefit from programs that support access to caregiving in the community. Such strategies could potentially delay or avoid institutional care. In national surveys, approximately 5-20% of housed adults over age 65 reported difficulty with self-care and 10% had cognitive impairments. 34, 35 In our sample (median age 58 years), over half had difficulty with self-care and over 20% had cognitive impairment. In previous work, we found that homeless-experienced adults had similar patterns of decline and persistence in functional impairments as those in older adults in the general community, suggesting that our participants' caregiving needs likely reflect those of older populations. This reinforces the need for interventions to reduce reliance on institutional care for homeless-experienced adults. 36, 37 In national studies, about 20% of older adults report having unmet caregiving needs compared to 82% of homelessexperienced older adults in our study with unmet caregiving needs. 35, 38, 39 This fourfold difference in unmet caregiving need highlights gaps in policies and practices for access to caregiving services among homeless-experienced adults. Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) are designed to decrease reliance on institutional care by providing individuals with services, including assistance with ADLs and IADLs, that keep them living safely in their homes and their communities. 8 People experiencing homelessness often face significant barriers to receipt of Medicaid-funded caregiving support despite their need for these services. These barriers range from statutory barriers restricting care to sheltered individuals to practical barriers created by cumbersome application processes.",

It is possible that expansion of pilot efforts to proactively expand IHSS to permanent supportive housing by leveraging trained staff with experience equipping formerly homeless individuals with the skills to navigate these barriers could alleviate this disparity. 42 Ensuring equitable access to caregiving services for homeless-experienced individuals requires addressing structural barriers. 43 In California, approximately 72% of people experiencing homelessness are unsheltered. 44 Homeless-experienced adults' friends and family are likely to experience deep poverty and have low household incomes, making it difficult for their social networks to provide unpaid care. 9 Individuals who 45 While homelessness was associated with lack of receipt of needed caregiving in bivariate models, it was not significant in adjusted models. Homelessness is a dynamic state. We found that those who regained housing remained at risk of unmet caregiving needs. Among those with caregiving needs, we found that men were more likely to have unmet need. This finding is consistent with work showing that while men present with higher levels of need when compared to women, men are less likely to access home care services and more likely to be admitted to long-term care. 46 Older men experiencing homelessness may be less likely to seek, and thus receive, care. Participants who rated their health as better were more likely to have unmet caregiving needs. It is possible that being in better health facilitates the ability to \"get by\" without assistance due to having fewer overall needs or better ability to navigate existing needs. Yet, there are significant risks to not receiving assistance with the impairments we examined. Impairments in ADLs and IADLs are significant contributors to overall frailty and predictors of long-term disability.

This definition may have resulted in an over-or underestimation of caregiving needs. However, characteristics included in our caregiving need definition were drawn from prior research and are widely cited as contributors to caregiving need in nationally representative samples of older populations. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Some participants may not have considered all potential sources of caregiving support when we asked whether they received assistance, potentially leading to an overestimation of unmet need. Individuals with the same level of disability, depending on their culture, age, and gender, can respond differently to instruments used to measure functional status. 55 To minimize this potential bias, we administered an IADL tool developed for use in homeless populations. 24 Some of our sample characteristics, including participant rates of current homelessness and institutional residence, are reflective of nationally representative data on homeless populations. 56 However, we recruited participants from California, which may restrict the generalizability of our findings with respect to access to caregiving services. For example, California is one of few states that allow IHSS recipients to hire family members as caregivers, which may facilitate access to additional caregiving options for housed individuals. This is the first study to describe caregiving need among older homeless-experienced adults and examine factors contributing to their unmet need. The high prevalence of unmet need in this vulnerable population has implications for individual health outcomes and future health system expenditures. By tailoring existing community caregiving resources to accommodate the needs of homeless-experienced older adults, we may better address their care needs while avoiding adverse and costly outcomes.",
