Network estimates (pooled direct and indirect data) of each intervention compared to standard medical therapy and other interventions are presented in forest plots, summarized in a league table (as shown in the results section). We were unable to use the nodesplitting analysis to examine the consistency assumption because of the star-shaped configuration of the networks [27] . We ranked the interventions by their posterior probability by calculating the surface under cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve values ranging from 0 to 100%. The higher the SUCRA value, and the closer to 100%, the higher the likelihood that a therapy is in the top rank or one of the top ranks; the closer to 0 the SUCRA value, the more likely that a therapy is in the bottom rank, or one of the bottom ranks [28] . We also provided rankograms, showing the probability of achieving certain ranks. Frequentist comparison-adjusted funnel plots were created for 1-and 3-month OS, and Egger's tests were performed to assess small-study effect. The low number of studies in the TFS analyses did not enable this method. In an additional analysis, methodology-based evaluation was performed. All calculations were performed with R (V. 3.5. ",

The APASL consensus guideline recommended the use of PE in ACLF for bridging to transplantation or recovery. The EASL did not find the available evidence to be sufficient for recommending the use of any liver support therapy for the treatment of ACLF. High-volume PE was found to reduce mortality and effectively remove DAMPs, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 in ALF patients in an RCT [53, 54] . The role of immune dysfunction and dysregulated immune response in ACLF has recently come into focus. Both hyper-inflammation and immunosuppression play a role in acute decompensation [1, 7] . Inflammation represented by elevated inflammatory markers was previously thought to be a consequence of ongoing infection, but lately endogenous inducers were identified as underlying causes [2] . Bioartificial devices have the potential of synthetic functions and contribution to the immune response [55] . So far, only ELAD was tested in RCTs, always compared to SMT. Although ELAD did not perform well on the cumulative ranking curves, significantly higher IL-1 receptor antagonist levels were measured during ELAD therapy than in controls [39] . Based on this finding, the immunomodulatory functions of bioartificial devices should be further assessed.",

Other blood purification methods, such as CytoSorb \u2122 therapy, also seem promising [59, 60] , but they have not yet been evaluated in a randomized setting. Nevertheless, according to a recent in vitro experimental model, Cyto-Sorb hemoperfusion leads to an initially faster removal of cytokines, like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, as well as more effective reduction of albumin-bound toxins, such as indirect bilirubin and bile acids, compared to MARS [61] .",

Studies enrolling patients with hepatorenal syndrome were not excluded with the aim of including cases with poorer prognosis. This new methodology enabled the comparison and ranking of different devices and highlighted the need for international consensus on the definition of ACLF and further trials testing already existing and new devices.",

Transitivity could not be directly tested, but we think that the differences between the study populations do not violate the assumption of transitivity. The analyses included relatively few studies, some of them only enrolling less than 10 subjects per group, raising concerns about the beta-type error. Most importantly, due to the different definitions of ACLF used (Table 1) , patient characteristics can differ significantly among studies, resulting in a highly heterogeneous population in our study. Eligibility criteria and the ratio of viral and alcoholic etiology differs in the included studies, but all patients were diagnosed with ACLF. Differences in the study populations may explain some of the controversial results of RCTs included in this meta-analysis. Also, in some of the included studies mortality was not a primary endpoint and was reported additionally; therefore, bias arises. The recruitment period for the included trials ranges from March 1997 until February 2015, which could impose chronological bias. Variance in SMT and treatment dose also could have influenced outcomes [62] . Due to the differences in treatment dose, cut-offs and reporting protocols, data on HE, laboratory parameters, and AEs could not be analyzed quantitatively.",

On the contrary, Thompson et al. found comparable mortality in the two groups at 5 years[39]. Interestingly, Qin et al. showed that in the PE group the 5-year cumulative survival probability was significantly higher (43% vs 31% survived) and have found that treatment added about 6 months to the life expectancy of patients with HBV-associated ACLF.",
