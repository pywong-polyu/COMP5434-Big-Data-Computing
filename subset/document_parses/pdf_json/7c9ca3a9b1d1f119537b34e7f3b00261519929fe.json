Since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of scientific articles published in this field has been increasing, making it highly desirable to carry out a bibliometric study to identify research efforts. Therefore, the aim of this work was to conduct a literature review of blockchain and COVID-19 technology in the field of Business Management to identify recent lines of research. To do so, we used a text mining technique on a corpus composed of 37 articles in the Web of Science database. The results obtained clearly show 3 distinct clusters. The first represents the blockchain technology framework in organizations and stakeholders in which the research methodology in artificial intelligence is very important. The second shows the need to take into account business sustainability caused by COVID-19. The third indicates the impact of the pandemic on the supply chain industry.",

The globalised economy has been an active principle of economic contraction which has paralysed international trade, through a crisis initiated on the supply and production chain side and immediately fed into the demand side on the consumption and investment side. On the other hand, this globalisation has become instrumental in increasing the adoption of digital technologies (Skare & Soriano, 2021) .",

However, output in mid-2021 was still 3.5% lower than expected before the spread of COVID-19, resulting in job and income losses. Most tellingly, as shown in Fig. 1 , inequality across countries, sectors and demographic groups explains an asymmetric recovery, with GDP increases to pre-pandemic levels not matched by the same increase in employment (US), or employment increases but without an increase in output and hours worked to pre-COVID levels (EU) (OECD, 2021) .",

In the second step, we selected scientific articles as the document type, obtaining a total of 210 articles. Then, the research areas chosen were Business Economics and Operations Research Management in order to focus the study on research fields related to economics and economic management. Applying these filters, 39 articles were obtained, not considering those papers that were presented at scientific congresses. Finally, the papers written in English were selected. A total of thirty-seven research articles were included in the database. Note that this query was performed on 20th September 2021 and the papers included in the database were composed of titles and abstracts. The review procedure comprised four steps, which are summarized in Fig. 2 .",

To do so, we used the software VOSviewer (OECD, 2021; Perera et al., 2020) (www.vosviewer.com) to group terms and to analyze the resulting clusters based on a corpus of documents. VOSviewer uses two standardised variables: the number of links for each term and the total link strength, and permits graphic visualisation of the network of relationships for each term. It then displays the relevance and strength of each link with the rest of the terms based on the letter size of each term and the number of interconnecting lines, as well as their thickness. VOSviewer has been implemented in a multitude of works showing the robustness of its methodology (Donthu et al., 2020; Guleria & Kaur, 2021) . A term map is a two-dimensional map where the distance between two terms is interpreted as the relationship between them. In general, the smaller the distance between two terms, the more related they are to each other. The relatedness of terms is determined based on co-occurrences in documents. For more information about how VOSviewer creates a term see Van Eck and Waltman (2011).",
