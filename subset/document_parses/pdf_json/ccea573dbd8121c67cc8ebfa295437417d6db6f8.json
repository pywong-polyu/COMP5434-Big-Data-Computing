However, confinement may cause negative feelings, such as frustration, anger, boredom, and stress, in quarantined people. Furthermore, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity behaviors are commonly linked to home confinement, leading to weight gain, metabolic disorders, smoking, and exacerbated alcohol consumption. As a result, these unhealthy behaviors are typically linked to vascular endothelium damage (endothelial dysfunction), which is a first step for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Given that CVD is the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, attenuating the progression of endothelial dysfunction is very important for the control of CVD. Consuming vegetable rich in nitrate, such as beetroots, may be an effective way to prevent endothelial dysfunction. Several emerging studies have recommended beetroot juice in order to improve endothelial function in hypertensive, hypercholesterolemic individuals, as well as in those with CVD risk factors. Therefore, nitrate-rich vegetable consumption, such as beetroot, should be encouraged to be included in the diet during confinement from COVID-19 outbreaks in order to alleviate the potential negative effect of home confinement on cardiovascular health.",

Changes in NO bioavailability are known to play a role in the development of a number of clinical conditions in which the function of the vascular system is impaired. Evidence indicates that the most likely mechanism for endothelial dysfunction is that of a reduced bioavailability of NO as a result of its interaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically superoxide anion (5) . The inactivation of NO by superoxide anion is an example of what is called oxidative stress, a term used to describe an imbalance between the anti-oxidant defenses of cells and excessive formation of ROS (5) . Since the adoption of new unhealthy life habits due to confinement (i.e., drinking, smoking, unbalanced diet, stress, and sedentary life) may contribute to exaggerated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), people under quarantine may be more susceptible to increase their risk for developing cardiovascular disorders.",

Beetroot is an important vegetable source of nitrate, a bioactive compound that has widely investigated due to its positive effects on endothelial function (6, 7) . Beetroot contains higher levels of nitrate that can be converted into nitrite by bacteria present in the oral cavity (8) . Nitrite, in turn, can be converted into NO in dysfunctional arteries, improving endothelial function (6, 7) . The present manuscript discusses how some unhealthy habits caused by COVID-19 quarantine may negatively affect endothelial function, which may be mitigated by beetroot juice ingestion to improve endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, we provide insight to encourage the consumption of dietary sources rich in nitrate (i.e., beetroot) for patients with COVID-19 who may have impaired NO bioavailability due to COVID-19 virus in endothelial cells, as well as present endothelial inflammation.",

In addition, social distancing caused by home confinement increases the risk of psychosocial strain (2, 3) . A previous study has investigated the lifestyle behaviors of 1047 individuals from different countries during quarantine.

A diet high in fat and sugar can inhibit the satiety response in the brain, activating reward systems, and consequently leading to more food ingestion (10). Greater energy intake combined with decreased physical activity levels due to confinement may result in weight gain, as well as elevated blood pressure, glucose, and lipids, thereby increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Figure 1) .

Torres et al. (12) demonstrated that emotionally stressed individuals ingested high-fat food in order to feel better. Moreover, since most people are fearful of being infected with COVID-19, it is plausible that people will prefer to purchase packaged and longer shelf-life foods instead of vegetable and fruits (fresh food) in order to avoid frequent supermarket shopping. In the short-and long-term, such unhealthy food ingestion and reduced levels of physical activity are very likely to cause weight gain, increased blood glucose levels, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and blood pressure in people suffering from emotional disorders (11) .",

For instance, storage of foods under low temperatures may preserve bioactive compounds in vegetables and fruits (30) . Corleto et al. (30) showed that nitrate content in beetroot juice was stable for 4 and 30 days when storage at 4 and \u221220 \u2022 C, respectively. Therefore, beetroot juice may be beneficially consumed when stored under appropriate conditions (low temperature), preserving the nitrate content in beetroot juice for a longer period. Corleto et al. (30) showed that nitrate degradation from beetroot juice started within 24 h at 25 \u2022 C and after 4 days at 4 \u2022 C, while it was stable for 1 month at temperatures below \u221220 \u2022 C. Therefore, when making the juice from beetroot it should be consumed immediately or if storage it should be at a temperature below \u221220 \u2022 C (e.g., fridge freezer) for up to 1 month to avoid nitrate losses. Avoiding nitrate losses from beetroot juice is important since the beneficial cardiovascular effect of beetroot juice consumption is related to the presence of nitrate in this food.",

Exacerbated production of ROS and RNS serve as host defense and are induced during stress, such as viral infection (35) . Considering that SARS-CoV-2 infects endothelial cells, which are the major source of NO synthesis, change in normal NO/ROS balance in such cells can negatively affect the endothelial function (i.e., NO is a potent vasoactive molecule), as well as regulating inflammatory cascades (i.e., NO inhibits viral replication, reducing inflammatory response) (37) . In this context, scientific evidence has demonstrated NO supplementation (by using inhaled NO or donor drugs, such as S-nitrosothiols) under pro-inflammatory conditions may prevent cytokine storm and restores microvascular function (37, 38) .",

Although no clinical trials testing natural products has yet been conducted, it would be plausible to investigate the effect of beetroot in COVID-19 patients given the effectiveness of beetroot juice ingestion in increasing NO precursors (nitrate and nitrite) in plasma and urine (39, 40) . A previous study has suggested curcumin as a possible natural product that can be explored for early intervention in COVID-19 due to the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin (38) .
