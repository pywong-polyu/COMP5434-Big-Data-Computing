There is little hope that chloroquine could be beneficial at the early onset of disease before getting into the hospital. Many other trials are still paused to get-go signal from the safety committee to make sure that these trials will not harm the patients under study ( Kupferschmidt, June 9, 2020) . So, the controversy of chloroquine at present is the dispute of the day. remdesivir and ravipiravir, are just approved for a clinical trial as a drug to treat COVID-19 (Maxmen, 2020) . Although promising results were observed with remdesivir and favipiravir and many pharmaceutical companies are launching generic names for these drugs as COVID-19 treatment but to date, we are lacking sufficient pieces of evidence to call any drug as \"game-changer\".",

Through molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies, we can speculate that chloroquine and SAA09E2 (Viral entry inhibitors) can block the viral entry into the human cell by blocking the binding interface of spike-RBD (virus) and human ACE2 receptor protein. So, the binding of these inhibitors with the spike-RBD domain may affect the key conformational switches required for the infection process. Similarly, binding of these inhibitors with the ACE2 receptor protein is of significant interest and it is speculated based on these results that virus entry could be stopped by blocking the viral host interaction to cure this COVID-19 illness ( Fig. 6 A and B) . So, these can be proposed as dualaction inhibitors instead of one bug one drug notion.",

It is evident from this structural informatics study that combo of chloroquine + SSAA09E2 with remdesivir or favipiravir could significantly restrain the virus at the entry and replication stage.

            "text": "COVID-19 pneumonia disease caused by SARS-CoV2. Recent, multi clinical trail of existing antiviral and malarial drugs possibly show their therapeutics value against COVID-19 disease but their exact mechanism of interaction with target molecules yet need to be explored. To understand the binding mode and critical pharmacophore features existing drugs for other diseases, with spike protein, RdRp enzyme, and human ACE2 receptor protein, a comprehensive interaction analysis was performed.Detailed interaction analysis of chloroquine (4-N-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-1-N,1-Ndiethylpentane-1,4-diamine;phosphoric acid) in complex with ACE2 receptor (binding energy -9.34 kcal/mol) revealed strong binding in and around the region involved in binding with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV2-spike protein. Phe40 and Ser47 formed Hbonding and Pi-Pi stacking interactions with the chloroquine molecule. Asp350, Phe390, and Arg393 were involved in hydrophobic interaction with the chloroquine inhibitor (Fig. 2 A, B and C). Adedeji et al in 2013 reported that SSAA09E2 an oxazole-carboxamide could block the viral entry of SARS-CoV and reported as promising SARS therapeutics. In the present study, we repurposed SSAA09E2 to block the entry of SARS-CoV2 due to close similarity with SARS-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f CoV.

            "text": "Similarly, to repurpose the dual action of chloroquine it was also docked with the spike-RBD and interaction analysis revealed binding of critical residues of spike-RBD with the different moieties of chloroquine. Ser349 and Tyr451 were involved in H-bonding and coordinate covalent interactions with the aromatic ring of chloroquine. While Arg346 formed Pi-Pi stacking interaction apart from the hydrophobic interaction of Asn450 (Fig. 3A B, and C).SSAA09E2 showed strong binding with the RBD domain of spike protein with the binding free energy of -8.67 kcal/mol. Glu471, Ile472, and Lys458 formed H-bond with the 2-oxazole-5carboxamide and phenylmethyl moiety of SSAA09E2, respectively. Ser469 formed coordinate covalent interaction while Arg454, Pro491 formed hydrophobic interaction to further strengthen the binding (Fig. 3 A, B and D). Through viroinformatics approach, hloroquine and SSAA09E2 (SARS-CoV entry inhibitor) are repurposed as dual-action inhibitors of viral entry by interaction with the spike-RBD and ACE2 (receptor) proteins, simultaneously. While the binding energy of SSAA09E2 is high as compared to chloroquine. Nsp12, a conserved protein in coronavirus, is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the vital enzyme of coronavirus replication/transcription complex. The RdRp domain of polymerase is located at the C-terminus and has a conserved Ser-Asp-Asp motif (Subissi et al, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2014). Predominantly, RdRp targeted inhibition possibly not cause substantial harm to the host cells, but specific inhibitor against RdRp is still lacking (Chu et al, 2006). The computational targeting of RdRp with remdesivir and favipiravir showed both drugs were very well placed within the catalytic pocket. Interaction analysis of remdesivir within the pocket of RdRp (-12.67 kcal/mol) revealed Val557 and Ala558 formed H-bond where, Try456, Arg624 Arg553, and Ser682 formed coordinate covalent bond with remdesivir in addition to pi-pi interactions. A number of residues (Tyr455, Ala554, Arg555, Thr556, Lys621, Ser681, and Gly683) were observed in hydrophobic interactions with different chemical moieties remdesivir to keep it in RdRp pocket (Fig. 4 A, B and C). Our results are consistent with Wu et al, 2020. Similarly, detailed docking analysis of antiviral drug favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-oxo-3,4dihydropyrazine-2-carboxamide) revealed strong binding to the binding cavity of RdRp with the binding free energy of -10.34 kcal/mol. Tyr456, Arg555 and Val557 formed H-bond and coordinate covalent interactions dihydropyrazine moiety of favipiravir. Ser624 formed pi-pi",

            "text": "Dynamics simulations were performed. Time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root means square fluctuation (RMSF) was estimated to measure the stability and fluctuations of protein C-alpha atoms of ACE2 receptor, spike and RdRp bound and the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fapostates. An overall convergence of energies indicated well behaved systems. RMSF and RMSD for each system were calculated using Apo stat as a reference at 50 ns. The average RMSD value for the bound and apo state of ACE2, spike and RdRp showed stability in the overall system.Detailed dynamic trajectories analysis of ACE2 apo, and ACE2SAA09E2 complex, showed fluctuation in and around the binding interface residues. Interestingly, all the critical residues (Phe40, Ser43, Ser44, Ser47, Trp349, Phe390, and Arg393) involved in binding showed slight changes to facilitate binding with inhibitors. Comparative analysis of the trajectories generated at different ns (ACE2-SAA09E2) with apo state of ACE2 receptor showed important structural twists. Phe40 and Ser44 bend towards the inhibitor molecule to get in pose favorable for binding.Ser43 and Ser47 were also tilted to attain binding conformation. The number of conformational changes was also observed in the loop region close to and far from the binding interface(Fig.5 Aand B).Similarly, the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 showed overall stability in the RMSF values in the bound (SSAA09E2) state in comparison to theapo state. Fluctuations were observed in the loop region near the binding site while the critical binding site residues (Lys458, Thr470, Glu471, Ile472, Try473, Phe497, Gly485, and Pro491) showed overall stability. Next, through analysis of dynamic trajectories of spike protein at different ns upon binding of SSAA09E2 significant structural changes were captured. Overall loops region closes to the binding residues showed more fluctuations as compared to critical binding site residues (Arg346, Ser349, Lys458, Thr470, Glu471, Ile472, Try473, Phe497, Gly485, and Pro491). Where Glu471 and Ile472 showed substantial movement to make H-bond with the SSAA09E2 . Lys458 and Ser469 showed slanting towards the bound small molecule to make important interactions. In addition to these J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f number of fluctuations were also observed in the loop region and secondary structure elements of spike protein of SARS-CoV2(Fig. 5 C and D).Next the analysis of RMSF fluctuation of apo and RdRp-remdesivir complex revealed more fluctuations in loop region close to the binding cavity where all the key binding residues (Val557, Ala558, Try456, Arg553, Ser683, Asp452, Tyr455, Ala554, Thr556, and Lys621) were stable with small changes to aid in binding with remdesivir.",

Another limitation is we opted to run our simulations for 50 ns it would be good to perform multiple of 100 ns-scale molecular dynamics simulation with MM-GBSA/PBSA as well as detailed energy analysis. Overall, by integrated molecular docking and dynamics simulations experiments we get confidence in our virorinformatic approach and binding behavior of the existing drugs repurposed against COVID-19 treatment. In this time of lockdown computational strategies as molecular modeling in addition to molecular dynamics simulation of receptor-drug molecules can facilitate and speed up the finding of specific and appropriate antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV2. Repurposition of existing viral entry and viral replication inhibitor in combination can be explicit therapeutic measures in the battle against COVID-19 in time-critical fashion by reducing the cost and time of de novo drug discovery.
