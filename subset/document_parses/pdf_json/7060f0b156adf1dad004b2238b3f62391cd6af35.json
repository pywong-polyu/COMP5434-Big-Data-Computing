This has been highly challenging for governments facing constraints in terms of time and resources related to the availability of testing kits for the virus. This paper develops an optimal method for multiple-stage group partition for coronavirus screening using a dynamic programming approach. That is, in each stage, a group of people is divided into a certain number of subgroups, each will be tested as a whole. Only the subgroup(s) tested positive will be further divided into smaller subgroups in the next stage or individuals at the last stage. Our multiple-stage group partition scheme is able to minimize the total number of test kits and the number of stages. Our scheme can help solve the test kit shortage problem and save time. Finally, numerical examples with useful managerial insights for further investigation are presented. The results confirm the advantages of the multi-stage sampling method over the existing binary tree method.",

More testing helps to know the movement of the virus through the population, tracing of the infected people, isolating their contacts, and identifying the hot spots for locking down, all of which lead to the prevention of large-scale spread. However, almost every country is suffering from the scarcity of testing kits to accurately track the new coronavirus. To help deal with the scarcity of testing kits, many news and research articles advocate the group pool testing method for coronavirus screening (Biswas, 2020; Conger, 2020; Cosh, 2020; , Eberhardt et al., 2020 , Sinnott-Armstrong, (2020 , Yelin et al., 2020 , Brault et al., 2021 . The group pool testing method allows ruling out a considerable number of samples with one test. According to Cosh (2020) , Technion, Israel Institute of Technology has conducted a successful trial of group pooling testing method using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the coronavirus. The Group pool testing method mixes multiple swabs and performs a single test for the whole group. If the group test result is negative, then the whole group is ruled out for virus infection. Otherwise, further testing of each individual is performed in the infected group to identify the infected people.",

            "text": "The basic group pool testing approach states that if a group pooling test of 64 samples is found to be positive, then further testing of individuals in the group is performed to identify a person infected with the coronavirus. This testing method requires a total of 65 test kits to identify the infected person. The basic group testing requires two times swab collection from 64 individuals. The first sample is collected for the group pool testing, and the second sample is collected for the individual testing. Without loss of generality, we assume that the swab collection is time-sensitive, and thus, multiple swab collections for later use can affect the testing accuracy. If the 64 samples can be further divided into different subgroups, then the number of required test kits can be further reduced. Although the subgroup testing increases the number of swab collections, the additional cost can be used as a part of a trade-off with the reduction of the required total number of test kits. The existing multi-stage group testing method uses a binary tree method to identify the infected person. In the binary tree method, a group with a positive report is further divided into two groups in the next stage. The existing binary tree method is shown in Fig. 1 A disadvantage of the existing multi-stage method is that it does not consider the minimization of stages. To overcome this problem, the current paper proposes a general multi-stage group testing method in which a group with a positive report can be divided into any number of groups in the next stage. The proposed multi-stage sampling method finds the optimal regrouping strategy in different stages. The primary objective is to minimize the total number of test kits, and the secondary objective is to minimize the number of stages.",

In the second stage, 64 individuals are further divided into m sub-groups, and each sub-group is tested. Since there is only one person infected among 64 individuals, only one of the subgroups would show a positive report, and the remaining (m-1) subgroups would show a negative report. The members from the subgroup with the positive report are finally tested individually at the third level. In the three-stage-sampling-method, the number of feasible solutions depends on the number of subgroups formation at the second stage. Some of the feasible solutions are shown in Table 1 .

That is to say, the total number of test kits required increases after some optimal level of subgrouping. If the number of test kits is considered as a function of the number of groups at the second level, then this function is convex. This property can be verified using the recursive equation described in Sect. 4. As shown in Table 1 , the optimal solution (i.e., solution 7) has an objective function value of 17. In solution 7, 64 samples are tested in the group at the first stage, and then these 64 individuals are divided into 8 groups with 8 members in each group.

The popularity of the group testing can be seen from the number of articles available in medRxiv archive, which provides an archive for unpublished manuscripts in the medical, clinical, and related health science (https://www.medrxiv.org/). The research papers available in this archive advocate the use of group testing for efficient screening of coronavirus (Yelin et al., 2020 , Sinnott-Armstrong, 2020 . The general group testing problem aims to identify a small set of k infected individuals out of population size (Aldridge et al., 2014 , Aldridge, 2018 . In Aldridge et al. (2014) , they focused on the group testing problem where the test structure is given via a Bernoulli random process. They then compared the performance of four detection algorithms via simulations. In Aldridge (2018) , they studied nonadaptive probabilistic group testing in the linear regime, where each item is defective independently.",

The recursive equation proposed by Jansen (1969) was improved by Van et al. (2004) 2012) proposed column generation embedded with branch and bound to solve the problem. Our problem is different from the k-clustering problem in the way that the objective function of the cluster is equal to the size of the cluster.

This group can be tested either in a group or individually. Each test provides either a positive or a negative report. If a group test is found to be negative, then every member of the group is considered a negative. If a group test is found to be positive, then further testing is performed in the next stage for the group. The complete test is performed in T stages. In the first stage, a single group test of n samples is performed. From stage 2 to stage (T -1), group tests are performed for more than one sample at each stage. In the second stage, n samples are divided into the m 2 groups. Similarly, in other stages, the required samples are divided into different groups. Finally, at the T th stage, an individual test is performed. Each group test and each individual test require just one medical kit. The problem involves finding the optimal number of subgroups for each stage from stage 2 to stage (T -1) (i.e., m * 2 , m * 3 , ..., m * T \u22121 ) to identify the member infected with the coronavirus. The first stage tests n samples in a group, while the last stage tests remaining samples individually. Therefore, the first and the last stage do not require finding optimal groups.

In the optimal partitioning, 2 samples will be assigned to each group initially, which will make a total 10 sample assignments to different groups. The remaining 3 samples can be assigned to any three groups, with 1 sample in each group. Thus, the optimal 5 partitioning for 13 samples will be 2,2,3,3 and 3.

            "text": "This subsection describes the optimal partition of 64 samples in T stages. The optimal solution for a 3-stage sampling method for 64 samples is already illustrated in the problem background. The summary of the optimal solution for the 3-stage group testing problem until the 7-stage group testing problem is summarized in Table 2 . We don't need a group testing method with more than 7 stages because dividing 64 samples into more than 7 stages brings 1 sample test in some of the earlier stages, which increases the total number of kits requirements. Our dynamic programming model provides a BigM value for more than 7 stages because of the boundary condition shown in Eq. (4). The results reported in Table 2 show that the 3-stage group testing method needs 17 kits. The number of kits reduces to 13 for the 4-stage group testing method. The total number of required kits does not decrease further for an increasing number of stages. The results bring an interesting insight into the group partitioning problem. For a sample size of 64, the binary testing method used in current literature seems to provide the optimal solution (in terms of the number of kits) for the multi-stage group testing problem. In Table 2 , the binary testing method corresponds to the 7-stage group sampling method. In the 7-stage group testing problem, groups are divided into two groups in every stage. The 7-stage group testing problem requires 13 kits which is the minimum number of kits requirement. However, the minimum number of kits requirements can be obtained at the 4-stage group sampling problem as well as illustrated in Fig. 3 . In the 4-stage sampling problem, the first 64 samples are tested in the 1st stage. In the second stage, 64 samples are divided into 4 groups with 16 members in each group. One of these groups would show a positive report, and thus 16 members have divided again in the 3rd stage. In the 3rd stage, 16 members are divided into 4 groups with 4 members in each group. One of these groups will show a positive result which is finally tested individually at the 4th stage. The 4-stage sampling requires 1 kit at the first stage, 4 kits at the second, third, and fourth stage. Thus, for the optimal 4-stage group sampling, the total number of kits required is 13. The results reported in Table 1 also indicate that the optimal number of kits for the multi-stage group partition problem follows nonincreasing order with stages. Because of this property, the proposed dynamic program can also be used to minimize the number of stages along with the minimization of the number of kits. Thus, the optimal solution to the group testing problem is the 4-stage group test, when the primary objective is to minimize the number of test kits, and the secondary objective is to minimize the required number of samples. The stage directly represents the maximum number of samples collected from an individual to identify the person infected with the coronavirus. Since every country is trying its best to flatten the curve of coronavirus cases, it is necessary to identify positive patients quickly. The number of stage minimizations is directly related to the time minimization to identify the positive case. The proposed MSGT model not only optimizes the total number of required kits but also reduces the time required to identify the positive report.",

At the beginning of the pandemic (around mid-March 2020), many provinces in Canada took one day to get the results for the COVID-19 test. In this situation, 4 stages would have required 4 days to identify the infected person. During this period, positive cases were moving exponentially.
