            "text": "In Ghana, minibus taxis (trotros) are an important mode of transport that commute about 60% of the traveling public. In spite of their popularity, minibuses are generally inefficient, disorganized and have low service quality. In an attempt to assess service quality of the service, a modified SERVPERF tool was developed. Differences in perceptions of service quality between male and female respondents were also assessed, and the attractiveness of certain technological features as possible remedies to service quality issues were determined. Using an online Google forms version of the modified SERVPERF, responses from nearly one thousand commuters were collected. The link to the questionnaire was dispersed via social media (Whatsapp and Telegram) since the data was collected during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ghana. Following a factor reduction, the most important service quality factors determined to affect trotro users were (i) Reliability of the service, (ii) Variability in cost and (iii) Responsiveness. Respondents also identified technologies that could help them (a) book, (b) report driver misbehavior, (c) make safe e-payments and (d) track the location of trotros, as most likely to improve their trotro service quality. The findings suggest that some mobility as a service features could have possible benefit for the trotro. The study is however limited in its ability to determine the exact impact of these technologies since it uses a stated preference approach. Future research could explore the willingness of other stakeholder groups such as operators in adopting these technologies since their participation would be key to the success of any such scheme.",

Since the mid-1960s however, the operations of the sector have seen little regulation, allowing for an influx of new entrants (Salifu, 2004) , and an accompanying low service quality (World Bank, 2020) . Hart notes that, post-colonially, the operators of this mode of transport have been viewed as exploitative and unreasonable in the pricing of their services. The combination of the low service quality and negative stereotypes that have endured over the years, have made the idea of improving the service seem daunting, if not impossible. This poor service quality and the failure of reform to address service challenges, are unfortunately borne by commuters, majority of whom have access to no other form of transportation.",

Adjaidoo and Akowuah (2021) as an example, used the dynamic rate leaky bucket algorithm to develop a departure scheduling model for these paratransit buses. This algorithm was aimed at improving the reliability of the service since the current service does not have any specific schedules for operation. Kommey et al. (2019) as well, developed \"Trotro pass\" a passenger accounting system that was designed to allow real time tracking of trotros while helping operators to estimate vehicle occupancy [and profitability] . The World Bank (2011) suggests that, technologies that can provide real time vehicle tracking and location, voice/data communication between vehicles and dispatchers, off-route monitoring, journey planning, route status information (for passengers via internet and mobile phone), fare collection, vehicle speed monitoring, etc. could significantly improve the service quality of the trotro. A review of literature, also suggests that some of these technological solutions, may well be needed in the trotro service (Hotor, 2016; Sam et al., 2018) .",

Schmidt (2013) also proposes that, for the paratransit, certain technological features can help improve user experience. Features that could allow commuters to; make advance arrangement for rides (passenger booking feature), e-payments to trotro drivers/mates (payment feature), cancel rides without a charge (ride-cancellation), track trotros in real time, report driver and mate misbehavior (reporting feature/trip evaluation feature), and use the digitized service with no-Wifi, were identified as being potential technology-based features of paratransit (Dzisi et al., 2021; Schmidt, 2013; Vanderschuren and Baufeldt, 2018) . Brakewood and Watkins (2019) as well identified that, technology-based transit solutions (such as real time transit information) made transit riders generally more satisfied with transit services. Technology-based transit solutions via cellphone [and other personal devices] also increased frequency of transit use (Brakewood et al., 2015a,b; Ferris et al., 2010; Gooze et al., 2013; Tang and Thakuriah, 2012) and feelings of personal safety (Brakewood et al., 2014) , while decreasing actual and perceived wait times of transit services (Brakewood et al., 2014; Brakewood et al., 2015a,b; Ji et al., 2017; Watkins et al., 2011) .",

Satisfaction with trotro was also seen as being directly influential on commuters' desire to continue using trotros. van Lierop and El-Geneidy (2016) in a previous study, had determined that, transit users' satisfaction with the quality of service had positive effects on their satisfaction with the mode, which in turn, had a significantly positive effect on their loyalty/continued use. Cheng, Lai, Chen and Ou (2010) , also determined that indeed, users' satisfaction was a key determinant in their willingness to repeatedly use mass transportation systems. These studies were however based on the fundamental marketing principle that customers' satisfaction could greatly enhance repeat purchase intentions of the same and other products (Cardozo, 1965) . This study therefore sought to determine service quality concerns of commuters, the possible disparities between service quality expectations of different commuter groups, and as well, the attractiveness of some technological solutions as potential remedies to service quality issues. In this study, it was hypothesized that understanding service quality issues of the trotro and possible factors that could discourage commuters (of all groups) from using it, could help in addressing the issues of this mode of transport. The technological solutions assessed were also hypothesized to create better satisfaction (Brakewood and Watkins, 2019) with trotros and have bearing on its continued use (Cardozo, 1965 ).",

            "text": "Together, both SERVQUAL and SERVPERF tools have been used extensively in research. In Ghana, the tools have been used in measuring service quality of the taxi service in Accra (Mensah and Ankomah, 2018) , service quality of on-campus shuttle services (Ojo et al., 2014) , and as well, the service quality of the bus transport services in Kumasi (Sam et al., 2018) . In these studies, the five service quality constructs of Reliability, Empathy, Assurance, Tangibility and Responsiveness (Zeithaml et al., 1988) are measured. However, upon a closer look at the SERVQUAL constructs, one could realize that, strictly adopting these tools without recourse to the local transport service, would result in an incomplete or incorrect analysis of service quality experiences of commuters. This is because, the SERVQUAL (and the subsequent variation SERVPERF) which were developed initially as management tools for a formal, structured services industry (Cronin and Taylor, 1994; Parasuraman et al., 1991) , would in such cases be used in measuring service quality for a service that is largely informal, and unstructured in operations. This study, in seeking to measure service quality issues of this informal transport service, sought to use constructs that were more relevant to the transport service under review. This was done because some constructs of the typical SERVPERF tool, were considered less relevant to trotros [based on literature and local experiences], while constructs that were considered more reflective of the service were not captured under a generic version of the tool (Birago et al., 2017; Dumedah, 2017; Dzisi et al., 2021; Mensah and Ankomah, 2018; Ojo et al., 2014; Poku-Boansi and Adarkwa, 2013; Sam et al., 2018; Tetteh et al., 2017) .",

In their study, Aniley & Negi (2010) also used a modified SERVPERF in determining passengers' overall satisfaction with HIGER buses in Ethiopia, while P erez S anchez et al. (2007) also used a traditional SERVPERF in examining the relationship between transport service quality and behavioral intentions in Spain. The findings from P erez S anchez et al. (2007) showed that, for the bus service, there indeed existed a relationship between the service quality and commuter's public transport use intentions. Sam et al. (2018) in a study of paratransit buses in Kumasi, Ghana, determined that only the construct 'Reliability' and 'Responsiveness' were significant in explaining service quality of trotros. This suggests that, for the paratransit service in Ghana, the factors important in explaining service quality may be different from the five dimensions used in explaining service quality elsewhere. For this reason, an exploratory study on these factors determining service quality was seen as appropriate, and modifications that made it possible to assess the service were implemented.",

Variability occurs because the trotro service is informal and lacks formal structures of operation. This also leaves little room for addressing commuter complaints with the service (Abane, 2011) . The informal nature of this service permeates almost all aspects of its operation including the fare structure, route selection, schedules (Ndibatya et al., 2014) and customer care (Abenaab, 2012; Ofori-Debra, 2017) . This variability of service quality was therefore made a central theme of this study, just as it is a central theme of the operation of this mode. Variability in customer care as Ofori-Debra (2017) points out, can be observed in the differences in treatment meted out to persons living with disabilities for instance, or women (Anane, 2021) in comparison to able-bodied male commuters.

            "text": "Successfully improving service quality of trotros in Ghana could result in the improvement of transport quality for the vast majority of people. Improving service quality however requires understanding the issues most fundamental to commuters in their choice of public transport. This study contributes to the growing literature on trotro service quality by retooling the SERVPERF to allow it better capture the construct of variability in the trotro service. The study also assessed the differences in service quality perceptions between able-bodied male respondents and more transport vulnerable groups, and as well, the attractiveness of some technology-based solutions. From the service quality evaluation, the following factors were determined as being critical to commuters' choice of trotros: reliability, variability in cost and responsiveness. Among the service quality constructs, reliability was the first most significant factor extracted. The factor contributed 24.9% of the total variance, and was comprised of the variables; 'Times between departures of Trotros are relatively short', 'Passenger belongings are secure', 'It is easy to get a space on a trotro in the morning', 'It is easy to get a space on a trotro in the evening', 'It is safe to use trotro in the morning', 'It is safe to use trotro in the evening' 'I have confidence in the trotro service operators to do their work', 'Trotro drivers are polite', 'Trotro mates are polite', 'The insides of trotro buses are generally clean and hygienic' and 'Trotro mates are neat'. As such, the construct of service reliability, which entails the ability of the operators to provide the promised service dependably and accurately, was considered as a significant factor that impacted trotro users. In an earlier study conducted by Sam et al. (2018) , the construct 'reliability' was also a statistically significant factor that influenced commuters use of trotros within the Kumasi metropolis. The findings of this study therefore re-emphasized the importance of this service quality parameter, and corroborated previous research findings (Adarkwa, 1991; Horsu and Yeboah, 2015; Sam et al., 2018) on its importance to commuters. Variability in cost of the service was the second most important factor extracted from the factor analysis. The factor accounted for 14.63% of the total variance. The variables 'Trotro fares are sometimes higher for women, the old or disabled', 'Trotro fares are sometimes lower for women, the old or disabled', 'Women, the old and disabled face more discrimination in using trotros' and 'Trotro fares are sometimes higher for the same route during different times of day' loaded unto this factor. In an earlier study, Birago et al. (2017) suggest the cost of public transport did have a significant impact on mode choice in Ghana. As such, the constantly varying fares (Buckman, 2013) of trotros could be a factor commuters perceived as affecting service quality. Abenaab (2012) suggests that, the variation in fares can sometimes be due to trotro mates who in some instances, consciously cheat commuters by holding on to change or by overcharging for trips. Persons living with disabilities also noted that, mates charged them twice the normal fares for bringing on board, wheelchairs and other equipment. The results suggest the indiscriminate change in fares were a key service quality concern of commuters. Responsiveness of operators followed next, as the third most important concern of commuters. The factor accounted for 11.37% of the total variance. The variables 'Trotro mates tend to be more helpful to customers with disabilities, old people or women with children', 'Trotro drivers generally tend to respond to passenger concerns', 'Trotro fares are commensurate with service provided' and 'Fares charged for luggage are affordable' also loaded unto this factor. The finding suggests that the willingness of operators to attend to the needs of commuters was another key measure by which commuters measured service quality of trotros. The emergence of the two constructs 'reliability' and 'responsiveness' that were also identified by Sam et al. (2018) as statistically significant trotro service quality factors suggested that the constructs had some influence on Ghanaian commuters. Additionally, the study also identified that male and female respondents had differing perspectives of certain service quality constructs. Statistically significant differences (p\u22640.05) were observed with regard to the perception of trotro driver and mates' politeness, trotro mates' neatness, the variations in trotro fares for women, the perception of discrimination towards women, and the willingness of the respondent groups to use trotros if there were other equally affordable modes of transport. Female respondents and persons living with disabilities were more likely to perceive service quality as being poorer than male respondents across these service quality parameters. These findings suggest there could perhaps be differences in the service quality experienced by males and females in their use of trotros. This further re-iterated the importance of the construct 'Variability' as a service quality measure for paratransit since the informal nature of operations implies the service quality that commuters get could largely depend on the specific operator whose vehicle the individual finds themselves in, and service quality the operator subjectively chooses to offer. The technological features that were considered most in-demand based on the assessment of suitable technologies included: (i) a booking feature, (ii) a driver/mate reporting feature, (iii) a mobile money payment feature, and (iv) a real-time tracking feature. It was also presumed that the selection of these technologies by respondents was because of their abilities in addressing specific challenges. Technologies that could be used in booking, as well as tracking the location of vehicles in real time, could improve reliability of the service. Features that could allow commuters report driver/mate misbehavior, could ensure greater responsiveness by helping regulators identify bad operators. Also, safe and easy payment options via mobile money (Tobbin and Kuwornu, 2011) could reduce incidences of varying costs, and ensure greater accountability on the part of operators. Asked about their intention to continue using trotro if service quality challenges were addressed, about 89% of respondents stated they were willing to continue using or increase their use of trotros if service quality was improved, and 11 % were of an opposing view.",

The study in particular highlights the importance of the construct 'variability in cost' to trotro users. Existing literature on trotros suggest that variation in fares occur for a number of reasons. Firstly, there are legitimate reasons such as servicewide increase in fares (Buckman, 2013) , however, for the most part, variations in fares occur when an operator (often the mate) wants to exploit the passenger (Abenaab, 2012; Ofori-Debra, 2017) . This study contributes to the literature on trotros by highlighting the importance of this construct to perceptions of this mode's service quality. Technologies that seem to help in the improvement of service quality and the closing of service quality gaps in the three identified areas were also seen as appealing features that could be implemented in the trotro service. The influence of these technologies on service quality could be studied much closer, and as well, the willingness of all stakeholders to participate in a technology-based trotro service. The findings of this study have benefit for transport planners in countries with paratransit, particularly those operated in similar ways to the trotro.",

Since transport service provision in developing countries have often been relegated to private actors -with little checks on service quality (Kumar and Barrett, 2008) , there is the need to constantly re-examine the ability of these services to deliver quality services to commuters. Technology-based solutions such as the mobility as a service features identified in this study could be explored further as avenues for better regulation of transport services. Technology-based solutions could benefit transport operators, regulators and commuters if retrofitted properly to the local situations in these countries. Technologies that increase the profitability of operators could for instance encourage the participation of operators. Technologies that improve service quality for commuters could as well help address some of the systemic issues with this mode of transport, while helping regulators coordinate transport services. Since paratransit are not exclusive to Ghana, some of the lessons learnt from this study could perhaps be applicable to transport management in other countries with paratransit.",

From the results, it was determined that, the service quality constructs reliability, variability (in cost) and responsiveness were the three main factors that were of importance to commuters. There were as well, statistically significant differences observed between responses of male and female study participants, and certain technological solutions were determined as possibly beneficial in resolving service quality issues. Technologies that could help commuters make advance arrangements for trips, mobile money payments, track the location of trotros and report misbehavior of operators, were considered most in demand. Together, the findings suggest that technologies that can improve reliability of the trotro, reduce variability around fares, and increase the accountability of operators could have the most benefit for trotro commuters. This suggests there exist service quality gaps that can be filled by MaaS features. However, the willingness of all relevant stakeholders to participate must be examined much more closely to determine the possible success of such a scheme.",
