Although global public health mitigation and suppression strategies are being rigorously executed, emerging pathogens with great potency have been successively invading human populations worldwide. Microbial experts and immunologists are consistently postulating heterogenous plausible theories, including genomic expression, cell structure, and the biological environment of microorganisms that are capable of altering the host's immune responses, thus making people vulnerable to infections [3] [4] [5] . However, these systemic theories at the molecular and microscopic levels do not answer the fundamental question as to why geometric progressions or the chaotic spread of diseases are sustained at the population level. Environmental attributes within the triad of infectious disease dynamics, apart from host and agent, are crucial factors when scrutinizing risks for pathogen spread at the population level.",

This phenomenon has advanced, a priori, that the proximity between people could be a factor in the spread of infections. While Malaysia nearly flattened the curve during the first and second waves of the pandemic [14] , an \"unexpected exponential surge\" of cases led to the third wave of the pandemic in late 2020 and early 2021. In addition, the absence of a vaccination rollout during this stage of the pandemic could have contributed to the rapid rise of daily cases. Malaysia fundamentally relied on targeted interventions of nontherapeutic measures to equilibrize lives and livelihood, while implementing full or partial movement control orders (MCOs); risk area-based lockdowns; rigorous contact tracing; the closure of social, tourism, education and certain economic sectors; and the restriction of people's movement [14] . Despite these interventions, Malaysia showed different infection rates and propagation effects. The nation observed a district-wise regional estimate spike of cases that were mainly concentrated in the Central region of Malaysia compared to other regions. Such geographically different intensities of infection were observed in Italy [15] , and it was postulated to be attributed to differences in demographics, socio-economic factors, health resource capacities, or political management [15] . Crucially, infections that spread between different geographies were hypothesized to be caused by the magnitude of population density in each area and the size of the area or district.",

While most preliminary findings highlight positive correlations between COVID-19 incidence and the compactness of people [11, 13, [16] [17] [18] [19] , some have yet to reach a consensus [12, 20] . These studies measured the direct effect of population density on the incidence count of cases, but did not establish an in-depth analysis that visualized heat distribution and the correlation of cases that could be attributed to attack rates and infectivity per km 2 , which could provide how much risk individuals were exposed to regarding COVID-19 infections in a given area when contacts within compactness were established. Malaysia is currently facing the third phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. To be coherent with the emerging epidemiological landscape, this study aims to determine the correlations between population density, clusters, and COVID-19 incidence across districts and regions in Malaysia. In addition, this study aims to provide an estimated risk of infection attributable to people when a unit of density is increased in a particular district.",

The execution of hierarchical cluster analysis aimed to create clusters of districts according to the rate of reported COVID-19 infections and population density, facilitating comparisons between populations of the highest and lowest rates of infection.

The r value ranges between \u22121 and +1 [27, 28] . A correlation directing towards \u22121 indicates that two variables are more negatively linearly related, a correlation of 0 means that two variables do not have any linear relations, while a correlation coefficient of +1 means that two variables are directed towards a more perfectly positive linear relation [28, 29] . The magnitude size of the r effect can be interpreted as follows [30] : The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) values were synthesized to determine the strengths of association between cases and population density according to geographical regions in Malaysia. Simple linear models using the equation Y = B + aX (Y = dependent variable representing COVID-19 cases; X = independent variable representing population density; B = constant) were deduced at countrywide and regional levels to confirm the associated impact of population density on COVID-19 infections [13, 31] .

The proportion of the variation that covers the spread of COVID-19, attributed directly to population density for each region in Malaysia, was interpreted through the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) values. By using simple linear regression equations, Y = B + aX, the current study deduced the expected rise of COVID-19 cases as per the increase for one inhabitant/km 2 in each region; in other words, the propagation effect yielding the number of active COVID-19 cases for each unit of population density at the given time point. Population density correlated with the spread of COVID-19 at the rate of 61.4% for the whole country. Notably, the countrywide point cloud revealed a propagation effect at the significance level of 5%, as each time the population density increased by 1 individual/km 2 , there was an increase in the number of active COVID-19 cases estimated at 0.88 for all districts in Malaysia ( Figure 5A ). For region-wise estimates, the rate at which population density explained the spread of COVID-19 for the Northern region was 47.7%. This region-wise point cloud estimation had a propagation effect at the significance level of 5%, as each time the population density increased by 1 individual/km 2 , there was an increase in the number of active COVID-19 cases estimated at 0.11 for all districts within the Northern region ( Figure 5B ).

The current third wave started in September 2020 and the surge in the number of cases is significant.

Despite successful efforts to contain the outbreak in the previous two waves [14, 32] , the unexpected exponential rise of cases in the latter, third wave of contagion in Malaysia currently seems difficult to control with nonpharmacological interventions. Revisiting empirical observations from the classical Kermack-McKendrick model that postulates that the size of an epidemic is associated with dense populations [33] , and coupling this with newer catalytic real-life meteorological, mobility or human interactions that can influence the spread and decay durations of epidemics, these factors could plausibly explain why widespread transmissions occur at a later time, as in Malaysia [12, 17] .",

A higher incidence rate is bound to exist in high-population areas as compared to low-density areas based on the availability of people susceptible to infections; however, the current study noted that the attack rate of the COVID-19 epidemic was higher in smaller districts than in larger ones ( Figure 2C ). This finding was consistent with a previous study from China [36] . Such observations should be interpreted with caution, as attack rates of the epidemic could possibly be attributed to population size, in which districts or cities with smaller number of inhabitants will have higher attack rates as compared to others, as attack rate serves as a relative metric for interpretation. This could support the notion advocated by previous researchers when the size of the population outweighs population density in the spread of COVID-19 [16, 37] . Another plausibility of such inconsistency could be attributed to the cut-off standard set by Malaysia to classify areas and districts with more than 40 incidence cases as potential red zones or hotspots [38, 39] . The reason for this move was to relax the stringent containment measures that were implemented for the whole country to continue, and to subsequently shift toward a more targeted approach, meaning districts or areas with more than 40 reported active cases would be placed under enhanced containment measures with rigorous contact tracings, while lower incidence cases would practice somewhat relaxed standard operating procedures to allow economic and social activities, yet facilitate people's movement to a certain threshold. At the time of this study, a national lockdown was not implemented, and interventions were solely based on the targeted implementation of a movement control order (MCO) and standard operating procedures. Incidence count will not equal an attack rate, and attack rates principally rely on potential exposure (contact with an infected person). When levels of interventions are different, people's communication and mobility vary, and so does transmissibility, regardless of density.",
