Based on the Weibo help data, we inferred the spatial distribution pattern of the epidemic situation and its impacts. Seven urban factors, i.e., urban growth, general hospital, commercial facilities, subway station, land-use mixture, aging ratio, and road density, were selected for validation with the ordinary linear model, in which the former six factors presented a globally significant association with epidemic severity. Then, the geographically weighted regression model (GWR) was adopted to identify their unevenly distributed effects in the urban space. Among the six factors, the distribution and density of major hospitals exerted significant effects on epidemic situation. Commercial facilities appear to be the most prevalently distributed significant factor on epidemic situation over the city. Urban growth, in particular the newly developed residential quarters with high-rise buildings around the waterfront area of Hanyang and Wuchang, face greater risk of the distribution. The influence of subway stations concentrates at the adjacency place where the three towns meet and some near-terminal locations. The aging ratio of the community dominantly affects the hinterland of Hankou to a broader extent than other areas in the city. Upon discovering the result, a series of managerial implications that coordinate various urban factors were proposed. This research may contribute toward developing specific planning and design responses for different areas in the city based on a better understanding of the occurrence, transmission, and diffusion of the COVID-19 epidemic in the metropolitan area.",

For instance, the experience of Toronto medical systems that fought against SARS-CoV 2002 indicated that hospitals were the major source that introduced higher risks to their surroundings, as the contaminated environment not only facilitates virus transmission among health care workers, patients, and hospital visitors, but also make more people and families exposed to the risk if pathogen carriers move around the hospital [21] . The clinical uncertainty of such a novel virus makes it more difficult to seize the window period of early control at the beginning of the outbreak. Some other spatial-related dimensions in metropolitan areas could also be recognized as essential factors to evaluate the transmission mechanism of COVID-19 in the urban context, as the density of residential blocks, shopping amenities, and the ration relying on mass transportations is extremely high, creating a suitable urban environment for the disease transmission [20] . Moreover, along with the influx of urban migrants, the squatter settslements with limited housing conditions, sanitation facilities, and access to urban infrastructures, may change the pattern of risks [6] .",

Identifying the impacts of urban environments becomes increasingly important to control risks in the current circumstance. However, it is difficult to evaluate how these impacts vary on the city level because previous epidemiology investigations used to focus on a coarse resolution across provincial or regional boundaries. Therefore, a more incisive investigation with credible location-based details is imperative to further explore the distribution pattern of COVID-19 and influencing urban factors on the city level. We aim to extend the understanding of this disease and its spatial impact not only by validating important urban factors, but also by providing convincing evidence to identify corresponding locations where these factors shed significant influences. Instead of providing a universal antidote, a more precise strategy could be proposed for different areas to better deal with similar public health emergencies in the future, if the spatial variation is taken into consideration.",

As a well-developed commercial centre, Hankou occupies a flat terrain with few natural obstacles but convenient transportation infrastructures.

Due to the adequate stock of reserved land and preferential policy support, the riverside area of Hanyang has kept upgrading along with the prosperous real estate market in recent years, particularly for newly developed residential projects of high-rise buildings. On the south bank are three administrative Districts, among which Wuchang is part of the birthplace of Wuhan city. Between the Sha Lake and the Ziyang Lake is another old downtown area, which also possesses highly concentrated urban facilities and aging ratio, whereas the intensity is slightly lower than that of the Hankou downtown area. The strip zone between the riverside area and the East Lake is another important place for newly developed real estate projects. As regards the other two Districts, Hongshan was the outer city of Wuchang, but in recent years it has gradually evolved into a sub-centre where the city extends to the east, and Qingshan is based on the compound of the large state-owned enterprise, Wuhan Steel Co., and its affiliated residential area.",

Many suspected or confirmed patients with mild to moderate syndrome had to stay at home. Some of them might have had to go outside for different reasons, facilitating the spread of the disease. More seriously, some patients' situation was exacerbated because staying at home cannot be rigorously enforced with effective health care and treatment. Under such a situation, Sina Weibo opened an online channel for people to seek help. To ensure the authenticity of help-seeking information, it was necessary to provide the help-seeker's personal information, including name, age, gender, dwelling address, contact information, syndrome description, etc. Some designated departments were involved to check the authenticity of the information before it was posted online. Therefore, the Weibo help data can be used to estimate the severity of the epidemic in Wuhan with precise positions. Until the middle of February 2020, when many shelter hospitals were built to admit these patients, Weibo was one of the most important channels for help-seeking.",

The information of a total of 415 infected persons was collected, with an average age of 59.9 years old. To ensure the representativeness of sampling, we compared the distribution of Weibo help data with that of the confirmed cases according to the jurisdiction, and it shows strong consistency between the two datasets (Table 1, Figure 2 ). The Chi-square test further confirmed that there was a non-significant difference (Chi-square = 9.977, p = 0.126).

Unexpected bias might exist if the community is adopted as the statistical unit. In addition, these communities are subject to significant variation in size and shape, and it is difficult to conform with the statistical requirements. Therefore, we decided to divide the study area into uniform grids according to Griffith's method [24] . After removing some grids with substantial vacant land and water, 502 urban grids of 1 km 2 coverage were eventually adopted for statistical analysis. The kernel density of Weibo help data was calculated to denote the epidemic severity, which denotes the degree of impact of COVID-19 in a given spatial unit. When adopting the Weibo help data, the epidemic severity refers to the number of potential infected population and social panic, as this means people have to try informal ways to seek help in such an emergent situation. This method is beneficial not only for eliminating a large number of invalid statistical units, but also for presenting the pattern of epidemic spread in the city with good spatial continuity.",

For instance, infectious diseases are usually associated with the distribution of population density in the urban context. In particular, elderly groups have been subjected to the highest level of risk among the cases in Wuhan ( Figure 3 ) [10] . According to a recent study with a large sample size of 1099 COVID-19 patients, people over 60 years old suffered from the highest risk of severe symptoms and mortality due to COVID-19 infection [9] . Those elder people with underlying conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease faced more exposure because of frequent visits to the hospital. Therefore, we took the community aging ratio, i.e., the proportion of elderly people over 65 years old within the community, as the socio-demographic indicator in this study. In this study, the population density was excluded from the model to reduce the multicollinearity problem due to the high correlation with the aging ratio. With regard to the indicators of urban growth, two factors, i.e., floor area ratio (FAR) and road density, were adopted for modeling. These two factors are also suitable proxy variables of population density without introducing multicollinearity. Indicators of urban facilities included the density of general hospitals, commercial facilities, and subway stations. Among them, hospital density denotes the risk of contamination during medical services or due to adjacencies, and the other two factors denote the major public contact with people in urban environments. Besides these, the degree of land-use mixture was calculated based on the Shannon Entropy to denote the diversity of urban functions. All these urban factors are listed in Table 2 . Table 2 .

As found, Hankou is the place where commercial facilities, hospitals, subway stations, and aging communities highly concentrate, whereas FAR, road density, and land-use mixture seem more dispersed in the urban space ( Figure 5 ). The epidemic situation developed from Hua'nan Seafood Market, in which the outbreak was detected, all the way to the south, spreading along the highly concentrated commercial areas such as Jianghan business loop, Jiefang Avenue, and the large surrounding areas of Hanzheng wholesale market. The hotspot pattern of severity is highly consistent with that of the major hospital and the commercial facility ( Figure 5 ). The epidemic situation seemed also widespread in the vast area along the Yangtze River and the Han River. Another spreading trajectory went along the north bank of the Yangtze River (the subway line-1), ending with a hotspot with high incidence around the Baibuting community.

As people in China prefer general hospitals to have medical services, during the outbreak of COVID-19, which coincided with the flu season, a large number of people with a high frequency of hospital visits may cause extra risk of cross-infection around these places. Such a hypothesis could be supported as the GWR model shows that the influence of hospitals on epidemic severity is indeed unevenly distributed in the city, resulting in three agglomeration areas with statistical significance. Statistical evidence reveals that the epidemic severity is highly associated with the distribution of major hospitals, particularly in Hankou (Figure 7) . The spatial pattern is in agreement with the hypothesis that the epidemic risk diffused from the place where the first several confirmed cases were found, i.e., Hua'nan Seafood Market (Figure 4) , perpendicularly to the waterfront area of the Yangtze River.

Because of the geographical restriction of these natural elements, nearby residents have to rely on the only two existing hospitals, intensifying the risk of cross-infection during the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, fallacy correlation between hospital and epidemic severity may exist for specific locations, implying the existence of other interfering factors. For instance, although there is not any major hospital near the Baibuting community which is situated at the northern end of Hankou, there was still a hotspot of confirmed cases.

Once more data are expected to be available, the Bayesian conditional autoregressive model could be implemented to dive into this study with more advanced methods.",
