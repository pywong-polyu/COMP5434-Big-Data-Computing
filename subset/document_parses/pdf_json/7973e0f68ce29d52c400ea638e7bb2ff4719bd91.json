The two other main phenotypes of rhinitis are allergic rhinitis (AR) and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR): AR refers to nasal symptoms that are triggered by Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated response to exposure to allergens, while NAR refers to a heterogeneous group of nasal symptoms without allergic sensitization. 3 Several definitions of rhinitis have been used in epidemiological studies, some of them defining rhinitis as a unified entity, while others define AR and NAR separately. To date, literature reviews on rhinitis prevalence have focused solely on AR. [4] [5] [6] [7] To our knowledge, the last extensive review of the literature on the prevalence of AR worldwide was conducted by the AR and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) in 2008, and at that time the identified studies were mainly conducted in Europe or in the United States. 4 In 2012, a literature review was conducted on the prevalence of AR outside North America and Europe 5 and two recent literature reviews reported prevalence of AR only in China. 6, 7 Therefore, there is no recent literature review on rhinitis prevalence worldwide.",

This variability is probably partly explained by heterogeneity in the definitions used in the studies. Indeed, within the same population the prevalence was found to vary greatly depending on the definition used: for example, in the study by Bauchau et al. rhinitis prevalence in Belgium varied by more than 30% depending on whether rhinitis was defined based on doctor diagnosis or on reported symptoms. 39 Considering all the studies, we found that the average prevalence of doctor diagnosis-based definitions was lower compared to the other definitions. This could be partly explained by the fact that rhinitis prevalence is often underestimated when based on the doctor diagnosis. Indeed, it is recognized that patients with rhinitis often tend to self-diagnose their rhinitis and treat themselves, 40 and those who consult a doctor are likely to have more often moderate to severe rhinitis. 41 In addition, access to health professionals may be heterogeneous according to the geographic location, healthcare system, or socio-economic status of the patient.",

The median rhinitis prevalences were: 29.4% (ranging from 1.1% to 63.3% based on 103 reported prevalences) for unspecified rhinitis, 18.1% (ranging from 1.0% to 54.5% based on 310 reported prevalences) for AR, and 12.0% (ranging from 4.0% to 31.4% based on 13 reported prevalences) for NAR. The median prevalence of current AR was 21.6% based on symptoms-based definition and 16.4% based on IgE/ SPT-based definition. For NAR, the median prevalence was 16.4% based on symptoms-based definition and 31.4% based on IgE/SPTbased definition.

Nevertheless, based on our literature review, We have recently shown that a combination of the ISAAC and ECRHS definitions could be a suitable proxy.43 Another way to define AR and NAR in the absence of IgE/SPT measurements would be to use questions referring to the main triggers of nasal symptoms.

Nevertheless, even in this sensitivity analysis a great heterogeneity was observed between the different prevalences. Moreover, using identical definitions, for example, ISAAC or ECRHS definitions, rhinitis prevalence still varies between different countries of the world.This geographical variability in rhinitis prevalence could be partly explained by different environmental exposures, such as different species of pollen, different lifestyle factors, including dietary habits and keeping of pets indoors, or different host risk factors.5 As in this study, we have reported rhinitis prevalences without considering these risk factors, these hypotheses need to be tested in future studies. It should be noted that these factors were rarely considered and/or investigated in the studies that were identified by this literature review.",
