Furthermore, nurses' job stress can adversely impact this development process. In short, it is hypothesized that nurses' resilience can be enhanced through professional growth and support for mitigating the impact of job stress. Based on the model by Grafton et al.

The average scores were as follows: resilience (62.2 \u00b1 12.2), professionalism (97.8 \u00b1 13.1), and job stress (114.8 \u00b1 19.5). Table 3 shows the results of the correlation between resilience, nursing professionalism, and job stress levels. Resilience was positively correlated with professionalism (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with job stress levels (r = \u22120.16, p = 0.024). In addition, professionalism was negatively correlated with job stress levels (r = \u22120.21, p = 0.003). Table 4 presents the regression analysis results conducted to verify the mediating effects of nursing professionalism on the relationship between resilience and job stress levels. In the first step of the analysis, resilience was treated as an independent variable, and nursing professionalism was treated as a mediator variable. A significant effect was found between resilience and nursing professionalism (\u03b2 = 0.42, p < 0.001). In the second step, the results of the regression with resilience (independent variable) and job stress levels (dependent variable) were statistically significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.16, p = 0.024). In the third step, resilience (independent variable) and nursing professionalism (mediator variable) were simultaneously introduced into the regression model to predict job stress levels (dependent variable). The analysis revealed that nursing professionalism had a significant effect on job stress levels (\u03b2 = \u22120.17, p = 0.026). However, the absolute value of the regression coefficient, the effect of resilience on job stress levels, declined from -0.16 to -0.09 and was not statistically significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.09, p = 0.251). Therefore, nursing professionalism can be interpreted as completely mediating the relationship between resilience and job stress levels, as seen in Figure 1 . Additionally, a Sobel test was performed to verify the significance of the mediating effects of nursing professionalism; the mediating effects on the relationship between resilience and job stress levels were found to be significant (Z = \u22122.12, p < 0.05).

Resilience is an essential resource for dealing with job stress [44, 45] , and people with high resilience levels can recover successfully even under stressful events [43] . In addition, resilience can be rebuilt by fostering professionalism [16] . A previous systematic review concluded that the nurses' resilience and coping factors, including personal views or attitudes as professionals (also known as professional identity), can help in effectively adapting to workplace stressors [46] . Similarly, Lu et al. [47] developed a path model, reporting that professional commitment is an antecedent of nurses' job satisfaction and work stress. The current study showed that nursing professionalism had a positive mediating effect on resilience and a negative effect on job stress levels. Nurses' professionalism affects their resilience and is also a helpful resource in coping with various stressful situations [16] . In other words, by improving nurses' resilience and professionalism, they can manage job stress more effectively, which will eventually become the basis for providing high-quality nursing care. Developing programs for job stress management for nurses [1, 48] and defining appropriate nursing care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [49] are imperative. Further research, including in LTC hospitals and facilities with vulnerable population groups, is needed.",
