Artifacts caused by body movements and head shakes are reduced. The WCF-MSS evaluates autonomic nervous activation from time-series IBI by calculating LF (0.04-0.15 Hz) components of heart rate variability (HRV) corresponding to sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity and HF (0.15-0.4 Hz) components equivalent to parasympathetic activities. The clinical test procedure comprises a pre-rest period (Pre-R; 140 s), mental task period (MT; 100 s), and post-rest period (Post-R; 120 s). The WCF-MSS uses logistic regression analysis to discriminate MDD patients from healthy volunteers via an optimal combination of four explanatory variables determined by a minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm: HF during MT (HF MT ), the percentage change of LF from pre-rest to MT (% LF (Pre\u2212R\u21d2MT) ), the percentage change of HF from pre-rest to MT (% HF (Pre\u2212R\u21d2MT) ), and the percentage change of HF from MT to post-rest (% HF (MT \u21d2Post\u2212R) ). To clinically test the WCF-MSS, 26 MDD patients (16 males and 10 females, 20-58 years) were recruited from BESLI Clinic in Tokyo, and 27 healthy volunteers (15 males and 12 females, 18-60 years) were recruited from Tokyo",

Indeed, the number of people who have experienced MDD during their lifetime was increased by nearly 20% for the last decade (Vos et al., 2016) . Over 76% of people in developing countries and over 40% of people worldwide receive no relevant medical treatment for mental health disorders owing to lack of resources and field professionals (Wang et al., 2007) .

(L\u00e9pine et al., 1997) . As an alternative to history taking, the WCF-MSS enables objective non-contact MDD screening using autonomic nervous system responses induced by a mental task (MT). Automatic nervous system activity can be evaluated using heart rate variability (HRV). The low frequency HRV component (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) corresponds to sympathetic and vagal tone activity and the high frequency HRV component (HF: 0.15-0.4 Hz) reflects parasympathetic activity. Previous research indicates that MDD patients have reduced HRV components at rest (Brunoni et al., 2013; Bassett, 2015; Carnevali et al., 2018) . However, some researchers have reported a lack of correlation between HRV and MDD (Yeragani et al., 1991; Moser et al., 1998) . These conflicting findings can be attributed to substantial individual differences in the autonomic activity of MDD patients during the rest state. Instead of using the rest state, we examined HRV-determined autonomic nervous responses induced by an MT (Sun et al., 2016) . HRV is generally calculated using time-series interbeat intervals (IBI) measured by contact-based electrocardiography (ECG) or PPG. Previously, we developed HRV-based MDD screening systems using both ECG and fingertip PPG (Sun et al., 2016; Dagdanpurev et al., 2018) . However, these conventional measuring techniques require contact-type sensors or electrodes. Long-term discomfort induced by contact-type devices affects the examinee's autonomic nervous system activity (Westen, 2012; Culpepper et al., 2015) .",

To enable non-contact monitoring of HRV, we previously developed an HRV monitoring method using Doppler radar (Suzuki et al., 2008) . The use of web camera-based contact-free remote PPG (rPPG) is another non-contact method of measuring HRV. Like PPG, rPPG uses optical methodology to sense heartbeat-induced arterial volume changes (Lewandowska et al., 2011) . Unlike contact-based PPG, rPPG detects blood volume pulse (BVP) by tracking changes in facial luminance induced by microscopic arterial pulsations via a remote web camera (Poh et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2017) . The WCF-MSS uses rPPG instead of Doppler radar. To optimize data processing procedures specialized for rPPG, we used techniques such as multiresolution analysis of the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transformation (MODWTMRA) to extract BVP from red-green-blue (RGB) color signals.",

A web camera captures moving images of the subject's face that reflect microscopic facial artery pulsations before, during, and after the MT. The system processes the captured facial images to extract heartbeat signals from facial luminance changes induced by arterial pulsations and processes the heartbeat signals to determine HRV-derived autonomic nervous activation induced by MT; this processing allows the system to differentiate MDD patients from healthy subjects. During the image-processing procedure, the system detects and tracks the subject's face to adjust the size and location of the region of interest (ROI). The facial luminance of each frame (30 frames/s) within the ROI is determined by the green signal of the web camera's RGB signals. During the signal-processing procedure, the BVP signal is determined from the green signal of the RGB signals via MODWTMRA. The LF (0.04-0.15 Hz) HRV component, the HF (0.15-0.4 Hz) HRV component, and the LF/HF are calculated using time-series IBI of the BVP signal for each measurement period; that is, the pre-rest (Pre-R), MT, and post-rest (Post-R) periods (Pre-R: 140 s, MT: 100 s, and Post-R: 120 s).
