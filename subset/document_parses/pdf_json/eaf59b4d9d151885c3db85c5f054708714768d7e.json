Whether this is due to waning of immunity to SARS-COV-2 remains unclear. Aim: We aimed to investigate dynamics of antibody isotype responses among vaccinated na\u00efve (VN) and naturally infected (NI) individuals. Methods: We followed up antibody levels in COVID-19 mRNA-vaccinated subjects without prior infection (VN, n=100) at two phases: phase-I (P-I) at ~1.4 and phase-II (P-II) at ~5.3 months. Antibody levels were compared to those of unvaccinated and naturally infected subjects (NI, n=40) at ~1.7 (P-1) and 5.2 (P-II) months post-infection. Neutralizing antibodies (NTAb), anti-S-RBD-IgG, -IgM, and anti-S-IgA isotypes were measured. Results: VN group produced significantly greater antibody responses (p<0.001) than NI group at P-I except for IgM. In VN group, a significant waning in antibody response was observed in all isotypes. There was about ~ a 4-fold decline in NTAb levels (p<0.001), anti-S-RBD-IgG (~5-folds, p<0.001), anti-S-RBD-IgM (~6-folds, p<0.001), and anti-S1-IgA (2-folds, p<0.001). In NI group, a significant but less steady decline was notable in NTAb (~1-folds, p<0.001), anti-S-RBD IgG (~1-fold, p=0.005), and S-RBD-IgM (~2-folds, p<0.001). Unlike VN group, NI group mounted a lasting anti-S1-IgA response with no significant decline. Anti-S1-IgA levels which were ~3 folds higher in VN subjects compared to NI in P-1 (p<0.001), dropped to almost same levels, with no significant difference observed between the two groups in P-II. Conclusion: While double dose mRNA vaccination boosted antibody levels, this \"boost\" was relatively short-lived in vaccinated individuals.",

The study included vaccinated na\u00efve (VN) participants (n=100) who had received two doses of the two approved mRNA vaccines in Qatar: BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. Levels were compared to those of unvaccinated but naturally infected (NI) subjects (n=40). Venous blood samples were collected from vaccines in two phases: phase 1 (P-I) and phase (P-II). For the VN group, P-I samples were collected at 1.4 months (median=6 weeks) and P-II samples were collected at 5.3 months (median=23 weeks) after the second dose. For the .

In the current study, mRNA vaccination elicited significantly greater NTAb, anti-S-RBD-IgG, and anti-S1-IgA levels, compared to natural immunity (Figure 1 ). These results are in concordance with previous research findings reporting that mRNA vaccines induce higher antibody levels and greater antibody breadth than natural exposure to infection, and differences were particularly notable against the RBD domain (19) .

It should be noted that our NI group included only 45% symptomatic subjects, while the remaining were paucisymptomatic (20%), asymptomatic (20%), or with unspecified severity (15%), which could have affected our results. In those with more severe COVID-19, binding and NTAb antibody titers have been reported to rise faster and reach a greater peak [9, 10, 14] . Individuals with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have greater antibody titers than asymptomatic, and people who are hospitalized have higher antibody titers than people who are managed as outpatients [9, 10, 15, 16] . Furthermore, several studies have shown a link between cycle threshold (Ct) and antibody titer, with lower Ct values linked with greater antibody titers at the population level [9, 13] . These factors could have impacted the elicited immune response. Furthermore, we have not measured antibody levels prior to vaccine administration.",

SARS-CoV-2Neutralizing Antibody 121, Mindray, China) with a WHO conversion factor of 1 AU= 3.31 IU/mL, and the reference range is 10 AU/mL to 400 AU/ml. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to dilute the samples that presented readings higher than the mentioned range.(2) Antibodies to the RBD of the S1 subunit of the viral spike protein (IgG (S-RBD)) (catalog No. SARS-CoV-2 Anti-S-RBD IgG122, Mindray, China), with a cut off index for the kit is \u2265 10-1000 AU/ml, and WHO standardization factor of 1.15 BAU/mL. IgA against a recombinant S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 was detected using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) (EUR S-IgA) (catalog number: EI 2606-9601 A). The IgA ratio was calculated by dividing the extinction of the sample by the calibrator. Ratios < 8 were considered negative, and \u2265 0.8 were considered positive(18). IgM levels were measured using the automated analyzer Vidas\u00ae 3 from BioMeriux Diagnostics (Cat.No. 423833, bioM\u00e9rieux, France).

Vaccination was subsequently expanded to include one age group at a time, as well as certain professional groups (such as teachers), with age serving as the primary criteria for vaccination eligibility throughout the rollout.
