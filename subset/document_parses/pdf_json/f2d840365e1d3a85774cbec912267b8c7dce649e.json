Long-standing health inequities, embedded in the continent over centuries, have been laid bare and have raised complex ethical dilemmas. While there are very few clinical ethics committees (CECs) in Africa, the demand for such services exists and has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The views of African healthcare professionals or bioethicists on the role of CECs in Africa have not been explored or documented previously. In this study, we aim to explore such perspectives, as well as the challenges preventing the establishment of CECs in Africa.",

            "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has raised numerous clinical and ethical challenges globally. Some were vaguely familiar from pre-COVID-19 times such as the fair allocation of scarce healthcare resources including beds and ventilators in intensive care units (ICUs) [1] . However, in Africa, the scarcity of all resources was exacerbated by the COVID-19 surge and this scarcity was extended to include high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, general hospital beds, and testing kits [2, 3] . In some instances, healthcare professionals (HCPs) struggled with the ethical conflict inherent in choosing between their lives, the health and lives of their families, and those of their patients. Many high-income countries were able to access clinical ethics committees (CECs) to assist HCPs and hospital administrators to create policies and protocols to outline clinical standards for treatment and fair distribution of scarce resources [1] . In the United States, some CECs reported that their workload doubled or increased substantially during the first 3-4 months of the pandemic [4] . This increase prompted ethics consultants to focus on providing support to HCPs who were dealing with ethical challenges surrounding critically ill patients. In addition, one of the consultants indicated that the reason they received an increase in requests for consultation was that HCPs found them useful and were satisfied with the resolution of the dilemma [4] . In South Africa, two new CECs were established during the pandemic-a COVID-19 CEC was set by the Mediclinic hospital group that has 52 health facilities in South Africa and a provincial CEC was established in the Western Cape. Some of the authors (KM, AK) served on these CECs that received several requests for consultation. Consequently, the CECs met more frequently during the pandemic. With the current third wave in South Africa, these requests are again being directed to existing and new CECs to assist with difficult triage decisions for ICU cases and hospital beds (KMpersonal communication).",

            "text": "CECs play an integral role in clinical decision-making in hospitals and clinics as a multidisciplinary group trained in analysing and discussing clinical ethics challenges, using a systematic approach following a specific deliberation method that encourages openness about value judgments and justifications in daily clinical practice. [5, 6] . CECs play several roles in order to fulfill their functions, which include the roles of analyst, moderator, disseminator, facilitator, stakeholder advocate, advisor, and guardian of values and laws [5] . The role is well defined in high-income countries (HICs) such as in Europe, the United States, and Canada [6, 7] , where CECs are regularly presented with various ethical dilemmas (end-of-life decisions, consent, confidentiality, and respecting family or surrogate wishes) [8] [9] [10] . However, according to the literature, there are no formal established CECs in Africa, other than two CECs in South Africa [11] . This raises the question of how HCPs in other African countries are handling ethical issues while caring for their patients, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most HCPs in Africa have limited or no medical ethics training [12] [13] [14] . The ethics training in the region is predominantly in research ethics and Research Ethics Committees (RECs) are well established in most African countries. These RECs are predominantly responsible for the review of research protocols with the ultimate goal of protecting the rights of research participants. CECs, on the other hand, provide oversight in clinical environments such as clinics and hospitals and advise on ethical dilemmas that arise in clinical care. In the absence of CECs during the pandemic, HCPs have been forced to take responsibility for soul-wrenching decisions on triage and resource prioritization [1] . In other low-and middleincome countries (LMICs) such as Malaysia, the limited number of CECs have turned to online consultation services to provide clinical ethics advice to HCPs to help resolve the ethical dilemmas raised by the COVID-19 pandemic [15] . Such a platform could also be useful to provide support to African HCPs who have no access to clinical ethicists to provide guidance and assistance when there are conflicting values among patients, their families, and professional staff in a clinical context or CECs at their institutions.",

This qualitative study has confirmed that most of the participants lacked formal CECs in their institutions and countries, as seen in our previous quantitative paper [16] . Only two African countries, South Africa and Kenya mentioned having established CECs with multidisciplinary membership that has been operating for more than three years. However, participants from other African countries without formal CECs described alternative approaches that they used in resolving ethical dilemmas. These included ad hoc consultations, clinical meetings, using existing knowledge, or seeking advice from colleagues. These approaches have been observed in other resources poor and some resource rich countries as well [13, [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, in a morally pluralistic world, it is insufficient to depend on individual professional judgment and moral codes to provide high quality healthcare because the quality of ethical deliberation required to make good healthcare decisions requires diverse clinical and ethical expertise [21] . This expertise can be acquired by having a multidisciplinary CEC with members who are trained or experienced in applying ethics frameworks to aid decision-making with respect to clinical dilemmas.",

            "text": "In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, participants realised the importance of having CECs in African healthcare institutions as this would have better prepared the health workforce for decision-making during this public health crisis. There were new ethical issues involving clinical decisions in critical care units, allocation of limited resources, and treatment of surgical patients. The support of CECs has the potential to provide valuable support to HCPs and healthcare institutions enabling decisions based on sound judgment, concrete understanding of ethical principles, and the ability to engage with patients with transparency. In particular, ethical challenges arose in the allocation of scarce resources and the prioritisation of treatment and care for patients with co-morbidities in under-resourced African countries [23] . Non-COVID-19 health services (HIV, Tuberculosis, oncology, and non-communicable diseases) were deescalated to prioritise acute COVID-19 care. This created moral distress for HCPs managing non-COVID-19 wards and clinics. Furthermore, many HCPs on the frontlines have reported experiencing moral distress and moral injury [24] . Moral distress usually arises when HCPs are unable to carry out their tasks or when they are forced to deny essential and life-saving treatment to a patient due to a lack of resources. Consequently, this level of distress may lead to feelings of anger, shame, and guilt, which if left unresolved may cause moral injury that may lead to anxiety and depression [25] . CECs play an important role in creating distance between the dilemma and the HCP minimising moral distress and moral injury in HCPs who are expected to deliver care under extremely difficult conditions [26] . It is therefore unsurprising that some of the CECs in the USA noted that their ethics consultations doubled during the pandemic [4] , and in certain facilities, they had to educate staff by implementing a series of formal and informal education programs at the bedside and via virtual ethics consultation services. Such online ethics consultation services could provide workable alternatives to physical on-site CECs, as implemented in Malaysia [15] , especially during the current coronavirus pandemic. The online platform can be coordinated by clinical ethicists in the country or outside the country, where HCPs ask their questions or gain access to resources related to clinical ethics concerns to guide their decision-making processes. Such online platforms have worked well for RECs during the pandemic and could work equally well for CECs provided sufficient security measures are in place to preserve confidentiality.",

Although our findings show that African countries with no formal CECs are receiving support from individual ethicists formally or informally, having formal ethics support services such as CECs could enhance the clarity, consistency, and plausibility of decisions made across African countries [28] . This is especially necessary from a legal perspective. For example, in Nigeria, there has been increasing litigation against HCPs, which might indicate the gaps between their level of awareness and basic knowledge of medical ethics [12] . South Africa has been experiencing an increase in medical litigation for the past decade [29, 30] because patients have become more aware of their legal rights. This could increase after the pandemic but it is currently too early to assess this possibility. In South Africa, our institutional CEC has been assisting with mediation when conflict arises between the healthcare team and families of patients since 2009. The mediation role of CECs could potentially be used to reduce medico-legal issues and conflicts to simplify a pragmatic reconciliation that allows a path forward in clinical care [30] .",

These dilemmas included consent difficulties, end-of-life decision-making, confidentiality, and conflicts regarding surrogate decision-making. Similar dilemmas have also been observed in developed countries [8, 9, 10, [32] [33] [34] . One of the study participants indicated that their CEC received referrals related to consent, particularly regarding the child's capacity to provide informed consent. Such situations can be complex as parents in Africa often believe they know what is best for their children [35] . In a Norwegian study, the authors found that the \"more people have a say in medical issues, conflicts regarding solutions of complex medical problems obviously become more frequent\". This could explain why 19 of their 31 case studies involved children who had appointed their guardians (parents) to make medical decisions [36] . In these situations, CECs or CESs balance all the possible treatment options before concluding what would be in the best interests of the minor [37] . However, an additional challenge is trying to respect patient autonomy with respect to the competence of children [37] . With such challenges, the competence of children to make various decisions about different aspects of their health care must be viewed on a sliding scale [37] .",

In such instances, a clinical ethics consultation was the solution for HCPs to get broader illumination or moral backing on a decision being contemplated by the medical team.",

To a large extent, the awareness challenge could be due to the fact that unlike RECs or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), 'CEC' is a new concept in most resource-poor countries. This finding illustrates the importance of educating and training CEC members to execute their functions efficiently and effectively to build credibility within healthcare institutions [40] . Funding constraints in establishing CECs are related to the emphasis on RECs or IRBs in Africa. Most research funders like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) fund development of research ethicists, not bioethicists and clinical ethicists and they fund the establishment of RECs or IRBs, not CECs. Furthermore, the lack of ethical guidance or expertise is compounded during a pandemic, as smaller and weaker health systems are at greater risk of using all their resources for healthcare with little or no support from the government for ethics [41] .",

While conferences focusing on research ethics are commonplace in Africa, there are very few events focusing on clinical ethics. The International Conference on Clinical Ethics and Consultation (ICCEC) has been hosted globally for the past 15 years, but never in Africa. Very few African delegates have been able to attend this conference when it was hosted in the global north. However, in 2021, ICCEC will be hosted in South Africa for the first time in its 15-year history (www. iccec 2021. co. za). This will provide an important role in stimulating interest in clinical ethics on the continent.",

By interviewing bioethicists/HCPs, we were able to obtain their unique experiences and perspectives on CECs in Africa, which is a major strength. In addition, through in-depth interviews, we were able to clarify the differences in understanding between RECs and CECs to some of the participants that were not so familiar with the term \"CEC\". A limitation was the suboptimal response from Lusophone and Francophone African countries. Most of the interviews were conducted in English as we did not have French-or Portuguese-speaking research assistants in this unfunded project. Although we could not interview participants from all African countries, we managed to interview representatives from many different parts of the African continent including some Francophone and Lusophone countries where participants were able to communicate in English. Given the suboptimal response from Lusophone and Francophone countries, future studies could attempt to source funding and translators to ensure balanced responses from all parts of Africa to improve the representativeness of the data. We validated our findings by analysing and discussing the data with the research team. Further research should investigate African countries that have implemented CECs in their healthcare facilities since this study was conducted or as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. It would also be interesting to examine whether CECs have an impact on the delivery of healthcare in African countries and the impact on healthcare litigation in Africa.",

Specialised training for HCPs in the area of clinical ethics was identified as a critical need amongst respondents in this study. Engaging with participants in Francophone and Lusophone countries in Africa would add to the diversity of perspectives in future studies. The timing of this study was pivotal in creating an appreciation of the need for CECs during the coronavirus pandemic. New CECs were developed and maintained during the first and second waves of infection in South Africa and are to be retained after the pandemic due to the positive role played. The idea for the formation of a network of CECs in Africa has been developed during this study and we hope to implement this finding and launch the first CEC network in Africa at the International Conference on Clinical Ethics and Consultation (ICCEC) in South Africa in 2021. The overall aim of our proposed CEC network is to develop and sustain multidisciplinary expertise in clinical ethics in Africa. The objectives of the network will be to provide capacity building to developing and established CECs, organise annual meetings, establish contacts with CECs internationally, produce a database of information for CECs, and encourage resource sharing across African countries.

This is so because there are no clinical ethics committees in the hospitals in my country. Individual healthcare workers sometimes ask bioethicists on a personal level but not as institutional arrangements. \" [Country 12] \"Healthcare professionals are reaching out for ethical advice during the current major global health emergency based on the experience of the senior colleagues/consultants who are working with the frontline teams. \" [Country 13] \"For my country, there is no system for answering ethical questions in hospitals, no committees for professional ethics, and this affects the direct answer to doctors' ethical concerns. Most doctors turn to the Internet and ask their older colleagues or the more experienced doctors\". [Country 16] The two countries that indicated they had CECs received support from their local committees during the pandemic, as described below by one participant: \"A provincial CEC was established in one province specifically for COVID-19 dilemmas and a private hospital group also established a COVID-19 CEC at the start of the pandemic\" [Country 1]. \"At the National Referral Hospital, the Clinical Ethics Committee is being consulted and is guiding on ethical issues during the pandemic. This is also happening at the University Hospital\". [ Country 6] Most participants indicated that having a CEC within healthcare facilities was important, as it would help with complex decision-making and would support the staff working on the frontline during COVID-19 who have to make difficult decisions. Furthermore, the participants felt having a CEC would have prepared HCPs in handling ethical dilemmas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The CEC would be important in guiding HCPs and especially in this time of a challenging new virus. Everyday HCPs are dealing with new dilemmas when providing care to COVID-19 patients, so the CEC would help by handling that burden and making sound ethical decisions [Country 12] \"CECs would have established policies that address many of the common and uncommon ethical issues. These policies would have been helpful during the pandemic. It is easier to establish policies to deal with emergencies during non-emergency periods as it allows non-emotional deliberations and allows adequate time for discussion and exploration of different viewpoints and involves more stakeholders. Policies to address issues such as allocation of scarce resources, do not resuscitate orders, quarantine, etc\u2026\" [Country 6] \"We think that having clinical ethics committees would prepare healthcare professionals for this global health emergency. They encounter different ethical aspects: lack of materials, treatment protocols, refusal of treatment from the patient. \" [Country 8] \"CECs are important because it will help institutions make well informed clinical decisions especially for clinically ill patients like those suffering from COVID-19 where clinicians in ICU need to decide which patient to put on a ventilator and which ones not to... \" [Country 5] \"\u2026because CEC will provide a platform for clinicians and other health care workers, to obtain needed help in deciding what to do when faced with an ethical-legal challenge in practice\u2026\"[Country 13] Another participant interestingly mentioned how the pandemic ignited the intention to establish a CEC. \"Until today, there was no intent to do it but the situation such as the Covid-19 pandemic heightened the urgent need to put it in place\". [Country 8] During the current COVID-19 pandemic, participants had several ethical issues or dilemmas that they were confronted with within their countries. Most of these issues involved resource allocation, patient and staff safety. \"\u2026At our institution, we are facing issues of allocation of resources such as ICU beds, ventilators, High Flow Nasal Oxygen and PPE. There was also conflict over de-escalation of surgical services to deploy skilled nursing staff to high care and critical care units. One case that was particularly difficult involved a patient who was managed in another country and was repatriated with complications. His condition was futile and discussion arose around allowing his wife to see him during lockdown regulations prior to withdrawing ventilation as she had not seen him for several months while he was abroad\" [Country 1] \"Most ethical decisions relate to dealing with the distribution of limited resources in a fair way to patients. In addition to that, the ethical dilemma of medical staff in danger of dying while carrying out their professional duties became important\". [Country 16] \"\u2026 there is a resource constraint on COVID-19 such as lack of PPE and other equipment like ventilators. The issue was who gets to be put on a ventilator in case of need for respiratory support\u2026\" [Country 12]",

We do not even have programs in bioethics... I know of a program that is mostly looking at research but not issues related to clinical ethics. Because the funding is NIH and the NIH interest is research, not clinical ethics. I think if we are going to see more clinical ethics, we need to dedicate funds to do clinical ethics. \" [Country 7] \"resources are another issue because if we need to have CECs we need to have a small setup and someone to help us to run the office/setup, so this is quite costly. It is about providing training that will lead to the establishment of CECs within the hospital setting. It can be replicated in other big hospitals in other parts of the country. \" [Country 3]",
