We randomly selected 100 PLWH and then 1:1 matched them to 100 outpatient HIV-negative adult medicine patients receiving care for chronic medical conditions on days since completion of second vaccination (minimum 10), sex, age +/-5 years, and the type of mRNA vaccine received, using the R 4.1.1 statistical software \"ccoptimalmatch\" package. Antibody responses were measured using a validated surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) [3] , and the ET Health Pylon anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG assay [4] . The sVNT measures competitive inhibition of the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) [4] . We defined a non-response as an sVNT reciprocal titer <10 and anti-RBD IgG <10 relative fluorescent units, based on the assay limits of detection. We examined non-response by HIV status using mixed-effects logistic regression, with a random effect for the matched-group indicator. We then compared continuous levels of each test following logtransformation using mixed-effects interval regression in similar fashion. Due to subtle differences in age of the groups, models were adjusted for age. ",

These findings mirror differences in humoral responses by HIV status following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in a similar population [4] . Following data suggesting that third dose booster vaccination may increase humoral response among other immunocompromised populations with decreased initial responses to mRNA vaccination, such as individuals who have undergone solid organ transplant [2] , it will be important to study alternate immunization strategies among PLWH. Given our finding that people with unsuppressed HIV RNA had limited humoral responses to vaccination, and in the context of continued waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical that we redouble efforts to achieve virologic suppression among PLWH who are not currently virologically suppressed.",

            "text": "PLWH could have decreased response to vaccination due to defects of CD4+ T-cell help [5, 6] , particularly given our finding that PLWH with low CD4+ T-cell counts did not mount a detectable serologic response. PLWH who received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not have reduced humoral or T-cell responses compared to those without HIV when PLWH with CD4+T-cell counts <350 cells/uL or <500 cells/uL were excluded, depending on the study [7, 8] . In another study which enrolled PLWH with higher CD4+ counts than in this study, no differences in humoral vaccine response were seen following BNT 162b2 vaccination by HIV status, although absolute IgG levels were lower among PLWH [9] . The persistent inflammatory state of HIV infection, mediated by the immunoregulatory kynurenine pathway [10] , may also interfere with CD4+ T-cell functionality in response to vaccination. Germinal center fibrosis related to longstanding HIV may lead to more limited persistence of vaccine antigens, required for ongoing stimulation of B cells to form a robust A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 7 antibody response, and functional proliferative B-cell defects related to HIV infection could contribute to a compromised humoral response [11] . Differences in humoral responses by vaccine type among PLWH should be interpreted with caution given that the sample of PLWH who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine was small. Higher vaccine response with the mRNA-1273 vaccine, if confirmed in other studies, could be related to the additional week between administrations, higher vaccine dose, differences in inducing T cell subsets, or other factors [12] . Given high initial clinical efficacy of both mRNA vaccines, these differences may not be clinically significant. However, it will be important to compare these two vaccines longitudinally among immune compromised populations to understand the durability of the immune response. Furthermore, with greater time following vaccination, or with variants of concern such as the delta variant, these differences could potentially become clinically relevant [13] .",

The comparison between the two mRNA vaccines was limited by fewer individuals receiving mRNA-1273, and the lack of randomization.
