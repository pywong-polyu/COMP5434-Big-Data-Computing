Since the last editorial (Carey et al., 2021) , this pandemic continues to burgeon and significantly impact society despite a variety of vaccination efforts, with cases now rising (at the time of writing) towards 180 million and 4 million deaths worldwide (WHO, 2021) . The majority of these are currently occurring within the USA; however, India's increased transmissions look to out-pace all countries. This is due to India's public health resource constraints including a critical shortage of COVID-19 vaccines (Cunningham et al., 2021) . Indeed, COVID-19 cases in India, if not brought under control, will soon surpass tuberculosis (TB) as the leading infectious disease in India (which accounts for the highest percentage of TB cases in the world: i.e., 26%). Indeed, TB in India is actually increasing because COVID-19 is hampering TB eradication programs (WHO, 2020a) . This is a secondary and very sad consequence of the current pandemic.",

Cancer is debilitating for all, irrespective of age, citizenship, religious/spiritual beliefs or social status and exerts 'tremendous physical, emotional and financial strain on individuals, families, communities and health systems'-a very costly disease for all societies (WHO, 2020c). It has already been argued in a previous issue of JORH (2020) , 'that the two main inhibitors regarding the prevention and treatment of cancer are lack of government commitment and inadequate research funding. If only nations would enthusiastically seek a solution for cancer as earnestly as a vaccine for COVID-19' (Carey, 2020 (Carey, , p. 2668 )-then another life destroying and fiscally crippling disease, affecting people and subsequently all economies, would be eradicated.",
