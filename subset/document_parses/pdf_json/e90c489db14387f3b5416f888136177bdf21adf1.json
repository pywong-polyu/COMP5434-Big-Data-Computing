            "text": "Open access to information processing difficulties and comorbid disorders (eg, anxiety), could lead to both an increase as well as a decrease of problems given pandemic related measures that are taken such as nation-wide lockdowns, social distancing, less face-to-face and more online social contact, and the use of face masks. Indeed, recent studies considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated public health measures on individuals with ASD and their close ones show mixed results. Several authors suggest that individuals with ASD may pose a particularly vulnerable population [13] [14] [15] [16] , yet only a handful of empirical studies have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with ASD. For instance, a recent study by Nonweiler et al 4 showed that, during a COVID-19 related lockdown in the UK, children and young people with neurodevelopmental disorders (n=106 with ASD) compared with neurotypicals (n=82) experienced more emotional and behavioural problems and presented with less prosocial behaviour. Moreover, two Italian studies 17 18 found increased problematic behaviour and intensity of autistic symptoms in children with ASD as measured during a COVID-19-related lockdown in Italy spring 2020. In addition, a large cohort study in the USA 19 found that the pandemic led to significant disruptions in therapies, worsened ASD symptoms and family distress. In a broader sense, the Co-Space study 20 has found that children with special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental difficulties (among whom children with ASD) have elevated levels of behavioural, emotional and attentional difficulties, which have not subsided post-lockdown in this group contrary to neurotypicals. Along that line, a study by Mutluer et al 21 revealed that special needs education was either partially or completely suspended as during the COVID-19 pandemic, and noted more behavioural problems. Other authors have also suggested that school disruption may potentially result in frustration. 22 The increased complexity of social interaction with different social cues in online communication, a decrease in exposure to social situations, routines that have been broken, disrupted mental healthcare services, and information and public health restrictions which are constantly changing may all contribute to increases in behavioural and emotional problems, such as more restricted, repetitive behaviours, sleep problems, anxiety, depression and aggression. 21 23 24 Along with individuals with ASD, relatives of individuals with ASD, like their parents or siblings, may also find themselves particularly challenged during the pandemic. Most informal support and professional mental healthcare guidance were significantly reduced due to the pandemic measures, known to be important protective factors for parents and families under normal circumstances. 25 Informal support, particularly one's satisfaction with informal support, is known to predict family resilience, 26 that is, a lack thereof is likely to decrease such family resilience. Actually, during a school-closure period in the UK, it was found that a large portion of families with children with special educational needs (>80% ASD) experienced negative effects on their mental health, with more anxiety, stress and lower mood. 27 Moreover, a recent COVID-19 study in Turkey found that mothers of children with ASD had more health anxiety, less dispositional hope and less psychological well-being compared with mothers with neurotypical children. 28 Similarly, parents of children with ASD in Saudi Arabia were negatively impacted (ie, more stress and less emotional well-being) by the COVID-19 pandemic. 29 It seems that particularly parents of school-aged children had an increase in overall distress, which may increase their risk of crises. 19 Relatives of individuals with ASD have to both assist their affected family members, and face other potential challenges such as work demands or financial worries. 30 Role confusion, that is, having to navigate the role of parent, advocate, educator, spouse, and so on, is most likely increased as well. 31 Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding measures seem to affect relatives of individuals with ASD by an increase in stress and decrease in overall well-being family resilience. 1 17 19 26 Interestingly, while the beforementioned ASD characteristics may thus leave individuals with ASD as well as their relatives at increased risk, some of these characteristics may also serve as a protective factor at the same time. 32 As the COVID-19 pandemic includes mandatory distancing, less-to-no exposure to group activities, and less social interaction, some individuals with ASD may benefit from the measures related to the pandemic. 33 For example, they might feel less pressured by society to participate in everyday (social) life, typical sensory overstimulation might be reduced, or they may be able to engage more in the repetitive behaviours which soothe them and decrease anxiety. 23 Moreover, individuals with ASD may, all of a sudden, feel less different from neurotypicals, as during the pandemic most people spent their time alone at home with little-to-no social activities. As such, individuals with ASD may experience less rejection or bullying, feel less stigmatised or outside the norm, reducing so-called minority stress 27 34 and potentially improving overall functioning. 35 Lastly, individuals with ASD may benefit from more online compared with offline social interaction with friends as an online environment may elicit less anxiety, allowing friendships to blossom. 36 During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents to individuals with ASD may also have gained new, positive experiences in dealing with their child (eg, maintaining a schedule for their children, learning new skills to their child and setting boundaries), resulting in potential positive longterm effects. 33 37 Taken together, previous research suggests that, while a pandemic may prove challenging to each and every individual, individuals with ASD and their relatives may prove particularly vulnerable. 3 15 16 18 Individuals with ASD and their relatives present with characteristics that may limit coping and resilience in light of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the continuously changing public health measures, putting them at risk for negative outcomes, such as stress, anxiety, depression, loneliness, a decline in general functioning, increase autistic symptoms, and confusion regarding the COVID-19 measures. 15 16 18 19 21 23 24 38 39 Moreover, previous research has shown that major-life events, trauma and stress can have a long-lasting impact on mental health in individuals with ASD, 40 which leads to the expectation that the COVID-19 pandemic too will have long-term consequences for individuals with ASD and their families. In addition, relatives of individuals with ASD may be subject to significant stress as well, due to extra role confusion and the extra burdens put on them. 17 28 29 However, all but one of the beforementioned research studies lack a direct pre-COVID-19 baseline measure. Some studies asked participants if they experienced an increase in symptoms or difficulties as a result of the pandemic or its consequent measures 17 or compared a subgroup to a larger cohort 19 , or compared different groups (eg, neurotypicals with a group with neurodevelopmental disorders 4 ), but no direct baseline measure was available to compare during COVID-19 with pre-COVID-19. In addition, the results depend on either quantitative 18 or qualitative data. 30 Given the limitations of these studies, it gives a limited understanding of the impact of the current pandemic as specific to individuals with ASD and their families. To date, no research has been conducted into the impact of a large-scale event in this target group using a baseline measure as well as a mixed-method design.",

Consent could be given either on paper or online. If no response was received for 1 week the research assistant did a follow-up via telephone. The quick turnaround was due to the time-sensitivity of COVID-19 research. Participants who did not want to partake were asked to answer a few questions on their motivation, to allow for some attrition analyses later. Active consent was acquired to share any unforeseen but relevant findings to medical health Open access professionals if needed.

In total 27 parents participated in the interviews. This sample size will allow for both deductive and inductive analyses depending on specific qualitatively or mixed-method oriented research questions, such as the experience of agency and family dynamics, role-confusion/change and parental burden due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For these questions, subsamples will be used in which sample size will be determined based on, for example, the qualitative saturation principle 42 or a mixed-method design in which we deductively deepen quantitative data. Samples will be selected either based on random sampling, purposive qualitative sampling, or purposive quantitative sampling. For instance, for research question 2 (parental burden) parents who score high on parental load on the Parenting Stress Questionnaire (PSQ; in Dutch: Opvoedingsbelastingvragenlijst (OBVL)) may be selected. 43 For the impact of COVID-19 on the families and the multiple roles parents may have to play (caregiver; informer, therapist; teacher; etc) (research question 5) we will use a grounded theory framework to capture the development of experiences within families and identify if parents experience role confusion due to the multiple roles they have play, more during the pandemic than normally. From previous literature it is known that chaos is particularly problematic in families with children with ASD, 44 45 and parents can play a critical role in managing chaotic circumstances for their children with ASD. Given the challenges the pandemic puts on everyone, including additional stress for parents, no predefined hypothesis can be formulated, but based on general theory one may expect this theme to be important. For this question, we do not exclude participants a priori but analyse the full sample until saturation is reached (ie, random sampling until saturation). If, contrary to expectations, saturation is not reached within the current sample, additional funding will be applied for continued sampling. If this is not feasible due to practical limitations, such as the impossibility to return to a time frame with specific COVID-19 measures, the findings will be presented in open science framework for triangulation with other possible study findings.",

At baseline, overall functioning could be reported by a parent/guardian by filling out the CBCL, 47 as part of standard care. Each item is scored on a 3-point Likert scale ranging from 0, not at all to 2, clearly to describe the behaviour of the child during the last 6 months. The CBCL consists of an Internalising (subscales: anxious/depressed, somatic complaints and withdrawn/depressed) and an Externalising domain (subscales: Rule-Breaking Behaviour and Aggressive Behaviour). A total problems score can also be determined, this score gives a general view of the extent of both behavioural and emotional problems based on the scores of the two domains and the three remaining syndrome scales: Thought Problems, Social Problems, and Attention Problems. The CBCL 6-18 parent-report has high test-retest reliability, internal consistency and criterion validity. 48 Overall functioning during the pandemic (T1 and T2) will also be assessed, for which the Brief Problem Monitor-Parent form (BPM-P) 49 , a shortened version of the CBCL. The BPM-P will be scored similar to the original CBCL on a 3-point Likert scale ranging from 0, not at all to 2, clearly. The internal consistency of the BPM was high, and the total score of the CBCL and the BPM-P highly correlate. 50 If the participant was \u226512 years at baseline, self-reported overall functioning will also be included if available, by means of the Youth Self Report (YSR). 51 The CBCL and the YSR can be transformed into similar domains and syndrome scales. Good reliability and validity have been confirmed for the Dutch version of the YSR in the Dutch population by Verhulst et al. 48 ASD characteristics (T0, T1, T2) To assess ASD characteristics within the children, the Dutch version of the parent-report SRS-2, 52 and if applicable the self-report SRS-A, 53 will be used, which can be part of baseline measurements as well.

The SRS-2 is composed of six subscales: (1) Social Awareness, (2) Social Cognition, (3) Social Communication, (4) Social Motivation, (5) Restricted Interests and (6) Repetitive Behaviour.

The items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 'not true' to 'very true'. The PSQ is composed of five domains: (1) parent-child relationship problems, (2) parenting problems, (3) depressive mood, (4) parental role restriction and (5) physical health problems. The instrument has good reliability and validity. 57 58 Parental functioning (T1 and T2) The subscales anxiety and depression of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) 59 60 will be administered to gain insight into the functioning of parents at T1 and T2.

Due to their socialemotional difficulties, this could lead to increased tensions, which in turn may result in difficulties in behavioural regulations as well as emotional stress in children and adolescents with ASD. 18 19 In addition, many individuals with ASD, children in particular, rely on clear structures and routines in order to function well on a day-to-day basis and minimise externalising behaviour. 67 68 These structures and routines are rarely subject to change under normal conditions. However, the COVID-19 pandemic measures often included lockdowns, with school and day-care closings, limited social gatherings and most of cultural, sporting or religious events cancelled. When schools and healthcare facilities reopen after lockdown, this often involves significant changes as well (eg, different entrance and exit routes, online consultations, mandatory face masks) rather than going back to business as usual, with a second wave of structure and routine disruptions as a result. In addition, there is variation in terms of how strict individuals adhere to the governmentally imposed rules and regulations, 69 which can also lead to frustration and stress particularly for individuals with ASD. Lastly, as many individuals with ASD present with comorbid problems, particularly anxiety, depression, and externalising behaviours, in varying rates, 9 10 extra concerns may arise with the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures. Simultaneously, some individuals with ASD may thrive due to decreased typical stressors. 32 The current study attempts to identify the impact of the public health measures on children with ASD and their families, both positive and negative, the relevant protective and risk factors, and the care and informational needs of this population during these challenging times in a mixedmethod design.",

First, baseline measurements may vary within limits between the different institutions and participants. As an inclusion criterion is pre-COVID-19 (March 2019-March 2020) availability of the CBCL and/or the SRS-2 (see measures for details) some participants may only have 1 of the measures. However, as this is an inclusion criterion there will be sufficient data to compare pre-COVID-19 functioning to during COVID-19 functioning. Second, possible loss of follow-up data at T2. Given that T0 and T1 have already taken place, there will be at least the possibility of investigating T0 to T1 functioning. In addition, our team has extensive experience with long-term follow-up studies and will exert all efforts to minimise loss of follow-up data, such as the graded compensation. That said, there are also several noteworthy strengths to mention. First, having pre-COVID-19 data which can be compared with during COVID-19 data, we can more objectively determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the functioning of children with ASD and their families. Second, the mixedmethod design allows for a comprehensive understanding as well as unique insight into the functioning of families with children with ASD during extremely challenging times. Third, a wide range of constructs is being assessed which allows for a comprehensive overview of functioning during the pandemic.",
