Among 3,762 individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, fatigue, breathlessness and cognitive dysfunction were the most debilitating symptoms beyond 35 weeks 8 . In the UK's largest Long COVID clinic, non-hospitalised patients required specialist referral at similar rates to hospitalised patients and were more likely to report breathlessness and fatigue, with reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 8 . A US study in 270,000 individuals post-COVID-19 showed one-third had persistent symptoms at 3-6 months (more common than post-influenza symptoms), possibly due to direct organspecific rather than general viral effects, and potentially informing development of effective treatments 9 .",

Our preliminary MRI data in 201 individuals showed mild organ impairment in the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and spleen, with single and multi-organ impairment in 70% and 29%, respectively, 4 months after COVID-19. Clinical utility of these MR metrics for chronic and multi-system conditions has been shown [11] [12] .

Each report included 49 organ-specific metrics with reference ranges to determine impairment (updated from our prior study 16 ) after determining distribution of each metric in healthy controls matched for age and sex (n=92) and for organ volumes from healthy controls representing complete sex and height subgroups (N=1835) in this study and UK Biobank 17 (Table S1a and b).

            "text": "To date, this is the largest, comprehensive, systematic, multi-organ, post-COVID study over 1 year. The study cohort is representative of UK Long COVID populations in terms of risk factors and acute COVID-19 hospitalisation 8, 9 . There are limitations. We did not have history and imaging prior to the pandemic and so it is difficult to determine if COVID-19/Long Covid caused impairment. There was no assessment of brain function. Not all participants had a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. 38% of participants were not followed up. Generalizability of results from the UK's first COVID-wave to the global population requires further exploration. We successfully delivered multi-organ MRI to assess organ health, but clinical utility remains to be determined. Health utilisation (e.g. primary care interactions) and economic burden of Long COVID were not assessed. Time off work was not assessed at baseline when the UK was in lockdown with a national furlough scheme in operation. Patients with normal assessment at baseline were not followed up due to resource and funding constraints. Therefore, whilst 222/536 (41%) patients at baseline were defined as normal after assessment, we cannot say they had better outcomes. Nevertheless, we can model cost-saving of a single assessment versus multiple assessments to achieve a discharge decision.",
