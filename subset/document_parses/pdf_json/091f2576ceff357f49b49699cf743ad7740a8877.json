            "text": "The seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low indoor relative humidity, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal lining of the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, in which supersaturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air. This elevated humidity promotes mucociliary clearance of pathogens from the lungs, both before and after an infection of the upper respiratory tract has occurred. Effective mucociliary clearance can delay and reduce infection of the lower respiratory tract, thus mitigating disease severity. This mode of action suggests that masks can benefit the wearer even after an infection in the upper respiratory tract has occurred, complementing the traditional function of masks to limit person-to-person disease transmission. This potential therapeutical use should be studied further.",

The common cold encompasses more than 200 different viruses (1), including a large family of rhinoviruses but also members of the coronavirus family, including 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, that are usually associated with mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illness. As suggested by their ''common cold'' name, these diseases have a seasonal character, and most become more widespread with colder outside temperature. Person-to-person transmission of respiratory viruses is dominated by respiratory droplets generated by the infected person, which include breath, speech, cough, and sneeze droplets (2) . The types of droplets that dominate the transmission path depend on the virus and on the location of the respiratory tract infection (2) .",

            "text": "The seasonality of COVID-19 (3) is now increasingly accepted as an important factor in the rapid escalation of this disease in the northern hemisphere with the onset of the 2020 fall and the approaching winter (4) . This pattern follows the same trend reported for the OC43 and 229E members of the coronavirus family by Kim et al., who noted that infections ''sharply increased during the low temperature winter months of October through February'' (4, 5) . Many factors may contribute to this seasonality. These include the following: more time spent indoors (3) (4) (5) , where respiratory-virus-containing aerosols remain airborne for many minutes (6) (7) (8) ; decreased exposure to sunlight, resulting in lower levels of vitamin D, which is essential to the immune system (9) ; lower ultraviolet levels that efficiently inactivate larger coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19; and prolonged viability of the virus at lower temperature and lower humidity (10) (11) (12) . Importantly, outdoor temperature is positively correlated with indoor relative humidity, which can reach low levels during the colder winter months. Because low humidity results in faster dehydration of respiratory droplets, a larger fraction of droplets fully dehydrate before landing on the ground (13) . Hence, the fraction that remains as aerosol, and thereby the potential for transmission, increases. All of these factors likely play some role in the seasonality of respiratory viruses and can be considered ''external factors,'' impacting the life cycle of the virus outside of the human host.",

Iwasaki and co-workers demonstrated in mice that low humidity increases disease severity after a respiratory challenge with the influenza A virus (14) . This effect was attenuated in caspase-1/11-deficient Mx1 mice and was linked to diminished interferon-stimulated gene expression in response to the viral infection, thereby impairing the innate antiviral defense. Dehydration of the airways upon inspiration of low absolute humidity air results in respiratory water loss that makes the surface layer hyperosmolar. This elevated osmolarity causes extraction of water from the underlying epithelial cells, which decreases their volume and causes the airways to shrink, an effect exacerbated in exerciseinduced asthma (15) . Dehydration of the airways is also known to result in decreased mucociliary clearance of pathogens from the lungs (16, 17) .",

The mask absorbs much of the water in exhaled breath that becomes supersaturated upon cooling when exiting the mouth; upon subsequent inspiration of dry air, this water evaporates and thereby humidifies the air that passes through this hydrated mask. We measured the magnitude of the effect at temperatures ranging from 8 to 37 C and for different types of mask material. Whereas all masks tested result in substantial humidification, the effect is strongest for high-density cotton masks, for which the high heat capacity of such masks aids in heating and humidifying the inspired air, resulting in effective increases above the environmental humidity that can exceed 100%. Hence, such masks act as rudimentary equivalents to the more effective heatexchanger masks introduced decades ago to mitigate coldinduced asthma (28, 29) .",

The side walls of the chamber were factory-powder coated. The rear wall, originally bare steel, was oil-base painted for minimal moisture adherence. The high thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the box reduced temperature increases upon expiration of warm breath into the chamber to less than 0.6 C. The acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene front panel contains a sealable opening, shaped to accommodate the chin, mouth, and nose of the breathing volunteer, with the edges of the opening lined with high-density foam rubber to make a tight seal with the facial skin. The front panel also contains a second, sealable, 10 cm diameter hole for refreshing the contents of the box with environmental air by using a high-capacity (300 L/min) fan mounted in front of this opening between measurements, with the breathing opening serving as the air exhaust channel. Sensors to record temperature, humidity, and CO 2 levels were mounted close to the geometric center of the box. A 10-cm fan (flow rate 100 L/min), positioned at the bottom of the box and pointed upward at a 45 angle, served to keep the contents of the box homogeneous and to maximize airflow over the three types of sensors. The response to a step change in humidity was found to depend on temperature (Fig. S2) , defined by exponential time constants of 15, 5, and 2.8 s at 8, 22 , and 37 C, respectively. At the top rear end of the box, an inflatable polyethylene bag was mounted to accommodate the changes in total gas volume at ambient pressure upon breathing. This bag also served as a visual gauge to control the volume of the exhaled air. The average breath volume was measured by placing a New Diagnostic Design EasyOne Air spirometer (Andover, MA) in line with the polyethylene bag during a representative measurement.",

However, it became clear that considerably more expiration/inspiration breathing cycles were needed with a mask than without a mask to achieve the same RH increase. This observation indicated that the mask absorbs water from the exhaled breath, which, under steady-state conditions, must be released upon inspiration, thereby effectively increasing the humidity of inhaled air.

At room temperature, the smallest increase in apparent RH of inspired air over the average RH of the chamber by $38% was observed for the surgical mask. Under the same conditions, both the N95 mask and the polyester-cotton mask increased the humidity of inspired air by 55-60% (Fig. 2) . Surprisingly, measurements with the heavy cotton mask resulted in a strong further decrease of chamber humidification, meaning a considerably larger fraction of exhaled water being temporarily stored in the fabric mask. During the 96-s measurement, the apparent RH increase over the average RH ($30%) in the chamber was $90%. At first sight, this apparent increase of inspired air humidity to above 100% may defy intuition. However, the explanation is grounded in simple physics. The exhalation of breath warms up the mask (and the water stored in it) to well above the environmental temperature. Indeed, with the air temperature at 8 C, rapidly removing the mask after exhalation during tidal breathing and folding it double while clamping a thermocouple sensor near its centerfold, followed by rolling up the doubled mask, consistently yielded temperature readings of 30 5 1 C. The same measurement after inspiration yielded 27 5 1 C. Presumably, this 30 5 1 C temperature represents a lower limit for the actual temperature at the face side of the mask at the start of inspiration, allowing the humidity of inspired air to reach values that are well above 100% at 8 C. Even if only 20% of the mask surface were involved in the actual passage of air, this fraction of the mask corresponds to $4 g of cotton with a total heat capacity of 20 J/K, considerably higher than the heat capacity of $1.2 J/K for 1 L of inspired air. Hence, the high heat capacity of the mask causes it to function like a rudimentary heat and humidity exchanger, warming and humidifying the inspired air to values much closer to those in the lower respiratory tract than of room air.",

It is important to note, however, that these very large RH increases at 8 C (150-300%) correspond to less dramatic increases in absolute humidity of 12-24 mg/L. Once heated inside the respiratory tract, this corresponds to changes in relative humidity at 36 C of 29-58%. By contrast, even though the RH changes of inspired air are much smaller for the measurements at 37 C, this increase directly translates into the relative humidity change of air inspired into the lungs. As a consequence, from the perspective of respiratory tract dehydration, the effect of each mask type is fairly constant across the entire 8-37 C range. At all temperatures, the humidification resulting from the heavy cotton mask is about double that of a surgical mask, with the N95 and cotton-polyester cloth masks falling in between.",

            "text": "Over the past year, it has become abundantly clear that facemasks offer an effective tool for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Remarkably, mask usage conferred not only a protective effect in terms of disease transmission but also a striking decrease in disease severity, the latter effect attributed to the infected person receiving a lower dose of the disease-causing virus (25) . The effect of masks was so pronounced that the authors even raised the possibility of ''variolation,'' i.e., the inoculation of an uninfected person with a minute amount of live virus, a procedure introduced into the Western world about three centuries ago to fight smallpox (Variola) before the availability of a vaccine (26) . Although, after the successful development of multiple effective COVID-19 vaccines, the idea of variolation is no longer relevant and was strongly criticized by experts (27) , we also note that it should not apply to airborne viral respiratory diseases in the first place. As shown by Haas et al. (38) , the dose-response curve for SARS infection follows the exponential model, also known as the Single-Hit-Model (SHM) (39) or Independent Action Hypothesis (IAH) (40) , meaning that the risk of infection initially increases linearly with exposure. This model also proved appropriate in the classic analysis of a measles outbreak (8) . Even though any single inhaled virion is unlikely to enter a susceptible host cell and create progeny, the probability of such an infection occurring is nonzero and increases linearly with the number of virions inhaled. This is analogous to purchasing lottery tickets; the odds of a winning single ticket are small but increase linearly with the number of tickets. With virions randomly dispersed in the oral or mucosal fluid that exits the mouth of an infected person in the form of highly hydrated (>95%) microscopic droplets, the vast majority of these droplets are so small that statistically they are unlikely to contain more than one infectious virion (7) . In contrast to smallpox variolation, in which the virus was applied to a small scratch on the skin, inhaled airborne SARS-CoV-2 virions will be distributed randomly across the epithelial surface of the respiratory tract. This makes any requirement for overload of the innate immune system, a concept that applies locally, highly unlikely.",

It is well recognized that only particles smaller than a few microns can enter the small airways and cause infection of the lungs, commonly associated with increased disease severity relative to infection of the upper respiratory tract (2, 41, 42) . However, cloth masks are relatively poor at filtering out these smallest particles. So, even though cloth masks are expected to lower the incidence of infection, their protective effect to the wearer will be less for the smallest particles, which are associated with more severe disease, opposite to observation. An alternate explanation for the Increase in apparent relative humidity of inspired air, DRH app , during pseudotidal breathing for four different masks. DRH app is derived from the increase in absolute humidity of air inspired through the mask, assuming the temperature of inhaled air is that of the room in which the measurements were carried out, and does not account for the increase, DT, in temperature of the gas when traversing the mask, which is particularly large for the heavy cotton mask (DT $22 5 2 C at 8 C; 8 5 1 C at 22 C; 0 C at 37 C) and enables >100% RH increases over that of the room air.

In contrast to the primary function of masks of preventing virus from entering the respiratory tract of another person (43, 44) , this additional benefit applies after a virus-containing particle lands on the surface of the respiratory tract; reduced dehydration limits impairment of the innate immune system (14) while improving mucociliary clearance (16, 17) , with both these factors reducing infection probability. If an infection does occur, humidification may limit its further spread through the lungs by lowering the generation of virus-containing breath droplets that could lead to self-inoculation elsewhere in the lungs (18, 19) . At the same time, effective mucociliary clearance and an unimpaired innate immune system of the well-humidified respiratory tract also may limit viral spreading, allowing more time for mobilization of the adaptive immune system. The effect of humidity on respiratory viral disease is increasingly recognized, as exemplified by the recent proposal to use elevated humidity as a nonpharmaceutical intervention for influenza A (45) .",

The surgical and polyester-cotton blend masks, which also will be subject to leakage, then are expected to perform somewhat lower than the N95 and all-cotton masks.
