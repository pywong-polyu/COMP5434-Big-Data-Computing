            "text": "In the COVID-19 scenario, patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have an increased risk of death. Through a national multicenter study, we aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on the survival of HSCT recipients in Brazil. Eighty-six patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (92% by RT-PCR) were included. There were 24 children and 62 adults receiving an autologous (n = 25) and allogeneic (n = 61) HSCT for malignant (n = 72) and non-malignant (n = 14) disorders. Twenty-six patients died, (10 on autologous (38%) and 16 patients (62%) on allogeneic group). The estimated overall survival (OS) at day 40 was 69%. Adults had decreased OS compared to children (66% vs 79%, p = 0.03). The severity of symptoms at the time of diagnosis, ECOG score, laboratory tests (C-reactive protein, urea values) were higher in patients who died (p < 0.05). In conclusion, HSCT recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a high mortality rate mainly in adults and patients with critical initial COVID-19 presentation. These findings show the fragility of HSCT recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the importance of adherence to preventive measures is evident, in addition to prioritizing the vaccination of family members and the HSCT team.",

Moreover, in the allogeneic HSCT setting, the occurrence of viral infection is even higher due to immunosuppressive therapy, graftversus-host disease (GVHD) and its treatment. Due to the risk involved with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the HSCT scenario, a collaborative effort by Bone Marrow Transplant Societies has prepared guidelines to assist the clinical call decision to protect recipients and donors in this pandemic scenario. Recommended measures include postponing non-urgent transplants, especially in the setting of non-malignant diseases, performing real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction exams (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 before transplantation to the recipient and donor, cryopreserving the stem cell product before starting the conditioning regimen or having an alternative donor as backup, in addition to strict adherence to infection control protocols during HSCT hospitalization [9] [10] [11] .",

This picture is potentially aggravated by the use of immunosuppressive therapy and other complications, such as GVHD and transplantation-related morbidities. Community-acquired viral respiratory infections can affect at least 50% of transplanted patients, with varied outcomes [16] . Historically, the Coronavirus family (with regard to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) has not been associated with more severe disease in severely immunosuppressed populations (transplants, chemotherapy or immunosuppressants).

These results are very similar to those previously described by Felsenstein et al., where children were also more frequently asymptomatic. According to them, one of the possible explanations for mild presentation in childhood may be the frequent contact to seasonal coronaviruses, as a result, the presence of antibodies with crossreactivity and co-elimination with other viral infections. The authors also hypothesized that vaccinations and associated heterologous immune responses, and a more diverse memory T cell may provide advantages over the elderly population [18] .",

Considering the type of HSCT, we observed an OS of 72.9% among patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation and 60% in the autologous transplantation group. The outcome in autologous HSCT recipients was slightly inferior to what was previously described in the study conducted by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), where~500 transplant patients in 22 countries were included. At 6 weeks, mortality rate was 19% and 24% in autologous and allogeneic HSCT, respectively [9] . Likewise, in a study by Akshay Sharma et al., with 318 patients, from the for allogeneic and 67% for autologous. The latter study also showed an association between the diagnosis of COVID-19 and mortality in the following 12 months in allogeneic HSCT recipients [12] . We did not observe any significant association between mortality and time of occurrence of COVID-19 after HSCT during a follow-up of 7 months. In our study, we were not able to individualize differences to explain this finding, however, it is worth emphasizing that mean age tended to be higher in patients in the autologous group and possibly associated with other comorbidities, although no statistical difference was found. In this study, we also did not explore differences in measures of protection or care between the evaluated groups. According to data provided by the Ministry of Health, on June 30, 2021, Brazil accumulated the number of deaths related to COVID-19 above 515,900 and a fatality rate of 2.8% [19] . Although Brazil has a Unified Health System (SUS) that guarantees assistance to all, the rapid and progressive increase in cases of COVID-19, especially in low-income populations, put a lot of pressure on hospital care, leading to the saturation of hospital and ICU beds, which certainly impacted final outcomes. Such premise was reinforced by the results obtained by Baqui et al., were 11, 321 Brazilian patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospitals with severe acute conditions were analyzed. Higher mortality rates were observed in the northern region of the country in comparison to the central-south region (65% vs 41%), the so-called \"regional effect\". The authors also demonstrated that comorbidities were more common in Brazilians admitted to hospitals in the northern region. The study theorizes that the regional effect is driven by an increase in the burden of comorbidities in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development and that the ethnic effect is possibly related to differences in the susceptibility of COVID-19 and access to health care [20] .",

Thus, our group of patients is heterogeneous including children and adults, allogeneic and autologous HSCT for malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Second, since patients' follow-up was short, it was not possible to assess long-term consequences of COVID-19 in these patients. Finally, although some laboratory results may indicate a worse prognosis, biomarkers could not be robustly evaluated due to the lack of data. Despite this, it is a representative sample of post-transplant patients treated in 21 centers in our country and the largest series of cases published so far in a middle-income country.",

Despite advances in the understanding of pathophysiology and therapeutic measures, prevention remains the main measure to minimize its impact and should be strongly recommended [23] . Understanding the delayed sequelae in surviving patients, the impact of new mutations and worldwide mass vaccination on the persistence of circulating SARS-COV-2, and the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines in HSCT recipients will be the challenges for years to come. In summary, this is the first multicenter retrospective study that evaluated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on survival of HSCT recipients in Latin America. Long-term outcomes should be evaluated in the future, such as the impact of COVID-19 sequelae and the influence of infections on the quality of life of these patients.",
