            "text": "Is transfer spending effective at reducing inequality? Economists in the public choice tradition historically regard with suspicion attempts to rely on government to redistribute income or wealth. In particular, public choice theory argues that governmental attempts at redistribution likely are to be in service of special interest groups, rather than promoting the general welfare by adopting targeted reductions in poverty or inequality. Tullock (1983a, pp. 173-178) argues that \"[A] great many programs purport to be aimed at helping the poor, but actually are aimed at helping someone else-someone who is politically more influential\u2026. [B] asically, the modern redistributive state transfers money back and forth within the middle class on the basis of the power of political organization and public misinformation.\" Despite such justified suspicion, governments around the world are successful at achieving significant reductions in inequality through tax and transfer systems. Figure 1 plots Gini coefficients for market income (pre-tax and transfer) and disposable income (post-tax and transfer) for 25 OECD countries: every single observation lies below the 45-degree line, suggesting that at least some redistribution does more than \"move money back and forth between the middle class\".",

            "text": "The question for the public choice theorist thus becomes, how much of the current pattern of income redistribution is effective-insofar as it reduces poverty or inequality in a targeted fashion in line with its purported justification-and how much represents benefits granted to special interest groups? To answer that question I propose two alternative versions of a \"Tullock index\" for assessing the effectiveness of redistribution. In the spirit of Atkinson's (1970) inequality index, 1 the Tullock index is constructed with reference to either (A) the maximum inequality reduction attainable with current transfer spending, or (B) the minimum transfer spending necessary to achieve current post-transfer inequality. Deviations from either of those ideals represent ineffectiveness in the transfer system, insofar as its purported justification is an egalitarian one. Using Current Population Survey (CPS) microdata from 1988 to 2014, I construct annual estimates of the Tullock Index at the national level for the United States. Over that period, the Tullock Index is increasing, suggesting that redistribution has become less effective at reducing inequality. At the state level, results from simple panel fixed-effects models suggest that-for a given level of transfer spending-ineffective redistribution (as measured by the Tullock index) is Atkinson (1970) Index is constructed with reference to the concept of equally distributed equivalent income, y ede . For a given social welfare function y ede measures the level of income per-head which-if equally distributed-would give the same level of social welfare as the present distribution. Denoting as the mean of the actual income distribution, the Atkinson (1970) index may be written: I = 1 \u2212 y ede . I expresses the share of total income that is \"wasted\" with respect to the attainment of a given level of social welfare. For a value of I = 0.3 the same level of social welfare could be attained with 30% less income, provided it were equally distributed. The two versions of the Tullock Index constructed in this paper are interpreted in a similar fashion (the % of either current transfers or inequality that are \"wasted\"). associated with a higher poverty rate, a lower employment-population ratio, and reduced total employment. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews some of the myriad reasons for redistribution offered in the literature and compares them to the political economy theory of equilibrium redistribution offered by Tullock (1981) . Section 3 introduces the data, discusses the construction of the Tullock index, and examines trends at the national level. Section 4 presents results from state-level panel data models. Section 5 concludes.",

            "text": "Economic justifications for redistribution are rooted in one of several alternative (although not mutually exclusive) rationales: (1) other-regarding preferences and neighborhood effects (Friedman, 1962; Hochman & Rogers, 1969; Tullock, 1983a) , (2) externalities in production (Marglin 1963; Thompson, 1974; Hendrickson et al., 2018; Petach & Tavani, 2019) , and (3) constitutional considerations (Buchanan, 1976; Buchanan & Tullock, 1962; Wessels, 1993) . 2 Beginning with Hochman and Rogers (1969) , several scholars contend that \"Pareto optimal redistribution\" is consistent with other-regarding preferences. If agent j's income enters as a positive argument into agent i's utility function, it is straightforward to show that some level of redistribution will be Pareto optimal, provided that the utility function is concave and inequality in earnings is sufficient. Similarly, Friedman (1962) points out that if agents obtain positive utility from charitable giving, such giving will be underprovided by the market mechanism. Intuitively, an isolated individual i makes monetary gifts, g, until the marginal benefit of giving equals the marginal cost (assumed to be one dollar): MB i (g) = 1 . With decisions taken collectively, the individual will give until the marginal benefit of giving equals his or her cost share, 1 > i > 0 \u2236 MB i (g) = . Summing across all individuals: \u2211 i MB i (g) = 1 . Comparison of the collective solution with the individual solution reveals charitable giving as a special case of Samuelson's (1954) conditions for optimal public goods provision. Charitable giving also has the property of being \"superoptimal\" in that a gift increases the utility of both the donor and the recipient. Even if preferences are purely self-regarding, some redistributive taxation may be optimal if production generates externalities. Thompson (1974) and Hendrickson et al. (2018) argue that if wealth accumulation imposes costs on the public-e.g., in the form of required outlays on national defense-some optimal interior level of capital or wealth taxation exists. Similarly, in a series of studies, Tavani (2019, 2022) 3 show that if production is characterized by strategic complementarities, an optimal tax and transfer scheme exists that both reduces inequality and increases the level of economic activity relative to their equilibrium values. Even when preferences are purely self-regarding and no externalities in production are present-such that \"political redistribution\" of the sort mentioned above is sub-optimalredistribution may be justified from a constitutional perspective. Buchanan (1985) emphasizes such redistribution as distinct in its contractarian character. Buchanan's (1985, p. 248 ) key insight regarding constitutional redistribution is that changes in the \"rules of the game\" that govern market interactions may result in different end-state patterns of distributiondespite not targeting those end-states directly-thereby \"embodying interpersonal transfers that might be loosely described as redistibutional.\" Buchanan and Tullock's (1962) discussion of the perceived insurance value of redistribution behind the Rawlsian veil of ignorance provides one example of the possibility of constitutional justifications for redistributive policy.",

            "text": "In contrast to attempts to rationalize redistribution, public choice theory concerns itself with analyzing the self-interested motives for redistribution and how those motives interact with the political process to produce an equilibrium set of redistributive policies. Tullock (1983b, p. 28 ) asserts the three primary motivations for redistribution are \"the desire to receive transfers, charity, and envy\", emphasizing \"the desire to receive transfers\" as primary. While Tullock acknowledges that charitable sentiment plays some role in determining the equilibrium level of redistribution, he rejects the notion that egalitarian motives can explain all, or even most, of the income redistribution observed in reality. In particular, Tullock (1981 Tullock ( , 1986 argues that egalitarian justifications for redistribution are inconsistent with the paltry sums transferred from the United States and other advanced economies to the developing world: \"[S]tandard explanations for egalitarian behavior do not fit the real world. Those Americans who are receiving grants of various sorts from the American government on the grounds that they are poor are uniformly higher in income than the world average\" (Tullock, 1986, p. 47) . If redistribution truly were explained by egalitarian motives, then \"American citizens' income should be reduced by an immense degree\" (Tullock, 1981, p. 282 ). That such is not the case suggests that \"[W]e should recognize that our motives in objecting to this are simply selfish. We want to keep our living standards up and we are willing to let people die in southern India to that end\" (ibid., p. 280).",

They go to people who for one reason or another are politically well organized\" (Tullock, 1986, pp. 57-59) . Tullock (1981, pp. 288-289) provides a laundry list of examples of policies that redistribute income ineffectively: \"The farm program, high wages of civil servants \u2026 the development of human capital at a subsidized rate for people whose natural talent is such that they would already have a higher income than average even without this capital, the price controls which have the purpose of transferring large amounts of wealth from American owners of oil wells to Arab Sheiks and American consumers are all examples.\" The logic behind how the desire to receive transfers interacts with the political process to produce an ineffective set of equilibrium transfers is illustrated in Tullock's (1959) analysis of the problem of funding access roads in a simple majority voting system. Tullock (1959, p. 573 ) considers a case of \"a township inhabited by one hundred farmers who have more or less similar farms is cut by a number of main roads maintained by the state.\" The township builds and maintains the local roads that connect to the main highway(s); outlays on local road maintenance are decided by majority rule voting with logrolling. Should each farmer follow a purely self-interested voting plan, Tullock (1959, p. 575) argues that. the outcome is clear. Each farmer would enter into bilateral agreements with enough farmers on other roads to insure that his own was repaired. He would then be forced to count as part of the cost of getting his road repaired the cost (to him) of repairing the roads of the other 50 farmers. These bilateral agreements, however, would overlap. Farmer A (more precisely the farmers on road A) would bargain with Farmers B, ..., M. Farmer M, on the other hand, might make up his majority from Farmer A and Farmers N, ..., Z.",

A hypothetical value of Tullock B = 0.1 would suggest that the current level of inequality could be attained with 10% less transfer spending. To illustrate the magnitude of the difference Before examining trends in each version of the Tullock index over time, a few caveats are in order. First, it is likely that the data analyzed here understate the true amount of transfers. Because the income concepts in the IPUMS CPS focus on pre-tax income, the versions of the Tullock index I've constructed miss any redistribution that happens through the tax system. From the perspective of a critic of redistribution like Tullock, that omission is unfortunate: many tax credits and deductions are precisely the kinds of movement of money back and forth between the middle class that Tullock derided. 6 Similarly, the values calculated here leave out some important transfers-in-kind, such as the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). The data also omit the values of implicit transfers that occur through other public policies such as import tariffs. Second, because I restrict the sample to individuals 18 and older, some transfers to children will be missed. Finally, even though lump-sum transfers are efficient from a welfare perspective-i.e., when compared to other tax-and-transfer arrangements-lump-sum transfers may nonetheless generate negative income effects (assuming that leisure is a normal good), resulting in the dissipation of a portion of the \"rents\" received through the transfer program. Lump-sum transfers themselves may therefore be \"wasteful\", despite not altering household incentives on the margin. That observation suggests that an additional possible interpretation of the Tullock index is as a comparison of one really \"wasteful\" transfer system (e.g., proportional or progressive subsidies) with a less \"wasteful\" transfer system (lump-sum payments).",

Both versions of the index should therefore be interpreted as lower bounds on the amount of ineffective transfer payments. The results in Fig. 4 suggest that Tullock's concerns about the ineffectiveness of equilibrium redistribution are warranted. From the perspective of someone who accepts the egalitarian assumption, a significant fraction of current transfers appear to be ineffective. That conclusion is true even if one believes that the government has an obligation to adopt transfer programs to reduce inequality. As such, important policy questions arise concerning the institutional environment that gives rise to ineffective transfers, as well as the consequences of ineffective transfers for outcomes related to household welfare, including poverty and employment. To examine those questions in further detail, I turn to the construction of the Tullock index at the state-level. ",

The results are suggestive: independent of any additional controls, both versions of the Tullock index are positively correlated with poverty rates and negatively correlated with the employment-topopulation ratio. To investigate the impact of redistributional ineffectiveness on state-level outcomes in further detail, I estimate the following panel fixed-effects model: where Y it is the state-level outcome of interest-either poverty, the level of employment, or the employment-population ratio, Tullock it is the Tullock index, X it is a vector of statelevel controls, t is a year-fixed effect, i is a state-fixed effect, and it is an idiosyncratic error term. The results from estimating Eq. 3 should be interpreted with caution. Although state-fixed effects will address any time-invariant state-specific unobserved heterogeneity and year-fixed effects will capture any timewise-common shocks faced by all states, unobserved state-level factors nevertheless may influence the relationship between the Tullock index and economic activity that preclude a causal interpretation of the results. In this sense, estimates of 1 obtained from Eq. 3 are pure correlations. However, with that caveat in mind, it is worth emphasizing that the correlations observed will nonetheless be informative, given what theory says about the expected relationship between ineffective redistribution and economic activity (i.e., the impact of ineffective redistribution on economic activity should be negative).",

At the mean level of Tullock A , the poverty rate is 1.4 percentage points higher than it otherwise would be-given the current level of transfers-were there no ineffective transfers. A similar effect is implied by the regression coefficient on Tullock B . That the impact of the Tullock index remains negative after entering per-capita transfers as a control also is suggestive. The result indicates that the index is not merely picking up the presence of larger transfers, but rather that redistributional ineffectiveness exerts a negative impact on economic activity, holding the level of transfers constant. Table 3 presents results from estimating Eq. 3 using either the employment-population ratio or the natural log of employment as the dependent variable. The empirical results again suggest that ineffective transfers reduce economic activity. Both the employment-population ratio and the level of employment are declining in Tullock A and Tullock B . Furthermore, in the case of the employment-population ratio, the per-capita amount of transfers has a negative effect, consistent with an undesirable incentive effect.

The drop in the estimated size of the regression coefficients between Columns (1)-(3) and Columns (4)-(6) hints that the observed dis-employment effect may be driven by the transfer programs themselves, rather than ineffectiveness in the transfer system. In Column (6), the coefficient on Tullock A implies that redistributional ineffectiveness is responsible for a reduction in the employment-population ratio of about 0.5 percentage points at the mean (while the coefficient on Tullock B is statistically insignificant). The effects on the level of employment are somewhat larger, with Column (6) suggesting a unit increase in Tullock A reduces the level of employment by approximately 0.28% (the size of the for Tullock B is roughly similar). In contrast, the naive point estimates indicate that transfers reduce the employment-population ratio up to 14 percentage points at the mean, a comparatively large effect. 10",

Each version of the index adopts the egalitarian assumption: that the goal of redistribution is to achieve the largest possible reduction in inequality at the least cost. Version A of the Tullock index measures deviations from the egalitarian assumption by calculating the maximum possible inequality reduction attainable with current levels of transfer spending under a lump-sum transfer policy. Version B of the Tullock index measures deviations from the egalitarian assumption by calculating the minimum per-capita lump-sum transfer necessary to achieve the current level of post-transfer inequality. Both versions of the index suggest that redistribution has become less effective over the sample period. In particular, Version B of the Tullock Index suggests that by 2014, approximately 30% of transfers are \"wasted\" with respect to the attainment of the current level of post-transfer inequality. State-level panel fixed-effects estimates show that redistributional ineffectivenessas measured by the Tullock index-is related to higher state-level poverty rates, lower employment-to-population ratios, and lower levels of overall employment. These findings have important implications for contemporary efforts at income redistribution, including policies adopted as part of the US government response to the Covid-19 pandemic. To take one example, the findings in this paper suggest that-given the observed decline in the effectiveness of redistribution over time-it should come as no surprise that Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans appear to have been largely targeted at high income communities (Schweitzer & Borawski, 2021) .",

A common approach of fiscally conscious policymakers is to advocate for more means-testing in government transfer programs. While the present paper is agnostic about the overall impact of such efforts, it is worth noting that a large empirical literature finds the introduction of means testing to be associated with various perverse disincentives (from work disincentives to savings disincentives) owing to high marginal tax rates in the program phase-out region (Autor & Duggan, 2007; Fetter & Lockwood, 2018; Gray et al., 2021; Powers, 1998) . Furthermore, the results in Table 2 suggest that-despite the presence of ineffective transfers-transfers do have a negative and significant effect on poverty. Thus, in the absence of a specific policy recommendation, policymakers should exercise caution to ensure that the \"cure\" for ineffective redistributionist policy is not worse than the disease.",

In that case, transfers that violate the egalitarian assumption (by moving money back and forth between the middle class through programs like social security or education subsidies) may nonetheless represent an effective use of the transfer system. If such preferences are assumed, the Tullock index will overstate the extent to which the transfer system is ineffective at achieving its objective.",

First, it is possible that-following Brennan and Buchanan's (1980) characterization of government as Leviathan-a large tax-and-transfer system may function as a means of maintaining government power through patronage jobs. Alternatively, if Tullock is correct, the median voter may simply desire transfers for herself, regardless of the impact of transfers on inequality. Farm subsidies, import tariffs, and auto company bailouts are all examples of transfers that essentially have nothing to do with alleviating inequality. Many of the most common income tax deductions also serve as examples of transfers that clearly are not intended to reduce inequality. Williams (2021) shows that nine of the largest tax deductions in the United States 11 transfer close to $650 billion a year up the income distribution. Furthermore, Williams (2021) shows that these transfers contribute substantially to racial wealth inequality: of the nearly $400 billion in annual federal spending on deductions for tax-exempt bonds, realized capital gains, pension wealth, and inherited wealth, close to 100% goes to white households. It is hard to see how such transfers satisfy either the egalitarian assumption or even very strong preferences for transfers-in-kind. Thus, even if the transfers measured in the CPS data examined in this paper are \"effective\" under the assumption of a preference for transfers-in-kind; many transfers will remain ineffective to the extent that they take the form of tax credits and deductions that are far less likely to be justifiable. The questionable nature of many such tax credits and deductions therefore points to the importance of extending the Tullock index to the tax side of the government budget in future work.",

The most recent iteration presents the distributions of household income, means-tested transfers, and federal taxes between 1979 and 2017. These data contain information on average income before transfers and average transfers received by income quintile, allowing Tullock A to be constructed following the process outlined in Sect. 3. Figure 7 plots the series for Tullock A generated from the CBO data against the series generated from the IPUMS CPS data. Although differences in levels arise (in particular, the CBO data result in somewhat inflated estimates of the Tullock index), both series display the same upward trend in redistributional ineffectiveness, suggesting that the trend is not simply an artifact of the IPUMS data.
