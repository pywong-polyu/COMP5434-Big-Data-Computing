Higher temperatures were shown to have a protective effect against transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 (7), possibly due to the decreased survival of the SARS-CoV on surfaces at higher temperatures (8) .

This is potentially a significant source of bias in existing studies, as imported infections are not related to weather conditions at the location at which they are detected. For example, 62.5% of COVID-19 cases in Australia (as of May 10th 2020) were acquired overseas (19) , and the proportion was even higher earlier in the pandemic. Secondly, most studies have not taken variation in capacity to detect emerging infections into account-this is particularly relevant for interpreting data on the spread of COVID-19 in the first few weeks of the pandemic. Finally, no studies have conducted a global analysis using COVID-19 data consistently aggregated at subnational level, which reflects limitations of current COVID-19 reporting.

There was a statistically significant effect of the average air temperature during the 3 preceding weeks on the COVID-19 case incidence in our study. However, the effect size was quite small, as shown by the pseudo R-squared estimates and changes in predicted values. The COVID-19 case incidence was negatively correlated with the air temperature for temperature above \u221215 \u2022 C. Notably, the effect of relative humidity was not statistically significant. This study provides evidence that there may be seasonal variability in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but this analysis does not imply that temperature alone is a primary driver of COVID-19 transmission. The observed association may not be due directly to temperature, but to correlated factors such as human behaviors during cold weather. Countries with higher early detection capacity had a higher reported case incidence. We suggest that this association is due to a detection bias, where countries with better disease detection capacity simply detect more cases. Current reports of the pandemic show that almost all countries across the globe have been affected by SARS-CoV-2, despite the large variance in their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks (29) . However, we expected the opposite association, where countries with higher early detection capacity would have lower cases due to their ability to implement control measures earlier. Surprisingly, the association of the time since the first case confirmation in the ADM1 with the outcome was negative. We believe this is linked to considerable underreporting of cases in the global data source used for this study. Manual assessment of the time series showed that as the time since the first case increased, the number of cases reported for each ADM1 did not follow the expected exponential pattern. We suggest that this is due to the overwhelming number of cases confirmed as the outbreak becomes more severe, resulting in limited availability of information on individual cases after the initial stages. The two issues discussed here are common in epidemiological analyses based on reported cases. These results complement those of several recently published studies investigating the weather effect published for China (14) (15) (16) , Brazil (30) , Spain (31), and at a global level (17, 18) . There are also many related studies not yet peer-reviewed and available as pre-prints. The published studies for China and Brazil as well as one of the global studies showed a negative association between the air temperature and COVID-19 case or mortality incidence, using different lag periods (14-16, 18, 30) . The two other studies did not find evidence of a relationship between COVID-19 cases and air temperature (17, 31) . Four studies showed a negative association between relative or absolute humidity and COVID-19 incidence (14, (16) (17) (18) while a fifth showed that an increase in relative humidity was associated with an increase in number of COVID-19 cases (15) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1343, "end": 1347, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2372, "end": 2376, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2377, "end": 2381, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2382, "end": 2386, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2396, "end": 2400, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2437, "end": 2441, "text": "(17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2442, "end": 2445, "text": "18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2743, "end": 2758, "text": "(14-16, 18, 30)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2866, "end": 2870, "text": "(17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2871, "end": 2874, "text": "31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2981, "end": 2985, "text": "(14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2986, "end": 2990, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2991, "end": 2995, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2996, "end": 3000, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3120, "end": 3124, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "There are several strengths to this analysis, which add to the evidence base for an association between weather variation and COVID-19.
