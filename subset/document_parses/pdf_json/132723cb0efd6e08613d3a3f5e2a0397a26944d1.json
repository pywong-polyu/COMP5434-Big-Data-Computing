Moreover, infectious diseases receive a lot of public attention as demonstrated by the recent coronavirus outbreak which has been reported intensely since January 2020. Infectious disease outbreaks may cause fear and panic among the public making it important to study these phenomena. Previous deadly outbreaks, such as the Black Death for instance, are known to have claimed the lives of between one-fourth and three-fourths of the world's population across Europe and Asia and, in Europe only, at least 25 million are estimated to have died from it [1] . The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a developing arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) which was first isolated from a monkey from the Zika forest in Uganda in the late 1940s [2] . Zika sufferers may exhibit mild symptoms and experience a slight fever or rash, and joint, muscle, or eye pain. Zika is transmitted from the bite of specific mosquito species carrying the infection. Zika can also be transmitted through sexual intercourse, and perinatal transmission has also been reported [3] . There is no cure or anti-viral treatment for the Zika virus infection, neither is there a vaccine. The Zika virus can spread from the womb to the child in pregnant women and leads to birth defects such as microcephaly [4] . Zika became a public concern in early 2016, when it first spread outside of Africa and Asia, where the virus had formerly been restricted. This geographical expansion led the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) [2] . However, unlike previous infectious disease outbreaks, there appeared to be low public knowledge of the Zika outbreak in the United States, leading to the dissemination of health information such as mosquitobite prevention notices and recommendations by public health authorities to avoid travelling to Zika-affected areas [4] . Moreover, misinformation on social media platforms has the potential to have adverse consequences if, for example, advice around prevention and transmission are inaccurate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 672, "end": 675, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 838, "end": 841, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1153, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1377, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1673, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2002, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "It is important to understand the types of content shared on Twitter because tweets are viewed widely across the Internet, and a substantive subset of the global human population use the platform on a daily basis [5, 6] .

Table 2 provides the results of the tweet categorization. Overall, tweets contained much more content from news articles shared on Zika than personal views. There were a number of varied discussions taking place around the Zika epidemic based on seven key discussions around pregnancy (164/8.36%), travel and the Olympics (120/6.12%), mosquitoes and conspiracy (259/13.21%), health organisations (365/18.62%), health information (160/8.16%), travel and tracking (246/12.55%), and general discussions around Zika (646/32.95%%). There was discussion surrounding pregnancy because of Zika's known association with microcephaly, which causes complications in children during birth (Mlakar, Korva, Tul, Popovi\u0107, et al., 2016). For women and couples in Zika-affected areas, it was recommended that pregnancy be avoided.
