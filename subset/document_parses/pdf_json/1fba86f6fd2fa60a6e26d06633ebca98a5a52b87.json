            "text": "Background: On March 9 th , 2020, the Italian government decided to go into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to changes in the workflow of radiological examinations. Aims: Aim of the study is to illustrate how the workload and outcome of radiological exams changed in a community hospital during the pandemic. Methods and Material: The exams performed in the radiology department from March 9 th to March 29 th , 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and compared to the exams conducted during the same timeperiod in 2019. Only exams coming from the emergency department (ED) were included. Two radiologists defined the cases as positive or negative findings, based on independent blind readings of the imaging studies. Categorical measurements are presented as frequency and percentages, and p-values are calculated using the Chi-squared test. Results and Conclusions: There was a significant reduction in the amount of exams performed in 2020: there were 143 (93|65% male, 60.7\u00b121.5 years) patients who underwent radiological examinations from the ED vs. 485 (255|53% male, 51.2\u00b124.8 years) in 2019. Furthermore, the total number of ED exams dropped from 699 (2019) to 215 (2020). However, the percentage of patients with a positive result was significantly higher in 2020 (69|48%) compared to 2019 (151|31%) (p<.001). The reduction of emergency radiological examinations might be a result of the movement restrictions enforced during the lockdown, and possible fear of the hospital as a contagious place. This translated to a relative increase of positive cases as only patients with very serious conditions were accessing the ED. (www.actabiomedica.it)",

Lazzerini et al. described a series of pediatric cases where parents reported avoiding accessing hospitals because of fear of infection [19] . The correlation between the pandemic and the fear of people to access medical services has already been reported during the SARS pandemic in 2003 [20] . This potentially explains the overall reduction in examinations observed during the lockdown. Another possible reason for this reduction can be found in a study conducted by Hanna et al [21] . In that study, the authors investigated and defined a class of patients called ED imaging \"superusers\". They found that 12% of ED patients consume 50% of all ED imaging services annually. The presence of this kind of patient might have been decreased in the COVID-19 period. The fear of people to access hospitals (thought of as contagious places) might not only explain the overall reduction in examinations, but we also hypothesize that the relative increase of positive cases during the lockdown period can be correlated with said fear: given the fear for potential infection, people seem to be waiting for more severe symptoms to occur before seeking hospital care, leading to only people with more serious conditions heading in, thus resulting in a relative increase of positive findings. This increase might also be related to the delay in health care access [19, 22, 23, 24] ; since hospitals were prioritizing COVID-19 cases, people had diminished access to immediate care, which might have resulted in more serious conditions being developed.",

In a study in a level one trauma center, Christey et al detected a significant reduction (43%) of the overall volume of all injury admissions during the level 4 lock down during COVID-19 pandemic [14] . The relative increase of thoracic clinical indications and findings might be due to the viral pneumonia, even if during the first three weeks of lockdown, only for eight patients the clinical indication was \"suspected COVID-19\". These patients had symptoms that could indicate a COVID-19 infection and they were required to wait in isolation for the results of the swab testing, which could take up to three days. While isolated, if necessary, a thoracic XR at the bed of the patient was performed [25, 26] ; from these patients, seven tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.",
