Standardised definitions are needed in the medical field to optimise research and clinical practice such that the impact of the profession on patient outcomes can be assessed and enhanced (Armstrong and Mouton, 2018) . In other words, to determine and evaluate best practice guidelines in medical affairs, we must first determine and agree upon the scope of practice. Definitions determine what is measured in research and may impact the validity of results (Patino and Ferreira, 2018) as well as the ability of researchers to interpret and replicate findings (Armstrong and Mouton, 2018) . As such, definitions guide both clinical practice and the research that informs it and are, therefore, needed to progress the utility of medical affairs within the pharmaceutical industry for the ultimate benefit of patients.",

While definitions have been proposed within empirical studies on related topics (Jain, 2017; Maeda, 2021) , and growing attention has been given to what changes have occurred in the role of medical affairs post-COVID-19 (Rajadhyaksha, 2020; Ghosh et al., 2021) , there is no consensus on what constitutes medical affairs and its boundaries of scope. Different understandings of medical specialties may affect how they are practiced and regulated as well as healthcare policy and how training is governed (Jamoulle et al., 2017) . Additionally, organisational studies of professional functions have suggested that role scope is determined by the position of the professional and the hierarchical level of the function within an organisation (Rieg, 2018) . Preliminary evidence from a pilot study has suggested that medical affairs may not be prioritised within pharmaceutical companies in terms of hierarchy (Jandhyala, 2020a) , despite the key role of MAPPs in satisfying distinct multiple external stakeholder requirements (Keene et al., 2020; Jandhyala, 2021a) for the successful adoption of medicines (Jandhyala, 2021b; Jandhyala, 2022) .",

This project was carried out between October and November 2021. Over the course of the programme, two MAPPs dropped out, leaving 11 in the analysis for this project. To be included, participants had to have at least 2 years of global or regional medical affairs experience at a global pharmaceutical company with offices in the United Kingdom. There was no geographic limitation for inclusion. While 10 participants were located in the United Kingdom at the time of study, the context was global, as participants were responsible for global medical affairs as well as for a specific range of EU and US territories (Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, the Nordics, the United States and the United Kingdom). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after providing information about the study and before the study commenced. Responses were anonymised, and consensus round list items were not identifiable to particular participants.

Bars represent the percentage of unique items generated by participants in order of entry into the study; the line represents the cumulative percentage of unique items, which was achieved by four participants in total. least aware of \"communication/education.\" This could be due to the traditional separation of medical affairs and commercial functions within pharmaceutical companies, whereby drug promotion is isolated from scientific interests for ethical reasons (Jacob, 2018) . However, medical affairs may be increasingly responsible for the communication and dissemination of scientific knowledge, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic (Ghosh et al., 2021) . This could explain why MAPPs agreed to include \"communication/education\" in the final definition despite being less aware of it initially. Participants unanimously agreed on the inclusion of five items: \"medical,\" \"protecting patient interests,\" \"regulating pharma company activities,\" \"adoption,\" and \"Real-world Evidence.\" All other items were agreed upon by 10 of the 11 participants. Therefore, the definition was robustly supported by consensus. All items could be categorised into four previously defined MAPP functions: protecting patients' interests, medicine adoption and regulation, evidence generation and gatekeeper stakeholder engagement (Jandhyala, 2022) , which provided confidence in the reliability and validity of our findings. Our definition varied from a previous definition (Maeda, 2021) in four ways: the designation of medical affairs as a medical specialty, the leadership of medical affairs in medicine adoption, detail regarding the generation of real-world evidence and the specification of distinct stakeholders who benefit from medical affairs. The lack of designation of medical affairs as a medical specialty is common in published literature, with some perspectives viewing it as a partnership with physicians rather than a speciality comprised of physicians (Bedenkov et al., 2020) and others as a partnership between non-physician medical staff and medical communications (Jain, 2017) . Most viewed the specialty as being staffed primarily by non-physicians who are not regulated by the General Medical Council (GMC) or other physician governance bodies (Jain, 2017; Bedenkov et al., 2020; Maeda, 2021) . Historically, the pressures of commerciality within pharmaceutical companies resulted in ethical violations when medical affairs functions, such as the communication of scientific knowledge, were poorly regulated (Maeda, 2021) . These issues were resolved by separating communication and scientific functions (Jandhyala, 2020a; Maeda, 2021) ; however, the increasing need for medical affairs to communicate and disseminate scientific knowledge responsibly (Ghosh et al., 2021) may necessitate this kind of professional regulation, including accountability to the GMC with the possibility of sanctions, now more than ever.",

For example, medical specialities adhere to the professional standard of primum non nocere, which protects patients as a matter of principle. Despite calls for more patient-centric medical affairs, this has not been addressed systematically or achieved to date, and existing frameworks suggest that patient-centricity should be a guiding principle but offer no way of ensuring this (Bedenkov et al., 2020; Ashkenazy, 2020) . Individual moral identity has been identified as a protective factor against unethical proorganisational employee behaviour (Kim et al., 2018) such as the ethical violations that occur when profit is placed above patients' interests. However, variation in moral identity between individuals (K\u00f6rner et al., 2020) suggests that the protection of patients would be enacted to varying standards across medical affairs departments without adherence to a moral code operationalised via professional ethical governance such as that afforded by defining medical affairs as a medical specialty.",

This was reflected in the low awareness score for \"adoption\" in this study, which referred to the process of medicine adoption through pharmaceutical gatekeeper stakeholder subsystems (Jandhyala, 2021a) , which received unanimous agreement in the consensus round. This suggested a need for further evidence generation on medicine adoption and the education and training of MAPPs and others who work in medical affairs on this process. Our definition also highlighted the fact that the medical affairs generates realworld evidence to benefit distinct stakeholders. Previous definitions refer to scientific evidence and stakeholders without distinction (Bedenkov et al., 2020; Maeda, 2021) . However, realworld evidence is generated through specific methods and in specific populations and contexts that differentiates it from other types of evidence (K\u00f6rner et al., 2020) . Additionally, stakeholders have distinct evidentiary needs (Keene et al., 2020; Jandhyala, 2021b ) that must be fulfilled for successful medicine adoption (Jandhyala, 2021c) . Specifying the type of evidence and each stakeholder involved in medicine adoption within the definition of medical affairs may focus research (Patino and Ferreira, 2018) and practice and benefit policy and governance (Jamoulle et al., 2017; Armstrong and Mouton, 2018) in this function to enhance outcomes for both patients and pharmaceutical companies.",

            "text": "First, our definition was limited by the small sample size and geographical locations. However, it was unlikely for the small sample size to have affected our findings, as we reached saturation after the participation of seven MAPPs. Additionally, while our definition was applicable in a global context due to MAPP operation at regional and global levels, MAPPs at different pharmaceutical companies may vary in the way they define medical affairs, and this could be determined by further research. It may be helpful to determine whether awareness of the medical affairs function's role in medicine adoption is low in the general population of MAPPs, as this may account for the lack of understanding of this aspect of medical affairs within research and practice as well as providing a possible avenue for change. Second, our definition was limited by being written only from the point of view of MAPPs. This may have been quite important, as the variety of other roles that work in medical affairs, such as medical science liaisons, may have a different perspective informed by their own role. However, our findings suggested that predominant ideas about medical affairs were more reflective of the functions of other roles and not physicians, even though they receive specialist training in medical affairs, are professionally regulated (and thus, accountable in their duty to patients) and to some extent, fulfil a regulatory function in terms of overseeing pharmaceutical activities to ensure that commercial interests are guided by ethical and scientific principles, which protect patients. Additionally, definitions in the literature provided by non-MAPPs did not add anything to our definition but left out key aspects needed to ensure safe and effective medical affairs practice. Therefore, a definition of medical affairs from the point of view of MAPPs was both needed and justified.",

Our definition varied from existing definitions in four key ways: the designation of medical affairs as a medical specialty (and its primary aim, therefore, is to protect patients), the leadership of medical affairs in medicine adoption, the generation of real-world evidence and the specification of distinct stakeholders who benefit from medical affairs. These areas define the role scope of MAPPs and govern the key principles recognised as necessary in medical affairs practice. The use of this definition may protect and further the interests of patients by enhancing research and practice in medical affairs.",
