Ideally, all people should have an equal opportunity to reach his or her full health potential. Health equity means that everyone has equal opportunity to be as healthy as possible [1] . This requires the removal of important barriers to a good health position for communities such as poverty, discrimination (including a lack of access to good jobs with fair pay), quality education and housing, safe environment, and healthcare [2] . Searching for the reasons for such inequalities is a very complex process, as it hides a number of linkages both between indicators and in their overarching areas [3] . Efforts to measure inequalities in the general health position of communities are not new [4] , but the definition of impartiality and (in)equality and the methodology to measure them, including the identification of optimal indicators, are controversial [5] . In [6] 'social model of health', health inequalities are commonly analyzed along several dimensions relating to social, economic, and environmental determinants. In order to better understand why some populations or groups are healthier than others, and to take actions that will improve health and reduce inequalities, the monitoring of determinants of health should go beyond measuring health outcomes [7] . For this reason, a shift in monitoring determinants and indicators, including causes and risk factors, is needed [8, 9] . In particular, the task of monitoring population health inequalities using multidimensional indicators requires the availability of spatially disaggregated data.",

The creation of a quality and sustainable environment, and an adequate level of economic and social development, simultaneously promotes good health conditions and social equity [11] . In this paper, we aim to reflect on the above issues, initially presenting preliminary results aimed at developing a substantive classification and subsequent quantification of the complex of relevant determinants of health. The health index in the Czech population and its spatial differentiation will be presented to illustrate the methodological approach. A composite indicator-the Health Index-was created to assess health inequalities. The index is composed of eight areas, which make up 60 indicators, which are analyzed in 77 regions of the Czech Republic. In comparing the results according to the mathematics methods, very similar tendencies can be observed. The paper presents a holistic approach to the assessment of determinants affecting health conditions at both the individual and population levels. This approach also enables the identification of problems whose solution can lead to the elimination or at least justification of health inequalities.",

These are interconnected and evolve over time and space [13] . We consider the components of \"life space\" to be the external environment (water, air, and soil), living conditions (individual environmental quality, access to healthcare, etc.), and socio-economic conditions (economic performance, socio-economic status, education, social disadvantage, etc.) [14] . Conceptual issues of spatial differences in health indicators and inequalities have been addressed, for example, in studies [15] [16] [17] [18] . In recent decades, the possibilities of using GIS in the analysis of spatial inequalities have been intensively discussed, e.g., [19] [20] [21] .",

These factors along with employment status, job opportunities, and income may either improve or limit individual health status (e.g., [27] [28] [29] ). Other authors emphasize the importance of overall and health literacy (e.g., [30] ) or environmental factors (e.g., [31] ) in the assessment of health determinants and inequalities. Spatial differentials in health condition are also observed across regions and countries in Europe. Beyond education, the objective cause of spatial differentials in health condition outcomes between countries is also represented by different levels of socioeconomic development [32] [33] [34] [35] . Socio-economic conditions influence the structure of mortality rates in the following way: countries with favorable socio-economic conditions record lower mortality rates (e.g., Finland, Sweden, and France), while countries with worse socio-economic conditions show higher mortality rates (e.g., Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Hungary, and Latvia) [36] . Similar results are found in a study investigating the countries in the central and eastern Europe (CEE) region [34] . Results from this study suggest a much higher mortality for CEE countries than countries in other regions of Europe, both for those with low levels of education and those with high levels of education. For Europe as a whole, while it is true that individuals with low levels of education die earlier than those with higher levels of education, there is still a significant difference in mortality rates between eastern and western European countries of the same educational categories, although the trend over the last 30 years indicates that European countries successfully fight against health inequalities [34] . According to the European Core Health Indicators, the life expectancy at birth of the population with a high educational level for CEE countries is similar to the life expectancy at birth of the population with a low educational level in northern Europe or Italy [37] .",

On one hand, the method of composite indicators is a recognized technique that allows the explanation of more complex research problems; on the other hand, the optimal methodological constructs and mathematical aspects remain rather unclear [48, 49] . At the same time, there is no agreed standard or internationally accepted rule for determining the number and type of variables to be included in health quantification [5, 50] . However, indices are a valued, recognized, and useful measurement tool not only for etiological approaches, but also for development strategies and policy decisions, as well as for institutional public communication [51, 52] . A review study [5] presents a summary of the literature (more than 1500 studies) on indices for assessing spatial data on the determinants of health and environment. The authors identified 23 indices and assessed 329 variables. This diversity illustrates the lack of a common framework, which can lead to strong subjectivity and at the same time, limit the possibility of comparing in time and across countries or regions different indices of health and environment. The specificity and varying availability of variables also limit the transferability of the indices [5] .",

            "text": "A composite indicator-the Health Index-was developed to assess health condition inequalities. The Health Index includes both determinants and indicators of health (see [54] ). The selection of indicators was directed by the following issues: (a) monitoring and availability of data in public databases over time and at the required geographical level (76 districts-LAU 1 and the territory of the Capital City of Praha, a total of 77 regions of the Czech Republic) and (b) the range of available indicators (determinants of health, health status, healthcare, etc.; [55] ). The index is composed of eight areas, which make up 60 indicators. The original set of 68 indicators was reduced after correlation analysis to eight indicators that showed a higher correlation value than required, i.e., more than \u22120. The newly developed Health Index is a mathematical combination of variables that reflect multiple selected variables [56, 57] . Two methods of multicriteria variance scoring were used for calculating it: the WSA and the TOPSIS method. The Weighted Sum Approach (WSA) method is a method based on the principle of utility maximization. The method is based on the assumptions of linearity and maximization of all partial utility functions, which are obtained by normalizing the original input data. The TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method aims to select a compromise option with the assumption that the best option has the smallest distance from the ideal option and the largest from the baseline option. In contrast to the WSA method, TOPSIS is based on the principle of minimizing the distance from the ideal variant or maximizing the distance from the basal variant. A more detailed explanation of the used calculation methods is given in the Appendix A. The higher the Health Index value, the more favorable the situation in the region (this is valid for both methods). The calculations were performed in MS Excel Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, DC, USA. and its add-in SANNA 2014 (Josef Jablonsk\u00fd, 2009, Czech Republic) [58] .",

The importance of each area and attached weights were determined by an interdisciplinary expert assessment using the Delphi method [53] . The most used methods to identify the weights were statistical, multi-attribute modeling, and subjective. We worked with subjective methods to determine the weights as we aimed to capture what is more important in the phenomenon we study. These new methods have been introduced with the aim to involve more individuals-experts or citizens-in the process of defining weights systems for social indicators. We chose the Delphi method among the subjective methods for weighting [59, 60] .",

This method allowed us to reduce the influence of participants upon one another when determining the weights. Our DELPHI questionnaire was distributed by email in order to maintain confidentiality and avoid leading effects. In our study, we selected a wide range of experts (10 people) from different disciplines (e.g., physicians, sociologists, demographers, economists, statisticians, public health specialist, and others) that come together in this research. Ten independent experts from different disciplines related to population health anonymously determined the scores of each of the eight areas through a questionnaire. The experts' opinions were refined in a three-round evaluation process and further used to create the Health Index.",

In the case of group 1, districts with the highest increase in the Health Index value are indicated, showing the highest positive change in ranking is larger. In the case of group 2, the increase in the Health Index value shows a different degree of change in the ranking of districts. In the case of group 3, there was an improvement in the Health Index value and a simultaneous decrease in rankings for a very small number of districts. The other three groups of districts (4 to 6) showed a decrease in the Health Index value and are characterized by a decrease in the Health Index value without a decrease in rankings (group 4). In the case of group 5, the Health Index value decreased and with it the ranking, while in group 6, the decrease in the Health Index value also reflects in the most significant decrease in the ranking of districts (D\u011b\u010d\u00edn and \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem). Despite this similarity in the characteristics of the groups of districts when comparing the two methods, the TOPSIS method generally results in a lower negative reduction in the Health Index than the WSA method.",

The main contributors to the positive scores for these districts are Area 2 (education; weight 0.18) and Area 8 (health; weight 0.20). In Area 2, education is characterized by an above-average proportion of people with a university degree and a low proportion of people with incomplete or primary education. In Area 8, health conditions are associated with above-average life expectancy and below-average total standardized mortality, as well as below-average mortality rate by underlying causes of death, including deaths caused by tobacco smoking and diabetes mellitus. With the exception of the district of Brno-m\u011bsto, the results are also favorable in Area 1 (economic conditions and social protection; weight 0.19) and Area 6 (except for the Capital City of Praha) (road safety and crime; weight 0.04). In Area 1, the value of the economic conditions and social protection index is reduced by the above average unemployment rates of both gender and age in the case of the Brno-City district. In the Capital City of Praha, the negative result in Area 6 regarding the road safety and crime index is directed by an above-average share of traffic accidents and registered crimes. In Area 3 (demographic indicators; weight 0.08), most districts are downgraded, mainly due to the higher age index. However, the districts of Praha-v\u00fdchod and Praha-z\u00e1pad remain in a favorable position. Area 5 (individual living conditions; weight 0.09) shows a similar regional distribution. On the other hand, in Area 7 (health and social care resources; weight 0.10), the districts of Praha-v\u00fdchod and Praha-z\u00e1pad lag significantly behind the other districts due to negative results for the Hospital Bed Capacity indicator. Area 4 (environmental conditions; weight 0.14) is rather unfavorable for this group of districts, with above average values of air pollution and a low coefficient of ecological stability. The only exception is the\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice district (see Table 4 ).",

This group of districts is mainly associated with unfavorable results in Area 1 (economic conditions and social protection; weight 0.19), Area 8 (health; weight 0.20), and Area 2 (education; weight 0.18) except for Ostrava-City district.

The results are also inconsistent in Area 5 (individual living conditions; weight 0.09), in which Chomutov joins the Most, Karvin\u00e1, and Ostrava-City districts, all with a low index affected mainly by the small share of flats heated by electricity or gas.

The current situation addresses a number of economic, social, and societal changes that reflect the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. An effective instrument is needed for decision-making processes at the national and regional level to serve as a tool for selecting appropriate measures to reduce health inequalities. These measures can have an even more significant impact if they are selectively targeted. ",

For usual TOPSIS method it is done by calculation of the difference between the highest value for the given criterion and the value for the given district in the criterion. For example, in Table A2 the max. value for the criterion 3_a is 10.0295 and the real value for Bene\u0161ov district is 2.3078, so after the change into maximization the value for Bene\u0161ov district is 10.0295 \u2212 2.3078 = 7.7217 (Table A5 ). Data normalization is the second step but the Formula (A3) is different than for WSA. In TOPSIS the square root of the sum of all square values for data in each criterion must be calculated and each value is then divided by this square root. For example, the sum of the square values of the criterion 3_a is 4067.6325 and the square root is 63.778. So, the normalized value for the Bene\u0161ov district and 3_a criterion is 7.7217/63.778=0.001898. The normalized matrix is in Table A6 . Third step of the TOPSIS method is the weighted matrix calculation-here equal weights (1/3) are used to multiply all values in normalized matrix. For the Bene\u0161ov district, the weighted value for the criterion 3_a is equal to 0.001898 * 1/3 = 0.00063. To calculate the distance from the best and from the worst value it is necessary to find the max. value (best) and the min. value (worst) for each criterion (in each column of the weighted matrix-Formula A4). For example, the max. value for the criterion 3_a is 0.000748 and the min. value is equal to zero.",

The health index is equal to the final c i score.Also here in this small area and selected districts, the difference of WSA and TOPSIS results is evident (in WSA the best is Brno-m\u011bsto district, in TOPSIS it is \u017dd'\u00e1r nad S\u00e1zavou district).
