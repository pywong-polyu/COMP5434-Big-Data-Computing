The peripheral and central system is known as the cause of vestibular hypofunction. Peripheral causes; pres by vertigo, cervicogenic dizziness, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Meniere, vestibular neuritis, vestibular migraine, head trauma, acoustic neuroma. Central causes; It is known as multiple sclerosis, atypical Parkinson's, stroke, migraine, cerebellar disorder, head trauma, drugs, psychogenic and cardiovascular/autogenic conditions [3] . Symptoms such as dizziness, oscillopsia, postural instability, and gait disturbances are seen in patients with UVH. Symptoms such as oscillopsia, spatial orientation problems, cognitive impairment, postural instability, visual and gaze disturbances, and physical inappropriateness are seen in patients with BVH [2, 4] .",

The exercises used in vestibular rehabilitation and the diseases in which the rehabilitation is applied vary. Whitney et al. examined the developments related to vestibular rehabilitation and rehabilitation; they said that gaze stabilization exercises, habituation exercises, virtual reality, and biofeedback were used [25] . In a review made in 2019, they found that gaze stabilization exercises positively affected VOR gain, improved dynamic visual acuity, and reduced dizziness [26] . In our study, a significant improvement was achieved with vestibular rehabilitation exercise training in our patients by providing balance training with adaptation, habituation, and replacement exercises. It was observed that there were significant improvements in balance parameters after vestibular rehabilitation treatment in patients diagnosed with vestibular hypofunction, resulting in improvements in the perception of verticality and horizontality. It has been determined that vestibular rehabilitation increases VOR gain, reduces the discomfort of patients from crowds, and this results in an increase in their quality of life. At the same time, it was observed that there was a decrease in the severity of dizziness, thus leading to improvements in kinesiophobia scores.",
