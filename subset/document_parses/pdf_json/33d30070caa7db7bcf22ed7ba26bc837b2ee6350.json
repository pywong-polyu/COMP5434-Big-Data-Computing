One approach is in silico drug design based on our existing knowledge of the biology of a specific disease and the specific target site binding chemistry. Based on this knowledge, a range of molecules will be designed and synthesised after which they will be tested in in vitro bioassays for activity and toxicity. The best candidates, called lead compounds, will then be ''fine-tuned'' by chemical derivatisation in order to improve their activity and/or to reduce their toxicity. Lead compounds are then tested in various animal models before entering clinical trials in people. Another approach is to screen a large number of biological samples (plants, bacteria and fungi) for activity against a specific disease. Any active extract, consisting of many compounds, will be fractionated by chromatographic techniques, and each fraction will be tested for in vitro activity. Active fractions will again be fractionated until the active compound is identified. This process, also called bioguided fractionation, can go through a number of fractionation cycles before the active compound is identified. The active compound will be chemically derivatised in order to improve its properties before in vivo animal studies will be conducted. Based on these test results, the most promising lead compounds will then be tested in clinical trials in people. There are however a number of shortcomings with both approaches. It is expensive, time consuming, makes use of in vitro bioassays and it suffers from a very low success rate. Due to these shortcomings, it is currently estimated that the development of one new drug costs around $1-1.5 billion, simply because so many lead compounds fail during clinical trials. Keeping these high costs in mind, one would think that all registered drugs are effective and importantly non-toxic. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as there are a number of drugs currently on the market that are causing severe side effects and whose efficacy should be questioned. This holds true particularly for cancer chemotherapeutics. It was estimated that cancer chemotherapy improves the average 5-year survival rate of patients (for all cancer types) by only 2 % (Morgan et al. 2004) . Another relatively unknown fact is that each year, 200,000 people die in the EU due to adverse drug reactions (all types of drugs), highlighting the severe shortcomings of the drug development and drug licensing pipelines (Archibald and Coleman 2012) . To put this into perspective, there are a large number of drugs that work perfectly well and are safe to use, but we have to concede that our approach to drug discovery and our overall approach to health care suffers from some major problems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2248, "end": 2268, "text": "(Morgan et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2493, "end": 2521, "text": "(Archibald and Coleman 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug Discovery and Reverse Pharmacology"}, {"text": "There are alternative approaches in which these problems can partly be sidestepped. One such approach can be called reverse pharmacology. This relatively simple approach identifies traditional medicines (e.g. predominantly medicinal plants) that are known to be non-toxic in vivo. This is an extremely important aspect as most lead compounds identified during the normal drug discovery processes fail during clinical trials due to in vivo toxicity. If we identify medicinal plants that have been used and are still being used by thousands of people without any reports of toxicity, we have practically sidestepped this major problem. The second step in reverse pharmacology is to work our way back to the active compound(s) with the use of in vitro bioassays. We therefore start with the in vivo uncontrolled clinical trial followed by the in vitro identification of the active compound(s). One notable difference with the normal drug discovery process is that this system does not necessarily need in vivo animal studies to be conducted (however, the drug registration authority demands animal studies to be conducted before registration). The reverse pharmacology approach is however not without its shortcomings either. The main problem here is that in vitro bioassays are being used, leading to the same set off problems experienced with the normal drug discovery pipeline at this stage of the process. Some of the main problems with in vitro bioassays are as follows:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug Discovery and Reverse Pharmacology"}, {"text": "\u2022 They exclude the influence of human metabolism on the active compounds and will therefore not detect the so-called prodrugs. Prodrugs are compounds that are inactive in their natural form but are chemically altered during normal metabolism to become active. \u2022 Bioassays are designed to identify compounds with a specific mechanism of action. It can for instance consist of a single enzyme (e.g. HIV integrase) or a specific life cycle stage of a parasite. Any active compound that does not bind to this enzyme or does not act against a specific life cycle stage might therefore be deemed inactive-A so-called false negative. \u2022 Bioassays do not test for important pharmacokinetic and dynamic aspects such as bioavailability. If the compound is not bioavailable in vivo, then the in vitro activity does not matter much (bioavailability can however be improved by encapsulation techniques).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug Discovery and Reverse Pharmacology"}, {"text": "\u2022 Bioassays normally make use of ''foreign'' organic chemicals or media that can react and thereby deactivate active compounds, leading to a large number of false negatives. Common compounds found in many plants can also react with these bioassay media constituents, making them active, leading to a large number of false positives.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug Discovery and Reverse Pharmacology"}, {"text": "The main issue is however the problem of false positives and false negatives. The false positives are compounds that are deemed ''active'' in a specific bioassay after which a large amount of time and effort will be spent on their identification. Fortunately, false positives eventually always reveal themselves but, unfortunately, at a cost of time and funds. False negatives are a far more serious problem in that they do not react with a specific enzyme in the bioassay used and are therefore deemed inactive. They may even degrade in the ''foreign'' media used in the bioassay. The main problem here is that false negatives never reveal itself. For example, if it is published that medicinal plant X show no activity against disease X, very few people will go and reinvestigate, if any. Unfortunately, this problem is also important when using in vitro bioassays to test for the toxicity of lead compounds or active extracts. Here, again we find the occurrence of false positives and negatives. False positives are again compounds reacting with specific cells, leading to cell death and the conclusion is made that this compound or extract is toxic. A good example of this was that we recently tested English tea (Camellia sinensis) as negative control on a specific cell line. Due to toxicity in that specific cell line, our experiments could not continue, and we could not use normal tea as a negative control (unpublished results). Many millions of people are drinking tea every day without any short-or long-term toxicity reported thus far. To put this into perspective, if this was a medicinal plant, we would have concluded that it is far too toxic and we would not have continued our investigations. A false negative in toxicity bioassays speaks for itself. There are countless examples of lead compounds that were deemed safe after in vitro and even in vivo animal studies that turned out to be toxic in people.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug Discovery and Reverse Pharmacology"}, {"text": "There are many problems associated with in vitro bioassays, and it will remain a problem for the normal drug discovery pipeline as well as for the reverse pharmacology approach. The only advice is to interpret in vitro results very carefully.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug Discovery and Reverse Pharmacology"}, {"text": "These two approaches to drug discovery that we can call the ''normal'' and ''reverse'' approaches are, unfortunately, at the moment exclusive. The main reason for this is not only scientific but economic and political, and that is why this aspect should shortly be discussed here. We live in a segregated world with on the one side the ''rich'' Western countries with their own unsustainable complex economic system (capitalism) and, on the other side, the ''poorer'' non-Western countries with their more sustainable simpler economic systems. In Western countries, scientific research should lead to the creation of financial profits in the short term in order to sustain their complex economic system. In practice, this means that funding for research into (new) medicines will be made available only if research will lead to the development of a new drug that can be sold for a profit in order to create or sustain a company and keep people employed. In short, to keep the economy growing, profits need to be made. As such, there is nothing wrong with this approach, but it does however focus on the creation of wealth and employment on the short term, and not on the health of people. One advantage of this economic system on a scientific level is that these countries have extremely well-equipped laboratories to perform in-depth scientific research into new medicines, but as long as potential profits take centre stage. Because of this, research into medicinal plants has basically been stopped for the simple reason that a medicinal plant cannot be produced and sold in order to create wealth-it is just too inexpensive and will therefore not be able to financially sustain anyone or any company. Identifying a new lead compound from a medicinal plant will be supported to some degree, but only if the possibility of patenting and eventual profits exist. The harsh reality is that if a medicinal plant works or not (the science behind it) does not really matter at all-it just does not fit into the economic model. In non-Western countries, the focus is still primarily on the health of people and not on short-term direct profits. Here, medicinal plants have always played a role and will continue to do so as long as the main objective is the health of their citizens and not direct short-term profits. That people sell medicinal plants for a profit in these countries does of course take place, but this is not on a comparable scale to the cost of drugs in Western countries. Is there any possibility to reconcile these two worlds? Can and should research into medicinal plants take place in Western countries in order to use it as such? The way we see it is that we do not have a choice anymore. The health care systems in many Western countries are on the verge of collapse, and it appears that the capitalistic model and health care are not a good mix after all. A fast growing lack of trust and the extremely high costs involved are probably the main reasons. It has become too expensive, proven by the fact that many people in Western countries are already excluded from primary health care, simply because they cannot afford it. We have to find a way to reduce the cost of health care in Western countries. Expensive medicine is of course only one part of the overall cost of the health care system, but it is a good starting point. What needs to be done is to study the health care systems in non-Western countries and to apply our vast resources in Western countries into studying specifically the types of medicine that they use in order to provide and create an evidence-based, quality-controlled, inexpensive and effective medicine. We have to be clear that not all of the traditional medicines used in non-Western countries will work; there will be many failures, but there will (or might) also be big successes. One medicinal plant that should be studied in detail is Artemisia annua L. (Asteraceae) (Fig. 14.1 ). This medicinal plant has the potential to satisfy the current needs of both worlds but also has the potential to bring these two worlds closer together. It can yield single compounds that can be further developed into a drug-which it already did. It can also be used in the form of a medicinal plant as an inexpensive, effective treatment for life-threatening diseases in non-Western countries-which it already did. Our sincere hope is that this plant will one day even be used in Western countries as soon as the scientific evidence for its efficacy is provided. All we need to do is some in-depth scientific research, which at the moment is unfortunately not being supported in Western countries due to the aforementioned economic reasons. To address this, we have recently published a review paper dealing with the scientific complexities we face in studying this plant and recommended the logical next steps that should be taken (van der Kooy and Sullivan 2013). This chapter will therefore describe another important aspect of A. annua ( Fig. 14.1 ) and the discovery of the remarkable anti-HIV activity of this plant. We will give a short introduction on the history of A. annua, the biological activities associated with this plant, the reported antiviral activities and more specifically the anti-HIV activities of all compounds identified in the traditionally prepared A. annua formulation. The potential impact of this discovery and the need to continue with this research will also be discussed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3924, "end": 3934, "text": "(Fig. 14.1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4981, "end": 4990, "text": "Fig. 14.1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Reverse Pharmacology: Economic and Political Considerations"}, {"text": "A. annua has been used for hundreds of years to treat various ailments, specifically those related to the treatment of intermittent fevers. This traditional use has been linked to malarial infections caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. From A. annua, one active compound, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide called artemisinin has been identified and is currently being used, as artemisinin derivatives, as a first-line treatment for malaria (De Ridder et al. 2008) . The traditional use of A. annua in the form of a tea infusion prepared from the dried leaves In the foreground, the Artemisia annua plant and in the background the users of this plant as a tea infusion for the treatment of various diseases (Photo with permission from Anamed) continues to be used in China and due to its apparent effectiveness has rapidly spread across the globe in recent times. Currently, it is being used all over the world as an inexpensive treatment for malaria, as opposed to the WHO-recommended artemisinin derivatives. The traditional use of A. annua has caused a large amount of controversy, and it is feared that resistance against artemisinin might develop because of the traditional use of the plant. There is however an opposing view that states A. annua has been used for hundreds of years without resistance developing and only now since a single compound from this plant is being used, resistance has developed. The use of A. annua can however have important implications specifically for antimalarial treatments in developing countries, where the high cost of commercial drugs makes it practically inaccessible to many. It can also have important implications for Western countries where the general high cost of health care has already excluded many from receiving adequate treatment for disease. The common view on the use of A. annua supported by the WHO is relatively simplistic. In order to reach the prescribed doses of the main active compound artemisinin, they have concluded that artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are the only way to approach the treatment of malaria (Mueller et al. 2004; WHO 2012) . This clash between Western-based drugs (e.g. artemisinin) and traditional medicines (medicinal plants e.g. A. annua) has culminated in the publication of a Position Statement by the WHO on the use of A. annua for the treatment of malaria. The main recommendation in this statement was not to use A. annua in any form including a tea infusion due to the low natural abundance of artemisinin in A. annua (Liu et al. 2006 and WHO, 2012) . For a full discussion on the traditional use of A. annua, Hsu (2006) should be consulted, and for a full discussion on the controversy surrounding the use of A. annua versus the WHO-recommended use of artemisinin derivatives, van der Kooy and Sullivan (2013) should be consulted.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 453, "end": 476, "text": "(De Ridder et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 747, "end": 754, "text": "Anamed)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2097, "end": 2118, "text": "(Mueller et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2128, "text": "WHO 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2533, "end": 2553, "text": "(Liu et al. 2006 and", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2554, "end": 2564, "text": "WHO, 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2625, "end": 2635, "text": "Hsu (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background of Artemisia annua and Artemisinin"}, {"text": "There are however some problems relating to the use of artemisinin. The main problem is that it is a very fast-acting drug with a very short half-life. It therefore needs to be combined with a slower-acting drug in order to assure the effective elimination of all the parasitaemia. Another problem is the assurance of an adequate supply of artemisinin. Due to its complex chemical structure, the synthesis and/or semi-synthesis remains to be difficult, and therefore the main source of artemisinin remains to be isolation and purification from the A. annua plant. Due to environmental and economic influences, the annual production of A. annua suffers from a boom and bust cycle with overproduction and low prices the one year to underproduction and high prices the next year. The cost of this Westernstyle treatment is also far too high for where it is used-predominantly in non-Western countries. In order to stabilise the global production of A. annua and the price of artemisinin, various approaches have been taken. To increase the yield of artemisinin in A. annua, classical plant breeding techniques have been employed (Bartlet 2010) ; the isolation and purification techniques are continuously being improved (Liu et al. 2011a) , and the chemical synthesis of artemisinin has been successful to some degree (Dietrich et al. 2009 ). It is of note that all of this research has taken place in Western countries and that the focus is on the single compound artemisinin. Another novel approach would be to identify a second active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in order to reduce the overall production cost of artemisinin (Lubbe et al. 2012) .

A. annua was also tested with the common antiviral drug acyclovir, where it showed higher anti-HSV1 activity than the commercial drug (Karamoddini 2011) .

For a relatively new disease such as HIV, the identification of medicinal plants that work against these new diseases will therefore still undergo the process of trial and error.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 613, "end": 630, "text": "(Farnsworth 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Discovery of the Anti-HIV Activity of the Artemisia annua Tea Infusion"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, the small-scale surveys conducted by Wilcox et al. (2011) and Noumi and Manga (2011) revealed that HIV-infected patients had started to use A. annua infusions for the treatment of HIV although the original treatment was intended for malaria. In both these surveys, the patients prepared a tea infusion from A. annua either alone or with other plant species. Feedback from the nongovernmental organisation Anamed also claimed that the herb is often used by HIV patients. This information is important in that we know that A. annua is being used by thousands of people for the treatment of malaria without any toxicity reported thus far. In effect, a large uncontrolled clinical trial has been conducted exactly where it should take place, where the highest burden of HIV occurs. This has given us two important outcomes: The A. annua tea infusion appears to be non-toxic and exhibits claimed in vivo anti-HIV activity. This is the first important step as toxicity is the biggest problem experienced in the drug discovery process. The next step in reverse pharmacology is to provide in vitro evidence that the traditional tea infusion does indeed have activity against HIV. Two questions needed to be answered. Does the A. annua tea infusion exhibit any in vitro anti-HIV activity? And if so, is this activity caused by artemisinin? In order to test if artemisinin was responsible for the reported in vivo anti-HIV activity, we therefore had to include a chemically similar plant which does not contain any artemisinin. Previous work conducted on Artemisia afra Jacq. ex Wild. (Asteraceae) revealed it to be chemically similar to A. annua but, importantly, it does not contain artemisinin (Liu et al. 2010; van der Kooy et al. 2008) . The inclusion of A. afra was done in order to determine whether artemisinin was responsible for any observed anti-HIV activity, or whether a combination of artemisinin and other components can explain any observed activity (synergism). Furthermore, we could not find any literature reports that A. afra was tested against HIV (Liu et al. 2009 ) except one report where HIV-infected patients were given A. afra together with standard HIV treatments in order to boost their immune systems (Mulholland and Drewes, 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 51, "end": 71, "text": "Wilcox et al.

The results indicated that the A. annua tea infusions had IC 50 values of between 0.6 and 3.7 lg/mL and for the A. afra infusion an IC 50 value of 1 lg/mL (values corrected for variation in the positive control- Lubbe et al. 2012) (Table 14 .1). These results by themselves are quite remarkable in that Cos et al. (2008) reported that any single compound with an activity of below 25 lg/mL should be considered to have significant antiviral activity. We know that the tea infusion prepared from A. annua consists of many compounds (Mouton et al. 2013) , making this chemically complex ''extract'' highly active against HIV. Furthermore, the activities of all the samples appeared to be relatively similar, indicating that the concentration of the active compound in the samples is probably very similar. Furthermore, the active compound appears to be stable for a number of years as the oldest plant sample tested was about 10 years old. These results answered our first question in that the A. annua tea infusion does indeed exhibit good in vitro activity against HIV. We have to be careful in interpreting these results, and we have to keep in mind that in vitro bioassays suffer from some severe shortcomings as was discussed in the introduction of this chapter.

Most of these studies have also focussed only on the extraction and quantification of artemisinin without conducting a complete chemical profile on the A. annua formulations. Based on this limited data, the main conclusion was drawn that the tea infusion is ineffective and should not be used (Mueller et al. 2000 (Mueller et al. , 2004 Rath et al. 2004; Jansen 2006; and van der Kooy and Sullivan 2013) . This view is unfortunately too simplistic. If we take a closer look at traditional medicines, we have to realise that the chemistry of any traditional formulation consists of two parts (1) the chemistry of the medicinal plant and (2) the chemical influence that the preparation method has on the final formulation. The first aspect has been studied in some detail, and over the years, more than 600 secondary metabolites have been identified and reported for A. annua (Brown 2010) . In contrast to this, only 37 compounds have been identified in tea infusions or cold water extracts, mainly consisting of caffeic acid derivatives, flavonoids, coumarins and artemisinin (van der Kooy and Sullivan 2013). The influence of the preparation method on the chemistry of the final formulation has not been studied at all. To put this into perspective, we all know that a raw potato tastes different than a cooked potato, indicating that the preparation method has changed the chemistry. What effect will the preparation method have on the chemistry of the final formulation of the A. annua tea infusion? The chemical changes that can occur are not only due to the high temperatures involved but also due to water chemistry. Under field conditions, people will use any water available to them to prepare their tea infusions, and we know that water contains a large and variable amount of salts and elements. Any of these salts or elements can react to any organic molecule extracted from A. annua. The implications of this have been discussed by Van der Kooy and Sullivan (2013) .

The chlorogenic acid family does have some potential role to play in this observed activity, while the coumarins appear to have no direct role to play. The melilotosides have not yet been tested, while some of the flavonoids were tested but did not show a high level of activity against HIV. The concentration of the flavonoids in the tea infusion was also found to be rather low, which furthermore decreases the possibility that this class of compounds are responsible for the activity. If the flavonoids have any role to play, it will be in the form of a prodrug, as Tao et al. (2007) reported on the strong anti-HIV activity of the sodium-rutin-sulphate complex. Artemisinin has been tested against HIV using various bioassays, and the reported activity is somewhat contradictory. It therefore appears that none of the compounds identified thus far can be seen as the main anti-HIV compound. The logical next steps to take would be to perform a full chemical investigation into the tea infusion including the chemical reactions that can take place during the preparation of the tea with various chemicals present in water. It will also be important that the in vitro anti-HIV activity of the tea infusion be confirmed by an independent laboratory in order to decrease the possibility that this result might be a false positive. If the activity can be confirmed, the active compounds should be identified with the normal bioguided fractionation processes. Here, we have to keep in mind that fractionation can lead to the loss of activity and this effect, combined with the difficulties we face with in vitro bioassays, can make this task more difficult than what it appears (Schmidt et al. 2007; Wagner and Ulrich-Merzenich 2009; and Gertsch 2011) . To give us a potential lead and to narrow down the possibilities, we can again take a reverse approach. If we look at the chemical structures of existing HIV drugs that are currently being developed or used, is there any similar structure to those compounds identified in the A. annua tea infusion? There is one HIV drug, Bevirimat, based on the structure of betulinic acid, a triterpenoid. The Asteraceae family of plants is known to contain a wide variety of terpenoids with various biological activities associated with this group of compounds. A. annua has been reported to contain oleanolic acid and other tritepenoids which is structurally similar to Bevirimat.

The best way to persuade the powers that be is to provide the scientific evidence of the effectiveness of this approach. And this is just where the problem lies.

Will they shift their focus from sustaining a too expensive health care system or will they start to investigate any and all possible methods to improve the health of their citizens and reduce the cost, even if this means using inexpensive medicinal plants. In this chapter, we used A. annua as an example of how quick a potential lead can be found with the use of the reverse pharmacology approach.

With A. annua, we have an uncontrolled clinical trial happening in exactly the right place-in countries suffering the most under the burden of HIV.
