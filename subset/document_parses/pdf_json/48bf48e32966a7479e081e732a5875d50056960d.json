Patients were randomly assigned to receive either spinal fentanyl followed by oral doses of tramadol, paracetamol, and diclofenac at predetermined regular intervals of 6 h for the first 48 h, and rescue treatment with percocet (oxycodone and paracetamol; oral analgesia group), or spinal morphine and rescue treatment with oral tramadol, paracetamol, and diclofenac (spinal-morphine group). The primary outcomes were pain intensity during the postoperative 48 h, measured on a 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS) and expressed as area under the curve (AUC), and the number of breakthrough events of moderate to severe pain (defined as NRS score \u2265 4).",

Higher rates and longer durations of pruritus, nausea, and vomiting were reported among patients receiving spinal morphine, as compared with oral analgesia. Satisfaction scores were high in both groups (8.2 \u00b1 2.4 versus 8.7 \u00b1 1.8 in the oral analgesia and spinal morphine, respectively; p = 0.23). Conclusions Both oral analgesia at fixed time intervals and spinal morphine are satisfactory methods for treating post-Caesarean pain.

Yet, a second-line treatment in cases, where spinal morphine cannot be used, has not been established. Such cases include CS under general anesthesia, contraindications for spinal morphine, such as allergy, or history of severe adverse reactions after previous use, e.g., severe pruritus, gastrointestinal adverse effects, urinary retention, and respiratory depression [10] .

Fentanyl was not given during the spinal anesthesia due to reports that morphine might contradict the short-acting effect of fentanyl when administered together [19] . Patients did not receive additional analgesia unless requested in the following manner: In the recovery ward, patients who complained of pain intensity of \u2265 5 received intravenous 5 mg morphine. Repeated doses were given in 10-min intervals if the patient still reported NRS score \u2265 5. In the maternity ward, additional analgesia was given on demand or when reported NRS score for pain intensity was \u2265 4 (rescue treatments). In such cases, patients received two tablets of Zaldiar (each tablet contained paracetamol 325 mg and tramadol 37.5 mg) at minimal intervals of 6 h, and 100 mg diclofenac at minimal intervals of 12 h in the first 24 h from arrival to the maternity ward; an additional dose of diclofenac could be given after 48 h (Zaldiar and diclofenac were given simultaneously if the time frame allowed it). 2. Oral analgesia group-received spinal anesthesia with 25 \u00b5g fentanyl and 10 mg bupivacaine (isobaric) before surgery. Addition of fentanyl to intrathecal bupivacaine results in faster onset with improved peri-operative anesthesia, without increasing the side effects [20] . In the recovery ward, patients who suffered from pain received the same protocol of IV morphine described above. Before transfer to the maternity ward, all patients received a tablet of Percocet (oxycodone 5 mg and paracetamol 325 mg). Once the patients arrived at the maternity ward, they received 100 mg intravenous tramadol hydrochloride (the only time an IV medication was used), a tablet of 500 mg paracetamol, and a tablet of 100 mg diclofenac. Six hours after patient arrival and every 6 h thereafter, patients received two tablets of Zaldiar. The patients also received a tablet of 100 mg diclofenac 12, 24, and 48 h after arrival. Patients were not woken for treatment. If additional analgesia was required, a tablet of percocet was given, as necessary, up to four times per day, at a minimal interval of 30 min (rescue treatment). The maximal allowed dose of paracetamol was 4 g per day. No woman in the study reached that dose. The oral analgesia protocol is the standard of care in our department.",

An additional primary outcome was the number of events of breakthrough pain of moderate severity or higher, defined as NRS score \u2265 4 during the first 48 h from patient arrival at the maternity ward. This outcome was selected since both analgesia treatment arms were designed to prevent breakthrough pain. An NRS score of 4, which is considered moderate pain intensity, was chosen since it is the minimal score for which pain relievers can be offered by the nursing staff in our department. Breakthrough pain lasting up to 3 h was considered one event. After that, it was defined as a new event.",

However, a direct comparison of the two, in order to evaluate if oral analgesia could be an alternative for spinal morphine, has never been adequately studied. One study with a small sample size compared oral analgesia to spinal morphine. In the study, 120 women received either sustained-release oral oxycodone 20 mg in the recovery room, followed by immediaterelease oxycodone 10 mg 6-hourly for the first 24 h, or intrathecal morphine 100 \u00b5g at the time of spinal anesthesia. All women received postoperative paracetamol and 8-hourly diclofenac, starting at least 12 h postoperatively. Fig. 2 Breakthrough events of moderate to severe pain (NRS \u2265 4) in blocks of 6 h until 48 h after patient arrival to the maternity ward for women in the \"spinal morphine\" versus \"oral analgesia\" groups. The rate of women who reported NRS score for pain \u2265 4 in each group is presented in blocks of 6 h for 48 h. *p = 0.003, **p = 0.0001 Oxycodone and tramadol were used for rescue treatment. The AUC for pain scores across the first 24 h did not differ significantly between groups. Pruritus was reported less frequently in the oral analgesia group, but satisfaction scores were also lower in this group [11] . Higher intensity of worst pain in the 24 post-operative hours was suggested to contribute to these inferior satisfaction scores, underscoring the importance of addressing breakthrough pain as a primary endpoint. The study was limited by its small sample size, breakthrough pain being only a secondary outcome and the fact that oral analgesia was probably not given sufficiently, as suggested by the fact that 82% of the women in the oral analgesia group requested additional analgesia [11] . Breakthrough pain is a major challenge during postoperative care. In a previous study, around 68% women undergoing major gynecologic surgery had breakthrough pain requiring rescue analgesia within 48 h postoperatively, even though different continuous analgesia methods were given [25] . In the current study, the number of women with NRS \u2265 4 between 24 and 48 h after arrival to the maternity ward was comparable between the cohorts, although the spinal morphine group did not receive any regular analgesia. This may be explained by the long-term effect of morphine, persisting longer than 24 hours, the low rate of breakthrough pain events in both cohorts for demonstrating any statistically significant difference, and that woman in the spinal morphine group received analgesia following demand that was sufficient to alleviate pain.",

Interaction of estrogen with opioid receptors was suggested to underlie the phenomenon [27, 28] . Our findings are also consistent with previous reports of shorter duration of pruritus following fentanyl treatment, as compared to pruritus invoked by spinal morphine [11, 26, 29] .",

The fact that women were not woken for analgesia administrations may have contributed to that. Multiple administrations at different times for each patient also complicated this protocol. A solution which was implemented in our department was fixed-interval dosing, administered when the patients were expected to be awake (e.g., at 6:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 24:00). Another way to simplify the protocol is to administer 400 mg ibuprofen every 6 h, together with Zaldiar instead of diclofenac. Future studies should examine whether a combination of spinal morphine and oral analgesia at fixed time intervals is superior to each method individually.",

The limitations of this study included its single-center nature, the focus on short-term outcomes, and the open-label treatment administration, which is subject to bias. The types and nature of the questions in the structured questionnaire and the fact that this questionnaire was not validated may have also influenced the results, as previously suggested [30] , yet, since both groups received the same questionnaire, this possible limitation was minimised. An additional limitation lay in the fact that the anaesthetic and post-analgesic regimens used in this study may not be in line with those used in other institutions. Nevertheless, the principle of using oral analgesia at fixed time intervals remains valid, regardless of the specific medications.",
