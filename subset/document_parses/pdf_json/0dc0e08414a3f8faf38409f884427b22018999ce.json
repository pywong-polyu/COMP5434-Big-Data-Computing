Cardiovascular events (CVEs) are common among CAP and influenza patients, but there have been few population-based studies of influenza-related pneumonia (Flu-p) patients published to date. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 1191 immunocompetent hospitalized adult Flu-p patients from January 2012 to December 2018 in five teaching hospitals in China was conducted. Results: A total of 24.6% (293/1191) of patients developed at least one form of CVE-related complication while hospitalized. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, preexisting heart failure, systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, respiratory rates \u226530 breaths/min, a lymphocyte count <0.8\u00d710 9 /L, PaO 2 /FiO 2 <300 mmHg, and systemic corticosteroid administration were independently associated with the incidence of CVEs; while early neuraminidase inhibitor treatment and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment were associated with a lower risk of CVEs. After controlling for potential confounding variables, we determined that CVEs were linked to a higher risk of 30-day mortality (OR 3.307,, p < 0.001) in Flu-p patients. Conclusion: CVE-related complications are common among hospitalized Flu-p patients and are associated with negative patient outcomes. Clarifying these CVE-related risk factors can aid in their clinical prevention and management.",

            "text": "A number of different mechanisms associated with systemic responses to the influenza virus may explain the high incidence of CVEs among Flu-p patients. 18 Myocardial function can be depressed in response to systemic inflammation, which can also increase left ventricular afterload. Hypoxemia suppresses myocardial oxygen delivery and increases both Figure 4 Risk factors for the incidence of CVEs in Flu-p patients. Notes: Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, lymphocytes < 0.8\u00d710 9 /L, PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 300 mmHg at admission, and systemic corticosteroid administration were associated with an increased risk of CVEs, while early NAI administration and ACEIs/ARBs treatment were related to a decreased risk of CVEs. Tachycardia results in a rise in myocardial oxygen requirements and shortened diastole, resulting in a net negative shift in further myocardial dysfunction. This mismatch between myocardial oxygen supply and demand leads to post-infectious myocardial injury. 19 Direct virus-induced myocardial inflammation can also contribute to this process. The influenza virus can also promote prothrombotic alterations in the blood and endothelial tissues, reducing atherosclerotic plaque stability and increasing the odds of coronary thrombosis. CVE incidence in Flu-p patients is linked to underlying disease severity and the incidence of any comorbidities. Acute decompensation is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease suffering from acute disease-related inflammation. Severe Flu-p is characterized by impaired pulmonary function and diffuse alveolar damage, 20 with pulmonary damage ultimately inducing tachypnea and reduced PaO 2 /FiO 2 . Hypotension is most often secondary to severe infection, and is indicative of serious hemodynamic abnormalities. 21 In contrast with previous reports regarding CAP, 5-7 age was not an independent predictor of CVEs in our present study. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that more than 50% of severe patients with A (H1N1) pmd09 infections were young patients. 22 Lymphocytopenia occurs in 30-100% of severe influenza cases 22, 23 and is linked to the apoptotic death of CD4 + and CD8+ T cells, in turn delaying viral clearance. 24, 25 These lymphocytes can also be depleted from circulation when they are recruited into the lungs or other organs in response t viral infection. 26 Pulmonary lymphocyte accumulation can result in increasingly severe localized inflammation and tissue damage. Lymphocytopenia has previously been identified as a predictor of influenza disease severity, thereby increasing the risk of CVEs. 22, 27, 28 This study is the first cohort study to our knowledge to have evaluated the relationship between ACEI/ARB used and influenza severity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is expressed on pulmonary endothelial cells wherein functions by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Ang II). 29 Ang II can, in turn, activate the pulmonary AT1a receptor, thereby inducing the contraction of bronchial smooth muscle, increasing vascular permeability within the lung, promoting the proliferation of pulmonary fibroblasts, and driving alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis, thereby contributing to acute lung injury and severe Flu-p symptoms. 30 Ang II can additionally induce vasoconstriction and circulation resistance, elevating the risk of CVE incidence. Huang et al 31 observed a relationship between severe H7N9 influenza infectionrelated mortality and plasma Ang II levels. Zou et al 32 also found severe H5N1 avian influenza infections to be associated with elevated serum Ang II levels. ACEIs can reduce Ang II production and thereby prevent severe pulmonary injury and lower the risk of CVE incidence. A combination of plasma exchange therapy and ACEI treatment were sufficient to improve the condition of a patient suffering from scleroderma renal crisis and influenza B virus-triggered thrombotic microangiopathy. 33 In another case report, the aggressive treatment of a woman suffering from H1N1 influenza and severe acute left ventricular failure resulted in improvements in symptoms and left ventricular function. 34 Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can selectively bind to AT1 receptors expressed in the vascular smooth muscle to selectively inhibit Ang II, thereby lowering blood pressure and preventing major CVE incidence. While we found that more CVE patients were treated with ACEIs/ARBs, the directionality of the relationship between ACEIs/ARBs and the incidence of CVEs changed following adjustment for confounders. Cardiac complications are also prevalent (~60%) in those suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 35 In a murine model, an increased level in angiotensin II ultimately increases pulmonary vascular permeability, leading to pulmonary edema and reduced lung function. 36 Treatment with recombinant ACE237 and losartan Figure 5 The impact of CVEs numbers on the 30-day mortality of Flu-p patients.

Controlled interventional trials will be necessary to confirm whether such a relationship exists.",

We were also unable to access vaccination-related data or other missing information owing to the retrospective nature of this study, limiting the accuracy of these results.
