The collection, analysis and use of disability-relevant data, particularly disaggregated data, has been championed as a way to operationalise the DI agenda and advance the sustainable development goals (SDG) stated aim of 'leaving no one behind' [1, 2] . Measurement of disability is not straightforward-multiple measurement approaches exist with choice between them influenced by the purpose of the data collection as well as the underlying 'model' of how disability is considered and understood [3] . We conceptualized the implementation of disability data collection as an 'intervention', in that it has an underlying theory (implicit or explicit) as to how it can bring about an outcome or change within the UN World Food Programme (WFP) system. While guidance exists on selecting appropriate measures (e.g., Washington Group Modules [4] , less attention has been paid to the process of implementing disability-related data collection within complex organisations, and the ripple-effects of such interventions. Understanding how a complex system responds to disability data interventions is crucial if such data interventions are to be mainstreamed across humanitarian and development organisations.",

J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 10334 2 of 12 WFP has developed an organisational preference for using quantitative data to support operating at scale; measuring billions of funding dollars received, thousands of metric tonnes of food delivered, and tens of millions of persons assisted annually. In the recent context of growing sectoral attention to DI, WFP made several organisational commitments, including disaggregation of its beneficiary data by disability, alongside sex and age. In 2018, this became the trigger for the launch of a new performance indicator-'A9'-measuring the number of persons with disabilities reached by WFP assistance. A9 was thus designed as an output indicator [5] , meaning it collected annual data on the persons assisted by WFP programmes, by measuring the number of persons with disabilities assisted. Therefore, A9 is distinct from disaggregating needs assessment data, which could provide information about whether persons with disabilities are disproportionately represented among households without enough to eat, or outcome indicators, which might measure the extent to which being included in assistance resulted in improved nutrition profiles for this group. Implemented across the complex, adaptive system of WFP itself, and spanning operations across 88 diverse country contexts, A9 launched one year before the UN Secretary General introduced the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS), putting WFP at the forefront of efforts to systematise collection of disability data across life-saving humanitarian and development operations.",

Here, we used a complexity informed, realist methodology to build an empirically testable account of 'how' and 'why' the A9 indicator resulted in myriad outcomes across WFP's various operating contexts. What seemed like a small change-disaggregating one indicator among many, had system wide, unanticipated effects. Over the 3-year history of the intervention, the bi-directional dynamics of organisational change meant that the WFP system responded to A9, while the A9 indicator was itself manipulated and revised through its use and interpretation. This layered nature of organisational change meant that as disability measurement expanded, the intervention mechanisms of yesterday were destined to become the implementation context of tomorrow. Our goal is to assess how a disability measurement intervention operated in practice, to help improve understanding of how best data can be leveraged to support inclusion in humanitarian and development activities.",

This case study of A9 forms one component of an ongoing, realist evaluation of the use of evidence as a pathway to mainstreaming disabilityinclusive programming in WFP. Realist evaluation is a theory driven, explanatory focused research methodology that seeks to answer the question 'what works, for whom, in which contexts, and why?'. It does this by identifying underlying, generative mechanisms (M) which, in certain contexts (C), operate to produce observable outcomes (O), framed as CMO-configurations (CMOC) [6] . Mechanisms are not elements of a given intervention-in our case, A9-but rather are a heuristic to represent how programme stakeholders-here, WFP staff-respond to the resources provided by the intervention. Mechanisms and the outcomes they produce are context dependent, as only certain conditions will enable the 'firing' of the mechanism [7] . This makes the variety of contexts across which WFP operates rich ground to evaluate a common intervention such as A9.",

To achieve this, CMOC's are developed and then refined in an iterative, theory-informed process, whereby the use of retroductive reasoning seeks to reveal the underlying causal explanation for observed outcomes. To ensure rigour, investigators should explicitly outline how the research draws on theory to develop CMOCs, which are then tested against the data. Practically, we drew on elements of complexity theory as applied to organisations. Complexity theory provides a language and conceptual framework for thinking about implementation and change dynamics in complex systems [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . It therefore provided a lens to frame our theorising and develop CMOC's which were subsequently refined, augmented, or refuted through analysis of secondary, quantitative A9 data, and qualitative interviews with WFP staff. We used this complexity informed, realist methodology to ask; how did one indicator among a suite of many, become adapted, in such a wide variety of ways, resulting in intended and unanticipated effects?",

As we proceeded, we understood that at the time of its conceptualisation and launch, key WFP staff viewed A9 as an initial move toward meeting its public commitments on collecting disability-related data. The theory gleaning phase also served a practical purpose, as it fostered relationships with WFP staff that facilitated access to A9 data. It was our experience that building this trust contributed to greater openness in subsequent interviews, giving us deeper insight to stakeholders reasoning regarding A9. This phase confirmed our expectation that A9 could serve as a 'ready-made', natural case study as WFP embarked upon standardising the use of disability-related data.",

In our document analysis, we drew on Gear and colleague's [17] use of complexity theory as a qualitative research methodology, to analyse the function of the document, rather than the content. That is, rather than analysing what A9 'said', we focused on what it 'did' as a resource. Other secondary documents helped to elucidate this function by illustrating the broader discourse in which A9 sat, and therefore what needs it might address.

We analysed the sources of the data reported for A9, such as surveys, estimates, etc., as these sources indicated how WFP was using and responding to A9 in practice. Drawing on the realist concept of depth ontology, we focused not on the numbers produced by A9, but at a deeper level, analysed the underlying sources for these numbers, and what this indicated about how A9 was being used (Table 2) . Drawing on aggregated annual country reporting from 88 country offices we analysed whether (a) data pertaining to A9 was reported and if so, (b) the source of the data (e.g., monitoring surveys conducted by the country office itself, secondary data generated by other actors; the accepted global prevalence estimate of 15%, etc.) [22] . A total of 19 participant interviews were conducted as part of the larger realist evaluation of implementation of disability-related data collection efforts in WFP. A subset of these interviews (n = 9) either made unprompted mention of A9 or were iteratively adapted to include questions related to A9. All interviews were conducted remotely and were consistent with the 'teacher-learner' cycle of realist interviews, whereby theories are explicitly shared with the interviewee for comment [15] . The participants included WFP staff in a range of different roles, including protection officers, data specialists, programme managers, and specialist thematic advisors. Interviewees also spanned specific country offices, regional bureaux and global, HQ level staff, providing insight into how different levels of the organization was responding to A9. All interviews were conducted by the lead author and used a semi-structured guide to lead the interview process. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and coding was carried out using NVivo V1.5. [23] . The CMOC's presented below were developed during the theory gleaning phase and were used as the unit of analysis, whilst themselves being iteratively refined through this process.

Although A9 underwent at least one revision in the three years of its operation, as evidenced in WFP's indicator compendium, there was insufficient feedback and corrective action to address the underlying implementation challenges. This inadvertently created a 'cul-de-sac' whereby implementing A9 could stand as a self-contained outcome, i.e., data for data's sake, rather than as an informative step toward inclusive action.

The following quotes illustrate the concerns related to the validity of the data and the need for support: Regional Support Staff: \"But then as I as I just mentioned, in most cases, that numbers just seem so ridiculously low that I would rather remove it, although it's mandatory to report on. But I would rather remove it or just use the 15 percent overall number sort of as a blanket thing... the numbers that the country officers were reporting was so much lower [than the global average] that it almost seemed really ridiculous to report it.\" Programme Manager Staff: \"if you're going to be introducing anything that's new, and this [A9] is going to be really out of the box for pretty much everybody, it cannot come without guidance methodology. How do we really collect this? What is the relevance of it? How do we analyze and interpret it and apply it? So that, I think, has to be there.\" Agents within a system are themselves complex, giving rise to the system's capacity to innovate on the ground and overcome structural gaps [26] . Despite challenges, by its second year of implementation the majority of WFP country offices (CO's) had found ways to report on A9. The secondary data analysis gives an indication of the emergent behaviour in response to A9, demonstrating a variety of reporting sources and interpretations. Some of this variety was expected and encouraged by the A9 methodology itself, which detailed various reporting options. Unanticipated however, was the way in which applying general disability prevalence data to WFP beneficiary tallies implied the proportionate inclusion of this group and would thus have obscured both higher representation due to increased food insecurity and need, or decreased representation, due to difficulties for WFP to identify such households, or for them to access WFP assistance. Table 1 shows the number of WFP CO's reporting on A9, and the total number of beneficiaries with disabilities identified. These reporting sources provide insight to how the users, WFP staff, were responding to and taking up the resource of A9.",

We cannot claim that the CMOC's we elucidated capture all the pertinent, mechanistic elements of implementing data disaggregation across a complex organisation.

This was recognised by the indicator document itself, which laid out alternative reporting methods, but even within this 'sanctioned' variation, unanticipated outcomes arose. The most interesting element here is not the numbers of persons with disabilities reported by A9. Indeed, our first engagement with A9 was in relation to the methodological improvements WFP wished to implement to increase the reliability of the data. Rather, this paper sought to understand how the intervention-regardless of its inherent quality-was operationalised across the system, as \"process data provides a useful explanation of the observed outcome\" [27] .",

A9 was introduced at a time when the humanitariandevelopment context was in flux in terms of DI, and the characteristically short timelines of both funding and implementation across the sector compelled staff to react quickly. This enabled a reductionist approach whereby a linear solution-to count the number of persons with disabilities reached annually, using a simplified, untested adaptation of the Washington Group Questions, was insufficient to achieve the system-state change of inclusivity toward which sector-wide DI efforts ultimately strive. Given that \"a critical feature of all programmes is that, as they are delivered, they are embedded in social systems\" [28] , the success of any intervention is reliant not only upon the merit of that original idea, but also upon the context in which it is implemented. A9 was a means that existed before an ends-it measured one aspect of disability inclusion, before WFP had systematically articulated its intention to become a disability inclusive organization, and thus why the inclusion of persons with disabilities was useful to measure.",

As the context became more favorable to DI overall, the outcomes produced by A9 were increasingly unsatisfactory. A9 did produce data for the majority of WFP's country contexts over multiple years, but over time, counting the number of programme beneficiaries with disabilities was perceived as an insufficient measurement. As this context around A9 shifted, staff responded to and utilisied A9 in multiple ways, but ultimately agents in the system could not overcome the lack of a pathway for A9 data to inform WFP activities through beneficiary targeting or programming design.",

This may have created bias in the interview sample and excluded important perspectives from informing and refining our theorising.

To accommodate this evolution, systems should be flexible enough to allow for innovation to subvert, rearrange or eliminate elements that are obsolete.
