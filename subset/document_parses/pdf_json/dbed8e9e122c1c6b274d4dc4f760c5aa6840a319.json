Until now, no curative therapy has been strongly recommended for COVID-19 except for personalized supportive care. T cells and virus-specific T cells are essential to protect against virus infection, including COVID-19. Delayed immune reconstitution (IR) and cytokine storm (CS) remain serious obstacles for the cure of COVID-19. Most COVID-19",

The percentage of na\u00efve helper T cells (CD3+CD4+CD45RA+) increased while memory helper T cells (CD3+CD4+CD45RO+), CD28 positive cytotoxic suppressor T cells (CD3+CD8+CD28+), and regulatory T cells (CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127low+) decreased in severe cases (10), implying that the immune system in the severe COVID-19 patients was impaired more greatly. However, several reports revealed exhaustive status of T cells. A much higher percentage of Tim3+PD-1+ expressed on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from COVID-19 patients with severe diseases, indicating the exhaustive T cells in response to this virus infection (13, 15, (33) (34) (35) . Moreover, increased expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 on T cells could predict progression from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages of COVID-19 (13) . Compared with the healthy control and mild group, the frequency of multi-functional CD4+ T cells (positive for at least two of cytokines IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2) decreased significantly in the severe cases, whereas the proportion of non-functional subsets (IFN-\u03b3\u2212TNF-\u03b1\u2212IL-2\u2212) increased significantly (35).

Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered lung bronchoalveolar immune cells in patients with COVID-19 (37). CD8+ T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALFs) from patients with severe/critical infection were less expanded, more proliferative and more phenotypically heterogeneous, whereas a larger proportion of CD8+ T cell effectors with tissue-resident and highly expanded features were present in BALFs from patients with moderate infection Accepted Article (37) .

Moreover, males may be more susceptible to COVID-19 than females (38-40). Females experience a lower risk of infections and chronic inflammatory disease but are generally more vulnerable to autoimmunity (41). As the ACE2 gene localizes on the X-chromosome, ACE2 levels in the blood are higher in males than in females as well as in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular diseases (42). Therefore, male patients may be more likely to die from COVID-19 because of the high expression of ACE2, though further research on the mechanism is needed.

CS is thought to be an overwhelming immune reaction mediated by immune toxicity. The clinical symptoms and signs of CS affect multiple organ systems, among which acute lung injury is a typical product of damages in the lung alveoli and can progress into respiratory failure (47).

A triad of IP-10, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6, anticipate subsequent clinical progression of COVID-19 (55). Lung macrophages in severe patients with COVID-19 may contribute to local inflammation by recruiting inflammatory monocytic cells and neutrophils (37). Levels of cytokine in severe patients with COVID-19 surviving the disease gradually restored to levels comparable to the mild cases (13, 17) . It is noted that C-reactive protein, ferritin, and neutrophil counts were considerably higher in severe patients than moderate patients, while eosinopenia appeared in the majority of COVID-19 patients (10, 15, 39, 56). Furthermore, the dynamic changes of T cell counts are reversely correlated with the dynamic changes of most cytokine levels in the peripheral blood in severe COVID-19 patients (17, 57) .",

Due to the role of IL-6 in disease pathology, the selective blockade of IL-6 signaling by the IL-6 receptor antagonist or anti-IL-6 antibody has been the backbone of CS remedy, resulting in rapid relief of CS symptoms within a few hours. Interestingly, it appears that IL-6 blockade does not suppress CAR-T cell function in humans and mice and does not impact prognosis (60-63), which may be helpful for not hurting potential anti-virus immunity in patients with COVID-19. Several reports worldwide emphasized elevated plasma concentrations of IL-6 and provided a rationale for the introduction of anti-IL-6 therapies in randomized clinical trials (64) (65) (66) (67) (68) (69) (70) .

The evidence in support of the administrating corticosteroids in COVID-19 is inconclusive (76) (77) (78) , but experiences from China recommend corticosteroids treatment to be an adjuvant therapy for critically ill patients with COVID-19 at a low-to-moderate dose and short term (methylprednisolone 0.5-1/mg/kg/day, 3-5 days or shorter than 10 days) (79-82). Furthermore, pathological pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation indicate corticosteroids should be used timely and appropriately for severe patients with COVID-19 to prevent the occurrence of ARDS (36). The RECOVERY Collaborative Group reported that the use of dexamethasone (oral or intravenous dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for up to 10 days, or until hospital discharge if sooner) resulted in lower 28-day mortality among patients receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support (83). Bruno M. Tomazini et al. supported that dexamethasone (dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously once daily for 5 days, followed by 10 mg intravenously once daily for additional 5 days or until ICU discharge) plus standard care resulted in longer days alive and free of mechanical ventilation over 28 days for COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS (84). It suggests that corticosteroids should be applied to patients with severe cases of COVID-19, especially for those requiring respiratory support.",

Hypoplastic bone marrow and decreased numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration, and necrosis in the spleen were found pathologically in three COVID-19 cases (97, 98). Hyperactivation of T cells or high levels of expression of pro-apoptotic molecules, such as FAS (also known as CD95)8, or TRAIL, could also contribute to T cell depletion (33). SARS-CoV-2 infects T lymphocytes through its spike protein-mediated membrane fusion (99), although whether the infection induces apoptosis in T cells still need further research. T cell counts in surviving patients with severe COVID-19 gradually recovered to levels comparable to the mild cases (13, 16, 17) . Fang Gong et al. comprehensively analyzed circulating CD4+ T cells of 13 COVID-19 convalescent patients (100). They found that more severe individuals showed higher frequency of TEM and TFH-EM cells but a lower frequency of TCM, TFH-CM and TNaive cells, relative to mild and moderate patients. Immune reconstitution (IR), marked by an increase in T cell number, is the most crucial process that takes place in COVID-19 patients after treatment. Enhancing immune reconstitution, in particular COVID-19 specific T cells, therefore, is an area of urgent research.",

These cytokines could function in T-cell differentiation into effector cells and T-, B-, and NK-cell proliferation. However, early T-cell immunity through peripheral expansion is almost unavailable on account of a substantially limited T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity for this novel coronavirus, as thymopoiesis could mainly supply new TCR clones in naive T cells.",
