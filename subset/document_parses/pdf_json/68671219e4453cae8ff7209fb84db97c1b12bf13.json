Editor: Edmundo Calva ABSTRACT A distinct difference between veterinary and human medicine is the routine use of antimicrobial mass medications (prophylaxis, metaphylaxis) to healthy individuals. The need for antimicrobial mass medications is based on beliefs that group/s of animals will contract a bacterial disease (i.e. morbidity) and/or die (i.e. mortality). Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) represents the major indication for cattle antimicrobials worldwide. The objectives were to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) for naturally occurring BRD investigating antimicrobial prophylaxis/metaphylaxis to prevent morbidity/mortality. In total, 58 publications met the inclusion criteria summarizing 169 individual RCTs, spanning 50 years . Antimicrobial prophylaxis and metaphylaxis demonstrated moderate, yet highly variable relative risk reductions in BRD morbidity. These were dependent on the antimicrobial classes used, dependent on metaphylaxis definition, BRD attack rates and duration of the RCTs. Best relative risk reductions were from broad-spectrum critically important antimicrobials, or combinations. BRD prophylaxis/metaphylaxis represents major antimicrobial consumption for highly variable short-term gains in absolute risk reduction of morbidity/mortality. Despite widespread use of prevention products, the need for antimicrobial mass medications should be re-evaluated since the underlying problem is more likely the segmented infrastructure of the feedlot and veal calf industries compared to the disease itself.",

These viruses trigger BRD by damaging upper respiratory tract mucosa and/or modifying host pro-and anti-inflammatory immune responses. Bacterial BRD pathogens include Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Mycoplasma dispar and M. bovis that exist commonly as commensals, often as biofilms within the upper respiratory tract and tonsils.",

This is subjective, non-standardised but the typical basis for deciding on further antimicrobials treatments, or combined with rectal temperature, although bovine fever thresholds vary throughout the scientific literature (Ives and Richeson 2015) . Comparing BRD field diagnostics to pulmonary lesions evident at slaughter reveals several cattle (e.g. >50%) with lung lesions, not previously identified and treated for BRD (Thompson, Stone and Schultheiss 2006; Tennant et al. 2014) . These limitations contribute largely to the justification for routine antimicrobial prophylaxis/metaphylaxis in place of identifying, pulling and treating sick calves/cattle. The culmination of stressors (e.g. recently weaned, auctioned, transported, environmental/nutritional changes, co-mingling, castrated) results in each cohort of feedlot cattle/veal calves expressing the majority of visual BRD cases (up to 90%) within the first 27 days after arrival (Edwards 1996; Buhman et al. 2000) .",

Antimicrobials were approved for growth promotion in the USA since 1949 and since 1953 in the UK (Swann 1969) . However, mounting evidence about antimicrobial resistance and transference of resistance genes from animal to human microbiota led to a full withdrawal of antimicrobial growth promoters in the European Union, since 2006 (Regulation 1831 . The European support to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization or Animal Health for a ban on antimicrobial growth promoters has encouraged other countries to follow (e.g. Canada, USA, South Korea). Since the ban, then antimicrobial 'mass medications' for the purposes of disease prevention has become the most common use in healthy food animals. Different terms describe 'mass medication' concepts in food animals, such as prophylaxis, prevention and metaphylaxis. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for BRD first appeared in the scientific literature in the 1950s (King et al. 1955) , and metaphylaxis appeared later in the 1980s. Both concepts are believed to still be heavily used, but exact consumption figures for food animal antimicrobial mass medications are largely unknown.",

Now, others re-define 'metaphylaxis' as mass medication of healthy animals when the disease of interest is present within the group/flock/herd (EMA 2016) . Others define as, 'Metaphylaxis is indicated for high-risk individuals, when the number of clinical cases within a group reaches a threshold, the remainder of the in-contact animals are treated simultaneously in order to restrict the spread and impact of the disease' (Lees and Shojaee Aliabadi 2002) . According to Edwards (2010) and Smith et al. (2001) , the criterion for antimicrobial metaphylaxis occurs when morbidity (i.e. attack rate) exceeds 10% for two to three consecutive days. Thus, prophylaxis/prevention and metaphylaxis involves administering antimicrobials to 'healthy' individuals to 'prevent' infections, but for prophylaxis/prevention there is a perceived 'risk', whereas metaphylaxis could be a definable 'hazard'.",

Many food animal antimicrobial VMP formulations are designed for easy mass medication, for dissemination in either bulk animal feed or common drinking water. Since it is considered 'inconvenient' or impractical to separate diseased from healthy animals, under intensive livestock production conditions, then routine prophylaxis/metaphylaxis is employed commonly, even if unintended. For example, assuming antimicrobial VMPs for dissemination in either bulk animal feed or drinking water are preferred for prophylaxis/metaphylaxis (e.g. premixes, oral powders/granules/solutions for drinking water) then European data (29 countries for 2014: overall sales = 9,009.5 tonnes of active ingredient of antimicrobials) reveals just over 90% of antimicrobial sales reported, in mg/PCU (Population correction unit, in 1,000 tonnes : The estimated weight at treatment of livestock and of slaughter animals.), were these VMP formulations (ESVAC 2016).

The need for antimicrobial mass medications is based on beliefs that a group/s of animals (especially newly received, stressed) will contract a major bacterial disease (i.e. morbidity) and/or die (i.e. mortality), resulting in economic and welfare consequences. Ancillary benefits are better average daily weight gains (i.e. growth promotion) and belief that less antimicrobial treatments are required later in the production cycle (i.e. reduced labour costs). Given the growing recognition of the one health agenda that animal and human systems are connected, it is relevant to better understand/question the original scientific evidence for antimicrobial prophylaxis/metaphylaxis in food animals to reduce morbidity and mortality from bacterial diseases.

The majority of publications described a uniform processing of cattle/calves upon arrival to the test facility, including injections with a variety of vaccines, vitamin products, dewormers and occasionally other products (e.g. growth implants). Afterwards, cattle were separated into treatment and control groups. These were considered typical field conditions for introduction of calves into feedlots and veal calf operations.",

            "text": "Aetiologies for BRD outbreaks are founded in physiological, management and environmental factors in conjunction with viral and bacterial infectious agents. Genetic selection has resulted in domesticated cattle with small lungs relative to their metabolic demands, contributing to decreased respiratory compensation, particularly during periods of exertion or disease (Weekly and Veit 1995) . Generally, high-risk calves/cattle are typically lightweight, recently weaned, highly co-mingled, or of auction market origin, extended transport times and unknown health/vaccination history. Despite widespread use of vaccines and antimicrobial mass medications, a sobering picture has suggested limited progress in North America to reduce the impact of BRD over the last 10-20 years (Hilton 2014) . National Animal Health Monitoring System data show an increase in BRD feedlot mortality from 1.03% in 1994 to 1.6% in 2011, despite \u223c16% were treated for BRD and up to 31% received prophylactic antimicrobials on arrival. Dairy heifer rearing data showed that 18.1% of pre-weaned dairy heifers were treated for BRD, including a BRD mortality of 2.3% (Dargatz 2014) . Other data reveal that feedlot mortality increased by 0.05% per year over the last 13 years (Engler 2014) . The reaction has been an increasing reliance on antimicrobial prophylaxis and/or metaphylaxis to control BRD, but the need for mass medications is more driven by the antiquated structure of the feedlot and veal calf industries compared to the disease itself. A major obstacle to control BRD remains the segmented infrastructure of these industries, as relatively unchanged for several decades (Ives and Richeson 2015) . Calves/cattle progress through the production phase, changing ownership at any and all points, resulting in transporting, co-mingling from various sources, minimal biosecurity and other stressors, providing ample opportunity for immunosuppression and pathogen colonisation of the lower respiratory tract. It has been estimated the average number of middle men between the cattle rancher and the consumer is 15 (Ives and Richeson 2015) . Cattle can be transported between two to five times throughout their lifetime, resulting in degrees of dehydration, physiologic stress and environmental/nutritional changes. This persistent infrastructure also impedes alternatives to antimicrobial mass medications, since the major BRD predisposition factors are present at the time of arrival to the facilities.",

A recently published study using a hierarchical Bayesian latent class metaanalysis comparing BRD clinical signs to slaughter lung lesions revealed an estimated predicted diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 0.27 (95% CI = 0.01-0.96) and 0.92 (0.14-1.00), respectively (Timsit et al. 2016) . There was much variability between studies due to different criteria for visual BRD diagnosis. This variability is further influenced by the number of cattle to be managed per employee, at large facilities. For example, the reported average number of cattle at high risk of developing BRD to be managed per employee at feedlots increased from 2739 to 3464 head between 2009 and 2014, in the USA and Canada (Lee et al. 2015) . The relevance of the RCTs from this systematic review and meta-analysis also reflects the decisionmaking criteria of producers, since every identified BRD case was further treated with antimicrobials. Based on NNT (Fig 4) , antimicrobial mass medications had a minor effect on either reducing BRD morbidity risk or affecting the decision-making process for using further treatment antimicrobials. For example, the NNT median was 7.27, or an approximate 14% reduction in ARR. Pharmaco-economic benefits only occurred at high attack rates (e.g. \u226550%) where benefits were also variable between RCTs.",

Consensus statements exist for design specifications of clinical trials (e.g. CONSORT-Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials), but the REFLECT statement for livestock clinical trials was not published until 2010 (O'Connor et al. 2010a) . Generally, veterinary RCTs lag behind human RCTs in quantity and quality study design features (e.g. blinding, description of randomisation, saline-treated placebo). Other limitations found in this investigation included a lack of RCTs for certain antimicrobial classes and metaphylaxis definitions. Certain types of beef production systems were under-represented (e.g. veal calves). Also, not all types of non-CIAs were represented by RCTs. More long-term studies could have better confirmed the declining benefits of initial antimicrobial mass medications. Significant explanatory variables were identified, but heterogeneity remained high in the models, due to the diversity of issues explored. Also, this heterogeneity further reflects the lack of foresight of old fashion practices of antimicrobial mass medication, based on beliefs of non-standardised risks without knowledge of the type/s of pathogens involved or antimicrobial susceptibilities. Like other food animal diseases, BRD is a disease complex encompassing multiple pathogens, and combined with a lack of foresight, will thus attract broad-spectrum antimicrobials for its successful prevention.",

Aspects of these results could fit concepts expressed in mathematical models of infectious disease transmission. BRD demonstrated disease patterns of low to high morbidity but consistently low mortality. Eventually, saturation (the resulting decline in the number of susceptible individuals to infection) occurs over time (up to 90 days for BRD) with more stable population dynamics (Grassly and Fraser 2008) . The broad range of attack rates from RCTs reflects field variations in infectiousness (characteristics of infected individuals that determines the rate of spread to the susceptible population that can be broken down into biological, behavioural and environmental components) and susceptibility (biological, behavioural and environmental) of cohorts of cattle. For example, at low attack rates (<15%), the basic reproduction number (R o ) (the expected number of secondary infections resulting from infected individual/s in a population. Mathematical models typically incorporate variables that describe the probability of transmission per animal contact, the number of contacts with the infectious animal per unit time and the duration animal/s are infectious.) is sufficiently low (<1) based on a small offspring distribution (the number of secondary infections as a function of infectiousness over time) that does not economically justify prior antimicrobial mass medications (based on NNT). Under these circumstances, the disease could die out (R o < 1) or become endemic (R o = 1), but unlikely to progress to an epidemic (R o > 1). A morbidity threshold does exist where antimicrobial mass medications provided more consistent reductions in morbidity risk (Figs 2 and 3) , but negligible effect on mortality (Fig. 5b) . This is broadly consistent with general observations that a disproportionate amount of disease transmission results from a small fraction of infected individuals (Grassly and Fraser 2008) . The random effects among individuals tend to cancel each other out as the number of infected individuals increases, resulting in a more predictable progression to epidemic dynamics. Antimicrobial mass medications represent the main intervention for BRD (i.e. R o -1) to prevent/control an epidemic. The results of this investigation revealed that the impact of this intervention was influenced by the duration of the RCTs. For example, the highest impact clustered with only short and small RCTs (\u226430 days) (Fig. 5) , with progressively less impact over longer and larger RCTs. Longer RCTs better reflect feedlot/veal facilities, since cattle are typically kept for months. Also, high variability from antimicrobial interventions reflects the complex BRD infectious disease dynamics, where the likelihood of each of three possible outcome population scenarios (endemic, epidemic, disease die out) is dependent on factors, including:",

(WHO 2001) . This includes an accurate diagnosis, short-term effective first antimicrobial professional prescriptions based on microbial sensitivity or proven efficacy (RCTs, safety, PK/PD, spectrum of activity) and low impact on selecting antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. BRD antimicrobial mass medications fails in aspects of prudent use in that the disease to prevent is poorly distinguishable from primary viral or cases with lung lesions, and without knowledge of inciting pathogen/s or microbial sensitivity. This systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs revealed that antimicrobial mass medications lead to a mean overall relative reduction in disease burden but did not economically lower the absolute risk for either displaying visual BRD symptoms or being selected for further antimicrobial treatments. Best relative risk reductions were primarily with broad-spectrum critically important antimicrobial classes. Metaphylaxis has a similar impact as prophylaxis, but the potential for lower antimicrobial consumption with an appropriate morbidity threshold definition that eliminates the least efficient (highest NNT) possibilities and prevents an epidemic. Prophylaxis/metaphylaxis for BRD represents major antimicrobial consumption for highly variable short-term gains in ARR, whereas RCTs of longer duration (e.g. >30 days) show progressive dampened variable ARR. Antimicrobial mass medications can also be associated with negligible improvements or worsened BRD morbidity/mortality.",
