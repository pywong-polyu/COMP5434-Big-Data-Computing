The quality of all prevalence studies was independently assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist. In addition, we assessing the quality of included studies involved with the impact of cardiac injury by Newcastle-Ottawa quality scale (NOS), which entailed evaluations of the selection of cohorts, the comparability of cohorts, and the assessment of outcome. In this meta-analysis, we defined studies with an NOS of \u22656 stars as moderate to high-quality studies; studies which lower scores were defined as low-quality studies. 26, 27 Two researchers discussed the topics during several face-to-face and web-based meetings. ware. The exact binomial (Clopper-Pearson) method was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Estimates were normalized using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. We selected a random effects model to evaluate summary prevalence. The effect measurement estimate of mortality risk chosen was the odds ratio (ORs) in our study. Risk ratio and hazard ratio in other studies were considered to be OR, as OR was shown to be a more effective measure. 28 If not available, the ORs were calculated by events and total numbers of patients in two groups. The natural logarithm of the OR (log [OR]) and its standard error (SElog [OR]) were calculated and then pooled using statistical software. Cochran's chi-square test and I 2 statistic were used to evaluate the heterogeneity among the included studies. I 2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were considered to represent low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively. 29, 30 The statistical significance threshold was set at p < .05.",

However, although with number changes, the positive association between cardiac injury and death was still persisted when excluding the unadjusted studies, which showed the robustness of our conclusion. Second, the definition of the cardiac injury differed across the included trials and potentially affected the findings. Third, the majority of studies are from China, the studies involved with the prevalence and impact of cardiac injury on COVID-19 is needing to confirm this conclusion. Fourth, high heterogeneity existed across studies in some comparisons, limiting the interpreting on the results, however, we attempted to account for this by using a random effect model to make our results more conservable. The precise number for the type of cardiac injury is lacking, therefore, we cannot evaluate the association between type of cardiac involvement and adverse prognosis.

Moreover, cardiac injury was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. and coronary heart disease, are the common comorbidity in patients with COVID-19. Those patients with cardiovascular comorbidity are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Those cardiovascular comorbidities may be related to cardiac injury in COVID-19. Recent evidence 33 also showed that COVID-19 can damage the heart directly.mal TnT levels had a relatively favorable outcome. Therefore, the uses of serum troponin testing may be a potential tool to facilitate risk stratification, help make decisions among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These results might call out the patients with induction of cardiac injury, more attention, prioritized treatment and even more aggressive treatment strategies should be reasonable. Although up to date, until now, no specific antiviral drugs have been recommended for COVID-19, Dexamethasone38 and Remdesivir 39 might be applied. The dexamethasone was reported be able to reduce the death 38 and the Remdesivir was showed to reduce the length of hospital stay.39 Elevated serum troponin concentrations are the hallmark of cardiac injury, including but not limited to myocardial infarction.5 The high prevalence of cardiac injury may increase the need for cardiology consultation. Interpretation of cardiac injury requires cautiously. In patients with COVID-19, the phenotypes of myocardial injury in COVID-19 include viral myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, tachyarrhythmia, coronary microvascular ischemia, pulmonary embolism, type 1 myocardial infarction, and type 2 myocardial infarction.40 The phenotypes of cardiac injury must be elucidated according to clinical scenarios. According to latest guideline, minority of patients with cardiac injury is diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction. In a case series of 18 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography, 10 patients underwent coronary angiography, of whom two thirds had nonobstructive disease.41 Hence, we need to take together with clinical information, electrocardiogram, cardiac echocardiography, coronary angiography, and cardiac MRI to assess the cause of cardiac injury.",
