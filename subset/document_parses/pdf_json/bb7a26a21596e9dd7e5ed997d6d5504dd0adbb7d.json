Diabetes self-management, which plays an important role in glycaemic control and reducing the risk of acute and long-term complications, may be discouraged by social distancing. Purpose: To evaluate the level of self-management activities in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients and Methods: A survey of with 872 patients with T2DM in the inpatient and outpatient departments through face-to-face interviews was conducted from 1 July, 2020 to 30 September, 2020. The main outcome measures were glycaemic control status and level of self-management activities during the pandemic. Results: In terms of glycaemic control, the data showed that patients with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 7.0 mmol/L (36.4%), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) < 10.0 mmol/L (26.3%), or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) < 7.0% (18.6%) in our investigation has well-controlled blood glucose level, and 11.9% of patients experienced blood glucose <3.9 mmol/L during the outbreak. The diabetes self-management of Chinese patients decreased and the final diabetes self-management score of the Chinese patients was 3.4 \u00b1 1.45. Patients with higher education, diabetes education, comorbidities, and online consultations had higher diabetes selfmanagement scores (P <0.05). Adherence to diabetes self-management in the normal glycaemic control group was higher than that in the substandard glycaemic control group (P<0.05). Among all participants, 72.1% of the patients reduced the frequency of hospital visits, and 44.8% considered that they had diabetes-related stress during the pandemic. The mean anxiety level score rated by 286 patients was 5.3\u00b12.8. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected diabetes self-management, including substandard glycemic control, increased diabetes-related stress, limited exercise range and medical visits. Therefore, future interventions should focus on the online management of chronic diseases and support online consultation' development and promotion, which can overcome physical distance and provide personalized services conveniently.",

Diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, the prevalence of diabetes among Chinese adults has risen to 12.8%. 3 It has been reported that people with diabetes are more likely to be infected 4 and reach the composite end-points 5,6 because patients with diabetes have the problem of immunity decline, 7 acting on phagocytosis, chemotaxis, the bactericidal activity of neutrophils and macrophages. 8 However well-controlled blood glucose can improve the prognosis. 6 According to the latest diabetes prevention and treatment guidelines issued by the National Diabetes Association, self-management education for patients with diabetes is the key to reducing the risk of acute and long-term complications. 9 Self-management consists of adherence behaviors such as dietary changes, exercise, self-monitoring of blood glucose, regular self-medication and follow-up. Diabetes self-management in Chinese patients with T2DM is suboptimal. Studies have shown that the average score of diabetes self-management in Chinese people with T2DM was nearly half of the total possible score. 10 With the spread of novel coronavirus continuously and rapidly, China has instituted some measures to achieve social distancing, which may lead to more unsatisfactory diabetes selfmanagement. A study from Spain found that consumption of sugary foods and snacks increased and physical activity dropped significantly during the COVID-19 lockdown. 11 But nearly half of all respondents from a Polish study stated that their diabetes self-management had significantly improved. 12 The current situation of self-management of patients with diabetes during the pandemic lacks a relevant data and sufficient evidence in China. Therefore, we designed a questionnaire to determine how Chinese patients with diabetes coped and adjusted during the pandemic period.",

To reduce the risk of infection and transmission of COVID-19, social distancing, travel restrictions, stay-at-home guidance, and quarantine practices are required, which may worsen glycaemic control, reduce the frequency of exercise, change routine clinical follow-ups, and increase diabetes-related stress. A previous study interviewed 12 patients with T2DM during isolation in Wuhan, China, and found that they had barriers to diabetes self-management, including lack of resources and knowledge. 16 The average score of diabetes self-management in Chinese people with T2DM during the pandemic was lower than before. 10 According to this study, we found that glucose control was generally substandard during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than half of the patients' FPG, PPG, and HbA1c were not up to the standard, which is similar to previous reports in Wuhan. 17 It was well-known that glucose control was associated with diabetes management. 18 Compared with patients with few self-management scores, patients with more self-management scores had better glycaemic control. However, among the 872 participants in this study, most had less overall practice in diabetes self-management, especially in complications and blood glucose monitoring, which is similar to previous studies. 19 Owing to these official control measures for COVID-19, some patients with T2DM have experienced difficulty in diabetes self-management. Social quarantine and lockdowns had limited physical activity. This study showed that the mean score of the exercise was 3.4 \u00b1 2.5 on a scale of 0 to 7 during the pandemic, which means exercise was inadequate and may lead to deterioration in glycaemic control. It is known that regular physical activity has significant physical and psychological benefits. 20 More people reported that they preferred to take a walk near their home or exercise at home because of the limitation of activity scope. A brief survey published in a Polish study showed a statistically significant increase in the number of walks taken by patients with diabetes during this period. 12 Therefore, during the outbreak, we can guide people with diabetes to perform appropriate exercises at home, such as walking and doing housework, or promote some simple and suitable exercise gymnastics that do not require too much space.",

The participants who refused to consult online in our survey explained that they were inexperienced in using the online platform and got used for traditional in-person visits. Therefore, broader access to digital health, and patient training, and simplifying procedures are the next priorities. Otherwise, the tool meant to bring convenience, will also become another burden. 26 At the same time, although there are various applications for diabetes self-management, they have not been designed perfectly and tested rigorously; thus, both patients and clinicians do not have direct evidence to guide them in their choice. More importantly, device manufacturers are reluctant to interoperate with third-party devices because they do not want to risk losing their exclusivity. 21 Previous studies have shown a significant increase in common and diabetes-related stress in adults with T2DM compared with pre-pandemic levels, 27 associated with the emergence of the pandemic and not knowing how to make appropriate adjustments in time. The results of our study revealed that 44.8% of the participants reported the presence of diabetes-related stress during the pandemic. Similar to this study, diabetes-related stress may be related to the change in diabetes management in previous studies, affecting blood glucose control. 28 It was reported that higher levels of depression are associated with decreased quality of life, unhealthy diets, and lack of physical activity. 29 These aspects are also the influence by the novel coronavirus pandemic in our lives. Several reports have suggested that aggressive interventions should be undertaken, including increasing online consultation and establishing connections with the healthcare community. 30 It is difficult to deny that something like the novel coronavirus will happen again. Furthermore, with the rise of diabetes prevalence, the diabetes community will increasingly face public health challenges in the following days, 31 impacting the traditional diagnosis and treatment mode and chronic disease management model, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 32 and 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. 33 Because of the new dawn that the diagnosis and treatment line has brought to chronic disease management during the pandemic, we think it is necessary to develop online consultation.",
