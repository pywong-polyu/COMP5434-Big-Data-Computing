However, their epidemiological impact has not been adequately assessed, leaving policymakers with limited information for making evidence-based decisions on these types of events in the rapidly evolving scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides organizational differences in the deployment of preventive measures, important unknowns exist that are key for the success of these preventive strategies. First, the negative predictive value of Ag-RDT drops with increasing local incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6 potentially affecting the performance of Ag-RDT-based screenings. Second, preliminary evidence on this strategy was gathered before the emergence of the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, with significantly higher transmissibility than early circulating variants and currently dominant in many countries worldwide. 11 In this study, we retrospectively assessed the COVID-19 incidence associated with two large music festivals (capacity for over 10,000 people), which applied similar prevention strategies based on point-ofcare Ag-RDT screening and mask-wearing, and were held during the fifth wave of transmission -predominantly caused by the delta SARS-CoV-2 variant -in Catalonia (North-East Spain). 12 ",

At the second festival, eating and drinking was not allowed in the area in front of the stage, where organization staff oversaw the event and warned people not wearing the mask. Attendees were allowed to move around without restrictions and no social distancing measures were in place. Regarding Ag-RDT screening, attendees to both festivals had to make an appointment for the same day of the entrance and pay for the Ag-RDT, performed by trained staff. However, the two festivals differed in the organization of Ag-RDT screening (Supplementary Appendix 1). Table S1 (Supplementary appendix 1) provides an estimate of the expected negative predictive value associated with Ag-RDT screening for a range of local prevalence values (i.e., pre-test probabilities). Figure 1 . Progression of cumulative weekly cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 inhabitants before and after the events in Catalonia. Event dates are indicated with yellow bands; the first festival was held on 03 July and the second from 08 July to 10 July, 2021. The progressive role out of vaccination campaigns to younger individuals is indicated. Selected policies regarding the use of the face mask and other COVID-19 preventive measures are indicated. Incidence data was obtained from the public repository https://dadescovid.cat. a The time points indicate only the starting date of vaccination campaigns for each age group. Healthcare and other essential workers of all ages were vaccinated during the first semester of 2021, before the indicated date for their corresponding age group.",

The influence of baseline and behaviour factors was investigated using a logistic regression model for reporting a positive COVID-19 result within 3 to 10 days following the event, based on the electronic health records and survey-collected data. The model included age, gender, vaccination level, and previous infection record in each of the two study populations: the overall sample of attendees for each event and the sample of respondents to the post-event survey. In addition, for the post-event survey sample, we added the use of the mask, the degree of compliance with protection measures, and the number of days attending the event.

Additionally, behavioural factors such as complying with the overall preventive measures and mask-wearing (all the time or most of the time, corresponding to the two highest scores on the 5-point scale) also reduced the odds of COVID-19. Although the variables \"mask-wearing\" and \"compliance with the Table S4 . overall preventive measures\" showed a positive correlation (rho=0.23), the nested version excluding any of the two variables did not improve the model fit ( Figure S2 ). Another variable pair with important correlation included the vaccination status and age (rho=0.35), presumably due to the age-driven rollout of vaccination campaigns (Figure 1 ). Each additional attended day significantly increased risk of experiencing COVID-19 by 1.14. Considering that all participants attended the event at least one day, a RR of 1.14 and 1.30 were associated with attending the festival two days (i.e., one additional day) and the entire festival (i.e., two additional days), respectively.",

We also found that previous COVID-19 infection, vaccination, adequate maskwearing, and following general recommendations for preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread were significantly associated with a lower risk of COVID-19.

[17] [18] [19] [20] The effectiveness of face maskwearing and Ag-RDT testing for preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread in this type of events had been suggested in previous experiences, which could not show an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. [8] [9] [10] However, these previous studies were conducted during periods of low COVID-19 incidence in the background population, thus resulting in an overall limited number of cases. The festivals included in our study were held in a moment of notably higher background incidence in the area: 620-to-658 7-day cumulative COVID-19 incidence per 100,000 inhabitants by the time of the outdoor events investigated vs. the 96-to-132 range reported in previous assessments of the impact of massgathering indoor events. [8] [9] [10] The higher transmission in the outdoor events included in our study highlights the relevance of the background COVID-19 incidence regarding the safety of mass-gathering events, which could be compromised by the sharp increase on the number of false negative results of Ag-RDTs with increasing local prevalence (i.e., pre-test probability) (Table S1, Supplementary Appendix 1). 21 One of the benefits from the Ag-RDT screening strategy was the identification of a remarkable number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, which was close to the absolute excess cases in one of the festivals. The screening effectiveness was clearly manifested by a lower risk of experiencing COVID-19 within the first 3 days following the event among attendees compared controls. Therefore, the identification and possibility of contact-tracing and quarantine of these cases that would be otherwise unnoticed should also be considered when appraising the overall impact of these events in the pandemic course. Likewise, other factors such as clinical severity (likely associated with the individual profile), psychological, social, and economic wellbeing of these events should be considered.",

Although positive experiences with these types of events have been conducted elsewhere, incidence data after the event is often reported in press releases, with little certainty of accuracy, 22\u221224 or descriptive studies without formal comparison with non-attendees that allow estimating the actual risk associated with the event. 9,25 On the one hand, the population-based control-matched approach constrained our study sample to individuals with available data on the vaccination status and basic demographic information in administrative health records, warranting high exhaustivity and representativeness of the datasets. Although the high number of individuals included in the analysis (45,622 overall) provides confidence in our risk estimates, this approach limited the analysis sample, which excluded attendees without information in the central Healthcare Registry (presumably non-Catalan individuals) and those without individuals in the general population meeting the matching criteria. Another limitation of our populationbased analysis was the unfeasibility of considering behavioural or socioeconomic characteristics for the pairing. Although the immunity status is expected to be the most relevant factor for COVID-19, virus transmission may also be influenced by social behaviours, health awareness, fulfilling of public health recommendations, and factors related to the socioeconomic status, including the place of residence, profession, or household occupation. 26, 27 Besides the population-based control-matched analysis, we collected behavioural information in one of the two investigated events. The post-event survey showed that wearing a face mask and complying with protective measures most of the time was independently associated with a lower risk of COVID-19. Attending two or three days to a multiday festival also increased the risk of COVID-19 by 14% and 30%, respectively. The results from the post-event anonymous survey must be read in the context of the limited and not randomized sample of respondents, who were biased towards older-, femaleand 3-days attendees. The positivity rate among survey responders also indicated that positive cases were more likely to answer. Thus, results from this analysis could be affected by these confounding factors. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the recall bias (i.e., inaccurate recollection of events by respondents) and social desirability bias (i.e., a tendency to give a favourable view of one's self). 28 Nevertheless, anonymity, the high number of respondents (over 13,000 individuals), and the consistency of the results with previous evidence regarding the use of masks in crowded outdoor environments 29 support the importance of this measure in preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread in mass-gathering events.",

For Survey analysis, gender was self-reported. b Categories of the COVID-19 immunity status were as follows: fully protected (i.e., had received the complete vaccination regimen or one vaccine dose among individuals with a history of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection), partially protected (i.e., either a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection without a vaccine, one dose of a two-dose regimen vaccine, or a complete vaccination regimen <14 days before the event), and unprotected (i.e., unvaccinated with no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection).SD: Standard deviation.",
