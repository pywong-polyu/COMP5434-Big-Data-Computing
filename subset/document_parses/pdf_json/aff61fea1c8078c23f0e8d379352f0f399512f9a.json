This meta-review applied a structured search of ten databases from 2006 to 2020, revealing 21 relevant systematic reviews, encompassing 332 publications. Interventions delivered via videoconferencing (17%), electronic healthcare records (16%) and phone (13%) were most frequently described in studies within reviews. DHIs were typically used in palliative care for education (20%), symptom management (15%), decision-making (13%), information provision or management (13%) and communication (9%). Across all reviews, mostly positive impacts were reported on education, information sharing, decision-making, communication and costs. Impacts on quality of life and physical and psychological symptoms were inconclusive. Applying AMSTAR 2 criteria, most reviews were judged as low quality as they lacked a protocol or did not consider risk of bias, so findings need to be interpreted with caution.",

Palliative care offers a holistic set of approaches for ameliorating the physical, psychological, social and spiritual burdens that patients and their families can face when dealing with the challenges associated with advanced progressive incurable illness, end of life and bereavement 1,2 . It prevents and relieves suffering through early identification, assessment and symptom management; including addressing practical needs and providing bereavement support. Digital health interventions (DHIs) in palliative care need to address the holistic needs and preferences of people with deteriorating health; and maintain patient-professional relationships that are dignity-enhancing and focused on patient and caregiver values and goals 3 . Improving access to, and increasing the quality of palliative care delivered is a healthcare priority in many countries 4, 5 . DHIs could have an essential role to play in achieving these aims.",

It encompasses a range of related concepts such as telemedicine and telehealth, mobile health (mHealth), health informatics and wearable devices 6, 7 . The adoption of digital health technologies is rapidly changing how healthcare is provided. Electronic health records (EHRs) and decision support tools are part of routine healthcare practice in many countries, while the use of videoconferencing to provide care at a distance is becoming more common. Mobile phones, apps, wearables and social media are in widespread use by citizens/patients, and innovations such as augmented reality, virtual assistants and artificial intelligence (AI) are finding new uses in clinical management and patient self-care. These approaches are reshaping healthcare as they become more affordable and widespread 3 .",

Level 1 represented study designs typically considered to offer the strongest evidence and Level 4 the weakest. Only 12% of publications were Level 1. Of the 43 publications describing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 29 were unspecified trials, 13 were pilot or feasibility trials and one was a Phase II trial.

At least one of the AMSTAR 2 'critical domains' was missing from all Table 3) , and overall quality of all other reviews was rated low (n = 15) or very low (n = 5) because of this. Only three systematic reviews referred to a study protocol or specific guide developed prior to the conduct of the review 22, 33, 35 . Most (n = 13) did not consider risk of bias. All were judged to have partially conducted a comprehensive literature review, though none had searched all sources identified in the AMSTAR 2 constituting a fully comprehensive search. Most reviews provided a satisfactory explanation for the heterogeneity of findings in their discussion (n = 17). Of the non-critical domains, none of the reviews explicitly defined all components of PICO when describing the research question, few provided a list of excluded studies (n = 3) and only one-third used a satisfactory technique for analysing risk of bias in individual studies. Most conducted study selection and data extraction in duplicate, reported sources of funding and potential conflicts of interest. Meta-analysis was not conducted in any review due to the heterogeneity of included study designs and outcomes. Eleven systematic reviews assessed the quality of evidence of included publications 10, 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 26, 30, [33] [34] [35] . Four used the Cochrane risk of bias tool 18, 26, 30, 34 .

Educational interventions were delivered via online learning for professionals 15, 18, 23, 26 , videoconferencing for professionals 16, 33, 37 , videos for professionals 19, 26, 29 , online symptom reporting for caregivers 21 , simulation-based learning experiences for professionals 22 and mobile phones/text messaging for education and training of providers and patients 32 . Two reviews reported that online learning was a feasible alternative to in-person training, though quality of evidence of primary studies within these reviews was not assessed 16, 23 . In a review of distance learning for healthcare professionals, Taroco et al. suggested that online case consultations involving active participation of students facilitated knowledge retention 23 . They also noted the prevalence of mixed educational initiatives (i.e., distance learning and classroom-based), with 64% of studies involving mixed approaches, suggesting a need for classroom activity to consolidate knowledge acquired at a distance. There was no consensus about the most-effective learning methods, and most virtual learning environments used a variety of multimedia to support communication and feedback mechanisms. Kidd et al. 16 suggested that online learning and remote access to guidelines supports dissemination of good practice but also reported that face-to-face teaching methods are preferred when discussing emotional or psychological issues. Ostherr et al. 26 reported strong evidence for benefits of video for educating patients about their illness and helping to determine treatment choices. Smith et al. sought to examine evidence on the use of simulation-based learning for end-of-life care conversations in their review, but found that information on outcomes was absent 22 . Overall, evidence on the impact of DHIs on education was mainly positive, though studies were mostly descriptive, outcomes assessed were heterogeneous, and evidence quality was not generally examined.",

EHRs were used to record symptoms 28, 33 while telephone and videoconferencing were frequently used to monitor, assess and treat symptoms 15, 18, [24] [25] [26] 31, 35 . Some reviews described positive impacts of DHIs on symptom management, while most reviews identified inconsistent evidence or noted that evaluation of impact in many studies was lacking. Describing evidence with moderate certainty, Jess et al. 35 identified positive impacts of videoconferencing on symptom burden, especially in remote settings, though also noted negative impacts in some studies, specifically due to technical challenges, which caused communication problems. Zhou et al. 24 concluded that telephone follow-up, for patients with advanced cancer, is a feasible alternative to hospital follow-up for symptom palliation and reduces travel burden. Head et al. 30 reported positive or no impacts of DHIs on patient symptoms (e.g. physical and social functioning), noting that overall evidence from primary studies within their review was weak. Hancock et al. 33 described home telemonitoring initiatives for patients (e.g. use of the telephone or computer software to record clinical symptoms at home); however, most interventions had not been evaluated. The heterogeneity of outcomes used to assess particular symptoms such as pain was highlighted by Allsop et al. 25 . Bush et al. 28 described evidence linking the documentation of clinical symptoms on an EHR to reduced time in hospital in the last 6 months of life, though this finding was based on just one publication included in their review, and was not directly evaluated in others.",

This RCT compared weekly video-consultations by a palliative care specialist with treatment as usual in home-dwelling patients with advanced cancer. The RCT authors concluded that higher distress in the video-consultation arm may have been due to excess focus on symptoms and suffering, and the provision of pre-scheduled support over 3 months as opposed to when it was actually needed 38 . Bradford et al. 14 described a number of small studies examining videoconferencing interventions for paediatric palliative care, noting reductions in anxiety. Head et al. 30 identified positive effects of DHIs (telemonitoring and videoconferencing) on patient anxiety, depression and distress. Zheng et al. 18 reported significant improvements in caregiver anxiety associated with access to videophones. Parker-Oliver et al. 17 identified studies examining the effect of DHIs on anxiety, though studies were not large enough to detect significant differences in outcomes.

In an early review of internet use, Willis et al. described the positive impacts of the internet as an additional source of information for patients, families and clinicians 27 . They found that patients and caregivers used online support groups and chatrooms to exchange information about an illness and alternative treatments. Patients and caregivers developed a connection with others online and appreciated the anonymity associated with online support. Capurro et al. 15 reported that DHIs were used by clinicians, patients and caregivers to meet informational needs regarding pain and symptom management and medication use. Kidd et al. highlighted the importance of telephone helplines for general practitioners, nurses and caregivers for gathering information about managing symptoms and medical equipment 16 . These telehealth interventions improved the reliability and accuracy of information exchanged 16 . Allsop et al. 25 noted that many systems designed to capture information from a patient for use by a healthcare professional, involved relaying symptoms without engaging in active forms of communication. Four reviews highlighted the information-sharing function of EHRs in palliative care 10, 28, 29, 34 . These reviews concluded that EHRs available across settings and platforms allow patient preferences regarding advance care planning (ACP) to be shared, improving continuity of care and ensuring that patients are treated in line with their wishes. Bush et al. 28 reported that in low-resource settings, the implementation of a standalone EHR system capturing patient demographics and palliative care treatment information was found to significantly improve clinical workflow. Leniz et al. 10 found that those with an EHR shared across settings were more likely to die in their preferred place compared with those who did not have an EHR. However, EHRs were limited in their capacity to capture important qualitative information such as information on anxiety or family distress 28 . Furthermore, locating relevant ACP information within the EHR was often challenging 34 , though could be improved by ensuring all ACP information is documented in a specific area 28 . Documentation templates, order sets and prompts may also improve the quality and incidence of ACP within EHRs 29 . Having an EHR improves documentation of advance care plans and communication of care planning information 28, 29, 34 , but this can come at the cost of increased workload 10 , challenges identifying which patients should have a shared EHR 34 , and concerns regarding data-sharing, security and consent 10 . Huber et al. 29 suggest that further research focused on developing a consensus definition for ACP documentation and related quality elements in EHRs is needed.",

Ostherr et al. identified 20 studies where video, computer-based multimedia and online materials were used to support communication between patients, families and staff in context of end-of-life decision-making 26 . There was evidence for the efficacy of video in facilitating ACP decisions, resulting in improvements in completion of advance directives, discussion of end-of-life preferences and improved patient knowledge and satisfaction. Taroco et al. identified two studies on distance-learning courses for decision-making in palliative care, but did not describe the outcomes 23 . Two reviews considered the role of clinical decision support systems (CDS), including EHRs in facilitating decision-making 28, 34 . Bush et al. 28 described evidence on the use of such systems to identify patients for a palliative care approach, and to capture ACP directives and patient-reported outcomes to inform clinical decision-making. Due to heterogeneity of studies, evidence could not be synthesized. However, Bush et al. 28 described positive impacts including a reduced likelihood of ICU admissions and hospital death for those with patient-reported outcomes shared via EHR, compared to those without; and earlier identification of patients for ACP discussion. Lemon et al. 34 found that EHRs can improve documentation of advance directives. Electronic reminders, electronic templates, decision aids and standard locations of advance directives increase documentation. Electronic search systems and identification algorithms located within the EHR can assist with identification of patients who could potentially benefit from a palliative care approach, by flagging those who may have palliative care needs for review by the clinician. Overall, the evidence from publications included in Lemon et al. was weak, but points towards promising potential effects of EHRs for ACP.",

Positive effects included enhanced communication between patients, healthcare professionals and caregivers; 15, 21, 27, 35 , more opportunities to express feelings 31 , increased connectednesss 15 , caregiver support 17 and improved ACP 26 . Jess et al. 35 identified 16 studies relating to the impact of videoconferencing on communication in palliative care. Positive impacts included greater efficiency and access, whereby several participants could be visually present and participate at once; shared decision-making involving the multidisciplinary team, patient and family; and enhanced communication through access to non-verbal as well as verbal responses. Negative impacts could occur where the family felt overwhelmed by the involvement of too many participants. Smith et al. 22 found that simulation-based learning was frequently used to teach nursing students communication skills in palliative care settings, but due to the lack of standardization and poor evaluation, it was difficult to identify best practices.",

Zheng et al. found no significant difference in QoL outcomes after telehealth interventions for caregivers 18 for paediatric palliative care, Bradford et al. 14 found either positive effects on QoL or no significant differences. Zhou et al. reported that telephone follow-ups with patients with advanced cancer reduced the patient burden by eliminating the need to come into hospital, facilitating a better QoL, though quality of evidence was not assessed and insufficient data on included studies was provided 24 . In a review of telehealth and hospice care, Oliver et al. 17 reported that studies examining QoL were too small to identify clinically significant differences. In a review of weblogs in palliative care, Ngwenya and Mills 31 concluded that weblogs improve patient and QoL by empowering patients and giving them a sense of active participation in their treatment, but this was a small scale study with no quality assessment of included studies. In reviews of EHRs, outcomes relating to QoL were rarely assessed 10, 33 .",

Jess et al. described cost savings associated with video consultation in palliative care for clinicians, service providers, patients and caregivers 35 . In two studies within their review, video consultations between healthcare professionals and patients resulted in cost savings for the hospital, compared to in-person consultations, and in clinician travel expenses for home visits. Travel cost savings were also noted for patients and carers in rural settings 35 . In a review of DHIs in hospices, Oliver et al. 17 identified one telehospice cost analysis study; this study reported reduced costs for telehospice visits versus traditional hospice homecare. Bradford et al. 14 described cost efficiencies when video visits were used in place of home visits; and when videoconferencing was used to educate patients about self-care, but cautioned that the cost-effectiveness will depend on whether DHIs are used in parallel with, or as a replacement for, traditional approaches. Kidd et al. described DHIs as an efficient alternative for patients and clinicians when time and distance is limiting 16 . Capurro et al. described cost efficiencies related to reduced hospital visits, but this was based on only one study in their review 15 . Overall, evidence on costs and resource use was positive, though interventions and outcomes assessed were heterogeneous, findings were based on a small number of primary studies within a small number of reviews, evidence quality was not generally assessed and robust economic evaluation not undertaken.",

Positive impacts of DHIs were reported on education, information sharing, decision-making and communication in palliative care contexts. Evidence pertaining to physical and psychological symptoms and QoL was inconclusive or absent. No evidence of risks to patient safety was reported. However, the methodological quality of existing systematic reviews on DHIs for palliative care was low when judged using the AMSTAR 2 appraisal criteria, mainly due to the absence of review protocols and risk of bias assessment. DHIs can play a positive, enabling role in palliative care but there is a need for more rigorous evaluation, implementation and costeffectiveness studies, with a greater focus on patient perspectives and consideration of bias in study designs. Rigorous quality guidelines should be adopted before embarking on future systematic reviews of primary research in palliative care to increase the confidence that can be placed in their findings.",

Compared to a previous meta-review, which encompassed six reviews 20 , it examined a wider range of databases and identified 21 systematic reviews for critical appraisal and synthesis. This meta-review shows that DHIs are more prevalent in palliative care than previously described, are used for a broader range of purposes, that impacts are generallyoften positive; and that the overall quality of research evidence is improving. As a by-product of our review, we provide a database of all 332 publications categorised by DHI type and main use, which may be of use to other researchers interested in evidence on specific DHIs for palliative care (Supplementary Data 1) .",

In many reviews, DHIs were described but outcomes were not evaluated in any detail. Although the searches were completed in January 2020, the dates of the primary studies ranged from 1997 to 2018, reflecting the time lag in academic publishing. None of the eligible systematic reviews focused on smartphone applications for palliative care, despite their growing use in this context 39, 40 . Three reviews emerged after our searches had been completed, including a rapid review on video consultations in palliative care in context of COVID-19 41 , a scoping review of patient experiences of telehealth for palliative care at home 42 and an integrative review of patient experiences of ehealth in palliative care 43 . Two would not have been eligible, as they were not systematic reviews. However, we suggest that future meta-reviews include all review types. Only 3 of the 21 systematic reviews had pre-registered a protocol on PROSPERO, which, in part accounts for the low-quality judgements obtained when using the AMSTAR 2 appraisal criteria. While it is true that the reviews were not as rigorous or comprehensive as might be ideal, the weighting of this criterion could potentially be disputed. The AMSTAR 2 appeared to be overly stringent when used to appraise reviews in palliative care, which tend to include heterogenous designs and outcomes often found when evaluating complex interventions. We also acknowledge that this meta-review was not pre-registered on PROSPERO, owing to its origins in a student project. Although we use PDQ Levels of Evidence 36 to categorise studies based on their design, we are aware that such frameworks value empirical over normative paradigms and may underestimate the contributions of qualitative research designs.",

            "text": "Our meta-review findings echo the wider literature on digital health 44 and palliative care 45 , which point to the need for more rigorous evaluations, cost-effectiveness analyses, implementation studies and patient-centred research. The lack of rigorous costeffectiveness studies seen in the literature on DHI in palliative care reflects findings from previous meta-reviews 46, 47 and systematic reviews [48] [49] [50] in digital health. There is a need for greater clarity on what is being compared in cost-effectiveness studies, and whether the DHI is offered in addition to, or as a replacement for, the standard approach 14, 26, 35 . Undertaking large, well-powered RCTs on DHIs is challenging, partly because technological developments may outpace the timescale for conventional clinical trials 51 , and also because, in practice, DHIs are implemented in complex systems as opposed to controlled settings 52 . Complexity informed paradigms that take account of dynamic interactions occurring in the setting in which the DHI is being evaluated are needed, and methods that pay greater attention to the factors that facilitate or hinder adoption, such as in-depth case studies, may be more realistic and fruitful in future evaluations of DHIs for palliative care 51, 53 . Evidence appraisal tools that value such methods are also required. Interdisciplinary evaluation, combining economic, social and clinical research, has the potential to better understand the role of different settings, healthcare needs and patient preferences for ensuring the appropriate, safe, acceptable and sustainable use of DHIs in palliative care. Early user involvement (patients, caregivers and staff) will also be a key in the design, evaluation and implementation of DHIs in this setting 54 .",

Remote consultations are perceived as particularly helpful when increasing access to care for families who are otherwise isolated by geography or housebound 14 , reflecting the context for many patients and families due to social distancing requirements during the Covid-19 pandemic. This should help reassure healthcare professionals that patients and caregivers often welcome these approaches, especially when face-to-face options are limited. While guidance regarding undertaking a remote consultation in palliative care is emerging 61 , evidence gaps remain. There is a need for research to determine when a face-to-face consultation is essential for terminally ill patients and when remote consultation is sufficient or preferred. Research is needed to understand contextual factors influencing the acceptability or effectiveness of remote consultations in palliative care 47 and to shed light on inconsistent findings around physical and psychological symptoms found in the present review and in related research literature 62 .

Professional gatekeeping is a challenge 63 , and biased samples consisting of patients who are mostly well or highly motivated is often problematic. However, there is ample evidence that many terminally ill patients are interested in taking part in research and may benefit from doing so 64, 65 . As patients and caregivers grow accustomed to receiving care remotely, there will be more opportunities to engage patients and their families in research remotely, reducing burden and travel costs. Providing a variety of ways in which patient and caregiver data can be collected, including online interviews and focus groups, maximises research participation, and is recommended.",

Mostly, positive impacts were reported on education, information sharing, decision-making, communication and costs. Impacts on QoL and physical and psychological symptoms were inconclusive.

Meta-reviews are useful in areas where numerous systematic reviews exist but vary in timeliness, scope and quality, making them difficult to interpret and use for evidencebased decision-making. Undertaking a meta-review typically involves applying a structured search strategy, filtering and critically appraising relevant systematic reviews, descriptive summarisation of the evidence base and thematic synthesis of the reviews' findings and conclusions. Additional rigour can be provided by also critically appraising the primary studies contained within each review, although this is less common 66 . Our review considered systematic reviews as the main units of analysis. We nonetheless checked details of their included articles to identify the total number of unique publications, then classified these based on the type and purpose of the DHI reported, and the level of evidence suggested by their study designs.",

We excluded rapid reviews and non-systematic scoping reviews, as well as reviews where search strategies were limited to one database, formal evidence appraisal was not undertaken, or data from individual studies were not summarized. Systematic reviews on broader topics were also included, provided these separately reported or synthesized studies of DHIs in palliative care. Using the PICO process 68 , we defined our target population (P) as children and adults who would benefit from palliative care, caregivers (informal and formal) and healthcare professionals delivering palliative care via DHIs or using DHIs to support palliative care decision-making. For the purposes of this review DHIs (I), were defined as approaches in which digital ICTs are used to deliver, facilitate or augment palliative care services, including psychological therapies, social support interventions, education, information, anticipatory care planning, remote care support, self-medication/management support, CDS etc. Examples of relevant ICTs include telephone, smartphone apps, mobile phones/ SMS, videoconferencing, voice over IP, instant messaging, email, internet resources, tablets, wearables, electronic patient records. Both synchronous (e.g. videoconferencing) and asynchronous (e.g. email) approaches were included. Our comparator of interest (C) was no DHIs or usual care. No limitations were placed on outcomes (O), as we were interested in identifying the broad range of outcomes potentially influenced by palliative care DHIs.",

In advance of conducting the appraisal, each read the AMSTAR 2 guidance, and met to discuss the interpretation of tool for the present study. Two co-authors independently judged each review based on each of the 16 items identified in the AMSTAR 2. Three co-authors then met to compare item judgements for each of the 21 reviews. Final judgements were agreed through further discussion and consensus. Drawing on item judgements, an overall quality rating of the review was made based on the inclusion of AMSTAR 2 critical domains in each review. These judgements were based on the guidance described by Shea et al. 69 , which emphasizes an overall judgement of confidence based on critical and non-critical elements of the reviews, as opposed to calculating overall review scores. Given the heterogeneity of study designs in the included reviews, we viewed four domains as critical: protocol registered prior to commencement of the study (AMSTAR item 2), adequacy of the literature search (AMSTAR item 4), consideration of risk of bias when interpreting results (Amstar item 13) and discussion of heterogeneity observed in the results where relevant (Amstar Item 14) . We rated quality based on overall confidence in the results of the review as follows: high: where all critical domains and no more than one non-critical weakness was evident, moderate: where all critical domains with few non-critical weaknesses were identified, low: where between one and two critical domains were not examined and very low: where three or more critical domains were not examined and numerous non-critical weaknesses were identified.",
