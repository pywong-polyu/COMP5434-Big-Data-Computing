The epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan city and related regions in Hubei Province, has reported 67,800 confirmed cases and 3,132 deaths. Although the number of new confirmed cases has substantially decreased since February 13, 2020, and the outbreak appears to be approaching the late phase in China, grave concerns about the severity of the outbreak have arisen, especially how many patients will die overall. Here, we have estimated the potential total number of COVID-19 deaths by applying Boltzmann function-based regression analysis, an approach that we recently developed for estimating the potential total numbers of confirmed cases for both the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the 2003 SARS epidemic. 3", "cite_spans": [{"start": 124, "end": 126, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 127, "end": 128, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "We collected data for analysis of the officially released cumulative numbers of deaths in mainland China, other provinces (outside Hubei), Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other cities in Hubei (from January 21 to February 29, 2020).

In support of this speculation, the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 deaths in the aforementioned regions were all well fitted to the Boltzmann function (R 2 all being close to 0.999) (Figs. 1B, 1C and Table 1 ).
