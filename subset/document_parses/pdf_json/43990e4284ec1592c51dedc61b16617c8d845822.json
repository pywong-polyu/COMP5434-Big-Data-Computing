One of the fastest ways of finding putative drug candidates is the use of computational drug discovery approaches. The purpose of the current study is to retrieve natural compounds that have obeyed to drug-like properties as potential inhibitors. Computational molecular modelling techniques were employed to discover compounds with potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibition properties. Accordingly, the Inter-BioScreen (IBS) database was obtained and was prepared by minimizing the compounds. To the resultant compounds, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) and Lipinski's Rule of Five was applied to yield drug-like compounds. The obtained compounds were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies to evaluate their stabilities. In the current article, we have employed the docking based virtual screening method using InterBioScreen (IBS) natural compound database yielding two compounds has potential hits. These compounds have demonstrated higher binding affinity scores than the reference compound together with good pharmacokinetic properties. Additionally, the identified hits have displayed stable interaction results inferred by molecular dynamics simulation results. Taken together, we advocate the use of two natural compounds, STOCK1N-71493 and STOCK1N-45683 as SARS-CoV-2 treatment regime.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in late December 2019 has spread across the world generating a global pandemic. [1] Currently, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) has no effective medication. [2] Coronaviruses (CoV) affect the humans and are grouped into 4 genera, \u03b1-CoV, \u03b2-CoV that are known to infect mammals and \u03b3-CoV, \u03b4-CoV predominantly infect birds. [2] Structurally, these viruses are enveloped obtaining the lipid membrane from the host cell and in which the surface proteins of the viruses are encapsulated. [1] These proteins resemble a halo-like appearance when viewed under the electron microscope. Hence, these group of viruses are called corona, meaning garland or crown in Latin. [1, 3] The genome of SARS-CoV-2 comprises of non-structural polyprotein open reading frame (ORF)1a/b, which upon proteolytic cleavage generates 15/16 proteins, 4 structural proteins and 5 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7, ORF8 and ORF9) with size of 30 kb. [4] [5] [6] The structural proteins are instrumental for SARS-CoV-2 assembly and infection. They are the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. [2, 7, 8] The infection triggers when Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID- 19) interacts with the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). For its successful entry into the host cell, the spike protein has to be primed using an enzyme called the TMPRSS2 protease. In brief, the spike protein (virus receptor) interacts with ACE2 (cellular ligand) by TMPRSS2. [9] [10] [11] After the infection, ORF1a and ORF1b undergo translation and are proteolytically cleaved to form functional proteins. [12] These functional proteins manifest their contribution during viral replication. [13] The non-structural proteins are nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp11, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16. The nsp1 suppresses host innate immune functions noticed in infected cells which proposes that SARS-CoV nsp1 may play an important role in SARS-CoV virulence. [14] Nsp1 protein from SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the 40S ribosomal subunit, leading to closure of the mRNA translation in vitro and in cells. Cryo-electron microscopy guided structural analysis has notified that the Nsp1C terminus interacts to and hinders the mRNA entry tunnel thus blocks RIG\u00c0 I-dependent innate immune responses thereby making it a potential target for designing drugs. [15] Studies on nsp2 murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV has revealed that nsp2 is dispensable for viral replication, and deletion of coding sequence of nsp2 represses the viral growth and RNA synthesis. [16] Another study recorded that the protein nsp2 interacts with prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and PHB2 two host proteins and may contribute to the intracellular host signalling disturbances amidst SARS-CoV infections. [17, 18] Of all the coronavirus proteins, nsp3 is the largest multi domain transmembrane protein. [19] It is generated by pp1a/1ab by the papain-like protease domain(s), a part of Nsp3, [20] and participates by several roles in the life cycle of the virus by serving as a scaffold protein aiding to bind to itself and to interact with host proteins or other viral nsp's. [20] It is a fundamental requirement for the replication/transcription complex (RTC) [20] formation. Furthermore, nsp3 is involved in the cleaving of the polypeptides, hindering the host innate immune response and stimulating cytokine expression. [21] The nsp4 binds to nsp3 which is a necessity for viral replication and perhaps host protein to bring about the role related to the rearrangement of the membrane in SARS-CoV. [8, 22] The nsp5 encodes for M pro and fundamentally cleaves viral polypeptides [19, 17] and inhibits IFN signalling. [21] The protein nsp6 participates in restricting autophagosome expansion and formation of double-membrane vesicle (DMV). [21, 23] The nsp7 cofactors with nsp8 and nsp12, and nsp8 is a cofactor with nsp7 and nsp12. [21] Nsp9 performs dimerization and RNA binding. [21] Additionally, nsp9 is speculated to mediate the replication of virus, cause overall virulence and reproduction of viral genomic RNA. [24] Nsp10 serves as scaffold a protein for nsp14 and nsp16. [21] The nsp12 functions as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [21] and its polymerase activity is enhanced in the presence of nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors. [25] The nsp13 performs RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding. [26] Studies report that nsp13 localizes to membranes, derived from endoplasmic reticulum that are perhaps the sites of RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV. [26] The nsp14 executes the proofreading of the viral genome [17] and nsp15 has viral endonuclease and chymotrypsin-like protease activities [17] and the functional role of nsp11 is still unknown. [21] The nsp16 is involved in negative regulation of the innate immunity [21] and shields the RNA of the virus from MDA5 recognition. [19] The RNA molecule of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is capped at their 5' end to shield the process of degradation that would be caused by 5' exoribonucleases, securing efficient translation, and prevents the recognition by the host innate immune system. [27] The non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) encoding the 2'-O-methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) performs the RNA cap modification. It requires the nsp10, which upon its interaction with nsp16 bestows selective 2'-O-MTase activity on N7-methyl guanine RNA caps. This kind of binding mechanism of nsp10 to nsp16 for the accomplishment of the 2'-O-MTase activity is a distinctive SARS-CoV-2 feature and is not discovered in host cell or other viruses. [27] The binding of nsp10 to nsp16 occurs through~930 \u00c5 2 activation surface in nsp10. [28] This favours nsp16 binding to RNA substrate and the methyl donor Sadenosyl-l-methionine (SAM), thereby leading to the stabilization of SAM-binding pocket and also elongating the capped RNA-binding groove. [27] Recent findings have demonstrated three sites for drugs to act upon, such as the SAM binding site, the interface between the nsp16-nsp10 and the RNA-binding groove. [27] In the current investigation, we have targeted the SAM-binding site for exploiting new leads to combat SARS-CoV-2 adapting several computational approaches.",

It was observed that the compound STOCK1N-45683 has shown a similar binding pattern as that of the SAM held by several key residues, as shown in Figure 1A . This compound has rendered a hydrogen bond interaction with the vital residue Asn6841 noticed with an extended linear chain. The HD21 atom of the Asn6841 and the O17 atom of the ligand have interacted to form a hydrogen bond with a bond length of 2.8 \u00c5, as shown in Figure 2A and Figure 2B . Additionally the residue Leu6898 held the ligand by ring A and ring B prompted by alkyl interaction as displayed in Figure 2B . Ring A also interacted with the Met6929 residue by \u03c0-alkyl interaction. The residues Tyr6845 and Pro6878 have held the ligand via the \u03c0-alkyl interaction accommodating the ligand at the active site of the protein as depicted in Figure 2B . Furthermore, several other residues as illustrated in Figure 2B have aided in clamping the ligand at the binding pocket of the protein as shown in Table 1 and Figure 2B . Additionally the hydrogen bond interactions were monitored throughout the simulations and was noted that the interactions existed during the entire simulations, as shown in Figure 1C defining that the ligand is stably located at the active site of the protein forming stable interactions. Additionally, MD inferred interaction energy between the protein and the ligand was recorded to be ranging between \u00c0 200 to \u00c0 150 kJ/mol with an average of \u00c0 181.58 kJ/mol, as shown in Figure 1D .",

[44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] The CDOCKER is a CHARMm-based molecular dynamics (MD) method to dock ligands into a proteins binding site. Correspondingly, random ligand conformations are produced using high-temperature MD and are subsequently translated into the binding site. Following this, the candidate poses are generated using random rigid-body rotations followed by simulated annealing. A final minimization is then used to refine the ligand poses. The results are evaluated based upon the -CDOCKER interaction energy. To ensure the binding affinity results, a second molecular docking programme, GOLD v5.2.2 [51] was additionally employed. GOLD uses a genetic algorithm for docking flexible ligands into receptor binding sites. The results are evaluated based upon the Goldscore Fitness. The binding site is marked around the SAM and the best poses are selected based upon the high /comparable dock score than the reference compound, chosen from the largest cluster, complemented by key residue interactions. The compounds that have obeyed to the aforementioned criteria were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) studies.",

The ligand topologies were generated using the SwissParam program. [53] Inhere, the protein ligand complexes from the CDOCKER were upgraded to MDS. Prior to the simulation, the structures were relaxed by energy minimization to avoid steric clashes or the presence of any inappropriate geometry. A two-step equilibration was performed after the energy minimization. The first step of the equilibration was conducted under an NVT ensemble (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) for 1 ns at 300 K using a V- rescale thermostat. The second step of equilibration was conducted under an NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature) ensemble for 1 ns, keeping the number of particles, pressure, and temperature at constant. The pressure of the system was monitored at 1 bar using Parrinello-Rahman barostat. [54] The protein backbone was restrained, while the solvent molecules along with counter-ions were allowed to move during the equilibration process. The NPT equilibrated structures were escalated to MD simulations for 50 ns. The obtained results were analysed using the GROMACS, visual molecular dynamics (VMD), [55] DS, and Chimera. [56] The LINCS algorithm was employed for the bond constraints [57] and Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method was utilized to calculate the longrange electrostatic interactions. [58] The van der Waals interactions were calculated by setting the upper limit of 12 \u00c5.",

The results inferred from the MD have illuminated the binding potential as inferred by the stable results. Taken together, we advocate the use of two natural compounds, STOCK1N-45683 and STOCK1N-71493 into COVID-19 treatment regime. Additionally, these compounds can also act as starting structures for designing and developing new candidate compounds. ",
