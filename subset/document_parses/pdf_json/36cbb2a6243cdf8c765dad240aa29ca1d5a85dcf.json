In the majority of patients, SARS CoV 2 causes a mild to moderate illness characterized by fever and respiratory symptoms, with or without evidence of pneumonia. The recent studies suggest that anti-cytokine targeted therapies might be associated with benefit for patients with severe COVID-19 especially in improving respiratory failure. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6 (IL6) receptor, is associated with clinical benefit for COVID-19 patients as it inhibits IL6 and decreases inflammation. Methods: As Tocilizumab has been an important part of our treatment and a strict criterion was followed to administer Tocilizumab, a retrospective study design used to assess the beneficial effects of Tocilizumab in improvement of ratio partial pressure of arterial Oxygen and fraction of inspired Oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 or P/F ratio) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in COVID19 patients has been done. 60 patients were taken for this study by using convenient sampling technique the data of demographics, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes i.e. improvement of respiratory failure depicted in the form of PF Ratio were obtained from the medical records, Statistical analysis was done with SPSS, version 21.0. Results: Sixty patients (47 males and 13 females)",

In the Ferritin row only 25 were negative ranks, 29 were positive and there were 5 ties which described that Ferritin also remained same or higher. According to last row the median LDH was very similar to Ferritin because there were 20 negative 36 positive and 4 ties which elaborated that the majority of patients LDH was high in post-test and some cases presented same value of LDH in pre and post test results. Table No : 2 describes the test statistics of lab values, P/F Ratio and effects of Tocilizumab on these variables in pair of CRP and P/F Ratio before and after the P-value was .000 that was less than 0.05 that showed the beneficial effect associated with use of Tocilizumab in decreasing of CRP and improving of P/F Ratio to a remarkable level. In D-Dimers case significant value of D-dimers before and after was .522 that was greater than .05 similarly in the 3 rd and 4 th pair significant value is greater than P-value so other lab values were not decreased in response to Tocilizumab .",
