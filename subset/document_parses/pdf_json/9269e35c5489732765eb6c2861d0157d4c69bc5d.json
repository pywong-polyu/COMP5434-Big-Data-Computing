Components of the decision, including expected turnaround time, journal acceptance rate, and journal impact factor, vary in terms of accessibility. In this study, I collated recent turnaround times and impact factors for 82 journals that publish papers in the field of fisheries sciences. In addition, I gathered acceptance rates for the same journals when possible. Findings indicated clear among-journal differences in turnaround time, with median times-to-publication ranging from 79 to 323 days. There was no clear correlation between turnaround time and acceptance rate nor between turnaround time and impact factor; however, acceptance rate and impact factor were negatively correlated. I found no field-wide differences in turnaround time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, though some individual journals took significantly longer or significantly shorter to publish during the pandemic. Depending on their priorities, authors choosing a target journal should use the results of this study as guidance toward a more informed decision.",

            "text": "Timeliness of publication has been reported as among the most important factors in the decision of target journal [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Prolonged peer review and/or production can be a major hindrance to authors [9] . Aarssen et al. [4] surveyed authors of ecological papers and found that 72.2% considered likelihood of a rapid decision a \"very important\" or \"important\" factor in choosing a journal. In some fields, research outcomes may be time-sensitive, so lengthy review can render results obsolete even before publication [10] . Desires and expectations for turnaround time are often not met: Mulligan et al. [11] found that 43% of survey respondents rated \"time-to-first-decision\" of their most recent article as \"slow\" or \"very slow.\" Allen et al. [12] found that authors in the life sciences expect peer review to take less than 30 days (although this may be unrealistic). Moreover, Nguyen et al. [7] conducted a survey of authors in conservation biology in which the vast majority (86%) of respondents reported that their perceived optimal duration for peer review was eight weeks or under, though their experienced peer review time was on average 14.4 weeks. Over half of the respondents in Nguyen et al. [7] believed that lengthy peer-reviews can have a detrimental impact on their career, including individuals who reported that the lack of timely publication obstructed their acceptance into educational institutions and caused delays to degree conferral. Despite the obvious and documented importance of journal turnaround time, published per-journal values are almost non-existent (BR, personal observation). Some journals do publicize \"time-to-first-decision\" on their (or their publisher's) webpages (e.g., ICES Journal of Marine Science), but summary statistics of times to acceptance and publication remain generally unavailable to the public. Lewallen and Crane [13] recognized the importance of turnaround time and recommended authors contact potential target journals and request information directly. However, this approach is time-consuming and unlikely to result in universal acquiescence from potential target journals. Moreover, because the duration of the review process is unpredictable, journals are more likely to give an average or a range-as an indicator-rather than guarantee a specific turnaround time (H. Browman, Ed. in Chief, ICES J. Mar. Sci., personal communication).",

            "text": "I began by developing a list of journals that regularly publish papers in fisheries science. On 20 March 2021, I searched the Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics; v.5.35) for published articles with \"fisheries or fishermen or fishes or fish or fishing\" as the topic. These terms were used by Branch and Linnell [14] for a similar purpose. I refined this search by selecting only \"Articles\" and \"Proceedings Papers\" thereby excluding reviews, meeting abstracts, brief communications, et cetera. Finally, I truncated the search to include only documents that were published during 2010-2020. This search resulted in 242,280 published works. Using Web of Science's \"Analyze Results\" tool, I compiled a list of source titles (i.e., journals) that have published >400 papers meeting the specifics of my query. This threshold was used because it emerged as a natural break in the list of journals. A total of 85 journals met these requirements. I removed from this list journals that publish strictly in the field of food sciences (e.g., Food Chemistry) as well as hyper-regional journals that may not be of broad interest to authors in the field (though their exclusion is not indicative of their quality). Finally, I added several journals ad hoc that had not met the 400-paper minimum. These additions were included either because of my personal interest (e.g., Marine and Coastal Fisheries and Global Change Biology) or because of their relevance and value in among-journal comparisons (e.g., Science and Nature). After removals and additions, the list included 82 total journals. Turnaround time. In the spring of 2021, I accessed webpages of each of the 82 journals selected for inclusion. For each journal, I located publication history information (i.e., dates received, accepted, and published) on the webpages or in the PDFs of individual papers. I tabulated these dates for each paper. Generally, I aspired to gather dates for all papers published from present day back to at least the beginning of 2018. It was my explicit goal to compare timeliness of publication only for original research papers. For all journals where possible, I excluded papers if they were not original research articles. Some journals publish a higher proportion of reviews, brief communications, errata, or editorials, all of which likely have a shorter turnaround time than original research. Most journals list the paper type on each document, allowing for easy exclusion of papers that were not original research.",

It is highly unlikely (perhaps impossible) that an unsolicited original research article could be accepted or published within 30 days of submission. I assumed that any implausibly short publication histories either were typographical errors, artifacts of that journal's methods for tracking papers, or the papers were simply not unsolicited original research articles. I therefore excluded from further analysis any papers with a time-to-acceptance or time-to-publication of fewer than 30 days; by-journal proportions of such papers ranged from zero to 0.06 (Table 1) . Similarly, some papers reported publication times on the order of several years or more since receipt. While extreme delays in publication are certainly possible, I assumed that any paper with a time-to-publication of over 600 days was either a typographical error or a result of extenuating circumstances for which the journal staff and reviewers likely played no role. I therefore excluded papers with a timeto-acceptance or a time-to-publication of over 600 days from further analysis; by-journal proportions of such papers ranged from zero to 0.08 (Table 1) .

I obtained impact factor for 2018 (the most recent year for which it was available for all journals) from https://www.resurchify.com/impact-factor.php. Impact factor is calculated as the number of citations received in a given year by all articles published in that journal during the previous two years, divided by the number of articles published in that journal during the previous two years. Information and summary values pertaining to each of 82 journals that publish papers in fisheries and related topics. % < 30 d and % > 600 d refer to the proportion of papers with a publication time of less than 30 days or greater than 600 days; these papers were excluded from the analysis. N refers to the number of papers examined in this study and does not include those excluded for extremely short or extremely long turnaround times. Start and Stop refer to the range of publication dates for the papers examined in month / day / year format. T acc and T pub are median times (d) from submission to acceptance and from submission to publication, respectively. % > 1 yr is the proportion of papers examined that took more than 365 days from submission to publication. % < 6 mo is the proportion of papers that took less than 180 days from submission to publication.

Most journals reject a percentage of submissions at the editorial stage prior to peer review (so-called \"desk rejections\") due to a lack of fit within the journal's scope, deficiencies in writing quality, and/or insignificant scientific merit [23] . Of course, rejections after peer review also occur, and overall rejection rates are increasingly made available on journals' or publishers' websites or in compendium papers [e.g., 20]. Unfortunately, rates of desk rejections are still rarely available online [23] . However, many journals' overall acceptance rates are reported either on their own page or on the publisher's website. For instance, Elsevier and Springer both offer acceptance rates for some (but not all) of their journals on their JournalFinder (https://journalfinder.elsevier.com/) and Journal suggester (https://journalsuggester.springer.com/) respectively. I extracted reported acceptance rates wherever available and tabulated them per journal. In addition, I sent email correspondence to Editors-in-Chief and/or publishers of each of the journals included in this study asking for their journal's desk rejection rate and overall acceptance rate. When information was provided, it was tabulated on a per-journal basis. In some cases, acceptance rates provided via email were not equal to the rate provided on the journal's webpage. In these cases, the value provided by the editor or publisher was used, as it is likely more recent and thus more valid. Such chases did not differ in these figures by more than 10%. It is possible that there are discrepancies in the calculation of acceptance rates, e.g., resubmissions may be tabulated differently among journals. I made no attempt to account for these potential differences in the present study.",

Alternatives to impact factor, such as SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) and H-index, have been proposed and may in some cases be more valid metrics of journal prestige or quality [30, 31] .

The degree to which these metrics change is likely variable among journals. However, barring major changes in journal formats or editorial regimes, the data presented here are probably applicable for the next several years at least. Indeed, median monthly turnaround times for most journals in this study were approximately static for the period from January 2018 to April 2021 (Fig 7) . Similarly, acceptance rates and impact factors [32] are generally strongly auto-correlated from one year to the next. I therefore suggest that the metrics presented here can be used by authors as a baseline, but if more than several years have transpired it may befit the reader to obtain updated information (particularly on impact factor and acceptance rate, which are generally more accessible than turnaround time). In addition, it is theoretically possible that this paper itself may alter turnaround times and/or acceptance rates for some journals. Enlightened readers may elect to change their submission habits in favor of certain journals that are more expeditious or that otherwise meet their priorities for a given paper. Authors without a preconceived notion of a specific target journal should still consider the paper's \"fit\" to be the most important factor in their decision [1] . I suggest that after assembling a shortlist based on fit, authors should use the results of this paper to select a journal that best aligns with their priorities.",
