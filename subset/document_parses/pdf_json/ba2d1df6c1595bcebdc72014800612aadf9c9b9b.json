Serological H1N1 responses were analysed in 72 patients; 34 (47%) were positive (haemagglutination inhibition assay titres >40). There were no statistically significant differences in symptoms between seropositive and seronegative patients. Women reported better adherence to personal protective measures, such as hand washing and cough etiquette than men. Women were also more concerned about possible adverse effects of the pandemic influenza vaccine than men. Conclusions. Discrimination between influenza and other viral upper respiratory tract infections is difficult in daily clinical practice, even during an influenza pandemic. A gender difference was found in reported precautions to prevent influenza.",

            "text": "In April 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infected hundreds of persons in Mexico and the USA and spread rapidly throughout the globe. 1 The influenza A (H1N1) virus was characterized as a pandemic strain with a low level of immunity in man; 2 however, older individuals (>60 years of age) had some degree of protection, due to circulating antibodies from previous influenza H1N1 viruses. [3] [4] [5] The clinical course of H1N1 influenza appeared to be mild in most cases, but individual cases of severe complications and deaths were observed in healthy young individuals, pregnant women and obese people. [5] [6] [7] The pandemic virus spread rapidly in Norway in October with consultations with GPs for influenza-like illness (ILI) peaking in November 2009. 8 During the pandemic, the Norwegian health authorities recommended vaccination against the pandemic H1N1 virus. 9 Also, public health campaigns to encourage the use of preventive measures such as regular hand washing and good cough hygiene occurred during the pandemic. Primary care plays a major role in the response to a pandemic. 10 During influenza outbreaks, patients consult their GP or out-of-hours services for treatment and advice, and further referral is generally not necessary. Hence, general practice is a suitable setting for recruitment of influenza patients for research. Diagnosis of influenza is primarily based upon symptoms, clinical signs and epidemiological knowledge. Fever with cough when prevalence of influenza is high in the community has been shown to have a positive predictive value of 80%. 11 The usefulness of serological testing in the clinical setting is limited, due to time delay in analysis.",

However, the true response rate among patients with actual ILI is probably higher. Manual control in medical records of 15 GPs revealed that 4 GPs (and probably their administrative assistants) had applied the influenza diagnosis code (ICPC R80) inappropriately for the purpose of this study. For example, it was used for situations such as influenza in the family, concerns about vaccination, etc. as well as own influenza symptoms. Accordingly, some individuals not suffering from ILI received questionnaires. However, we do not have data to exactly quantify the response rate among patients with actual ILI.",

In our material, only 30% of patients were in the age group 0-17 years. Children are less likely to answer questionnaires, if not assisted by a parent, and assistance is essential for the youngest patients. Hence, there may be some selection bias in our study according to age. Patients who experienced mild influenza symptoms probably did not consult their GP during the pandemic, and we may have lost mild and subclinical cases of influenza. Most employees had 7 days of sick leave for ILI without a doctor's certificate according to advice from the Norwegian Minister of Health. On 5 November 2009, neuraminidase inhibitors were released as over the counter drugs for patients presenting with ILI, which supported patients' self-care, and they were thus less likely to contact their GP for treatment and advice. Also, some patients were probably missed to out-ofoffice duties managed by GPs, as reflected by local data reported that there were 440 consultations with emergency doctors in Bergen city during 1 week at the peak of the pandemic and 46 new hospital admissions. 8 Our material still reflects the situation for patients seeking a GP consultation for influenza, with the exception of the age distribution. We found a difference in symptoms between age groups among all ILI patients. Individuals <18 years of age reported fever, cough and GI symptoms in higher proportions than those in age group >18 years, whereas myalgias/arthralgias and subjective feeling of fever were more frequent among older patients. Among adults who had a serological test, there were no statistically significant differences between those with confirmed H1N1 influenza and those with negative results. The influenza A (H1N1) was characterized by typical flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, headache, fatigue and myalgia) and up to 50% had GI symptoms according to one review paper. 5 Our results supports that GI symptoms were more common among ILI patients, and we found that children <18 years of age were particularly prone to have such symptoms. A study published from the Netherlands, reported a positive predictive value of 76% for diagnosis made by the GP during periods of high influenza activity. 24 However, results in our study suggest that influenza is not clinically easy to distinguish from other viral causes of ILI, even during an influenza pandemic.",

This may be due to selection of patients who actually see a GP for ILI, and also it may reflect a selection bias among patients answering the questionnaire. Among the 392 early cases of confirmed H1N1 virus in UK, 92% reported treatment with oseltamivir. 27 Interpretation of differences in antiviral medication between these countries may be related to higher availability of oseltamivir in UK compared to the area this study was conducted. Prior to and during the pandemic, the Norwegian Institute for Public Health informed the public about specific behavioural measures to avoid viral spread and prevent disease. Specific advices such as frequent hand washing, avoiding public places when ill, use of hand disinfectant and avoid viral spread by droplets by coughing in the elbow room were thoroughly announced to the public by different ways. Women in our study reported more frequent use of preventive measures than men, such as hand washing, coughing in elbow room and use of paper tissue. Previous studies have also shown that women are more likely to follow behavioural recommendations during influenza pandemics, such as hand washing and other measures to prevent viral transmission. [20] [21] [22] 28 The use of facemasks was not promoted actively in Norway during the 2009 influenza pandemic. Only 4% of participants in our study reported the use of facemask, despite free availability at the pharmacy as compared to studies from Asia were up to 90% wear masks during flu epidemics. 22 A systematic review could not find evidence that facemasks protect against being infected during an outbreak of influenza. 29 Attitudes towards vaccination and influenza disease may be better explored by the use of qualitative methods. However, our results give an indication of attitudes among ILI patients, and our findings are in line with findings from previous studies from other settings. 17, 19, 20, 30 Our study showed that women more often reported concern about side effects of vaccination than men, and a similar tendency was associated with younger age. A study by Wong et al. 30 showed that factors associated with willingness to accept pandemic vaccination among community nurses was age >40 years and previous seasonal influenza vaccination. In another study, from Turkey, female health care providers were more concerned about vaccine safety than men. 20 We conclude that important finding in our study is that discrimination between influenza and other viral upper respiratory tract infections is difficult in daily clinical practice, even during an influenza pandemic. Women reported better adherence to personal protective measures, such as hand washing and cough etiquette than men. Individuals <40 years of age reported more concerns about possible adverse effects of pandemic and seasonal vaccines compared to people in the age group >40 years of age. These results may be useful for health care planners when designing health protective campaigns in the future.",
