Extant studies of influence on social media, however, are limited by publicly available data that record expressions (active engagement of users with content, such as likes and comments), but neglect impressions (exposure to content, such as views) and lack \"ground truth\" measures of influence. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a social media simulation using an original, web-based micro-blogging platform. We propose three influence models, leveraging expressions and impressions to create a more complete picture of social influence. We demonstrate that impressions are much more important drivers of influence than expressions, and our models accurately identify the most influential accounts in our simulation. Impressions data also allow us to better understand important social media dynamics, including the emergence of small numbers of influential accounts and the formation of opinion echo chambers.",

            "text": "Since 2005, the number of American adults using social media has risen from 5 to 72%. Social media now surpasses print newspapers as a source of news for Americans. Similarly, spending on digital advertising in the United States now exceeds spending on all other forms of advertising combined, with Facebook alone accounting for nearly a quarter of those dollars. Much of the activity on social media is designed to influence users' beliefs and behaviors. Reports of organized online social influence (OSI) operations are now widespread and include both \"good\" influence operations as well as malicious ones. \"Good\" influence operations include campaigns focused on wellness such as the Healthy Together Victoria campaign in Australia 1 and the state of Maryland's social media campaign to promote mask usage 2 . Malicious influence operations include allegations of foreign state-backed influence operations in the 2016 US election 3 , anti-vaccination campaigns 4 , and COVID-19 related misinformation 5 . Understanding how influence occurs on social media is, therefore, of utmost importance for almost every aspect of modern society. This has led to an explosion of research on online social influence from computer science 6-9 , physics 10,11 , and the social sciences 12,13 . Moreover, these studies typically have no way to determine the ground truth data about exactly whose opinions or behaviors (other than expressions) were influenced and to what extent. These limitations make it difficult to tune and evaluate models of social influence. (3) Finally, few existing studies have been able to systematically study the goals, strategies and effects of OSI operations because doing so requires positive control of the OSI operation by the researcher as part of the study design. This is difficult using observational data because it frequently violates the terms of use of social media platforms and/or raises ethical issues regarding performing experiments on human subjects without consent. While previous work has used the click history of users to study impressions on social media, they also face similar limitations. These studies have access only to the actions and impressions of select users, not of the broader network of users that they interact with. Our research design allows for complete access to information on every user's expressions and impressions.",

            "text": "These users were also asked to identify the accounts whose posts most influenced them. Importantly, in addition to commonly used expression data, the software platform also captured impression data, which consists of the posts that users viewed, but did not actively engage by liking, re-posting, commenting, or following. Although users knew they were participating in a simulation, most agreed that the experience faithfully represented social media use in the real world. At the end of the simulation, 86% of subjects reported that the platform was somewhat or highly realistic. Further details regarding the simulation are described in the methods section. We make two major contributions. First, we define the novel concepts of direct influence networks (DINs) and full influence networks (FINs) that trace back the impression or expression events that precede an influence event. We propose three influence models, FI1 , FI2 , FI3 that leverage both expression and impression data and build on FINs to create a more complete picture of the mechanics of social influence. The second set of contributions involve 5 novel findings. (1) We demonstrate that impressions account for far more exposure to information on social media than do expressions and that impressions and expressions are not highly correlated. Yet, for the reasons described above, impressions have been largely ignored by the majority of the literature to date. (2) We find that once participants adopt a position on a particular subject, the diversity of positions on the same subject they choose to view (as measured by entropy) decreases dramatically over time. This suggests the potential for influence operations to polarize social media users through the formation of echo chambers. Though the existence of echo chambers has been described before 14, 15 , to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to document the emergence of echo chambers using both impression and expression data from a social platform. (3) Our proposed models of influence accurately capture acts of successful influence in the ground truth generated by our simulation. (4) As expected, only a small minority of accounts were identified by observers as being influential. However, we found that accounts that users did not consider influential at the beginning of our study remained largely un-influential throughout the study, while users who were influential at the end of the study were likely to have been identified as influential from early on. (5) Using quasi-Poisson and Gamma-Poisson regression models to identify the determinants of influence, we found that all expression types (posts, comments, likes) and impressions are individually statistically significant and positively linked to influence at the p < 0.01 level. When we consider all these features simultaneously, however, only the impressions are positively linked and significant. Specifically, our regressions show that when the impressions of a particular account on the platform increase by one standard deviation, the expected number of times users cite the account as influential more than doubles. These results suggest that the single biggest determinant of influence on social media platforms is impressions, a factor that has hardly been studied in the growing OSI literature.",

In this paper, we have proposed novel models of influence for online social networks and developed new techniques for evaluating and refining them. Using a custom-built social media platform, we are able to record all aspects of user behavior and, with embedded daily surveys, develop ground truth measures of influence. We show that our models can capture the dynamics of online social influence reliably.

For example, the data generated from our simulation reveals that users quickly coalesce around a small set of highly influential accounts, with few new accounts achieving influence with the passage of time. Because our simulation allowed us to observe the evolution of online social networks starting from a blank slate with no connections at all, we were also able to capture the formation of these networks in ways that would be impossible using data from preexisting public social media sites. Our data show that although participants initially explored a variety of different accounts and issue positions on the subjects being discussed on the platform, most quickly There are several important limitations to our study. First, the \"in-vitro\" nature of the simulation can have an effect on the behavior of the participants. Though our users confirmed that our simulation faithfully replicated the environment of prominent social media platforms, our participants' motivations were primarily monetary, whereas social media users in the real world are more likely to be a mixture of social and political. Likewise, because our participants did not reflect a representative sample of social media users, it is possible that their behavior might differ in important ways from users in the real world, particularly very high-profile users who we might expect to have the greatest influence. Second, our simulation lasted only 5 days. This was long enough to produce valuable data, but not long enough to capture dynamics of influence that may take longer to develop. Third, the \"natural\" environment in a social media platform is saturated with millions of posts discussing a large variety of topics, while in our simulation the platform was not pre-populated with any posts. Finally, our current measure of influence is not disaggregated by topic. While we did ask users to supply information on the topics they were influenced on, few users opted to answer this voluntary question. As there may be meaningful relationships between influence and topic, future work could extend this experiment by requiring users to provide information about the topic or topics they were influenced on.",

Numerous experimental studies in the fields of sociology, psychology, communications, and political science have utilized simulated social media content to explore the dynamics of human behavior and opinion formation on social media [26] [27] [28] . Typically, these studies simply expose subjects to a single mock post or news article from a social media site or using simple online games. Our approach significantly improves upon these studies by providing a more realistic environment in which users can interact with each other and react to user-generated content in a more natural way. Because social media platforms do not make impressions data publicly available and because researchers cannot control many critical aspects of the social media platforms they study, simulations like the DartPost-enabled methods in this study provide a valuable tool for researchers.

Only American citizens over the age of 18 were included. Mechanical Turk workers were invited to participate in \"a social media simulation as part of an academic study of social media usage\" and asked to use the platform for between 15 min and 1 h per day, depending on their role in the simulation. Users who consented to participate in the study provided us with their Mechanical Turk worker number, which is not linked publicly to names or other identifying information. Each user was then assigned to one of three main roles: 160 were assigned to be single account operators, 40 were assigned to be multiple account operators and 87 were assigned to be observers. Multiple account operators were then randomly assigned a number of unique accounts between 4 and 8. We aimed to recruit 300 participants, 200 users, and 100 observers, but only successfully recruited 287. We elected to decrease the number of observes to 87 to ensure there was enough content generated on the site. Users did not know the nature or distribution of these roles across other users, or that some other users were operating multiple accounts. Participants were paid 10 USD per hour.",

The results of the Quasi-Poisson model indicate that an account's received (i.e. shown) views are positively and significantly associated with the number of times they are mentioned as being influential. The coefficients for the expression variables (Issued Posts, Issued Comments, Issued Likes) are either insignificant, or only marginally significant in the case of Issued Comments. In the gamma-Poisson model, we see similar results. Here, only the coefficient for Received Views is significant at conventional levels, while all of the expression measures are insignificant. To provide additional context for the effect size of Received Views, we first calculated the expected counts of expressed influence holding all of our independent variables at their mean values, finding a value of 1.91 for the Quasi-Poisson and 1.52 for the gamma-Poisson. We then increase the value of Received Views by one standard deviation and recalculate the expected counts, which increases to 4.3 in the Quasi-Poisson model and 5.1 in the gamma-Poisson model. In both models the expected number of mentions more than doubles.",
