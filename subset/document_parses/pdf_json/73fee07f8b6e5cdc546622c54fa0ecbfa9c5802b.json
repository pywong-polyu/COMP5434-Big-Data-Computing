Many researchers have proven that sensors can be used as side channels to leak touchscreen interactive information. The research of information leakage in the restricted area has been relatively mature, but in the unrestricted area, still there are two issues to be solved urgently: chirography difference and posture variation. We learn from the way spiders perceive prey through the subtle vibrations of their webs; an unrestricted-area handwriting information speculation framework, called spider-inspired handwriting character capture (spiderinspired HCCapture), is designed. Spider-inspired HCCapture exploits the motion sensor as the side-channel and uses the neural network algorithm to train the recognition model. To alleviate the impact of different handwriting habits, we utilize the generality patterns of characters rather than the patterns of raw sensor signals. Furthermore, each character is disassembled into basic strokes, which are used as recognition features. We also proposed a user-independent posture-aware approach to detect the user's handwriting posture to select a suitable one from some pretrained models for speculation. In addition, the Markov model is introduced into spider-inspired HCCapture, which is used as an enhancement feature when there is a correlation between adjacent characters. In conclusion, spider-inspired HCCapture completes the handwritten character speculation attack without obtaining the victim's information in advance. The experimental results show that the accuracy of spider-inspired HCCapture reaches 96.1%.",

By exploiting those sensors as a side-channel, touchscreen information can be speculated, such as passwords tapped by users on the virtual keyboard (Xu et al., 2012; Das et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2019) . By far, most research work only focus on the restricted-area input interface, in which touchscreen information is entered by tapping a specified position/area on the touchscreen, such as the virtual keyboard (Spreitzer et al., 2018a; Mehrnezhad et al., 2018) and the pattern lock screen (Aviv et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2018) .",

Mehrnezhad et al. (2016) have shown that primitive operation actions (e.g., click and scroll in gesture control) on touchscreens can be recognized by analyzing sensor signals. Nevertheless, the speculation for more complex and meaningful inputs, such as handwritten contents, has not been sufficiently discussed. One issue is that victims are usually unknown to attackers before attacks, but the speculation model is built on the training data from the known users. Meanwhile, we observe that each person has his/her own handwriting habits, such as writing strength, sequence, and speed, called chirography difference. The other is that the sensors' signals and noise patterns vary under different holding postures (e.g., sitting and standing), since the victim's limb jitter and handwriting strength change significantly under different postures, called posture variation. Moreover, posture variation also needs to be handled when the victim's data are not included in the training process of the speculation model.",

To solve the chirography difference issue, spider-inspired HCCapture utilizes a generality pattern of characters (i.e., stroke number), which enables character speculation without collecting the target victim's training data in advance. Regarding the posture variation issue, we propose a userindependent posture-aware approach based on the correlation comparison of holding posture features, to dynamically perceive the victim's posture. With the perceived posture, spider-inspired HCCapture can adjust the speculation model to improve the speculation accuracy.",

            "text": "Spider-inspired HCCapture is an improvement of J. Chen et al.'s work (Chen et al., 2021a) . Compared to the previous version, we have made three major improvements. First, under the premise of noting the difference in the number of strokes of characters, we divide the strokes into eight basic types and label them. In spider-inspired HCCapture, we use the detected strokes to reconstruct the characters, instead of directly using the classifier to predict the entire signal of a character. Second, we added lowercase characters, which makes spider-inspired HCCapture more practical. Thanks to a more fine-grained model, the accuracy of the experiment is further improved, despite the doubled character set. At the same time, considering that there may be relevance between handwritten adjacent characters, we also introduced a Markov model. At last, corrections were made to the places where the previous experiment was not rigorous. We strictly exclude the tested data from the training set, and use a 3-fold crossover experiment for verification.",

(Cai and Chen, 2011) first proposed the possibility of eavesdropping virtual keyboard input via embedded sensors in a smartphone. They developed TouchLogger, which can monitor the orientation signals and extract features from these signals to infer key-press information. TouchLogger's accuracy can reach 70% when the recognized characters are only numbers. Similar to this work, Xu et al. (Xu et al., 2012) recorded gyroscope signals to infer user input and PIN code. Ping et al. (Ping et al., 2015) proposed a method to infer even longer input. Mehrnezhad et al. (Mehrnezhad et al., 2018) presented a threat of eavesdropping users' PINs by recording the sensors' signals from a web page. They proposed PINlogger.js which is a JavaScript-based side-channel attack embedded in a web page, recording the sensor signal changes while a user inputs the sensitive information on other web pages. However, as the mobile operating system gradually restricts collecting sensor signals from web pages, this attack method is not effective any longer. All of these research works only focus on the disclosure of restricted-area information, and only a few number of researchers study the threat to unrestricted-area information based on sensor side channel.",

In order to get the optimal solution, bionic algorithms derived from nature often provide a novel research idea (Liu et al., 2021a; Xu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) . In recent years, deep learning models have provided new solutions to traditional problems (Jiang et al., 2021a; Jiang et al., 2021b; Tao et al., 2022; Yun et al., 2022) . Similarly, mobile security is closely related to society, and the game theory in sociology also has a certain reference value (Chen et al., 2021b; Chen et al., 2021c; Chen et al., 2021d) .

Since the Apple App Store does not have download statistics, we count the number of handwriting-related apps in the App Store based on a third-party data set (Qimai, 2019) . Table 1 shows that the total downloads of targeted vulnerable apps in Google Play is over 300 million and the number of apps in the Apple Store (including the United States and China) is up to 1,381, which draws a conclusion that there are enormous targeted vulnerable apps which could potentially be compromised by spider-inspired HCCapture.",

However, for the existing mainstream mobile phone operating systems, such as Android and iOS, access to general sensor data does not need application for permission, so we can freely obtain motion sensor data. In spider-inspired HCCapture, in order to speculate the handwritten information, we need to precisely perceive the mobile devices' movement caused by handwriting actions. Specifically, we employ two commonly used motion sensors, accelerometer and gyroscope, to measure the acceleration and angular velocity of a device separately. Conceptually, these sensors provide signals at a given frequency which contain the data in three dimensions (denoted as X, Y, and Z, respectively, in Figure 1 ) and its corresponding timestamps.",

To filter the noise from these raw sensors' signals and restore the real signal fluctuations caused by handwriting actions, we utilize the wavelet denoising for filtering. Figure 3 shows the gyroscope's signals for handwriting actions of character \"A,\" \"F,\" \"D,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" and \"L.\" After wavelet denoising, we can find the actual change pattern of signal fluctuations during the handwriting process for different characters. More specifically, the difference in the number of peaks in Figure 3 can be observed, as the characters have different strokes. For example, the signal of character \"A\" has three strokes, and character \"C\" has only one stroke. The number of strokes observed here is an important basis for us to solve the chirography difference issue (see Section 4.5 for details). 2) Segment detection: The goal of segment detection is to extract individual signal segments generated by the handwriting action of a single character from the above denoised signal stream. Generally, it is difficult for victims to keep their arms and palms still for a long time, and therefore, the collected sensors' signals would be unstable. Extracting the target signal segment from the unstable signals is the first step to implement the handwritten character speculation.",

Specifically, we define the speculation accuracy as the ratio between the number of correctly speculated characters and the total number of handwritten characters in a testing data. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve describes the false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) under the varying threshold. A higher AUC means that for a given testing data set, spider-inspired HCCapture is able to speculate characters more accurately. Figure 7 shows the actual detection result of three segment detection methods. The accuracy here refers to the percentage of the signal data detected by the algorithm to the raw data.",

Considering the whole, we can find that the detection rate of all characters has reached 88%, and it needs to be clear that the character data for subsequent recognition accuracy experiments are based on the character signal that has been detected by the mCFAR. Figure 8 shows the speculation accuracy under two different holding postures. We apply each posture profile, generated from the posture-aware analysis, to build the corresponding speculation model and test the speculation accuracy of each model. As lowercase characters were added to the experiment, the speculation space has doubled, so we are allowed to guess twice.",

Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2021a) . The experimental performance in the sitting posture is better than that in the standing posture, because the sitting posture has less background noise, and we can extract more handwriting segments from the collected sensors' signals to fully train the speculation model. On the other hand, we can find that when using a posture profile that does not fit the current holding posture to speculate characters, the accuracy is significantly reduced. This is because the posture profile of one holding posture may be redundant and inappropriate for other holding postures, which may reduce the speculation accuracy. The experimental results in the sitting posture will be shown in the follow-up.",

The performance degradation of one guess is only 73.2%, maybe caused by too similar capitalization of some characters, such as (O, o), (S, s), and (Z, z). Almost all characters can be speculated within 5 times, where the accuracy can reach 99.8%. We took two guesses as a representative and drew the ROC curve as shown in Figure 10A .

We designed a modified constant false alarm rate algorithm (mCFAR) to extract handwriting segments from the motion sensor signal stream, and a user-independent postureaware approach which combines digital signal processing and correlation analysis. In order to solve the chirography difference issue, spider-inspired HCCapture utilizes a generality pattern of characters (number of strokes and type of strokes). Furthermore, we classify the strokes to obtain a more fine-grained model, which is trained by the neural network algorithm. We also propose a postureaware approach to solve the posture variation issue. After the user's posture is recognized, a model specialized for a certain posture is automatically selected to improve the accuracy of the speculation. Moreover, the Markov model is used to deal with the situation where adjacent characters may be correlated when the user writes.",
