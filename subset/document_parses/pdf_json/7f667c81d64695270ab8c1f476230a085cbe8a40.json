One hundred twenty-five incidents had sufficient information to categorise the perpetrators. Mental and behavioural disorders (MBD) were the most frequent perpetrator characteristic present in security alerts (n = 102, 81.6%) and were associated with increased severity of incidents. MBDs other than psychoactive substance use (PSU) were associated with 59.2% (n = 74) of incidents and 66.7% (n = 18) of injuries. PSU was associated with 42.4% (n = 53) of incidents. Following PSU and MBDs other than PSU, repeat perpetrators were the next most prominent perpetrator category (24.8% n = 31) and were almost always associated with an MBD (93.5% n = 29).",

            "text": "Most interventions to reduce workplace violence focus on education and training for staff as a one-size fits all approach [2, 8] . However, there is very weak evidence of their effectiveness, suggesting interventions should be more targeted in their design. Including a focus on perpetrators may provide a more informed and tailored approach to violence prevention [2, 6, 7, 9] . In previous literature, perpetrators are generally categorised into patients, family members or others [10] . Emergency department nurses in Australia have indicated that they differentiate between violent indivduals, placing them among six categories. They then tailor their approach based on which category they fall in to. The six categories of perpetrators are: (i) No medical cause, (ii) Mental Health, (iii) Physical Health, (iv) Substance abuse/addiction, (v) Complexity of issues, (vi) Repeat perpetrators [2] . While qualitative descriptions have categorised perpetrators of violence based on the apparent underlying cause for aggression [2] , the epidemiology of violence in the ED is not clear due to a lack of empirical data [3, 9] . The majority of studies investigating characteristics of workplace violence use staff surveys, focussing on staff perception rather than objective incident data [1, 10] . Survey data has indicated that alcohol, drug intoxication and mental health issues are the most prevalent factors associated with violence in EDs, however the subjective self-reports from staff do not paint the whole picture [9, 11] . Recent reviews of the international literature highlight several studies, spanning over 25 years, that report on characteristics of violent incidents in EDs, and indicate that few studies include data sources beyond incident reports [1, 12] . Only four studies have incorporated incident reports and patient medical notes to provide detailed understanding of the characteristics of perpetrators. Each of these used varying methods and objectives, and all were conducted in metropolitan EDs [1, 12] . The consistent findings from hospital records indicate that verbal violence is most common type of violence, [1, 3, 10, 13] , perpetrators are predominantly male [1, 9, [14] [15] [16] , and psychoactive substance use is the most common precipitant to violence [1, 3, 9, 12, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Mental health issues as precipitants to violence is commonly yet inconclusively reported, with rates of associated mental health issues ranging from 14 to 78% [1, 9, 12, 15] .",

The categories include violence associated with (i) no medical problem (e.g. frustrated with waiting), (ii) physical health issue, (iii) mental and behavioural disorders (MBD), and (iv) repeat perpetrators. The MBD category has three sub-categories: Psychoactive substance abuse (PSU), MBDs other than PSU, and complex MBDs [2, 20] . Perpetrators were placed into the pre-defined categories based on patient presenting problems, diagnoses and narrative accounts in incident reports and patient notes. Previous medical history was collected from previous diagnoses that were recorded in the patient medical records, it is not known if these diagnoses were made in the ED or in other contexts. Perpetrators were considered repeat perpetrators if they were responsible for security alerts over multiple presentations or if an alert for previous violent behaviour was recorded.

This study provides much needed regional ED data and is the first study to apply ED data to the categories of perpetrators that ED staff differentiate between and approach differently. This will assist with better understanding of the breadth and depth of the issue and for more targeted efforts to reduce violence. One notable finding was that mental and behavioural disorders (MBD) was a perpetrator characteristic present in the majority of security alerts. This characteristic was also associated with an increased severity of incidents and perpetrating multiple incidents of violence. Incidents most commonly occurred in the first 4 h following arrival at hospital, on late shifts and in ED cubicles. Almost all perpetrators were patients, most incidents involved verbal violence, and more than half involved physical violence. Many of the perpetrator and situational characteristics observed in this study are similar to previous studies, with the main differences being an increased rate of self-harm and attempted absconding and a higher incidence of perpetrators presenting with and having a past history of MBDs [1, 3, 12] .",

The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine state that providing adequate community-based services for MBD patients should be a priority [23] . In the recent Covid-19 pandemic, two Australian studies have shown an increase in ED presentations for several MBDs in the context of decreasing total ED presentations [26, 27] . This may pose a unique challenge during times of crisis [23] and potentially lead to an increase in violence in the ED. In emergency situations where patients with MBDs do require the ED, Behavioural Assessment Units (BAU) have been recommended as a way to remove these patients from the chaotic ED environment [28, 29] . BAUs are co-located within the ED have been associated with decreased ED length of stay along with lower incidence of security alerts, mechanical restraint and therapeutic sedation, however controlled trials are still required to assess their effectiveness [28] .",

Violence in the ED impacts multiple disciplines and likely requires a multidisciplinary approach to interventions; including ED staff, ambulance services, police, psychiatric and community mental health services. The diversion of patients with MBD and PSU into community-based services is one example of a multidisciplinary approach [22, 24, 25, 30] . Violence in the ED appears to be part of a larger, societal problem with violence and risk-taking behaviour [2, 6, 9] , and public health approaches are thus needed to address the societal component of violence in the ED.

Accessing patient medical records was a strength of this study, validating the information found in incident reports and providing patient characteristics that were inaccessible from incident reports. One key limitation of this study is that the extent of under-reporting of violent incidents is not known. The incidence of violent incidents was lower at site 1, which may indicate different reporting procedures between sites. Missing data for many of the variables and the assumption that it was missing completely at random may limit the results. The study relies on the accuracy of documentation in the incident reports and patient notes. The documentation of MBDs was not standardised and often did not report a specific MBD, this will likely result in the Complex MBD category being underrepresented in the results. In addition, there was a lack of blood alcohol and illicit substance screening recorded in the patient notes; rather, history of substance abuse was often based on self-report. A prospective study design would likely allow for specific criteria to be recorded.",
