Although social distancing regulations were quickly strengthened, the outbreak continued to grow, causing increasing delays in tracing and testing. Further regulations were introduced, plus 'targeted testing' services for at-risk groups. Estimating the impact of individual NPIs could provide lessons about how outbreaks can be controlled without radical lockdown. However, the changing delays in confirmation time challenge current modelling methods. We used a novel approach aimed at disentangling and quantifying the effects of individual interventions.",

These interventions include not only social distancing measures but also contact tracing, which aims to identify the close contacts of cases, who are immediately quarantined or self-isolated, and tested. If confirmed, they are isolated in hospital and reported as cases with the label 'epi-link' (epidemiological link).",

For example, in Hong Kong, social distancing was relaxed during the period preceding the third wave, but re-introduction of measures even stricter than those before the relaxation did not stop expansion of the outbreak, because of decreased efficiency of the contacttracing system. 1 Variation in the load on contact tracing (e.g. the amount of people to be traced or tested) can affect its efficiency and hence the time between infection and confirmation (confirmation time). In the preceding paper, we analysed observational data from the third wave concerning the percentage of cases for which infection was not confirmed until after symptom onset (confirmation delay) and found that a rise in the proportion of such cases was associated with an increase in the number of recently confirmed cases. 1 Presumably, a higher number of infected cases results in more close contacts and hence increases the load on the tracing and testing system. 5 When tracing or testing capacity is limited or not sufficient, delays are likely to happen.",

This diagram shows, schematically, the time-course of transmission of infection from an index case to two secondary cases: Patient 1, confirmed relatively quickly, before the appearance of symptoms; and Patient 2, confirmed after symptom onset. To simplify comparison of these two secondary cases, the time of exposure (E), the time from transmission to the onset of infectiousness (latent period; white bar), the pre-symptomatic transmission period (blue), and the symptomatic period (orange) have been made identical for the two. Light colours indicate that the cases are assumed not to be transmittable due to hospital isolation. The index case in the diagram is assumed to have been recognised and tested because of the appearance of symptoms, so there is an unavoidable period between transmission and confirmation, which is a delay (Delay 1) between exposure and the onset of contact tracing (E ! O) for the secondary cases. We call this delay the covert period. Delay 2 (contact-tracing time), between the onset of contact tracing and the start of individual mobility restriction (O ! M) is affected by contact-tracing capacity. Contact-tracing delay is the sum of these two delays, i.e. the time between exposure and the start of individual mobility restriction (quarantine or self-isolation) (E ! M). Testing is performed during the period of mobility restriction, and confirmation of infection occurs some time later. The entire period between restriction and confirmation (Delay 3: M ! C) is the testing delay, which is mainly affected by testing capacity. Each case is isolated in hospital as soon as infection is confirmed. The confirmation time, i.e. the time between exposure and confirmation (C), is the sum of the delays in contact tracing and testing. Patient 1 is traced and tested quickly and is confirmed before the onset of symptoms. But for Patient 2, the whole process is more prolonged. Delay 2 (contact-tracing time) is longer and this individual is already symptomatic when traced and mobility restriction (called self-isolation because it is after symptom onset) is imposed. More time is also taken for testing and confirmation (Delay 3; testing delay). In cases like this, confirmed after the appearance of symptoms, we call the time between symptom onset and confirmation the confirmation delay (S ! C).

Starting on 9 July, there was a second sharp increase of Re to 3.2, before the first intervention, T1, on 11 July ( Figure 3C ). This second increase was caused by the effect, in the model, of decreasing efficiency in contact tracing and testing because the number of reported cases was larger than the capacity thresholds of contact tracing and testing (both about 20 cases; see Methods and Table S3 ). E.g. the average cumulative number of reported cases within 10 days had reached 110 on 10 July, when the peak of Re occurred.

One assumption we made in modelling the impact of confirmation delay on Re is that most of the cases are soon hospital isolated following their confirmation.

This suggests that, even when case numbers are very low, social distancing should be relaxed with great caution, to prevent a sudden rise in transmissions that can temporarily overwhelm the capacity of contact tracing and testing. It also highlights the importance of incorporating measures of tracing and testing efficiency into modelling, to give more reliable estimates of the dynamics of transmission, and hence to provide more accurate assessment of public health risk and interventions.",

The red dashed lines indicate the predicted mean values of daily cases with various combinations of interventions. No NPIs shows the predicted exponential growth if no new NPIs had been introduced. The other red dashed curves show the projected effects of T1 alone and of various combinations of social distancing measures (T1,2; T1,2,3; and T1\u22124) but without the interventions aimed at increasing contact-tracing efficiency: targeted testing (TT) and boosting of isolation capacity (IB) (see",
