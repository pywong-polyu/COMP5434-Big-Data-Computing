Expanded ambulatory and hospital testing help identify cases, but concerns persist regarding possible false-negative results that may compromise contact tracing and isolation efforts and in turn impede coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation and containment efforts. Prior work has shown potential false-negative results in nearly 20% of respiratory swab samples; however, these were smaller studies, pooled analyses, or studies conducted that varied substantially in test used, timing of testing, and comparator methods. [1] [2] [3] [4] Thus, these findings may not be generalizable to US hospital-based testing performed with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized tests in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-regulated laboratories. Reporting a true false-negative rate for RT-PCR testing is infeasible given the lack of an established gold standard, the need to use limited testing supplies sparingly for clinical purposes, and the variability in access to different testing platforms. As such, realworld evidence may offer a unique opportunity to indirectly examine test characteristics and address clinician and policy-maker concerns regarding false-negative results. 5 We report the observed false-negative rate of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalized patients in a large US-based health system early in the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were admitted between February 23, 2020, and April 24, 2020; were tested for SARS-CoV-2 within 48 hours of emergency department (ED) arrival; and were considered to have symptoms concerning for COVID-19. Symptoms were defined based on institutional implementation of CDC guidelines during the early pandemic to include lower respiratory tract infection (eg, fever, cough, or physician concern) given the changing information regarding COVID-19 risk factors. All testing was performed on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected by healthcare providers and placed into viral transport media (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). RT-PCR testing was performed locally using either an emergency use authorized (EUA) variation of the CDC protocol (n = 1,311), 6 GeneXpert Xpress (Cepheid; n = 635), or other (n = 1), or if the sample was sent out to a reference laboratory (n = 24). Internal validation data support the comparability of these assays, and a real-life application of these specific assays has been published. 7 This analysis was limited to patients who received a second SARS-CoV-2 test within 48 hours of ED arrival to identify patients still suspected of COVID-19 despite an initially negative test. The primary outcome, a potentially falsenegative test, was defined as a patient with an initial negative test result who had had a discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 based on either repeat testing or a clinical diagnosis. Medical records of all identified patients with positive second testing were manually reviewed for qualitative assessment. Furthermore, we performed a chart review of a subset of patients without a COVID-19 discharge diagnosis to assess for COVID-19. This study was approved by our institutional review board.",

Although NP swabs are considered the preferred upper airway specimen, the viral burden in the nasopharynx can be lower in later stages of COVID-19 potentially leading to false-negative results. 8, 9 Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage are more sensitive for detection of lower respiratory tract disease, but these are usually not available. Delayed testing early in the pandemic due to reagent limitations and more restrictive testing guidance could have led to these patients being overrepresented in our data set, potentially explaining the patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 despite negative testing. Additionally, test performance is dependent upon a high-quality specimen being obtained, and the quality of the original NP sample may have been affected by patient acuity and admission triaging decisions. However, second specimens would have been collected in an inpatient environment, where, in most cases, staff were educated on proper sample collection methods and staff collecting second samples were highly motivated to obtain an appropriate specimen. A small number of our patients had samples sent to an outside reference lab, and initial results may not have been back when a second specimen was obtained (6 patients). Our case finding was based on the assumption that patients still suspected of COVID-19 would undergo repeat testing within 48 hours of admission, but some patients may have died before a second specimen was collected (9 patients with 48-hour mortality without a second test), and others may have had testing >48 hours later or not at all.",
