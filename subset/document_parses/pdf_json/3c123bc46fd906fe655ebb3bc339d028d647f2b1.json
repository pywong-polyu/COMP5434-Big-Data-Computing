One of these therapeutic strategies suggests the use of immune response modulating drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (antimalarials) alone or in combination with azithromycin (macrolide antibiotic); the use of antivirals such as ritonavir and lopinavir have also been suggested. Although the clinical evidence supporting their use is scarce and mostly limited to in vitro studies, the off label use of these drugs as first-line therapy and even as prophylaxis has spread very quickly in face of the progression of the epidemic and the high mortality rate in susceptible populations. However, it is very important to note that all of these medicines can pathologically prolong the QT interval in patients at high risk by genetic predisposition (with congenital long QT syndrome or in patients with polymorphisms but without phenotypic expression) or those with acquired predisposition. This risk may be further increased by the wide interaction of these drugs with countless medications such as antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, anesthetics, and muscle relaxants, among others (http://www.covid19-druginteractions. org/).
