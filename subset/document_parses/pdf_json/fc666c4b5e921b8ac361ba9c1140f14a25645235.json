Viral diseases have had a major effect on history, causing more deaths than all wars combined. The first successful strategy against viral infection is difficult to date but certainly involved the empirically observed fact of immunity -that survivors of certain febrile diseases, such as smallpox, bearing the scars of illness, were forever protected from that disease but not from other diseases. From this originated the idea of deliberately inducing a mild form of the disease to protect the victim from contracting the severe form. This led to the strategy of vaccination to prevent disease. Antiviral drugs, which interfere with the life cycle of the virus in the host, are of more recent origin. Their use is grounded on knowledge of the details of how viruses infect and damage cells because viruses use the biochemical machinery of the living cell to replicate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The first scientific instance of vaccination against an infectious disease occurred in 1796 when Edward Jenner, drawing on the common knowledge that those with a history of cowpox never developed smallpox, inoculated cowpox material into the skin of young James Phipps, a local boy. When the boy was later inoculated with fully virulent material from a smallpox lesion, no disease resulted. Jenner named this process vaccination, from vacca, the Latin name for cow. This first published experiment in vaccination was preceded by similar empirical procedures of variolation in the Orient that were practiced for centuries. Since then, vaccines have been developed to prevent a wide range of viral diseases ( Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 707, "end": 715, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Vaccines"}, {"text": "The basic strategy behind vaccination is to present antigens to the immune system in such a way as to stimulate immunity against the fully virulent organism without causing disease. The vaccine antigens (whole attenuated or inactivated virus or protein subunits of virus) are processed in a way similar to that of the wild-type virus. When the vaccine is injected, the virus or viral proteins are taken up by macrophages, processed, and presented to helper T lymphocytes, which then orchestrate the immune response. The immune system is thus primed so that encounter with wild-type virus results in its elimination.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vaccines"}, {"text": "Initially, there were two basic methods for making viral strains suitable for vaccines (vaccine strains). In the first, a virus is 'inactivated' by exposure to chemical or physical agents that would 'kill' the virus, for example, by denaturing viral proteins important for attachment to and invasion of the cell, so that the virus is rendered noninfectious. Thus, inactivated virus does not replicate. Inactivated vaccines tend to be less reactogenic than attenuated vaccines and have the advantage that they do not revert to a virulent form. The Salk polio vaccine was inactivated by treatment of the virus with formalin.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vaccines"}, {"text": "In the second method for making vaccine strains, a virus is 'attenuated' by serial passage in cells or host tissues from other species, resulting in the production of viral strains that are specifically adapted to the tissues of the other species and therefore less virulent to humans. Thus, such a vaccine virus causes a mild infection and induces immunity against the virulent wild-type virus encountered in nature. These vaccines have the potential disadvantage of reverting to virulent form. An example is the Sabin polio vaccine, in which the three strains of poliovirus were serially passaged through monkey kidney tissue cells. There have been rare cases of reversion of Sabin vaccine strains to virulent form, and a few cases of paralytic poliomyelitis have resulted.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vaccines"}, {"text": "There are several other methods of producing vaccines in development, including subunit, vector, and DNA vaccines.

Because only the single viral protein is used, there is no danger of inadvertent infection with the virus. An example is the original hepatitis B vaccine, in which hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) was purified from the blood of hepatitis B carriers. This viral protein is now produced by recombinant DNA methods, involving no human blood products.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vaccines"}, {"text": "Vector vaccines consist of a relatively nonpathogenic virus incorporating a gene, from a virulent virus, which encodes antigenic protein. The strategy is that during the mild infection by the vector virus, protein from the DNA of the virulent virus is also presented to the immune system without actual infection by the virulent virus. The advantage of a vector vaccine is that the DNA of several different virulent viruses can be incorporated so that immunity is induced to more than one virulent virus. There are no vector vaccines currently available for human use. DNA vaccines are a variation on the vector vaccine theme. Here, a segment of viral DNA coding for an immunogenic peptide is injected directly into muscle, and synthesis of the peptide occurs in the host cell. The peptide is expressed on the surface of the cell in conjunction with a type 1 major histocompatibility complex molecule and is recognized by the immune system, which is then activated and primed. DNA vaccines are still under development and none is available for human use.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vaccines"}, {"text": "For a vaccine to be effective, it must induce the appropriate immune response. In general, both humoral and cellmediated immune responses are made, but each has varying importance. Thus, specific antibodies inhibit enteroviruses, whereas herpesviruses are suppressed by cell-mediated immunity. The precise type of immune response that is protective is unknown for most viruses, however. Furthermore, an inactivated virus or viral subunits are often not very immunogenic by themselves, and to generate a sufficiently robust immune response an adjuvant must be added to the vaccine formulation. Adjuvants enhance the immune response by various means, such as attracting macrophages by inducing a mild inflammation. Some adjuvants, such as Freund's complete adjuvant, consisting of mineral oil and nonviable mycobacteria, are too toxic for human use. Currently, aluminum salts and a combination of aluminum salts with phospholipid A (used in a recently approved bivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine) are the only adjuvants used in vaccines for human use.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vaccines"}, {"text": "Safety considerations are definitely very important and include determination of adverse effects of the vaccines, such as nonspecific febrile reactions, injection site erythema and induration, and allergic reactions to the vaccine virus or its vehicle.

The disease is characterized by dramatic and progressive neurological deficits leading to cardiovascular instability and death within a few days, after a long period from the time of exposure. The disease is very rare in North America because it has been eliminated from domestic animals and pets, and most cases now come from wildlife such as infected bats. Throughout the rest of the world, rabies poses a serious burden, with more than 55 000 deaths estimated annually by the World Health Organization.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Rabies"}, {"text": "The idea of using modified infectious material as protection from viral disease was adopted by Pasteur, who used attenuated rabies virus from infected rabbit spinal cord to protect dogs from rabies. His strategy, which was similar to what he did to produce a chicken cholera vaccine, was to take infected rabbit spinal cord and allow it to dry, which 'weakened' or attenuated the virus present in the cord. The longer the dessication, the weaker the virus would be until, at some point, the immune reaction induced by the attenuated virus would prevent infection by fully virulent virus. The Pasteur vaccine was first used publicly on 6 July 1885, in a young boy, Joseph Meister, who had had multiple bites from a rabid dog. He was administered 13 injections during a 10-day period and survived. The original Pasteur vaccine was thus cumbersome to administer, with multiple painful injections, and frequently led to neurological complications, which were termed 'neuroparalytic accidents.' The Fermi vaccine used live virus attenuated with phenol, and the Semple vaccine used phenolinactivated virus. Both contained neural tissue, however, and neuroparalytic accidents remained a problem. Fuenzalida first produced a myelin-free vaccine in 1956 by propagating virus in neonatal mouse brains. The first nonneural tissue-based vaccine was the duck embryo vaccine (DEV), which consisted of vaccine virus propagated in duck eggs. This was introduced in 1956. Although the incidence of neuroparalytic accidents was greatly reduced with DEV, the vaccine was not as immunogenic as the neural tissue-derived vaccines and required 14-23 daily injections. Human cells were used to develop rabies vaccines free of animal proteins, and the human diploid cell vaccine, the contemporary standard, was first developed in the early 1960s at the Wistar Institute by growing the Pitman-Moore strain of rabies virus in the WI-38 human cell line. Currently, the vaccine is produced by growing Pitman-Moore strain in the MRC-5 human fibroblast cell line and inactivating the virus in the supernatant with b-propriolactone, after which the inactivated virus is concentrated.

Most reactions in adults consist of soreness at the site of injection, headache, malaise, and nausea; fewer reactions occur in children.

Poliovirus was first isolated by Landsteiner and Popper in 1908. Approximately 1-5% of infections result in poliomyelitis, with patchy involvement of anterior horn cells and subsequent weakness that may be severe and permanent. The development of poliovirus vaccine is an epic tale of failed attempts, intense scientific research, and rivalry, followed by the introduction of two different successful vaccines and the eradication of the disease in the Western Hemisphere.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poliomyelitis"}, {"text": "The prospect of global eradication of poliomyelitis is not unrealistic. The first attempts at vaccination against poliovirus in the 1930s were plagued by inadequate attenuation of the virus and actually caused the disease in some of the trial subjects. Much needed to be learned. The demonstration that there were three distinct polioviruses was not achieved until 1949. There was no test for the attenuation of the viruses. There were no safety precautions against injecting neurally derived material. Scientific developments during the following 20 years led to the important realization that the virus is transmitted through fecal-oral contact and that the virus replicates in the gut before spreading to the nervous system. Further research led to the Salk vaccine, an inactivated poliovirus vaccine that was administered by intramuscular injection, and to the Sabin vaccine, an attenuated poliovirus vaccine administered orally. The trial of the Salk vaccine, begun in 1954 and completed in 1955, was done first in the United States and involved approximately 2 million subjects. The Sabin vaccine trials were done soon afterward in the Soviet Union. Wide use of these vaccines has essentially eliminated poliomyelitis in the Western Hemisphere. The rate of poliomyelitis in the United States decreased from 10.6 per 100 000 persons in 1958 to 0.43 per 100 000 persons in 1963. Vaccination of entire populations promises to eradicate the disease worldwide.

Most children with measles recover completely from the disease, but complications are not uncommon. These include bacterial superinfections, and in 1 of 1000 cases, a postviral acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurs that can be fatal or leave severe neurological deficits. Rarely, the virus becomes established in the brain, and in 1 of 1 million cases it leads to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a progressive degenerative disease of the brain, resulting almost always in death after a few months following a latent period of several years. Measles virus was first isolated and propagated in tissue culture by Enders and Peebles in 1954, and efforts at making measles vaccine followed soon thereafter. The Edmonston strain, named for the individual from whom it was first isolated, was the initial virus from which a vaccine was made. The Edmonston B strain, the actual strain used in the vaccine, was obtained from the original Edmonston isolate by serial passage in primary kidney cells (24 passages), primary human amnion cells (28 passages), chicken embryos (6 passages), and then in chicken embryo cells. This vaccine was first introduced in 1963 but was associated with a high rate of fever and rash. It was discontinued in 1975. Other vaccine strains that were much better tolerated were introduced several years before its discontinuation. One of these, the Moraten strain, introduced in 1968, was derived from the Edmonston B strain by an additional 40 passages in chicken embryo cells. The Schwarz strain was obtained from the Edmonston B strain by an additional 85 passages in chicken embryo cells and was used from 1965 to 1976. The Moraten vaccine is the only one used in the United States today. Other vaccine strains are used elsewhere throughout the world. The effectiveness of vaccination may be gauged from the fact that before vaccination 4 million cases of measles occurred annually in the United States, whereas there were only 309 cases in 1995.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Measles"}, {"text": "The difficulties in measles vaccine development are demonstrated by the formalin-inactivated measles vaccine, which was prepared from the Edmonston strain and used in the United States from 1963 to 1967. The vaccine provided only short-term protection against measles and left the recipients vulnerable to infection with measles virus. The clinical form that measles takes in these patients is atypical and severe and is marked by sudden onset of fever, headaches, dry cough, myalgias, and abdominal pain, followed by a rash beginning in the distal extremities. Most patients developed pneumonia, which resolved slowly. Patients with atypical measles had high titers of antibodies to many of the viral proteins but not to the viral fusion protein (F protein). It is thought that the formalin inactivation of the virus rendered the F protein nonimmunogenic and thus allowed cell-to-cell spread, resulting in a more widespread disease. The use of this vaccine was discontinued in 1967.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Measles"}, {"text": "Mumps virus is a paramyxovirus, which causes an acute painful parotitis in children. The disease is usually self-limited, but it can be complicated by meningitis and meningoencephalitis, with residual deficits. It can also result in sensorineural deafness. In adults, mumps has a higher rate of systemic complications and can cause orchitis in up to 40% of adult men and oophoritis and mastitis in a substantial proportion of adult women. Other organs may be involved as well. The virus for the first mumps vaccine was obtained from a young girl named Jeryl Lynn, the daughter of the master vaccinologist, Maurice Hilleman. It was passaged in embryonated hens' eggs and chick embryo cell cultures. The Urabe strain was obtained from a Japanese patient. The Jeryl Lynn strain vaccine was tested in two clinical trials, one in Philadelphia nursery school and kindergarten children during 1965-67 and one in Forsyth County, North Carolina, schoolchildren in 1966 and 1967. Mumps vaccine was first licensed for use in 1967. The number of cases of mumps in the United States in 1968 was 152 209, and this decreased to 2982 cases in 1985.

In 1940, the virus was linked by Norman Gregg to congenital cataracts in offspring of mothers who had rubella during pregnancy, and it was later realized that rubella during pregnancy could lead to multiple birth defects. Some of these are neurological and include deafness, blindness, and microcephaly, with subsequent mental retardation and motor and language difficulties. The disease can be complicated by arthritis and in 1 of 6000 cases by postviral ADEM. Rarely, the acute disease may be followed months or years later by progressive rubella panencephalitis, a progressive degenerative disease leading to death within a few months. The virus was isolated in 1962 by two different groups. Several vaccine strains were developed, but only one is currently used, the RA27/3 strain in a live virus vaccine. The virus was first isolated from the tissues of a fetus in 1965. It was serially passaged in a human diploid cell line WI-38 at two different temperatures and shown to be attenuated by inoculation into human volunteers. It was then further passaged to increase the attenuation in human diploid cell lines. The vaccine is given as a combination with measles and mumps vaccine. Vaccination against rubella has been exceedingly successful, with an incidence rate decreasing from approximately 30 cases per 100 000 persons in 1968, before the vaccine was licensed in 1969, to 128 cases in 1995 in the United States.

Complications of the disease include varicella pneumonia, hepatitis, cerebellar ataxia, and encephalitis. The disease tends to be severe in adults and the immunocompromised as well as in pregnant women, in whom the previously mentioned complications are more common. After acute infection, the virus assumes a latent state in sensory ganglia and reactivates as the host ages or when the host is immunocompromised. Reactivation results in shingles or zoster, a painful vesicular eruption located in the dermatome of the spinal nerve root in which reactivation has occurred. The pain of shingles can be quite severe and prolonged, occasionally for years after the episode of shingles, resulting in postherpetic neuralgia. Shingles is common and can affect up to 15% of the population living to the ninth decade. Shingles can affect the distribution of the trigeminal nerve and cause ophthalmic zoster, with blindness being a potential complication. The reactivation of VZV in sensory ganglia can also involve the spinal cord, resulting in myelitis. Varicella virus vaccine strain was originally obtained from a 3-year-old boy, whose last name was Oka, with otherwise uncomplicated chicken pox. The virus was isolated in primary human embryonic lung fibroblast (HELF) cell cultures and serially passaged in multiple cell lines, and these were sonicated to release free virus. The resulting vaccine Oka strain virus was found to be temperature sensitive and to be less pathogenic in skin explants than wild-type virus. There are also differences in DNA cleavage patterns between the vaccine Oka and wild-type strains of virus. Clinical trials with the Oka vaccine strain began in Japan in 1974. The vaccine was first given to 70 normal children and was found to be immunogenic and protective, with no significant side effects. The safety of this attenuated vaccine strain was demonstrated in 39 children with chronic medical conditions. Subsequent studies in Japan showed that the vaccine was safe to use in children with leukemia and other malignancies if chemotherapy was stopped 1 week before vaccination and resumed 1 week after. Studies in the United States showed that in children with cancer and kidney transplants, the vaccine was safe, although two doses were needed to guarantee optimal protection from chicken pox. The vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1995. It is used in healthy children and adults and, with appropriate precautions, in children with leukemia and renal disease.

The virus was first isolated in 1937 by Zil'ber and coworkers in the Soviet Union. Clinically, the disease may be biphasic, with an initial period of fever, malaise, headache, backache, and nausea. This is followed by an afebrile period of several days to 2 or 3 weeks, after which fever resumes, along with headache, confusion, paresis, seizures, and, in some cases, coma. Because of the tropism of the virus for anterior horn cells, surviving patients are often left with paralysis of neck and shoulder girdle muscles. Indeed, in the far eastern areas of the former Soviet Union, individuals who must prop their heads up are almost always victims of TBE. The central European form of the disease is less virulent than the far eastern form, in which mortality rates of 20-30% are reported. Older patients tend to have more severe form of the disease. The risk of infection in susceptible US military personnel living in highly endemic areas was estimated to be 0.9 cases per 1000 per month in the 1970s and early 1980s. The first vaccine against TBE was produced in 1937 using an inactivated virus prepared from infected mouse brain, and it was given to Soviet military personnel.

Influenza can be complicated by ADEM and, in children, encephalopathies including Reye's syndrome. The disease occurs in yearly epidemics, in midwinter, and every few decades a completely new strain appears and causes a pandemic. Some strains are very deadly, and the 1918 influenza pandemic caused tens of millions of deaths worldwide, dwarfing mortality from the concurrent world war. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were serious but did not have the lethal consequences of the 1918 pandemic. The virus was first isolated in 1933 by Smith, Andrewes, and Laidlaw. In 1935, neutralizing antibodies were detected in subjects given subcutaneous injections of influenza virus. Stokes et al., who demonstrated some degree of protection, performed the first trial of an influenza vaccine in 1936. The virus was grown in a suspension of mouse lung and injected into children. Further studies of influenza vaccination were carried out by the US Army beginning in 1942 and 1943 and used inactivated influenza virus. The benefit of the vaccine was clear-cut. This and other studies led to the licensing of influenza vaccines in the civilian population in 1945. In 1947, there was a dramatic failure of the vaccine during an influenza epidemic, and it was found that the vaccine produced immunity to the vaccine virus but not to the epidemic strain. This was because the epidemic strain was different antigenically from the vaccine strains, illustrating the effect of the antigenic change known to occur in influenza virus. There are two types of such change: (1) antigenic drift, in which the accumulation of mutations in the genes coding for the surface antigens of the virus render it sufficiently different from the previous strains that it can cause disease despite exposure to the previous virus, and (2) antigenic shift, in which there is reassortment of genes coding for the surface proteins. The origin of the new genetic material seems to be from strains circulating in birds. This experience led to the establishment of worldwide sentinel centers by the World Health Organization that monitor for new strains of influenza virus every year so that the new strains can be incorporated into the updated vaccine. This is an important activity because new pandemics are expected to occur in the future. Recent activity of concern has been a 2009 pandemic of influenza H1N1, so-called 'swine flu.' Additionally, a highly pathogenic strain of H5N1, 'avian flu,' emerged in the 1990s. Although cases in humans are few, requiring contact with sick poultry, there is a high mortality rate in people.

Thus, DNA viruses (such as herpesviruses) use cellular precursor molecules to replicate their DNA. DNA is composed of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) (deoxynu-cleoside \u00bcpurine or pyrimidine base \u00fe deoxyribose), and virally programmed enzymes use cellular dNTPs to synthesize viral DNA. Acyclovir is a guanidine analog in which the deoxyribose is replaced by an acyclic structure. It was originally synthesized by Elion and Hitchings, and it was the first 'designer drug,' specifically designed for the purpose of inhibiting DNA synthesis by viral polymerase. Acyclovir has two mechanisms of action. First, it inhibits viral DNA polymerase by competitively binding to the active site of the enzyme. Second, when acyclovir is inserted into a growing DNA chain, it terminates elongation. Acyclovir must be triply phosphorylated to be active. Acyclovir is first monophosphorylated by a virally encoded thymidine kinase and subsequently phosphorylated by cellular enzymes. Thus, acyclovir is active only in virally infected cells. Acyclovir is effective against herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), -2, and VZV infections but not against other herpesvirus infections. Gancyclovir, another guanidine analog, is notable for its effectiveness against cytomegalovirus (CMV). Acyclovir was one of the first agents shown to be effective in the treatment of herpes simplex encephalitis.

Initial clinical trials comparing the drug to placebo demonstrated a survival benefit in the short term, and the drug was licensed for use in AIDS in 1987. Other antiretroviral drugs followed, but the initial hope was short lived. Two main difficulties in using antiretroviral drugs became quickly apparent: the toxicity of the drugs and the fact that viral resistance to the drugs occurs readily because the virus replicates rapidly and resistance mutations arise readily because RT is an error-prone replicating enzyme. It is estimated that 10 10 virions are produced daily during HIV infection, and because there are only 10 5 nucleotide bases in the HIV genome, the rate at which mutants arise is very high. Indeed, a single HIV virion gives rise to a large number of viral variants -a 'swarm' or 'quasispecies.' Many of these viral variants will be resistant to whatever antiretroviral agent the patient is taking. Therefore, an initially good response to the drug will last only a few months.
