Delayed hypersensitivity reactions at the site of injections with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) 1 and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNtech) vaccines 2 are now known as 'COVID-arms'. Besides, cases of Rowell's syndrome 24 h after vaccination 3 and persistent exanthema have been recently reported. 4 Bostan and Yalici-Armagan 5 described the case of a 78-year-old man with thoracic herpes zoster (HZ) 5 days after COVID-19 vaccination. We wish to report an additional case from Finland.",

He presented pain and local redness after vaccination, as widely reported. 2 However, after a week, pain had not subsided and extended to the neck and the left hand. It also changed to a neuropathic pain. He also developed intense tiredness and noticed a rash on the left upper limb. Upon full examination, he displayed an herpetiform vesicular and erythematous rash on the left upper back (Fig. 1a) and lateral side",
