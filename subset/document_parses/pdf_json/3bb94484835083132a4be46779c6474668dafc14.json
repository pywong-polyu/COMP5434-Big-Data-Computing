He was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia at a different hospital approximately 10 days before presentation and was discharged with supportive care instructions as the patient only had mild symptoms and did not require supplemental oxygen.

He tested positive for COVID-19 and was placed on supplemental oxygen (without further treatment). From that medical facility, he was transferred to our hospital.

Ten days after the exenteration, he developed a left orbital hematoma confirmed by a CT orbit, measuring 67 x 57 mm ( Figure 6 ). Heparin was immediately discontinued. Within the next three days, his contralateral right eye became injected, fixed, and non-reactive to light. There was no evidence of a hematoma involving the right eye. Ophthalmology re-evaluated the patient and performed a right retrobulbar injection of 17.5 mg of amphotericin B. Within a month of his exenteration, his left eyelid developed dehiscence, and the orbital wall was surgically removed. The patient remained in the ICU for over one month for continued treatment and stabilization. He had a tracheostomy tube and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed.

Multiple mechanisms for this association have been proposed with concomitant DKA infection. Hypoxia secondary to COVID-19 leads to an exploitable environment, which is ideal for the germination of Rhizopus spores. Acidosis can be triggered by multiple mechanisms including the lactic acidosis seen with tissue hypoperfusion and sepsis in addition to the respiratory acidosis due to respiratory failure. These synergistic acidic mediums and systemic inflammation in turn cause hyperferritinemia, which provides a source of iron for the further dissemination of mucormycosis [2] . In hyperglycemic states of DKA, the staggering elevation of glucose levels leads to impaired neutrophil function and motility, thus inhibiting the immune system to combat this fungal pathogen [5, 7] .",

Most commonly, mucormycosis presents in the form of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis, involving the sinuses with a high likelihood of orbital and cerebral invasion. Presenting symptoms generally include fever, purulent discharge, and congestion, and later evolve to eschar formation [8, 10] . A close examination should be performed on presentation to assess for signs of orbital involvement such as periorbital swelling, chemosis, proptosis, and, in severe cases, blindness. Facial numbness is common and is secondary to the destruction of the trigeminal nerve branches. Cerebral spread can occur and presents generally with cerebral sinus thrombosis with cranial nerve deficits [10] .

In cases of rhinoorbital-cerebral mucormycosis, immediate ENT consultation with an endoscopic evaluation of the sinuses should be performed, and specimens should be evaluated for the presence of non-septate broad hyphae. Of note, the absence of hyphae with high clinical suspicion does not rule out the disease and further evaluation should be pursued. In cases of high clinical suspicion with or without suggestive histopathologic findings, an urgent CT scan of the sinuses, orbits, and head should be done to evaluate the extent of the disease and the presence of bony structures involvement [12, 13] . MRI is less sensitive in bony structure involvement; however, it should be performed to assess for further extension of mucormycosis [13] . Nevertheless, mucormycosis can be found in healthy patients and, in these cases, their presence in cultures is considered a contaminant in the absence of suggestive clinical signs.",

A delay in treatment of one week nearly doubles the 30-day mortality rate to 66% [14] . Amphotericin B exerts its activity by binding to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes leading to developing pores in the membrane, which leads to leakage of intracellular structures and eventual cellular death [15] . There have been adjunctive treatments with hyperbaric oxygen therapy in addition to local treatment with amphotericin B [14] . In the event that the disease is too advanced, orbital exenteration is the last resort that could leave a patient with disability and disfigurement; however, could be life-saving, as our case depicted [14] . Per Raghav et al., there have been positive outcomes with a clinical cell-based approach with mesenchymal stem cell therapy that have shown promising outcomes with a combination of shortterm antifungals, and it is important to note that this therapeutic method assessment is in clinical trials without any conclusive data as of yet [16] .",

Our patient was found to have substantial left-sided nasal necrotic debris that was confirmed to be mucormycosis, only 10 days after his COVID-19 diagnosis. In our case, the patient likely developed CST, four to five days prior to presentation when he began to have symptoms of vision loss, eyelid swelling, and headache. As mucormycosis was the likely triggering factor for his CST, he likely developed the exponential growth of mucormycosis within the first five days of his COVID 19 infection and acute DKA. This highlights that there is a short window (of days) in which complications from mucormycosis can occur. Of note, he was not on any immunosuppressants (dexamethasone) prior to the development of his mucormycosis, but rather, his underlying uncontrolled diabetes alongside COVID-19 pneumonia was the medium through which his mucormycosis developed.",

These inflammatory states, as seen in this report, can contribute to the severity and prognosis of mucormycosis. Prompt recognition and diagnosis of mucormycosis and its associated complications by physicians are of paramount significance. Expeditious administration of antifungal therapeutics along with surgical intervention is crucial due to the high mortality of this pathogen.
