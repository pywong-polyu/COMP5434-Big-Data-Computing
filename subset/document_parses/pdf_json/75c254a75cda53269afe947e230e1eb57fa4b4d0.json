Using Chinese online wildlife seizure news (2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018), we evaluated the interactions among enforcement operations, news frequency, and social engagement (i.e., whistle-blowing) frequency. Our results showed that intensive enforcement operations, which commenced after 2012, have social impacts by increasing the frequency of all seizure news significantly by 28% [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 5%, 51%] and those via whistle-blowing by 24% [95% CI: 2%, 45%], when compared to counterfactual models where possible confounding factors were accounted for. Furthermore, we revealed the potential interaction between enforcement seizure news with and without social engagement, and the consequential social feedback process. Of the species identified from 'whistle-blowing' news, up to 28% are considered as high conservation priorities. Overall, we expanded our understanding of the enforcement impacts to social dimensions, which could contribute to improving the cost-effectiveness of such conservation efforts.",

In addition, pandemics resulting from disease transmission between humans and wildlife, particularly as seen in recent times, might become more regular in the future (Gibb et al. 2020 ). Under such an anthropogenic environmental change scenario, we need to seek solutions that require a better understanding across the natural and social sciences, which includes engagement from all sectors of society (Dhanjal-Adams et al. 2016; Reddy et al. 2017) . Nevertheless, the science of behavior change and social influences has not received adequate attention in conservation science and practice (Cowling 2014; Cinner 2018; Nielsen et al. 2021) .",

Evaluating its evidence-based effectiveness and impacts is a priority in nature conservation (Baylis et al. 2016) . Many researchers focus on evaluating the enforcement impacts on species protection (Frank and Wilcove 2019; Ribeiro et al. 2019) and potential ecological risk such as species invasion (Cardador et al. 2017 ). Yet, there is limited understanding of its social impact in conservation policy implementations and practices, where a progressive tightening of law enforcement could be more effective in influencing social norms and thereby compliance behavior (Keane et al. 2008; Arias 2015; Acemoglu and Jackson 2017; Salazar et al. 2019; Rizzolo 2021) . As such, integrating human and social dimensions into law enforcement may promote sound conservation policymaking (Cowling 2014; Reddy et al. 2017; Sas-Rolfes et al. 2019) .",

Although there may be some factors that could impede the effectiveness of enforcement actions (e.g., limited resources, poverty, power dynamics and clandestine nature of the illegal activities), evidence exists that better allocation of enforcement, incorporating voluntary compliance and appropriate community and social engagement could facilitate effective natural resource management (Arias 2015; Dhanjal-Adams et al. 2016; Cooney et al. 2018; Norris et al. 2018; Salazar et al. 2019) . Social engagement from non-governmental organizations or the general public through whistle-blowing on illegal activities plays a prevalent and broad role in law enforcement, particularly when laws are consistent with prevailing norms (Acemoglu and Jackson 2017) . Indeed, whistleblowing with incentives has been widely used to facilitate the timely detection of corporate fraud in business areas (Andon et al. 2018) . Recent evidence in China also showed that social engagement in environment governance via whistle-blowing could have a positive and direct impact on the control of industrial air pollution and the risk of disease transmission during the outbreak of the pandemic (Chen and Chen 2020) . Although whistleblowing is also emerging in protecting wildlife as a prosocial engagement, its potential interaction with law enforcement and conservation has received limited attention (Leavitt et al. 2021) .",

Our goal is also to understand the role of social engagement through the act of whistle-blowing in enforcement efficiency and in wildlife conservation impacts. In our context, we evaluate conservation impacts indirectly through the extent to which high conservation priority species, those of national protected status or international threatened status, are discovered from whistle-blowing. Through expanding our understanding of enforcement impacts to the social dimensions, we could provide evidence-based guidance for future strategies that optimize both enforcement efforts and social engagement to address conservation challenges.",

Under this scenario, we would expect public perceptions for wildlife conservation to improve (either unconsciously or intentionally) with increasing exposure to information and the formation of social norms triggering pro-social engagement and stewardship of wildlife protection (Nolan et al. 2008; House et al. 2020) . If this happens, we would also expect the intensification of enforcement efforts to increase the frequency of social engagement via whistle-blowing (A2), as well as the frequency of normal seizure news (i.e., ones that are not related to whistle-blowing). Further, we propose that these two categories of seizure news (i.e., whistle-blowing or not) may interact in complex ways (A3). Furthermore, we postulate that social engagement via whistle-blowing could also have an important role in delivering conservation impacts (A4), with respect to the numbers of species across different conservation statuses (e.g., threatened status, national protected status or international trade-regulated status).",

Specifically, on combatting illegal wildlife activities, nationwide enforcement operations were periodically conducted by National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) and General Administration of Customs. We collected detailed information about all nationwide enforcement operations since 2003 from the Forestry Police Section of China Forestry Yearbook (CFY 2020; Table S1 ). These enforcement operations were targeting any illegal activities that threatened wildlife, such as poaching, domestic and international trafficking. The temporal trends showed that intensive enforcement operations commenced around December 2012 (Fig. 2a) , which coincided with the key national governance strategy of 'Ecological Civilization'. This allowed us to explore specifically the social impacts of enforcement by comparing their patterns pre-and post-December 2012 in China.

As such, the social engagement in environmental governance through whistle-blowing is encouraged and may be seen as a normative pro-social behavior in China .

Reports originating from official agencies are widely known to raise awareness among the media and public about enforcement efforts, as well as relaying legality and conservation information (i.e., a form of public outreach). Media outlets also publish related reports regularly with similar intentions. However, there is no standardized format for seizure news as they are produced by multiple sources (e.g., official agency media office or local media outlets). As such, we used purposive sampling to collect online news on seizures on Baidu News (https://news.baidu.com/). Baidu is by far the largest search engine in China, fulfilling a similar function to Google, and has been applied to IWT research (e.g., Ni et al. 2018) . We conducted the search in March 2019 and the search was done backwards in time beginning with 31 December 2018 until the earliest news we could find. The final period of news reporting was therefore limited from 1st January 2003 to 31st December 2018. The key words we used are in Simplified Chinese with meanings similar to ''wildlife'' and ''seized or smuggling or poaching'', which are widely used technical terms related to Chinese laws on wildlife protection. In this study, we only considered enforcement operations and seizure from all forms of IWT (e.g., Fig. 1 Proposed framework of the relationship between enforcement and social impact on pubic engagement. The arrows illustrate the proposed pathways with specific assumptions from intensified enforcement to the social impacts indicated by seizure news reports and social engagement via whistle-blowing seizure news reports. Law enforcement could amplify the social impacts by promoting seizure news reports (A1). The intensification of enforcement efforts also could have important effects on forming social norms and increasing the frequency of social engagement via whistle-blowing (A2). There could be a mutually reinforced interaction between enforcement and social engagement on invoking stewardship of wildlife protection. These two categories of seizure news (i.e., whistle-blowing or not) may interact in significant and complex ways (A3). In return, social engagement could have an important role in delivering conservation impacts (A4)",

While it is likely that we may have left out certain confounding factors, we tried to capture some of the more meaningful ecological and social influences with the best data available. Further, to evaluate the robustness of our result on A2, we conducted a monthly model (Model 3) to evaluate the impact of intensive IWT enforcement operations (after December 2012) on the number of monthly whistle-blowing seizure news reports, using normal seizure news as confounding covariate. Because both categories of reports are based on enforcement activities during the same duration, we assumed that the normal news could capture the confounding ecological and social changes and hence allowing us to evaluate the social impact of intensive enforcement.",

It is a widely used method for inference on directed interactions in complex systems of many variables, with the advantages in situations where there is one or more highly autocorrelated variables (Barrett et al. 2010) . It originated in the field of econometrics but has since found widespread application in many fields such as in time series inference on stochastic processes with references to energy policies (Troster et al. 2018 ) and cultural change (Jackson et al. 2019) . For time series data, x t and y t , Grangercausality is a method for determining whether one series is likely to provide more information about future values of the other than past values of itself alone (Granger 1980) . In our case, we are trying to determine whether period x 1 (the time series of the number of normal seizure news monthly) statistically provides more information about future values of y 1 (the time series of the number of whistle-blowing news monthly) than past values of y 1 alone; and vice versa. If so, then two time series are said to cross-correlate and interact with each other on temporal ordering. (Supplementary for equations).",

            "text": "In addition, the public may become partly influenced by the growing information exposure, albeit unconsciously, in the online news environment (Nolan et al. 2008) . When social engagement via whistle-blowing on wrongdoing becomes widespread and normatively appropriate, such behavior could develop into social norms thereby promoting prosocial behavior (Bergquist et al. 2019; House et al. 2020) . Moreover, our finding suggests that 'top-down' effect (e.g., law enforcement promotes social norms and engagement) might interact and lead to 'bottom-up' feedback (e.g., social concerns and engagement facilitate enforcement efforts) (Fig. 4) . Future conservation efforts on strengthening law enforcement efforts could incorporate our understanding of the social impact and its positive feedback, by considering the interplay between law enforcement and social norms (Acemoglu and Jackson 2017; Rizzolo 2021) . Moreover, drawing from our insight, future design of behavior change strategies should encourage social engagement, where it is essential to increase selfefficacy about how to act and strengthen the social support Notably, we observed that the surge in law enforcement operations in late 2012 appeared to coincide with China's commitment to the 'Ecological Civilization' ideology first proposed in November 2012 (Xiao and Zhao 2017) . Meanwhile, many efforts have been carried out to mainstream biodiversity conservation and improve public conservation awareness in China (Zhang and Yin 2014; Olmedo et al. 2020) . As such, it would be important to further explore in-depth the interaction between enforcement and social impacts. Media reports could be utilized as one of the main approaches to continuously monitor this interaction, as well as to strengthen social feedback (Wu et al. 2018) . With China's goal to fulfill the ecological vision (Mi et al. 2021) , enforcement agencies could leverage the growing trend of social impacts to deliver conservation outcomes. Having the right conditions such as appropriate social norms could also maximize the benefits of social engagement in conservation, as well as environmental issues . Furthermore, monitoring the interaction between enforcement and social engagement, and exploring feedback mechanism in various regions and context could guide the implementation on where and when public outreach efforts could be enhanced for positive social impacts as we face growing environmental issues (e.g., biodiversity conservation).",

            "text": "For the conservation impacts, we noticed that whistleblowing and normal seizure news in China both contribute to a substantial percentage of high conservation priority species (22%-43%), though the absolute numbers are much lower for the former than the latter. The low numbers and proportion (17 out of 60) from whistle-blowing news might be due to the highly clandestine nature of the illegal wildlife activities of high conservation priority species, or the rudimentary conservation knowledge that the public are simply alerting the authorities to any perceived illicit activities. Besides, there is a higher probability for the public to encounter low conservation priority species, which are relatively more common. This evidence would be beneficial for future conservation intervention designs, aiming at enhancing social engagement in conservation governance. For instance, increasing a cadre of volunteers or professionals with related training and capacity might contribute to more targeted whistle-blowing (e.g., birdwatchers on illegal bird trade). Improving conservation knowledge about wildlife could potentially increase public whistle-blowing knowledge on species with high conservation priority (Keane et al. 2011; Green 2016 Chi-Squared Test was conducted on conservation concern for exclusively Normal and Whistle-blowing groups: IUCN Red List status: v 2 = 0.41, df = 1, p = 0.520; National protected level: www.kva.se/en and enforcement inefficiency should be avoided. Therefore, further efforts are needed to empower the public and encourage 'trained' volunteers to focus on high conservation priority species, in addition to certain species of low conservation need that may require immediate conservation action, to raise and improve overall enforcement efficiency and conservation successes. Enforcement agencies could also lay the foundation for social engagement to help meet the challenges posed by the increasingly concealed and organized illegal IWT (Sas-Rolfes et al. 2019), such as leveraging citizen science on intelligence gathering platforms with digital technologies (e.g., Walsh and O'Connor 2019; Chauhan and Gallacher 2021) . For example, in China, one of the online whistleblowing platforms is on one of the most popular social media platforms (i.e., WeChat) through the official account called ''Tencent For The Planet''. The platform was jointly launched in 2015 by Tencent and several international conservation organizations (e.g., International Fund for Animal Welfare), with support from the main governmental agency responsible for conservation in China (i.e., NFGA). Optimizing the whistle-blowing platforms could either promote enforcement efficiency or increase public perceived behavior control, which could in turn motivate more people to participate (Kl\u00f6ckner 2013; Chauhan and Gallacher 2021) . Future research could use the platforms to evaluate the effectiveness of social engagement and explore the trigger mechanism of public whistle-blowing to unpack the decision-making processes in conservation, as these details are almost always omitted in the news. Notably, while new technologies to improve social engagement have been developed in criminology (e.g., Walsh and O'Connor 2019; Chauhan and Gallacher 2021), implementing them in the IWT context and across various different societies might be challenging. Related regulatory efforts will need to carefully consider the social context, local norms and acceptability of such actions to minimize unnecessary side effects. Furthermore, proper legal and administrative protocols must be in place and the enforcement agencies must ensure that informants are sufficiently protected from being victims of violent retaliation.",

            "text": "Admittedly, although we attempted to extract and include as much online seizure news reports as possible, there may still be some potential sampling issues. Nevertheless, we were able to use the publicly accessible 'independent' Chinese criminal court verdict data from 'Openlaw' (http://openlaw.cn/) to cross-validate the extent of temporal (r = 0.97, p \\ 0.001) and geographical congruence (r = 0.79, p \\ 0.001) in our online news sample, giving us confidence in our results (Supplementary Methods, Fig. S4 ). Additionally, although anonymous whistleblowing were explicitly mentioned in news, there remains the possibility of inaccurate estimation of such news due to various reasons. As such, we partially evaluated the classification accuracy of the whistle-blowing news using court verdicts. Using two key provinces as examples, we manually and thoroughly matched 78 of 197 news reports (about 40%) with corresponding court verdicts from Yunnan province and 56 of 193 news (about 30% match rate) from Guangdong province. The low rate may be because not all seizure in news reached the criminal courts (i.e., those under Administrative Penalty Law in China where the cases are generally less severe than crimes), and relatively fewer verdicts from before 2013 were recorded in 'Openlaw'. Despite this, we still uncover a relatively high accuracy classification on whistle-blowing news of the matched data (Yunnan: 0.81 [95%CI: 0.70, 0.89]; Guangdong: 0.79 [95%CI: 0.66, 0.88]) and higher proportion of whistle-blowing in news (Table S5) . Moreover, although the interpolated and extrapolated sampling coverages on seized species indicated the detected species sampling is nearly complete (estimated at 93.6% for all seizure news) (Fig. S5 ), our seizure news likely also suffer from taxonomic bias. Similar to previous study, there appears to be more underreporting in amphibians and reptiles than birds and mammals (Thomas-Walters and Raihani 2017). This potentially limits our comprehensive understanding on the impact of social engagement via whistle-blowing, especially on other groups such as plants (Sas-Rolfes et al. 2019) , which are also heavily trafficked in China and globally (e.g., orchids, Hinsley et al. 2018 ).",

Our results illustrate the positive social impact of nationwide enforcement operations on news reporting and pro-social engagement (i.e., whistle-blowing) in China. This form of social engagement could produce some conservation impacts, where species of high conservation priorities have been seized. Our findings, as seen across China and a handful of provinces, provide data-driven guidance for enforcement strategies to the governments to optimize enforcement efforts through promoting social impact via social engagement. We conclude that leveraging our understanding of the interactions between IWT enforcement operations and social engagement could assist governments to achieve the mutual empowerment and social amplifications required to scale-up cost-effective efforts to address IWT and other conservation challenges.",
