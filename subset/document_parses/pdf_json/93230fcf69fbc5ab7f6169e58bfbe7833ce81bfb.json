These measures may have led to a disruption of daily life and affected food-related behaviors. This paper investigates the state of food waste management in Serbia and COVID-19's direct effect on consumer awareness, food consumption, and food waste behaviors. The study is based on an online survey using a structured questionnaire administered in Serbian from May 13 until June 13, 2020, through the Google forms platform. A total of 1212 valid answers were collected, mainly from female, young, and high-educated people. The survey results suggested that (i) household food waste in Serbia is low and there is a positive attitude toward food waste prevention; (ii) food waste increased during the COVID-19 pandemic; (iii) consumers reduced the number of shopping trips and shopped more than usual during the pandemic. This study contributes to a better understanding of consumers' consumption habits and attitudes toward food waste to prevent and reduce it.",

Nevertheless, in the context of increasing food demand due to the global population growth and extending pressures on natural resources, food loss and waste (FLW) is a growing global issue (FAO 2019 (FAO , 2011 HLPE 2014) . Food loss and waste (FLW) occur throughout the entire food supply chain, from harvesting to consumption. Food loss happens upstream of the food chain (e.g., harvesting, transport, storage, and processing), while food waste refers to food lost at retail and consumption levels (FAO 2011 (FAO , 2019 HLPE 2014) . According to FAO (2019) , \"Food waste is the decrease in the quantity or quality of food resulting from decisions and actions by retailers, food services, and consumers.\" Food wastage at the household level is \"the food brought home or prepared at home but not consumed\" (Grandhi and Appaiah Singh 2016, p. 474) .",

It has also been confirmed that food waste increase when consumers shop from large supermarkets rather than from small shops or local markets (J\u00f6rissen et al. 2015) . These factors influence consumer behavior in a specific way and vary from one person to another, from one era to another (rural/urban), or from country to another. Although food waste is a global concern, the scope and nature of food waste differ substantially between countries (Roodhuyzen et al. 2017) . Additionally, food waste is mainly the result of poor food-management routines and behavior. Food-related behaviors and routines such as planning, purchasing, storing, cooking, eating, and managing leftovers, significantly affect food waste performance (Schanes et al. 2018 ). Reducing FW is critical for economic, environmental, and social reasons, and it is imperative to have a greater comprehension of how the COVID-19 outbreak has altered household consumption, as well as FW patterns and behavior (WRAP 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disturbed household food buying, altered shopping habits, and affected food waste. Several voices have come forth to warn of COVID-19's destabilizing effect on agri-food systems and food consumption ). Undoubtedly, due to the strict measures imposed by governments to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread, food management and consumption patterns shifted drastically (Principato et al. 2020 ). The crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has changed global waste generation mechanisms, resulting in unforeseen changes in waste composition and quantity (Kalina and Tilley 2020) , especially in the case of food waste (Sharma et al. 2020) . Household food waste generation can either increase due to panic buying or decrease if consumers better use stored food and leftovers (Aldaco et al. 2020) . Indeed, on the one hand, at the onset of the outbreak, customers concentrated on stocking food to mitigate the risk of future shortages. Many reports of panic buying of nonperishable food products (e.g., pasta, rice, canned goods, flour, and frozen food) have been recorded worldwide (Baker et al. 2020) . Panic buying increased household food waste generation, especially for perishable products, due to storage limitations, bad cooking habits, or overcooking (Cosgrove et al. 2021; Cranfield 2020) .",

            "text": "On the other hand, the COVID-19 outbreak has created unanticipated possibilities for sustainable food production and consumption (Sarkis et al. 2020 ). Many consumers have embraced thriftiness and cut down on food waste during the coronavirus crisis. Several researches, in Italy (Principato et al. 2020) , the USA (Babbitt et al. 2021; Rodgers et al. 2021) , the UK (Waste and Resources Action Program (WRAP) 2020), Russia (Ben Hassen et al. 2021a), Japan (Qian et al. 2020) , Tunisia (Jribi et al. 2020 ), Lebanon (Ben Hassen et al. 2021b ), Mexico (Vargas-Lopez et al. 2021 ), or Qatar (Ben Hassen et al. 2020 ) revealed that household food waste decreased. In fact, during the pandemic, households adopted a wide range of positive food management strategies, such as more pre-shop planning (e.g., making a list), better inhome food storage, and creative approaches to cooking/prep (e.g., batch cooking and using up leftovers). Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic improved food shopping performance and prompted a favorable behavioral shift vis-\u00e0-vis food waste (Jribi et al. 2020) . Adopting these strategies is motivated by several factors: avoiding going to the shops, since shopping in a grocery store has a perceived risk; saving money; not wanting to run out of food, and having more time. Also, it might be because people stayed inside for more extended periods, allowing them to devote more time to kitchen chores without feeling rushed (Vargas-Lopez et al. 2021) . However, as Jribi et al. (2020) highlighted, consumer behavior changes toward food waste are likely to be influenced more by the socioeconomic context of the COVID-19 lockdown (i.e., food availability, limited mobility, and loss of income) than by a proenvironmental concern.",

On March 6, 2020, Serbia confirmed its first case of COVID-19 (The Government of the Republic of Serbia 2020). Consequently, a state of emergency was declared on March 15. Later, Serbia adopted several containment measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19: nationwide lockdown, closure of nonessential business, closure of school and universities, remote work, etc. (\u0160anti\u0107 and Anti\u0107 2020) . However, these measures may have affected attitudes and behaviors related to food, such as food waste. Also, after several years of substantial growth, the Serbian economy had a recession of 3% in 2020 (World Bank 2020). Overall, Serbia is recognized as a medium food waste polluter when it comes to food waste quantities. However, there is no accurate information or official statistics on how much food is wasted in Serbia. According to the National Geographic Srbija (2020), 35 kg of food is thrown per capita per year. Djekic et al. (2019) suggest that, annually, Serbian households discard 198,712 tons of food waste associated with 687,346 tons of CO 2 emission. Overall, research on food waste in Serbia is scarce. Since the COVID-19 infection is new and we do not know how long it will last, there is a need for information and knowledge to assess its impacts on food consumption patterns. In this context, the present paper investigates the state of food waste in Serbia.",

The study adopted the snowball-sampling technique, and participants were asked to roll out the online questionnaire to their acquaintances and relatives. The survey administered in Serbian was disseminated through various communication channels such as social media (Twitter and LinkedIn) and email. Before participating in the study, all participants provided their digital informed consent for data sharing and privacy policy. The questionnaire consisted of 30 one-option and multiple choices questions structured in 8 different sections: 1) Sociodemographics; 2) Food purchase behavior and household food expenditure estimation; 3) Knowledge of food labeling information; 4) Attitudes toward food waste; 5) Extent of household food waste; 6) Economic value of household food waste; 7) Information needed to reduce food waste; 8) Food waste and shopping behavior during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Furthermore, approximately one-third of consumers buy more food than usual (24.6% more and 5.5% much more), which might denote panic buying and food stockpiling behaviors among Serbian consumers following the outbreak of COVID-19. This behavior has undoubtedly been influenced by limited movement and panic over food shortages. Approximately proportional to the increase in food supplies, the quantities of food thrown away also increased. During the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, 26.7% of the respondents confirmed throwing more food and only 8.1% threw less or much less.",

            "text": "First, in Serbia, food is mainly bought in hyper/supermarkets, as in most countries in the Western Balkans region (Berjan et al. 2019; Bogevska et al. 2020; Preka et al. 2020 ), because supermarkets have become dominant in global food supply chains (Machado et al. 2017) and \"buying in this type of store has an element of pleasure\" (Farhangmehr et al. 2000) . The place of purchase of food affects the individual purchased quantities of food. Regarding buying frequency, more than half of our cohort goes shopping every two days, which certainly affects the amount of food thrown away. Rationality in shopping can be achieved by following a preprepared list, but only about a third of the participants do it. Moreover, we noticed some differences in sociodemographic factors, such as the value of purchased food, age, occupation, and household composition. Undeniably, as observed in Japan by Qian et al. (2020) , larger families and younger people tend to purchase excessive food. Households with children are more likely to buy more food than single-person households or couples without children. Also, older individuals have a greater awareness of household food waste and consequently buy less food than younger adults. Individuals who are 65 or older have been shown to engage in food waste-reducing practices such as meal preparation in advance and having a greater understanding of food waste than younger adults (Quested et al. 2013) . Also, the difference in occupation implies variance of income and lifestyle. Individuals in paid work (fulltime or part-time) have more income and consequently tend to buy more food than students, unemployed, etc. Second, consistent with our hypothesis H1, the results showed that household food waste in Serbia is low, as in most developing countries in the Balkan region (Berjan et al. 2019; Bogevska et al. 2020; Va\u0161ko et al. 2020; Yildirim et al. 2016) and less than what Djekic et al. (2019) determined for Serbia in 2019. FW in Serbia is significantly lower than in developed countries [e.g., from 21% (Gunders 2012) to 30% (Yu and Jaenicke 2020) in the US, 22% in the UK (WRAP 2020), and 21-35% in the EU (Caldeira et al. 2019) ], taking into account the limitations regarding different methodologies used for FW calculations (Br\u00e4utigam et al. 2014 ) and that there are differences between studies and in the reliability of data (Corrado and Sala 2018) . Further, the most wasted food groups were cereals and bakery products, fruits, and vegetables. Due to their specific physiological and microbiological characteristics, fruits and vegetables are highly perishable products that can end up in the bin if they are not adequately preserved. Because it is susceptible to stalling and spoiling, consumers find that old bread is less attractive than fresh. These results confirm those observed in Serbia by Djekic et al. (2019) and other European countries such as UK (Quested et al. 2011) and Switzerland (Visschers et al. 2016) .",

The overrepresentation of women and educated individuals jeopardized the sample's representativeness and, as a result, the degree to which *Scale: I buy a lot less than usual = 1; I buy less than usual = 2; I buy as same as usual = 3; I buy more than usual = 4; I buy a lot more than usual = 5. **Scale: It has become much less = 1; less = 2; has not changed = 3; more = 4; much more = 5 results could be generalized to the whole adult population in Serbia. We believe this is related to the cultural context in Serbia and the Balkans in general, where women are in charge of cooking and food management in most households. Consequently, women were more interested in participating in the survey. Furthermore, persons who are not web-literate, as well as the elderly, are often excluded from online surveys. The limitations described above are prevalent in CAWI, frequently used in surveys (Couper 2000; Evans and Mathur 2018; Monzon and Bayart 2018) . However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, online surveys can collect data remotely, a significant benefit when social distancing is necessary, and face-to-face interviews are impossible and/or unsafe.",

First, the results showed that household food waste in Serbia is low and there is a positive attitude toward food waste prevention. Second, most participants cook meals from fresh ingredients several times a week and have developed cooking skills. In addition, it is a common practice in Serbia to store and eat leftovers during the next few days. Third, regarding food labeling knowledge, we observed confusion about the interpretation of food labels. Hence, an appropriate media campaign should be conducted to bring consumers' attitudes and behaviors in line with food safety standards. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic led consumers to go shopping less often, buy larger quantities of food, and, consequently, throw away more food than before. The increase of household food waste in Serbia during the pandemic might have been triggered by panic buying. This suggests that raising consumers' awareness through effective, multichannel information and communication campaigns, as well as ensuring a regular supply of agri-food markets, is fundamental to prevent household food wastage during crisis situations such as pandemics.
