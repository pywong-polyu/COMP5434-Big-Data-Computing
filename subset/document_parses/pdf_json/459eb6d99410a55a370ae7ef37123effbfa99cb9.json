            "text": "The current COVID-19 pandemic has a devastating global impact and is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to human host cells through interaction of its receptor binding domain (RBD) located on the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells. RBD binding to ACE2 is a critical first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral attachment occurs in dynamic environments where forces act on the binding partners and multivalent interactions play central roles, creating an urgent need for assays that can quantitate SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 under mechanical load and in defined geometries. Here, we introduce a tethered ligand assay that comprises the RBD and the ACE2 ectodomain joined by a flexible peptide linker. Using specific molecular handles, we tether the fusion proteins between a functionalized flow cell surface and magnetic beads in magnetic tweezers. We observe repeated interactions of RBD and ACE2 under constant loads and can fully quantify the force dependence and kinetics of the binding interaction. Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 interaction has higher mechanical stability, a larger free energy of binding, and a lower off-rate than that of SARS-CoV-1, the causative agents of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. In the absence of force, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD rapidly (within \u22641 ms) engages the ACE2 receptor if held in close proximity and remains bound to ACE2 for 400-800 s, much longer than what has been reported for other viruses engaging their cellular receptors. We anticipate that our assay will be a powerful tool investigate the roles of mutations in the RBD that might alter the infectivity of the virus and to test the modes of action of neutralizing antibodies and other agents designed to block RBD binding to ACE2 that are currently developed as potential COVID-19 therapeutics.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID- 19) , which emerged in late 2019. SARS-CoV-2 particles carry ~100 copies of the trimeric viral glycoprotein Spike (S) on their surface 1 , giving the appearance of an eponymous corona around the virus. Like SARS-CoV-1, which caused an outbreak in 2002-2004, SARS-CoV-2 attaches to human host cells by S binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (Fig. 1A,B) . Specifically, each S trimer carries receptor binding domains (RBD) at the tip of the three S1 domain that can bind to ACE2 (Fig. 1A,B) . Binding of the virus to host cells occurs in dynamic environments 7, 8 where external forces act on the virus particle. In particular in the upper and lower respiratory tract, coughing, sneezing, and mucus clearance exert mechanical forces 9, 10 that the virus must withstand for productive infection. In addition, standard binding assays suggest dissociation constants for isolated SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 in solution in the range K d ~ 1-100 nM (Supplementary Table 1) , while the estimated concentration of S in vivo is ~1 pM, based on 7\u22c510 6 viral copies per ml sputum 7 and 100 S proteins per virus 1 \u2212 orders of magnitude lower than the measured K d . To enhance both avidity and force stability, SARS-CoV-2 attachment to host cells very likely involves multivalent interactions. The homotrimeric nature of S, combined with the dense coverage of the viral capsid surface by S trimers 1 and the observation that ACE2 clusters on the apical site of cells 3 imply a high local density of binding partners. Consequently, an initial binding event could rapidly lead to further engagement of additional ligand-receptor pairs 11 as has been suggested for a number of other viruses, including influenza, rabies, and HIV 12, 13, 14 . Stable binding of S to ACE2 enables further downstream events such as cleavage of S by furine or TMPRSS2 proteases 5, 11, 15 , triggering conformational changes, and ultimately fusion with the cell membrane and cellular entry. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its interaction with ACE2 have been the target of intense research activity, as they are critical in the first steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection and constitute a major drug target in the current search for treatments of COVID-19. Further, differences in binding between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs have been linked to the different observed patterns in lower and upper respiratory tract infections by the two viruses 5 . Despite its importance, many questions about RBD ACE2 interactions, in particular about their stability under constant external force, are unresolved. Consequently, there is an urgent need for assays that can probe the affinity and kinetics of the interaction under controlled external forces and that can mimic the effect of multivalent interactions in vivo by positioning the ligand-receptor pair in spatial proximity at an effective concentration much higher than in solution-based methods.",

Our assay utilizes fusion protein constructs comprising of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2 joined by flexible peptide linkers (Fig. 1B,C) . We hold our tethered receptor ligand constructs under precisely controlled and constant external force in magnetic tweezers (MT) 16, 17 (Fig.  1D) . Tethered ligand assays have provided insights into von Willebrand Factor binding to platelets 18, 19 , force-sensing of the cytoskeletal protein filamin 20 , rapamycin-mediated association between FKBP12 and FRB 21 , and protein-histone interactions 22 . Their key advantage is that they allow observation of repeated interactions of the same binding partners that are held in spatial proximity under mechanical control. Therefore, they can provide information about affinity, avidity, on-and off-rates, and mechanical stability. Measuring at the single-molecule level naturally provides access to kinetics and molecular heterogeneity. Using the tethered ligand assay, we compare the stability of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD ACE2 interactions under mechanical load, measure the on-and off-rates, and extrapolate to the thermodynamic stability at zero load. Our assay gives direct access to binding rates of ligand-receptor pairs held in spatial proximity and we anticipate that it will be a powerful tool to assess the mode of action of potential therapeutic agents (such as small molecules 23 , neutralizing antibodies 24, 25 , nanobodies 26, 27, 28 , or designer proteins 29, 30 ) that interfere with S binding to ACE2.",

Protein constructs were coupled covalently to the flow cell surface via elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) linkers 33 and to magnetic beads via the biotin-streptavidin linkage. Tethering proteins via ELP linkers in the MT enables parallel measurements of multiple molecules over extended periods of time (hours to weeks) at precisely controlled forces 34 . In the MT, bead positions and, therefore, tether extensions are tracked by video microscopy in (x,y,z) with ~1 nm spatial resolution and up to kHz frame rates 35, 36, 37 .",

At forces in the range of 2-7 pN, we observed systematic transitions in the extension traces, with jumps between a high extension \"open\" and low extension \"closed\" state ( Fig. 1E) . The transitions systematically changed with applied force: At low forces, the system is predominantly in the closed state, while increasing force systematically increases the time spent in the open state. Histograms of the tether extension revealed two clearly separated peaks (Fig. 1E, bottom and Fig. 2A,D) . By setting thresholds at the minima between the extension peaks, we defined populations in the open and closed states. The fraction in the open state systematically increases with increasing force (Fig. 2B,E ; symbols) following a sigmoidal force dependence. The data are well described by a simple two-state model (Fig.  2B ,E; solid line) where the free energy difference between the two states depends linearly on applied force F, i.e. \u0394G = \u0394G 0 -F\u22c5\u0394z, such that the fraction in the open state is given by",

From fits of Equations 1, we found F 1/2 = 3.3 \u00b1 0.4 pN and \u0394z = 9.4 \u00b1 1.9 nm and thus \u0394G 0 = 4.4 \u00b1 1.0 kcal/mol for SARS-CoV-1 ( Table 1) . The midpoint force and binding energy are, therefore, approximately two-fold lower for SARS-CoV-1 RBD interacting with ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-2 using the same linker and a very similar overall geometry. The length increment \u0394z determined from fits of Equation 1 is again, within experimental error, in agreement with the value determined from fitting two Gaussians to the extension histogram near the midpoint of the transition (\u0394z G = 11.8 \u00b1 1.2 nm at F 1/2 ) and with the expected extension change of \u2248 12.1 nm taking into account the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-1 RBD bound to ACE2 31 (PDB code 2AJF). The slightly shorter extension increment upon opening for the SARS-CoV-1 construct compared to SARS-CoV-2, despite using the same 85 aa linker and a very similar crystallographic geometry is mostly due to the smaller extension of the WLC at the lower midpoint force for SARS-CoV-1. Control measurements for the same ACE2-SARS-CoV-1 RBD construct with a 115 aa instead of 85 aa linker show a larger length increment \u0394z = 14.0 \u00b1 2.9 nm upon opening, consistent with the expectation of \u2248 15.1 nm from a longer linker and again with good agreement between the \u0394z value fitted from Equation 1 and \u0394z G from Gaussian fits of the extension histogram ( Table 1) .",

The predicted length change from the crystal structure is \u2248 6.2 nm, still in rough agreement but slightly shorter than the experimentally determined value, while the prediction for the opposite geometry was close to or slightly longer than what was determined from the extension traces. The overall good agreement between predicted and measured length increments upon opening of the complexes and the fact that the deviations have the opposite sign for the two different tethered ligand geometries strongly suggest that the RBD and ACE2 ectodomain remain folded in the open conformations. Significant unfolding of the domains upon opening of the complex would increase the observed length increment compared to the predictions that assume folded domains and lead to systematically larger measured compared to predicted \u0394z values. We note that some residues are not resolved in the crystal structure and, therefore, not taken into account in our prediction (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The observed deviations between predicted and measured \u0394z values would be consistent with the unresolved residues at the RBD C-terminus becoming part of the flexible linker and the missing residues at the Nterminus remaining folded as part of the RBD. Taken together, the MT data show that our tethered ligand assay can systematically probe RBD ACE2 binding as a function of applied force and enables faithful quantitation of the mechanostability and thermodynamics of the interactions.",

In contrast, the tethered ligand assay probes binding between receptor-ligand pairs held in proximity and under external force. While the situation in vivo is even more complex, the tethered ligand assay mimics the multivalent interactions that likely occur between viral particles with multiple trimeric S complexes and the apical surface of cells where multiple binding partners are in spatial proximity. To compare tethered ligand measurements to traditional binding assays, it is important to consider the differences between tethered ligandreceptor systems and cases with binding partners in free solution. The free energies \u0394G 0 (or \u0394G 0,tau ) determined in our assay measure the stability of the bound complex with respect to the open state with the ligand tethered. Consequently, \u0394G 0 will in general depend on the length of the linker and the tethering geometry, as we clearly observe experimentally: For the same set of binding partners, we find significantly different values for \u0394G 0 for different tethering geometries. For example, we can compare ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the two different tethering geometries (10.1 \u00b1 2.8 kcal/mol vs. 6.6 \u00b1 1.7 kcal/mol; p = 0.04 from a two-sample t-test) or the SARS-CoV-1 data for the 85 or 115 aa tethers (4.4 \u00b1 1.0 kcal/mol vs. 6.8 \u00b1 1.0 kcal/mol; p = 0.004). In contrast, binding assays with the binding partners in free solution are sensitive to the free energy difference between the bound complex and the ligand and receptor in solution, which depends on the solution concentrations.",

            "text": "To compare the two scenarios, it is useful to consider the problem in terms of lifetimes or, equivalently, (on-and off-) rates 19 . The lifetime of the bound complex in the tethered ligand system \u03c4 0,closed (= 1/k 0,off ) has units of seconds and can be directly compared to the binding lifetimes (or solution off-rates k sol,off ) measured in bulk binding assays. The lifetime of the open conformation in the tethered ligand assay \u03c4 0,open (= 1/k 0,on ) also has units of seconds, but can not be directly compared to solution on-rates, since for a bimolecular reaction the solution on-rate k sol,on has unit of M \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 and depends on concentration. To relate the two quantities, one can introduce an effective concentration 19, 41, 42 of the tethered ligand c eff such that k sol,on = k 0,on / c eff . We can quantitatively relate our results to studies that have reported equilibrium dissociation constants and rates for the ACE2 interactions with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 using traditional binding assays (for an overview see Supplementary Table 1 Table 1 ). Our value for the off-rate of SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to ACE2 is also in reasonable agreement with the value of (8 \u00b1 5)\u22c510 \u2212 3 s \u2212 1 extrapolated from AFM force spectroscopy experiments 46 . A clear trend is that the off-rate for SARS-CoV-2 is smaller than for SARS-CoV-1, by about one order-of-magnitude, indicating a longer lived bound complex for the new SARS variant. In contrast, for the onrates most solution binding assays report similar values for the two SARS variants, in the range of k sol,off ~10 5 M \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 . Our tethered ligand assay also found similar unimolecular onrates for the two SARS variants, similar to ~10 3 s \u2212 1 , implying an effective concentration of c eff = k 0,on / k sol,on ~ 10 mM. This effective concentration is in the range of concentrations found for other tethered ligand protein systems 19, 42, 47 and can be understood as the apparent concentration of one molecule in a sphere of ~4 nm radius, a distance close to distances to the transition states determined from the data under force and to the approximate mean square end-to-end distance in solution for a 85 aa peptide. Taken together, we find that in the absence of applied force, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD remains bound to ACE2 for ~400-800 s, consistent with traditional binding assays and at least 10-fold longer than the lifetime of the SARS-CoV-1 RBD interaction with ACE2. The time scale for binding in free solution is concentration dependent, but for the situation that the binding partners are held in close proximity, we observe rapid (re-)binding within <1 ms in the absence of force for both SARS variants.",

We find that in the absence of applied force, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD remains bound to ACE2 for ~400-800 s, which would provide a long time window for conformational rearrangements to engage additional RBD copies on the same S trimer 11 , to bind to additional S trimers, and to initiate proteolytic cleavage and downstream processes. Our measured lifetime of the initial RBD ACE2 interaction is much longer than the values < 1 s reported for influenza, rabies, or HIV viruses engaging their cellular receptors measured by AFM or optical tweezers force spectroscopy 12, 13, 50, 51 , which might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 higher infectivity. For influenza, rabies, and HIV multivalent interactions of the virus with its host cell have been suggested to play important roles 12, 13, 14 . Our data suggest that if held in close proximity, SARS-CoV RBDs can engage ACE2 rapidly, within \u03c4 0,open ~ 1 ms. While our assay is different from the situation in vivo, the tethered ligand mimics the effect of pre-formed interactions by a subset of the RBDs in the S trimer or by neighboring S trimers, which suggests that multivalent interactions between the virus and its host cell could form rapidly after an initial binding event, providing additional stability of the interaction. We estimate the concentration of S in vivo as ~1 pM, based on 7\u22c510 6 viral copies in ml sputum 7 and 100 S proteins per virus 1 . This estimated bulk protein concentration in vivo is much lower than the dissociation constants reported, which are in the range K d ~ 1-100 nM for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 and 10-fold lower affinity for SARS-CoV-1 (Supplementary Table  1 ), suggesting that multivalency might be critical for efficient viral binding. The rapid binding of RBDs held in proximity to ACE2 revealed by our assay might, therefore, be an important component of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We anticipate that our tethered ligand assay will provide a powerful approach to investigate how the RBD ACE2 binding is blocked or altered by antibodies, nanobodies, or other drugs. In particular, the tethered ligand assay could go beyond standard bulk assays and reveal heterogeneity, include avidity effects, and determine drug residence times, in addition to affinities 21 . In addition, our approach could provide a tool to characterize emerging mutations of the viral S protein that alter binding or interfere with antibody recognition 24, 52 . Beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic, our assay provides a new method to probe cell-virus interactions 53 and should be broadly applicable to other host-pathogen interactions.",

The crystal structure by Li et al. 31 available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB accession number 2AJF) was used as a structural reference. The linker sequence and tag placement was adapted from Milles et al. 56 . The linker sequence is a combination of two sequences available at the iGEM parts databank (accession numbers BBa_K404300, BBa_K243029). We used an analogous approach to design the fusion protein with the sequence of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 from the sequence published by Wu et al. 57 available from GenBank under accession number MN908947. Reverse control constructs with C-terminal ACE2 were designed by reversing the order of the protein domains. A 6x histidine tag was added for purification. In addition, tags for specific pulling in magnetic tweezers were introduced: a triple glycine for sortase-catalyzed attachment on the N-terminus and a ybbR-tag on the C-terminus. In summary, the basic construct is built up as follows: MGGG-ACE2-linker-RBD-6xHIS-ybbR. All DNA and protein sequences are provided in the Supplementary Information. The constructs were cloned using Gibson assembly from linear DNA fragments (GeneArt, ThermoFisher Scientific, Regensburg, Germany) containing the sequence of choice codonoptimized for expression in E. coli into a Thermo Scientific pT7CFE1-NHis-GST-CHA Vector (Product No. 88871). Control constructs with different sized linkers were obtained by blunt end cloning with either deleting or adding sequences to linker. Replication of DNA plasmids was obtained by transforming in DH5-Alpha Cells and running overnight cultures with 7 ml lysogeny broth with 50 \u00b5g/ml carbenicillin. Plasmids were harvested using a QIAprep\u00ae Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN).",

The dialysis device provided was placed into the dialysis buffer and kept at room temperature until it was filled with the expression mix. For preparing the IVTT expression mix, 50 \u00b5l of the HeLa lysate was mixed with 10 \u00b5l of accessory proteins. After each pipetting step the solution was gently mixed by stiring with the pipette. Then the HeLa lysate and accessory proteins mix was incubated for 10 minutes. Afterwards, 20 \u00b5l of the reaction mix was added. Then 8 \u00b5l of the specifically cloned DNA (0.5 \u00b5g/\u00b5l) was added. The reaction mix was then topped off with 12 \u00b5l of nuclease-free water to obtain a total of 100 \u00b5l. This mix was briefly centrifuged at 10,000 g for 2 minutes. A small white pellet appeared. The supernatant was filled into the dialysis device placed in the 1X dialysis buffer. The entire reaction was then incubated for 16 h at 30\u00b0C under constant shaking at 700 rpm. For incubation and shaking an Eppendorf ThermoMixer with a 2 ml insert was used.

In the setup, molecules are tethered in a flow cell (FC; see next section); mounted above the FC is a pair of permanent magnets (5\u00d75\u00d75 mm 3 each; W-05-N50-G, Supermagnete, Switzerland) in vertical configuration 17 . The distance between magnets and FC is controlled by a DC-motor (M-126.PD2; PI Physik Instrumente, Germany) and the FC is illuminated by an LED (69647, Lumitronix LED Technik GmbH, Germany). Using a 40x oil immersion objective (UPLFLN 40x, Olympus, Japan) and a CMOS sensor camera with 4096\u00d73072 pixels (12M Falcon2, Teledyne Dalsa, Canada) a field of view of approximately 440 \u00d7 330 \u00b5m 2 is imaged at a frame rate of 58 Hz. Images are transferred to a frame grabber (PCIe 1433; National Instruments, Austin, TX) and analyzed with an open-source tracking software 58, 59 . The tracking accuracy of our setup was determined to be \u22480.6 nm in (x, y) and \u22481.5 nm in z direction, as determined by tracking non-magnetic polystyrene beads, after baking them onto the flow cell surface. For creating the look-up table required for tracking the bead positions in z, the objective is mounted on a piezo stage (Pifoc P-726.1CD, PI Physik Instrumente). Force calibration was performed as described 60 by analysis of the fluctuations of long DNA tethers. Importantly, for the small extension changes on the length scales of our protein tethers, the force stays constant to very good approximation (to better than 10 \u22124 relative change). The largest source of force uncertainty is due to bead-to-bead variation, which is on the order of \u2264 10% for the beads used in this study 17, 61 .",

For each trace, (x,y)-fluctuations were checked to avoid inclusion of tethers that exhibit inter-bead or bead-surface interactions, which would also cause changes in x or y. Non-magnetic references beads were tracked simultaneously with magnetic beads and reference traces were subtracted for all measurements to correct for drift. Extension time traces were subjected to a 5-frame moving average smoothing to reduce noise. All analyses were performed with custom scripts in MATLAB. Figure 1 . A tethered ligand assay probes the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 interaction in magnetic tweezers. A Schematic rendering of SARS-CoV-2 (top) binding to human cells (bottom). The virus binds via its RBD (blue triangle) located at the tip of the S1 domain in each copy of the S protein trimer and engages the ectodomain of ACE2 (red rectangle) that is anchored to the cell membrane by its transmembrane domain (black rectangle). B Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to ACE2 (rendered from PDB entry 6M0J 32 ) with the N-and C-termini of both proteins highlighted in yellow. C Scheme of the fusion protein receptor ligand construct. Shown is the variant N-terminus-ACE2-linker-RBD-C-terminus. D Schematic of the MT tethered receptor ligand assay. The fusion protein construct shown in C is attached via an ELP linker to a flow cell surface and via biotin-streptavidin to magnetic beads (for details of the molecular handles and protocol used for attachment see Materials and Methods). Permanent magnets mounted above the flow cell are used to apply calibrated stretching forces to the tether. E Extension time traces of a ACE2-linker-SARS-CoV-2 RBD fusion construct at different levels of applied force (indicated above the trace segments). Stochastic transition between a lower and a higher extension are observed that systematically shift to the higher extension state with increasing force. The overall shift in extension from plateau to plateau is due to the stretching response of the tether. Extension histograms (bottom) are shown for the three plateaus highlighted in color and reveal two distinct peaks. The two peaks are well described by a double Gaussian fit (solid line, middle panel) and correspond to the open and closed state of the tethered receptor ligand pair (shown schematically as an inset).

The assay is identical to the scheme shown on Fig. 1C , except that now the ACE2 domain is attached via a ELP-linker to the flow cell surface and the RBD domain is coupled to biotin via the ybbR-tag and attached to streptavidin coated magnetic beads.

The corresponding distances between the N-and C-termini of the fusion constructs in the open conformations \u0394z open are estimated as follows: We assume that the RBD and ACE2 domains remain fully folded, but are free to rotate as indicated in the figure panels. The distance \u0394z open is then given by the sum of the distances between the N-and C-termini of the individual domains (indicate in the figure panels) and the length of the ELP linker, which was estimated from the WLC model evaluated at the midpoint force F 1/2 for each construct.

For all constructs measured, the sum \u0394z open + \u0394z closed is equal, within experimental error, to the total distance between the open and closed conformations \u0394z (Table 1), providing a consistency check between the equilibrium and kinetic analyses. The parameters \u0394z open and \u0394z closed quantify the force-dependencies of the lifetimes of the respective states and the slopes in the log(\u03c4 open/closed ) vs. F plots (Fig. 2 C,F) are given by \u0394z open/closed / k B T. For all tethered ligand constructs investigated, \u0394z closed is smaller than \u0394z open (by approximately a factor of ~2), i.e. opening of the bound complex is less force sensitive than rebinding from the open conformation. The different force sensitivities can be rationalized from the underlying molecular processes: The closed complexes feature protein-protein interfaces that will break over relatively short distances; in contrast, the open conformations involve flexible peptide linkers that make rebinding from the open states more force dependent. The extrapolated lifetimes at zero force of the closed conformations \u03c4 0,closed are in the range of 400-800 s for the SARS-CoV-2 and ~20 s for SARS-CoV-1. In comparison, the lifetimes of the open states in the absence of load \u03c4 0,open are much shorter, in the range of ~1 ms (",
