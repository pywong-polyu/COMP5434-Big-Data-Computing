Locus of control (LOC) is described as a personality trait developed through social learning theory. Recently, LOC has got attention from both the patient's and clinician's perspectives. In addition, higher external LOC is associated with problematic Internet use. The aim was to investigate whether problematic Facebook use is associated with LOC. Four hundred twenty-one university students were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Problematic Facebook use was determined by the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale, and the participants were divided into two groups as neutral users and problematic users. Locus of control was assessed using the Locus of Control Scale, including subscales of personal control, belief in chance, the meaninglessness of the effortfulness, belief in fate, and belief in an unjust world. Results: In total, 333 students were eligible for the study. There were 66 students with neutral Facebook use (19.8%), and the remaining (n=267) had problematic Facebook use (80.2%). No significant difference was observed in the demographic characteristic of neutral and problematic Facebook users (p>0.05). Problematic Facebook users had significantly higher scores on the meaninglessness of the effortfulness (p<0.001), belief in fate (p=0.019), and belief in an unjust world (p=0.004) compared to the neutral Facebook users.",

The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly restricted people's everyday life and contributed to enhanced social media use [2] , and people, especially students, have started to use social media since they are at home and hostels and have more free time more than before. During the COVID-19, our personal and professional lives interfered (mixed) through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram [3] . Also, a study showed that 50.8% of the university students reported usually obtaining their information about COVID-19 from social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram [4] . It was shown that 47.8% of students reported they were watching new stories about COVID-19 for 1-3 h a day and 4.8% for more than 6 h [4] . In addition, education in universities in Turkey and many countries have currently begun digital instruction and distance learning [5] . In addition to get information about the latest news and leisure time engagements, many university students use social media networks as an instrument to disseminate information and to communicate in their academic and research activities [6] . Overall, many external factors of life can influence Facebook and social media use.",

Health LOC, another version of LOC, was developed to evaluate the patient's belief in the health and physiotherapy field [12] [13] [14] [15] . Turkish patients had a high chance and external beliefs, and these factors were related to increased disability levels, decreased quality of life, and increased pain severity [14, 15] . Most physiotherapy professionals deal with patients with chronic pain for many treatment sessions. Chronic pain has a complex mechanism, leading to impairments in patients' lives as a biopsychosocial being. In the literature, chronic pain has been reported to cause chronic pain behavior, depression, fear of activity, and anxiety [16] . Patients with chronic pain need more external support, especially from health practitioners like life coaches [13] . The biopsychosocial model should be adapted to clinical practice since recent evidence suggests that psychosocial risk factors lead to prolonged disability and increased pain levels [17] . Patients with a developing longterm disability risk and higher levels of catastrophizing or depression might have shown more significant reductions in disability if physiotherapists' attitudes and beliefs changed [18] . The importance of behavior and positive belief of physiotherapists in managing patients with chronic pain is well known [19] . Therefore, investigating the association between problematic Facebook use and a person's control beliefs in physiotherapist candidates emerges as an important topic. The present study aimed to investigate the association between problematic Facebook use and LOC.",

The internal consistency of the scale is 0.83, and a 3-week test-retest reliability is 0.82 [22] . This scale was translated into Turkish, and this adapted version was shown to be valid and reliable [23] . The Turkish version of BFAS had high internal consistency (ICC=0.93), and the model fit indices of the confirmatory factor analysis applied to determine the construct validity of the scale were adequate [23] . The cutoff points of BFAS were accepted as 20, and the participants were divided into two groups as neutral Facebook use and problematic Facebook use. Further, the problematic Facebook use was categorized as mild (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) , moderate (41-69), and severe Facebook addiction (70-90).",

Researchers have indicated the importance of perceived control in managing stress and academic achievement [9, 30] . LOC was defined as individuals' attributions for the causes of outcomes [7] . If the behavior is viewed as determined by one's influence, the LOC is labeled internal. Individuals with a high internal LOC are better psychologically adjusted than those having higher external LOC [10] . On the contrary, if the expectancy for the behavior is perceived as being outside one's control, it is considered external LOC, highlighting individuals' point of view for external factors such as fate, luck, or powerful others to be responsible for an outcome [10] . Internal LOC was related to academic success, self-esteem, and stress management [31, 32] . Internet addiction was negatively associated with internal LOC [20] .",

Another study also reported that more lonely and unhappy students with high external LOC were more likely to be engaged in online social interaction [11] . These findings have supported that problematic Facebook use is associated with external factors such as chance and fate beliefs.",

Also, the importance of behavior and positive belief of physiotherapists in managing patients with chronic pain is well known [19] . The current study is important by providing information about the association between problematic Facebook use and a person's control beliefs in physiotherapist candidates. Since our study has a crosssectional design, we cannot show a cause-effect relationship between the problematic Facebook use and LOC. However, reducing problematic Facebook use may help There were several limitations to the present study. Firstly, it had a cross-sectional design; therefore, its results cannot imply causation between problematic Facebook use and LOC. Additionally, Facebook use characteristics could have changed over the years, and the cross-sectional findings cannot be enough to reflect this possibility. Therefore, longitudinal studies are highly warranted. Second, we only investigated Facebook use; however, it is evident that other social media platforms, especially WhatsApp and Instagram, are so frequent. Future studies should investigate their effects on LOC. Lastly, since the study sample was recruited from a single state university, the study's generalizability of findings was limited. Further multicenter studies including students from other private and state universities and different departments would be more informative and representative of the general population. ",
