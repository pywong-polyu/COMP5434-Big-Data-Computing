Left untreated, OME can negatively affect language, development, learning, and health and wellbeing throughout the life-course. Currently, OME care includes observation for 3 months followed by consideration of surgical ventilation tube insertion. The use of a non-invasive, low-cost nasal balloon autoinflation device has been found beneficial in other populations but has not been investigated among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.",

Children aged 3-16 years with unilateral or bilateral OME are being recruited from Aboriginal Health Services and the community. The primary outcome is the proportion of children showing tympanometric improvement of OME at 1 month. Improvement is defined as a change from bilateral type B tympanograms to at least one type A or C1 tympanogram, or from unilateral type B tympanogram to type A or C1 tympanogram in the index ear, without deterioration (type A or C1 to type C2, C3, or B tympanogram) in the contralateral ear. A sample size of 340 children (170 in each group) at 1 month will detect an absolute difference of 15% between groups with 80% power at 5% significance. Anticipating a 15% loss to follow-up, 400 children will be randomised. The primary analysis will be by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes include tympanometric changes at 3 and 6 months, hearing at 3 months, ear health-related quality of life (OMQ-14), and cost-effectiveness. A process evaluation including perspectives of parents or carers, health care providers, and researchers on trial implementation will also be undertaken.",

A flat type B trace is diagnostic of middle ear effusion in the absence of pain and/or a bulging or perforated tympanic membrane.

Treatment with antibiotics is of minimal benefit, and not without risk, for improving resolution of OME, hearing, or reducing tympanostomy tube insertion [20] , while nasal decongestants and steroids are of no benefit [21, 22] . Guidelines for OM in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children recommend that children with persistent bilateral OME for 3 months are referred to an audiologist for a diagnostic hearing assessment and to an Ear Nose and Throat surgeon (ENT) to consider insertion of tympanostomy tube(s) to re-establish normal middle ear pressure. This enables clearing of the middle ear effusion and aeration of the middle ear space [21] , thereby reducing the risk of longer term hearing loss and other complications. However, there are temporal and financial costs and health risks associated with this approach. The deferral of surgical tympanostomy tube insertion to at least 3 months after initial diagnosis means no active treatment and a potential decline in hearing in children with persistent OME, during this period. Additionally, access to surgery is extremely limited for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children with OM living in rural and remote areas where surgical wait lists can be years [23] . Furthermore, although unilateral OME is increasingly being recognised as contributing to adverse outcomes including spacial processing disorder [24] , guideline-recommended treatment approaches for unilateral disease based on highquality intervention studies are lacking.",

No statistically significant difference was shown for tympanometry changes; however, a composite measure of tympanometric or audiometric improvement showed nasal balloon autoinflation for OME was effective at more than 1 month, compared to no nasal balloon autoinflation (relative risk increase = 1.74; 95% confidence interval 1.22 to 2.50). Treatment adherence varied from 43 to 98%. There was no significant difference in adverse events between nasal balloon autoinflation and no nasal balloon autoinflation, with one study documenting ear pain with balloon autoinflation. The authors interpreted the findings as 'favourable' but noted that the included studies were small, and recommended further research in primary care. A subsequent study published in 2015 of 320 children (4-11 years) with unilateral and bilateral OME showed tympanometric resolution at 3 months (adjusted relative risk = 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.83) in a nasal balloon autoinflation group versus no nasal balloon autoinflation group [31] . The study also reported improved ear health-related quality of life and good adherence to treatment (80% at 3 months). Another study of 45 children demonstrated improvement in hearing thresholds after 1 month (difference = dB. 95% CI) and concluded the device could be useful while children were on waiting lists for surgical treatment [32] . Although Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are at increased risk of OM complications, no studies of nasal balloon autoinflation have been undertaken in this population.",

This 15% absolute difference reduces the 65% non-resolution by approximately a quarter, which is clinically relevant. Assuming a 15% loss to follow-up, 400 children will need to be randomised.

Therefore, cost-effectiveness will be determined by the ear-related quality of life measured with the OMQ-14 questionnaire at baseline (day 0) and 1 month. The OMQ14 is a 14-question survey. For the purposes of research, scores are calculated using a weighted scoring system, with high scores indicating poorer outcomes. Medical costs, including medication and health service use, and non-medical costs, including from events related to OME and its treatment, will be calculated from data collected during trial visits. Missing costeffectiveness data will be managed through imputation, rather than deleting observations.

In addition to the process evaluation, qualitative exploration of particular aspects of interest within the trial will be undertaken using the qualitative data generated in the process evaluation, with analysis methods determined by the research question for substudies. The process evaluation of the INFLATE trial is being undertaken together with the WATCH trial as they run parallel in most sites, share common governance, and both examine otitis media management options [33] .

The protocol has since been amended (version 3.0 dated 26/ 09/2018) to include children with unilateral or bilateral OME, and primary outcome assessment at 1 month. This amendment was initiated in response to slower than anticipated recruitment, and to minimise loss to follow-up and improve adherence to treatment enabling better determination of treatment efficacy, at least in the short term. The change in protocol conforms with similar studies [30, 31] . As at January 2022, 137 patients of the estimated sample size of 400 have been randomised. The unanticipated COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction in children attending health services face to face, and a diversion of human resources to COVID-19 mitigation activities. This has significantly impacted on the ability of health services to recruit participants during 2020 and 2021. The trial is scheduled to cease recruitment on 31 December 2022. ",
