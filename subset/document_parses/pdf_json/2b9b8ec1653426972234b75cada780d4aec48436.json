The newly discovered C. difficile adenine methyltransferase A (CamA) is specified by all C. difficile genomes sequenced to date (>300), but is rare among other bacteria. CamA is an orphan methyltransferase, unassociated with a restriction endonuclease. CamA-mediated methylation at CAAAAA is required for normal sporulation, biofilm formation, and intestinal colonization by C. difficile. We characterized CamA kinetic parameters, and determined its structure bound to DNA containing the recognition sequence. CamA contains an N-terminal domain for catalyzing methyl transfer, and a C-terminal DNA recognition domain. Major and minor groove DNA contacts in the recognition site involve base-specific hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts and the Watson-Crick pairing of a rearranged A:T base pair. These provide sufficient sequence discrimination to ensure high specificity. Finally, the surprisingly weak binding of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) might provide avenues for inhibiting CamA activity using SAM analogs.",

We purified recombinant full-length CamA [from gene CD2758 of reference strain 630 25 ], and measured its enzymatic activity on a double stranded DNA oligonucleotide (oligo) containing a single recognition sequence (Fig. 1) . We first optimized the reaction conditions for pH, ionic strength, reaction time, and enzyme concentration (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Under the optimal laboratory conditions (pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, t = 2.5 min), we next measured the CamA kinetic parameters by varying, respectively, concentrations of the DNA substrate and SAM (Fig. 1a, b) . CamA has k cat values of 3.9 min \u22121 and 5.4 min \u22121 , respectively, for substrate DNA and SAM. For comparison, the measured k cat values for the two other wellstudied DNA orphan adenine MTases, under their respective assay conditions, are 0.14 min \u22121 (E. coli Dam) 26 and 5.2 min \u22121 (C. crescentus CcrM) 27 . However, the CamA binding affinities (as reflected by K m values) varied from 0.1 \u03bcM for DNA to >17 \u03bcM for SAM (Fig. 1c) . While the K m value for DNA is comparable to that of E. coli Dam (55 nM) 26 and CcrM (17-23 nM) 27 , CamA appears to have substantially lower affinity for the methyl donor SAM than that of E. coli Dam (3-6 \u03bcM) 26, 28, 29 and phage T4 Dam (0.5 \u03bcM) 30 . For context, while we are not aware that SAM levels have been measured in C. difficile, in E. coli cells the concentration of SAM ranges from~30 \u00b5M during logarithmic growth up to~230 \u00b5M in stationary phase cells 31 .",

Second, compared to absence of cofactor, CamA demonstrated about 1.8\u00d7 stronger binding to substrate DNA in the presence of sinefungin (from 0.20 to 0.11 \u03bcM), whereas the presence of SAH yielded about 1.8\u00d7 weaker binding to DNA (from 0.20 to 0.37 \u03bcM; Fig. 1e ). The opposite effects of sinefungin and SAH on DNA binding are small but repeatable ( Supplementary Fig. 3b, c) , and might represent two CamA reaction states (substrate complex before, and product complex after, methyltransfer).

Pairwise comparisons revealed rootmean-square deviations of just 0.3-0.5 \u00c5 between~550 pairs of C\u03b1 atoms, and so we describe only complex B hereafter. CamA comprises an N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 1-320) and C-terminal target recognition domain (TRD; residues 320-577) ( Fig. 2d-f ). The TRD is the region of DNA MTases responsible for DNA sequence specificity 35, 36 . The first 26 residues are disordered in the current structure. The catalytic domain is consistent with structures of Class I MTases 37 , though most such MTases include seven \u03b2-strands, CamA contains a nine stranded \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21-\u03b29 in Fig. 2g , with \u03b28-\u03b29 being the added ones). The structure includes six helices (\u03b1A-\u03b1E and \u03b1J) located on the front side of the sheet and four helices (\u03b1F-\u03b1I) on the back side of the sheet, resulting in an open \u03b1\u03b2\u03b1 sandwich [37] [38] [39] (Fig. 2e, f) . As is also typical of Class I structures, there is a central topological switch point between strands \u03b21 and \u03b24, where SAM and the target Ade generally binds at the carboxyl ends of these two parallel neighboring strands. In addition to a characteristic reversed \u03b2 hairpin (\u03b26 and \u03b27) next to strand \u03b25, CamA contains a second consecutive \u03b2 hairpin (\u03b28 and \u03b29) at the same end of the sheet (Fig. 2g) . In this respect, the structure resembles that of the adenine MTase of the TaqI restriction-modification system (PDB 2ADM) [40] [41] [42] . The extra strands make the N-terminal catalytic domain larger, with the longest dimension (~60 \u00c5) comparable to that of the larger TRD domain (Fig. 2g, h) , and are stabilized via interdomain interactions.",

The CamA-bound DNA molecule undergoes major distortions at the 6-bp recognition site (labeled as 1-6), while the unrecognized flanking sequence maintains B-form (Fig. 3a) . We generated a regular B-DNA model of the same sequence, and superimposed it onto the CamA-bound DNA (Fig. 3a) . Several substantial distortions were observed. First, the bound DNA molecule is kinked between base pairs 6 and 7 (the joint between target A6 and the 3\u2032 G7) and bent~30\u00b0 (Fig. 3b) , resulting in the largest movement of~23 \u00c5 towards one end of the DNA molecule (Fig. 3c) . Second, the six recognized base pairs have conformational features of base-pair propeller twist (C1:G1 and A3:T3), base-pair buckle (A4:T4), and base pair-rearrangement (A5:T6) (Fig. 3d ). The space left by the rearranged A5 is partially occupied by protein residue Lys172, which forms a hydrogen bond (H-bond) with the orphaned base T5. Third, the \u03c0-stacking force in the non-target strand is disrupted by Tyr455, which is wedged between T5-T6 (Fig. 3e) . Fourth, the target A6 is flipped completely out of the helix (Fig. 3f) .",

As shown by diminished enzymatic activity on substrates having base pair substitution of A5:T5 to G5:C5, a guanine at position 5 would generate a G:T mismatch for the rearranged pair. Beyond the recognition sequence, there is no protein-mediated DNA base contact (Fig. 4h ). In sum, the discrimination yielding sequence specificity for CAAAAA is provided by base-specific interactions with the first four base pairs of both strands, involving hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts in both grooves, and by the base pairing of the rearranged A5:T6. By examining C. difficile CamA orthologs that were complete but nonidentical to that from strain 630 (on which this study is based), we note that every identified residue involved in DNA base interactions is completely conserved ( Supplementary Fig. 7) ; so we would expect the sequence specificity to be unchanged as well.",

We started with a molar ratio of 1:24 of CamA:SAH, and ended with a final 1:3 ratio of concentrated complex for crystallization (see \"Methods\" section). The ternary complex was crystallized under conditions similar to those used for the binary CamA-DNA complex, and the structure was determined to a slightly higher resolution of 2.54 \u00c5 (Supplementary Table 1 ).

The ordered N-terminal fragment forms two additional helices (residues 9-18 and residues 21-27) and closes off the cofactor binding pocket (Fig. 5c-e) .

Examples of such orphan MTases include the DNA adenine MTase (Dam) in Escherichia coli (Gammaproteobacteria) and cell cycle-regulated DNA MTase (CcrM) in Caulobacter crescentus (Alphaproteobacteria) which are, respectively, responsible for post-replication maintenance of daughter strand adenine methylation at two very similar sequences: GATC or GAnTC (n = any nucleotide) 21, 53 . Based on the different order of motifs, and the location of the TRD, Dam is a member of \u03b1-group and CcrM is a \u03b2-group MTase. Taken together, our kinetic and structural characterization of Dam, CcrM, and CamA means that we have characterized an orphan MTase from each group (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3) 45, [54] [55] [56] .",

The phenylalanine (or tyrosine) of motif I provides an edge-to-face interaction to the face of SAM-adenosyl ring, helping to hold it in place. However, in CamA, motif I (SxGxG) has replaced the corresponding phenylalanine with a much smaller Ser62 (Fig. 6b) , which interacts with ribose O4\u2032 oxygen (Fig. 5i) . This version of motif I is fully conserved among examined CamA orthologs ( Supplementary Fig. 7) and, in fact, is a general feature of the \u03b3 class of DNA MTases 33 . We now know that the phenylalanine's role can be provided from Phe200 of helix \u03b1H (see Fig. 5i for the spatial relationship between Ser62 and Phe200). We note that TaqI MTase too has a motif I (AxAxG) with a small-residue substitution for phenylalanine in the corresponding position. Similarly, the SAM-interacting phenylalanine in M.TaqI is Phe146 32 ; the corresponding Phe200 of CamA is very highly conserved among CamA orthologs (Supplementary Fig. 7) . Nevertheless, unlike CamA, M.TaqI has an affinity for SAM in the normal range, with a K D value of 2 \u03bcM 32 . We note that another MTase, M.EcoP15I (which has a consensus FxGxG motif), has been crystallized in a complex with DNA, but the cofactor is absent 44 .",

We note that a shifted base pair has previously been observed for M.HaeIII 63 , a DNA cytosine MTase, which methylates the internal cytosine (C3) of GGCC. The outer 3\u2032 cytosine (C4) is moved over to form a rearranged base pair with the guanine (G3) that was originally paired with the flippedout target cytosine.

The observation of weak binding of SAM, together with cofactor-induced conformational change of N-terminal residues near the SAM binding pocket, might provide avenues for inhibiting CamA activity using SAM analogs [64] [65] [66] . Iterative cycles of crystallography, synthesis, and bioactivity assays would aid successful design of selective and potent inhibitors of CamAmediated DNA adenine methylation in C. difficile. Such inhibitors could be clinically useful, given that CamA-mediated methylation is required for normal sporulation and colonization by C. difficile 24, 67 . The profound conformational change when CamA has or lacks a bound cofactor is relatively unique. Further study including mutagenesis is needed to address the mechanism CamA uses for the bi-substrate reaction, and to determine the rate limiting step of the methylation reaction, though some MTases (including phage T4 Dam) are known for which SAH release is the rate-limiting step 68 . It is also possible that the unusually low affinity of CamA for SAM makes it particularly sensitive to in vivo SAM levels, which could play a regulatory role, as has been suggested for MettL16 69, 70 .",

Some other bacterial orphan MTases (not associated with a restriction endonuclease) are involved in chromosome replication, DNA repair, and epigenetic gene regulation 16, 23 . For example, the expression of pyelonephritis-associated pili (Pap) in uropathogenic E. coli is epigenetically controlled by the methylation state of the two GATC sites (separated by~90 nucleotides) in the Pap regulatory region 72, 73 . In contrast to most GATC sites in the E. coli genome, the pap-associated sites are not always completely re-methylated after DNA replication, and their methylation state determines in part the phase variation of pilus formation 73 .

If the primary role of CamA methylation is regulatory, one would not necessarily expect it to be highly processive, but maybe (like Dam in the control of the Pap locus) responsive to the presence of other regulatory proteins. If, on the other hand, CamA is meant to link the timing of gene expression to replication, as in the case of some E. coli transposons responsive to Dam methylation [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] , it might act more processively on just the daughter strand by following the replication fork, in which case only CAAAAA sites on the leading strand would likely be relevant. In this regard, it is interesting that the presence or absence of sinefungin (a SAM analog) or SAH has little effect (<2\u00d7) on CamA's DNA affinity (Fig. 1e) . This is consistent with a possible processive mechanism, where SAH-SAM exchange occurs without dissociation from the DNA, though this remains to be tested.",

When trays with crystallization drops were opened to obtain crystals, some phase separation occurred in the drop and over a short period of time, crystals would tend to dissolve. Thus, crystals were picked up quickly in a nylon loop which were then momentarily placed into mother liquor supplemented with 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol before plunging into liquid nitrogen for cryoprotection. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the SER-CAT beamline 22ID of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. For the crystal with the selenomethionyl CamA, X-ray diffraction data was collected 15 eV above the selenium absorption edge (0.97775 \u00c5) and 1000 images were collected rotating the crystal 1\u00b0per image so as to obtain large redundancy to achieve an adequate anomalous signal.",

The initial electron density showed recognizable features of secondary structures of \u03b2-sheets and \u03b1-helices. Reinserting the selenium positions into AutoSol and utilizing the full resolution of the dataset (2.69 \u00c5) gave a very good map in which protein side chains and DNA could be easily identified. In this instance, Autosol reported a Figure- Of-Merit of 0.24 and gave a densitymodified map with an R-factor of 0.24. AutoBuild module of PHENIX was utilized to begin the model building which allowed for reiterative processing, and together with manual building in COOT 92 , giving improved maps which allowed building of three protein-DNA complexes in the asymmetric unit. COOT was also utilized for corrections between PHENIX refinement rounds.",

The ternary complex was concentrated about 8\u00d7 to a final concentration of about 100 \u00b5M [CamA], 115 \u00b5M [DNA], and 300 \u00b5M [SAH] and directly used for crystallization. Crystallization was carried out by an Art Robbins Gryphon Crystallization Robot. Mixture of 0.2 \u00b5L complex with 0.2 \u00b5L crystallization solution over 70 \u00b5L well solution was set up using the sitting drop technique. Single crystals were obtained from solution containing 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.7, 23% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and 0.3 M potassium citrate. Crystals of SeMet-CamA and DNA complex (without added cofactor) grew in solution containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 24.5% PEG 3350 and 0.28 M potassium citrate (Supplementary Fig. 4d). Similarly, the ternary complex of CamA, DNA and SAH were crystallized under conditions of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 23% PEG 3350, and 0.27 M potassium citrate.",
