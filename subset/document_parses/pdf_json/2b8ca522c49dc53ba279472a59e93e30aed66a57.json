The researcher prepared a psychological service providers' empowerment scale that consisted of 28 items, and this scale was applied in a random sample consisting of 975 psychological service providers. The results showed that the empowerment scale has acceptable validity and reliability. The results of the exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 28 scale items saturate on seven factors, which accounted for 64.42% of the total variance of the scale: the first factor named expect psychological services effectiveness accounted for 27.86%, the second factor named self-stimulation accounted for 9.71%, the third factor named responsibilities and duties accounted for 7.12%, the fourth factor named psychological services work environment accounted for 6.51%, the fifth factor named psychological service providers' decision-making accounted for 5.37%, the sixth factor named creative psychological service provider behaviour accounted for 4.45%, and the seventh factor named psychological services confidence accounted for 3.82% of the total variance of a psychological service providers' empowerment. In order to study the ability to predict the empowerment among psychological service providers, the researcher developed a structural model for psychological service providers' empowerment and then used the structural equation model analysis. The results showed that the proposed structural model of a psychological service providers' empowerment has goodness-of-fit, and these results emphasised the ability to predict psychological service providers' empowerment by seven tested factors.",

Because of the importance of the profession of psychological services in the preparation of members of society psychologically, it is necessary to pay attention to the empowerment of psychological service providers to achieve the quality of psychological services provided to beneficiaries, that is matching the current performance of the psychological service providers with the needs and expectations of psychological service providers at different ages and social and professional levels of society, and accuracy and comprehensiveness. Arnout, Al-Dabbagh, et al. (2020) and Arnout, Alshehri, Assiri, and Al-Qadimi (2020) discuss the origins of COVID-19 as a new strain of virus that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death (WHO, 2020) . On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the spate of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) a pandemic.",

Caring for mental health in such difficult times is extremely important. That is why the need of community members for psychological services increases under these conditions of quarantine and social separation, and the psychological problems it creates. Almutairi, Adlana, Balkhya, Abbas, (2018) stated that the spread of infectious viruses such as SARS and others provokes emotional, ethical and cultural conflicts in the healthcare providers' work environment, which affects the quality of care they provide to patients with infection. The findings of Arnout, Al-Dabbagh, et al. (2020) and Arnout, Alshehri, et al. (2020) indicated that the increased prevalence of COVID-19 has a negative effect on the mental health of individuals. In the same context, infection with deadly viruses results in self-stigma and external stigma. Recently, Overholt et al. (2018) found that during follow-up, stigma levels were stable. Baseline stigma significantly increased during enrolment and following clusters of Ebola re-emergence in Liberia. Survivors encountered primarily enacted and perceived external stigma rather than internalised stigma. In addition, James, Wardle, Steel, and Adams (2020) found that EVD-related stigma (internalised and enacted) is prevalent among EVD survivors since their return to their communities.",

The practice and performance of renewable and changing roles are used in the light of current and new developments in technology. Kaddour and Mohammed (2013) noted that empowerment refers to the increasing delegation of authority and participation in decision-making among the organisation's affiliates (the context of the organisation) or to an interest in the possible environment for collaborative work and for improving the quality of life in it (the community context), or for empowering the individual from their sources of strength, for example self-employment and employment in their social life, including their relationships and work (the context of the individual). Empowerment has become the subjective experience of the individual as a catalyst and motivation to strengthen the feelings of self-efficacy and is linked to rehabilitation within the limits of possibilities and not determinants and is part of the framework of today's main research, application and measurement in the field.",
