These discoveries will be possible only if access to a shared infrastructure, shared organizational network, as well as the education and retention of experts in academia, national laboratories, and the private sector are supported in the crucial area of advanced electronics including near-detector front-end electronics implemented in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), used for back-end processing.

A more complete, detailed understanding is captured in the minds of those builders whose ideas were tested, revised and made to work in the design and development of today's highly sophisticated readout systems. As detector systems become more complex and more granular, the time between conception and realization of a data taking system is becoming consistent with the length of a career.

These extreme environments have made it mandatory to understand the performance of commercially available electronics especially custom integrated circuits in extreme environments far from the manufactures intended use. These non commercial research uses require careful measurements and the development of device models for basic design elements over the range of fabrication extremes provided by fabrication facilities. These teams of specialists who delve into the physics of the devices and understand the required operating conditions for the commercial processes and in turn develop libraries of parts adapted for the intended environmental extreme.

            "text": "A notable recent example was the realization that several complex ASIC designs nearing completion for the High Luminosity LHC detector sub-systems were behind in their scheduled completion dates. On examination it was recognized that although the complexity of custom IC's has dramatically increased as well as the number of specialized design tools the size of some design teams remained the same. Details of the new capabilities of HL-LHC designs include the fact that recent advances in ASIC technology have lower sensitivity to ionizing radiation (> 100 MRad) enabling a higher density of gates and operational speed resulting in increased data transfer rates. At the same time the size of sensing elements has decreased resulting in a requirement for a large increase in the number of gates in these new ASIC's compared with LHC designs and eventually to a significant increase in timing sensitivity across a chip and Single Event Upset sensitivity. This evolution in size, speed, and radiation requirements for HL-LHC designs led to the need for new verification techniques, which also implies the need for a larger design team and introduces the prospect of long redesign cycles for failed designs, which may take as long as a year crisis. CERN's electronics system design group (ESE) responded by proposing and forming a task force designated as CERN-HEP IC design and platform services in microelectronics (CHIPS) to formally engage experts from CERN's ESE group with ASIC design teams experiencing problems to collaborate and broaden the range of experience available for problem solving and ensure that up to date verification techniques are being employed. This expanded role for CERN's ESE group has provided additional important help for HL-LHC design groups beyond their traditional umbrella activities to facilitate uniform access to ASIC technology and design flows in addition to important IP design blocks that they openly share with the community. An important exemplary way to effectively meet the need to increased the size of the design team for highly complex ASIC design is the CERN RD53 group formed as a collaboration of multiple design groups to tackle the common issue of pixel designs in high radiation areas near the collision point of the inner trackers that are part of both the ATLAS and CMS detectors. In a recent submission only a few masks were different between the ATLAS and CMS versions of the pixel chip. It should be noted that a unified IP management platform with verification requirements for updating designs.",

For future projects it would be useful to set up a web based, open access, repository to encourage the user community to document and share problems and solutions encountered with tools and technologies through FAQ's and design discussion threads as well as have experts available via special channels like Mattermost or Slack to help with problems encountered by HEP designs that encounter the limits of the validation tools or ASIC technology their design goals push them to explore.

One important example is the introduction of the RISC-V instruction set.

The RISC-V ISA has unleashed a significant amount of design creativity and has helped drive Open-Source efforts in other areas of hardware development.",

Venerable tools such as Magic (for mask layout editing) have been used by generations of students in coursework and research. However, as integrated circuits get more complex, there has been a need for integrated design flows to improve design productivity. It has been difficult for open-source tools to keep up with this trend due to the significant investments needed to ensure various tools can work together to effectively develop high-performance integrated circuits. For this reason, design groups in the HEP community have relied on costly commercial tools. This has created a significant barrier to entry for new groups to address the needs and challenges of electronics for HEP.",
