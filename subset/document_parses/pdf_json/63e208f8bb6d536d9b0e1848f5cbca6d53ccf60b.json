However, neoplasms could be induced only by intratracheal instillation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-containing fraction of smoke condensate (2) . No statistically significant increase in pulmonary neoplasm incidence was found in animals exposed to smoke by inhalation, presumably because the animals died prematurely from chronic respiratory disease (1).",

More recently, a lifetime exposure of rats to tobacco smoke produced a 9% incidence of respiratory tract tumors, including adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas (7) . In this experiment, animals exposed in parallel with those for the lifetime study were killed at earlier intervals for assessment of morphologic lesions induced by smoke inhalation. The present report characterizes those lesions. Many of the alterations appeared to be similar to those described above.

Beginning at 12-14 weeks of age, the animals were gradually exposed to increasing dosages of tobacco smoke from standard 85-mm, nonfiltered experimental cigarettes (National Cancer Institute code 16). Two final dose levels were used, 7 or 10 cigarettes/day, and the animals were killed at time intervals from 1 to 2 years after exposure began. The exact number of animals killed at various times in each dose group is shown in table 1. Since mortality was high in the lO-cigarette-per-day group, all the remaining animals in this group were killed at 1.5 years. Both untreated and sham-exposed groups were killed in parallel with the exposed animals. Additional data were Tz\"ssue preparation.-Before they were killed, the animals were anesthetized with 30 mg Fentobarbital/kg body weight. For tissue fixation the trachea was cannalized; the airways and lungs were removed and fixed with buffered formaldehyde under 20 cm of pressure for 24-48 hours. The lung lobes were cut along the bronchus, except for the left lobe, which was cut in cross section just anterior to the entry of the bronchus. The tissues were embedded in paraffin. Sections from the right lobes were used to determine the number of fibrotic lesions in the lungs of smoke-exposed animals. All of the sections were examined, and the cumulative number of lesions, normalized to the number of animals killed, was used as an estimate of the frequency of each type of lesion. Sections from the left lobes, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, were used for morphometric analysis. For each sample, 10 fields were selected at random and viewed at 100X magnification through a Weibel ocular. Fields comprised of more than one-third conducting airways or vasculature were excluded. The mean linear intercept was determined, and point counts (420 points/lobe) were made to obtain the volume percent of alveolar versus nonalveolar air space and respiratory versus nonrespiratory tissue. Alveoli were defined as enclosed circles or as open semicircles with a radius greater than half the distance across the opening. Additional sections of the left lobes were stained with Snook's silver stain for reticulum, aldehyde fuchsin, and Lushbaugh's stain.",

The frequency after a 2-year exposure was approximately double that after a I-year exposure. The lesions were characteristically associated with venules and arterioles in the parenchyma. They were most common in branches of the pulmonary vein located at or below the level of the terminal bronchiole (figs. lA, 1B) and were also found in bronchial veins, but they were never seen in the adventitia of major arteries. Perivascular accumulations of cells were also found rarely in unexposed rats and consisted of large lymphocytes and macrophages (fig. IC). The lesions of smoke-exposed lung tissues contained predominantly particulate-laden macrophages (figs. lA, IB). An ultrastructural analysis of several lesions associated with venules showed that lymphocytes, plasma cells, and, occasionally, fibroblasts were closely apposed to macrophages in the adventitia ( fig. 2 ). While macrophages and lymphocytes were usually seen adjacent to the basal lamina of the epithelium, the cell mass was separated from the epithelium by a basement membrane in some lesions. In addition to the adventitial lesions, a separate lesion was sometimes found around major veins, consisting of lymphocytes within the lumen of lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic endothelium in these lesions frequently contained smoke particulates (figs. 3A, 3B). However, lesions with characteristics intermediate between those of the lymphatic and adventitial lesions were not found, so a common etiology seemed unlikely.",

Generally, both histologic types of lesions were larger than perivascular lesions and could be discerned readily in paraffin-embedded lung tissue. Neither type of lesion was found in the lungs of control animals, and the frequency of both types increased with the number of cigarettes smoked and the cumulative time of smoke exposure (table 2). The type II hyperplastic lesions always constituted more than 90% of the total number oflarge lesions. However, the total number of peribronchiolar lesions increased markedly in the later stages of exposure at a dose of 7 cigarettes/ day. In animals exposed at the higher dose rate of 10 cigarettes/day for 1.5 years, the peribronchiolar lesions constituted only 2% of the large lesions, even though the cumulative dose of tobacco smoke was comparable to that delivered in the 2-year exposure at the lower dose rate. The peribronchiolar lesions constituted 7% of the large lesions under the latter conditions. In paraffin-embedded sections treated with Lushbaugh's stain for collagen, the amount of collagen seen in lesions showing septal enlargement appeared to increase in relation to the dose of tobacco smoke.

In animals exposed to a dose of 7 cigarettes/day for I or 2 years, about 60% of the lesions were located on the pleura. When pleural lesions embedded in epoxy resins were serially sectioned, nearly all of them were found to be adjacent to sites where one or more alveolar ducts terminated on the pleura; about half were also distal to or surrounding perivascular lesions (fig. 5B ).

All of the type II lesions studied showed some degeneration of basal lamina structure; in areas where marked degeneration occurred, the type I epithelium was separated from the underlying connective tissue (fig. 8 ). Degenerative changes were frequently, though not always, found in areas where luminal macrophages were in close contact with the type I epithelium. The presence of phagocytes (i.e., macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes) in the interstitium had little relationship to the position of basal lamina degeneration. The lining epithelium in hyperplastic lesions consisted of cells with an undifferentiated appearance, which could be flattened, distorted in shape, or hypertrophic. Some of the cells showed long microvilli on their luminal surfaces. In addition, most lesions contained cuboidal, type III cells, with an extensive endoplasmic reticulum rather than the lamellar bodies typical of type II cells ( fig.   9 ). Other type III cells had a dense cytoplasm, abundant profiles of endoplasmic reticulum, and osmiophilic inclusions ( fig. 10 ). Lymphocytes were frequently found as cellular constituents of the epithelium. Binucleate cells and evidence of stratification in the epithelium were seen in about half of the lesions. A few lesions also contained large cells with an exceptionally clear cytoplasm ( fig. 8 ).",

In the lifetime experiment, the observation of tobacco smoke-induced tumors clearly was dependent on the long-term survival of the experimental animals. The mean survival time (\u00b1 SD) was 2.3\u00b1O.6 years for rats exposed to 7 cigarettes/ day, 2.4\u00b1O.4 years for untreated controls, and 2.6\u00b10.4 years for sham-exposed controls. The survival curves for these 3 groups were not significantly different. The earliest of the 5 adenomas found among the treated animals appeared at 2.0 years, and the average age at death of the animals with these tumors was 2.6 years. For the 5 other lung and nasal tumors, which were adenocarcinomas and a squamous cell carincoma, the average age at death was 3.1 years. Only 1 alveologenic carcinoma was observed in the control animals over their life-span.

Similar accumulations of lymphoreticular cells in perivascular locations have been noted in the normal course of aging in the rat (11) and in cases of multiple sclerosis in humans (12). Although perivascular lesions were often contained within some of the more extensive lesions, it is not clear whether they played an essential role in the pathogenesis of the larger lesions. The larger lesions could have been induced by infiltration of lymphoreticular cells into the surrounding parenchyma or could have been initiated independently. Since these locations were probably subjected to tobacco smoke exposure under similar local conditions, inflammatory responses could have resulted from the same, presumably chemotactic, biochemical intermediaries in both cases. However, the larger lesions showed the full spectrum of inflammatory cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mast cells. Another feature common to the more extensive lesions was degradation of the basal lamina, particularly under the type I or squamous epithelial cells. We considered this alteration a possible contributing factor in fibrogenesis and/or epithelial hyperplasia. The proximity of phagocytes, particularly macrophages, to these sites suggested that enzymes released from the cells during phagocytosis may affect the structure of the lamina. The presence of lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages in the interstitium has also been reported in human diffuse interstitial lung diseases (13) .",

The exceptions that particularly note \"bronchiolization\" of the peribronchiolar alveoli have been reports on mice and hamsters infected with infll!enza virus (14), mice exposed to synthetic smog or calcium chromate dust (15) , and hamsters treated with chemical carcinogens (16) . In experiments on rats treated with various agents, particularly intratracheal instillation of tobacco smoke condensate (2) or of casein and carbon particulates (J 7), or a single exposure to benzo[a)pyrene followed by lifetime tobacco smoke inhalation (1), bronchiolization appeared to have occurred but to have been classified with other types of metaplasia. Our studies, based on the improved structural detail obtained by the examination of tissues embedded in epoxy resins, suggest that the bronchiolar lesions differ in several respects from the more common cuboidal metaplasias, which were identified here as type II hyperplasias. Since only about half of the peribronchiolar lesions showed epithelial metaplasia, our studies are also the first performed on rodents to suggest that fibrotic and cellular enlargement of the peri bronchiolar septa precedes the replacement of the squamous, type I epithelium with a columnar epithelium. However, prominent areas of peribronchiolar fibrosis without columnar metaplasia have also been noted in the lungs of human smokers and of nonsmokers exposed to lung irritants (18).",

In addition, the two types of larger lesions differed in other respects: Their locations were typically dissimilar, the type II lesions being mainly at the pleura. More importantly, the frequency of the lesions was related to the duration of tobacco smoke exposure. Increasing the time of exposure at the lower dose of tobacco smoke from 1 to 2 years led to approximately a tripling in the frequency of type II hyperplasias but to a sixfold increase in the frequency of peribronchiolar lesions. While exposure to 10 cigarettes/day for 1.5 years induced as many type II hyperplasias as the 2-year exposure to 7 cigarettes/day, it induced far fewer peri bronchiolar lesions.
