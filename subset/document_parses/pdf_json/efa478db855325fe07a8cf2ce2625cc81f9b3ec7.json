How QICs can be used to support healthcare improvement in care homes is not fully understood. Methods: A realist evaluation to develop and test a programme theory of how QICs work to improve healthcare in care homes. A multiple case study design considered implementation across 4 sites and 29 care homes. Observations, interviews and focus groups captured contexts and mechanisms operating within QICs. Data analysis classified emerging themes using context-mechanism-outcome configurations to explain how NHS and care home staff work together to design and implement improvement. Results: QICs will be able to implement and iterate improvements in care homes where they have a broad and easily understandable remit; recruit staff with established partnership working between the NHS and care homes; use strategies to build relationships and minimise hierarchy; protect and pay for staff time; enable staff to implement improvements aligned with existing work; help members develop plans in manageable chunks through QI coaching; encourage QIC members to recruit multidisciplinary support through existing networks; facilitate meetings in care homes and use shared learning events to build multidisciplinary interventions stepwise. Teams did not use measurement for change, citing difficulties integrating this into pre-existing and QI-related workload.",

There is uncertainty, both in the UK and internationally [3, 4] , around how to implement evidence-based approaches to care in care homes, given the tensions between the quality of care (often involving multiple external inputs from expert healthcare professionals) and quality of life (involving client-led, asset-based and person-centred care in a homely environment) [5] .",

Quality improvement approaches enable adaptation of evidence-based interventions across multiple settings in a way that is context sensitive [7] and therefore have potential to overcome some barriers to implementation in care homes. Quality improvement collaboratives (QICs) bring together professionals from multiple sites to learn and apply improvement methods [8] . QICs vary in their delivery but generally comprise (i) focus on a specified topic, (ii) support by clinical and quality improvement experts, (iii) participation by multiple professionals across organisations and (iv) use of an improvement model (setting targets, collecting data and testing changes). A systematic review which collated the evidence for QICs in all healthcare settings from randomised controlled trials, nonrandomised controlled clinical trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time-series studies with or without control site up till 2014 found 64 studies describing QICs found that 83% reported improvement in one or more effect measure [9] . Four studies were conducted in care homes and focused on falls [10, 11] , pressure ulcers [12] and painmanagement [13] . Whilst positive outcomes were reported, less is understood about how the QIC intervention worked to improve care in care homes.",

Most members understood this to be about breaking down barriers and minimising hierarchy, and all were happy to support it.

[27] The corollary of this is that to understand what change is improvement, practitioners need to measure processes and outcomes with sufficient robustness and frequency for statistical tests of change to be applied. Teaching our site teams about this, and reinforcing the importance of measurement for change, did nothing to enable or empower them to implement measurement plans. The time and resource requirements to 'measure what matters' are well described, even where statutory datasets and metrics are in place [28] . In UK care homes, however, there are no statutorily mandated datasets or metrics. Data are collected in inconsistent ways, and incompletely collated, whilst information governance is negotiated between multiple organisations, with lines of responsibility often unclear [29] . Given the findings here about the reticence of NHS and care home staff to collect additional data, it is important that proposals to develop minimum datasets in UK care homes, already underway, take account of the likely needs of teams who will need to undertake measurement for change as part of improvement in the sector.",

We found, however, that when improvement initiatives were contingent on GPs playing a central or leading role, then they were at risk of stalling. This was because of competing demands on time, an increased focus on medical aspects of care, and reinforcement of traditional hierarchies with consequent disempowerment of other staff groups. Similar findings about both the importance and role of GPs have come from care home improvement work undertaken in the Netherlands [4] , so these findings are not unique to England although they may be even more important here because of the central role of GPs within the NHS. An ongoing realist synthesis will explore these issues and consider what needs to be in place for GPs to play a productive role in improvement in care homes [30] .",

            "text": "Much of the literature on leadership in care homes has focussed on the role of care home managers as leaders in social care delivery [31] . Our findings suggest managers can also play an integral role in leading healthcare improvements for their residents. Throughout the study, we saw care home managers and staff engage in the QIC with enthusiasm. They generated improvement ideas, hosted QIC meetings, advocated for the initiative and went on to ensure the delivery of improvement interventions within their care homes. Where they were not able to do so, it was because one or more NHS staff dominated the improvement team and the care home staff were unable to challenge this or offer alternative approaches. An important lesson is for QI coaches not to allow teams to partition along organisational lines, as this may reinforce care home staff feeling like outsiders. Some of the care home managers involved in the QICs were registered nurses by training and supervised nursing teams as part of care homes with nursing, but this was not universally the case. The debate around the importance of nursing expertise in care homes is one commonly visited in the international literature [32] , but we saw excellent leadership in our study even when nurses were absent. It could be that the focus on specific professional groupings misses the true question of what skills are needed to lead in long-term care.",

CGA, however, is a complex intervention and the term has been recognised, even by its proponents, to be a misnomer [33] because it is essentially about delivering appropriate holistic care, albeit it crucially underpinned by comprehensive assessment. In the context of this study, CGA proved difficult to understand and operationalise for the staff involved because it was superimposed on pre-existing ways of working that already encompassed aspects of CGA. The principle of multidomain assessment by multidisciplinary teams (MDT) was widely accepted but participants regarded this as a self-evident component of good care, rather than as a part of CGA. It may be that CGA is a useful framework for improvement teams supporting QICs to keep in mind but that it is too much to expect participants to learn about both CGA and improvement methodology at the same time.",

In many countries, commissioners would not be sufficiently integrated into health systems to enable them to play the co-ordinating role that they played here and they could, in some jurisdictions, be precluded by law from engaging in service delivery. In other countries GPs do not play a central role in healthcare for care homes. International readers may find it easier to consider commissioners as 'regional leaders in health and social care' and GPs as 'accountable healthcare professionals' when translating our descriptions to their national setting. Implementation of these findings will depend, in part, on opportunities for staff to interact in a structured way with sufficient QI support and guidance. In England, the recent roll-out of Enhanced Care in Care Homes, part of the NHS long-term plan [35] , with consequent reconfiguration of how healthcare is delivered to care homes, represents one such opportunity. Yet the focus of this initiative has so far been on strategy, without any attention to supporting teams to operationalise improvements in a consistent way. The findings presented here could, if consistently deployed, be of significant help. Internationally, attention has recently turned to how the similarities in long-term care settings merit common responses [36] , despite the differences in how long-term care is organised. They have not, hitherto, considered the role of QI, or QICs, in developing such common responses. The programme theory here presents some unifying principles that could provide a basis for such work.",
