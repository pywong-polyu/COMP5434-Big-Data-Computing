            "text": "In viral binding and entry, the Spike(S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 uses transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for priming to cleavage themselves. In this study, we have screened 'drug-like' 7476 ligands and found that over thirty ligands can effectively inhibit the TMPRSS-2 better than the control ligand. Finally, the three best drug agents L1, L2, and L6 were selected according to their average binding affinities and fitting score. These ligands interact with Asp435, Cys437, Ser436, Trp461, and Cys465 amino acid residues. The three best candidates and a reported drug Nafamostat mesylate (NAM) were selected to run 250 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Various properties of ligand-protein interactions obtained from MD simulation such as bonds, angle, dihedral, planarity, coulomb, and van der Waals (VdW) were used for principal component analysis (PCA) calculation. PCA discloses the evidence of the structural similarities to the corresponding complexes of L1, L2, and L6 with the complex of TMPRSS2(TM) and Nafamostat mesylate (TM-NAM). Moreover, Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) pattern recognition was generated using PCA for the investigation of structural similarities among the selected ligands. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model was built to predict the binding energy compared to the binding energy obtained from molecular docking. The MLR regression model reveals an accuracy of 80% for the prediction of the binding energy of ligands. ADMET analysis demonstrates that these drug agents are appeared to be safer inhibitors. These three ligands can be used as potential inhibitors against the TMPRSS2.",

It plays an important role in viral entry and spread in the host (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019) . The predominant coronavirus antigen is a surface spike glycoprotein (S) which facilitates viral entry by activating the host receptor and negotiating virus-host membrane fusion . A two steps mechanism is followed here to activate SARS CoV-2. In the first step, facilitating host-cell entry, viral entry hemagglutinin protein is connected with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded by the ACE2 gene, that is expressed on respiratory epithelial cells. In the second step, cleavage of hemagglutinin is occurred to activate the internalization of the virus. This second step is proceeded through proteases particularly TMPRSS2, on the host cell (Walls et al., 2020) .",

Further, the structure validation of the predicted model was investigated by the Phi/Psi Ramachandran plot using PROCHECK Figure 3 (R. A. Laskowski et al., 1993) . The quality of the protein model was calculated by employing the Protein Structure Analysis (ProSA) Figure S1 (Wiederstein & Sippl, 2007) . Then, the generated structure of targeted protein TMPRSS2 was modelled using the template of Serine protease hepsin (PDB ID:5CE1) (Meng et al., 2020) as shown in Figure S2 . Moreover, Secondary structure analysis carried out by discovery studio and PDBsum shown in Figure 2A and 2B (Laskowski et al., 2005) . Finally, TM-align algorithm was also employed and the best model was selected based on TM-score (Y. Zhang & Skolnick, 2005 ). The predicted model structure does not provide information on the location of hydrogens, commonly referred to as the protonation state. The accurate prediction of the correct protonation state, especially within the binding interface, is crucial to accurately predict the correct binding mode and, binding affinity (Onufriev & Alexov, 2013; Petukh et al., 2013) . The protonation state of ionizable residues (Asp, Glu, Arg, Lys, Tyr, His, Cys) was set under pH 6.5 based on the pKa values calculated by the H\u00fe\u00fe server (Anandakrishnan et al., 2012; Gordon et al., 2005) .",

The shading on the Ramachandran plot showing in Figure 3 for TMPRSS2 protein is used to indicate different regions such as the red areas reveals the most favorable region for phi-psi combination. In case of better stereochemical quality of any model, maximum residues of protein (about 90%) in the core regions should be found. The plot statistics for TMPRSS2 protein showed 253 residues (84.6%) in the most favored regions, 44 residues (14.7%) are in the additional allowed regions, and also 1 residue (0.3%) in generously allowed regions whereas only 1 residue (0.3%) is in disallowed regions showing in Figure 3 and Table S1 .

Other main chain parameters including omega angle standard deviation, bad contacts/100 residues, zeta angle standard deviation, hydrogen bond energy standard deviation, and overall G factor are determined by PROCHECK. These results also reveal that the SWISS-MODEL generated structure has better structural qualities (Table S2) .

Z-score obtained from this server represents the quality of the whole model and the total energy deviation of the structure can be measured from an energy distribution that is derived from random conformations. The Z-score obtained from the server is plotted compared to experimentally found Z-scores of all similar size proteins through NMR and X- ray (Wiederstein & Sippl, 2007) . The z-score obtained for TMPRSS2 protein is -8.67 denoting no significant deviation from the scores calculated for the proteins of closure structure of PDB database showing in Figure S1 .

Thirty-one ligands are shown better binding affinity than the control ligand and they are selected for further analyses. Again, selected 31 compounds were screened three times by AutoDock vina and reported their average binding affinity. At that time, the GOLD suit was used to support the Audock Vina docking results. Higher fitness scores in GOLD docking, as well as higher binding affinities in AutoDock, refer to the better docking interaction between ligand and protein. Three ligands L1, L2, L6, and NAM are docked with protonated protein TM to compare the binding affinity ( Table 2 ). The binding affinity and fitness score of the top thirty-one ligands are shown in and Table S4 . Besides, a standard TMPRSS2 inhibitor such as NAM is subjected to dock to compare the findings with the zinc database ligands. In this study, the binding affinity of 31 ligands is compared to NAM. Docking results show that three ligands have more binding affinities than NAM. The highest binding affinities are observed from the corresponding complexes of L1, L2, and L6 and while NAM shows the binding affinity of -8.5 kcal/mol. The results of the selected ligands are expected as the possible inhibitor of TMPRSS2, clearly representing the selected ligands will display stronger inhibitory effects than standard drugs. A significant number of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bond, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are detected in three ligands with TMPRSS2 as shown in Figure 4 and Table S5 .

RMSF helps to assess the dynamic activity of amino acid residues in the protein. The flexibility of amino acid residues is measured to provide a deeper insight into the degree to which protein flexibility is influenced by ligand binding. The RMSF of residues (146-255) fluctuated substantially during the interaction between protein and ligands. The average RMSF value of apo-protein, TM-L1, TM-L2, TM-L6, and TM-NAM are 1.82 \u00c5, 1.78 \u00c5, 1.84 \u00c5, 2.89 \u00c5, 3.74 \u00c5 respectively. For the majority of residues, a small RMSF (within 1.84 \u00c5) in the TM-L2 complex is found, a high fluctuation of 2.74 \u00c5 is identified in the loop region adjacent to the residue 150, and a maximum fluctuation of 5.11 \u00c5 is noticed in the helix region of residues 220-230. Overall, RMSF of the residues, HIS296, ASP435, CYS437, GLN438, GLY439, TRP461, GLY462, GLY464, and CYS465 are lower for all ligand-bound complexes and apoprotein. It can also be said that the RMSF value of TM-L2 is lower than TM-NAM. The radius of gyration (R g ) is used to measure protein structural compactness. The lower degree of fluctuation in the simulation with its consistency implies the increased compactness and rigidity of a system. In Figure 6D ; the Rg of apo-protein (average Rg $22.06) is the most stable concerning the consistency of fluctuations in the simulation.",

For all complexes and apo-protein almost equal value of SASA is reported ( Figure 6E ). The average SASA value of apo-protein, TM-L1, TM-L2, TM-L6, and TM-NAM are 17414 \u00c5 2 , 16757 \u00c5 2 , 16890 \u00c5 2 , 18169 \u00c5 2 , 16853 \u00c5 2 , respectively. Therefore, it can be proposed that the binding of TM-L2 may decrease the expansion of protein. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds play a role in conformational stability. For all complexes, the numbers of hydrogen bonds are determined. In Figure 6F , the total number of hydrogen bonds is calculated for all complexes. The average total hydrogen bond numbers for apoprotein, TM-L1, TM-L2, TM-L6, and TM-NAM complexes are 680, 637, 650, 687, and 631 respectively. For apo-protein, the highest number of hydrogen bonds is reported. The total hydrogen bond numbers found for TM-L2 are nearly analogous to TM-NAM.

The energy and structural information vary with some parameters including bond energies, bond angle energies, dihedral angle energies, planarity energies, Van der Waals energies, and Columbic interaction energies are here considered as a variable. Different cluster formation on the PCA plot as shown in Figure 7A reveals the similarity and dissimilarity between apo and protein-ligand complexes. The PC1 and PC2 score plots are considered in this study. From Figure 7A , it has been observed that the first principal component analysis (PC1) describes 45.53% of the variability and the second principal component (PC2) covers 23.74% of the variability. The scores plot shows that clusters of apo, L2 ligands are overlapped to each other to a great extent. In addition, by maintaining a small difference from apo and L2 clusters, clusters of L1 and NAM are also overlapped. Interestingly, it is shown from the loading plot ( Figure 7B ) that bond energies, bond angle, VdW are found in the same distinct area where the clusters are formed on the scores plot ( Figure 7B ). This reveals that these variables may have influenced the formation of different clusters in the scores plot. However, the cluster of L6 shows a noticeable deviation from apo's cluster. During MD simulation both TM-L6 complex exhibit the fluctuating nature that could be responsible for wider distribution in the score plot. Both the TM-L1 and TM-L2 complexes are in the lowest deviation compared to other complexes, especially the TM-L2 complex approximately overlaps with the cluster of apoprotein. Hence, it can be considered as a potential candidate. Figure 7C illustrates the binding free energy of all the ligands which are obtained from the prodigy-ligand web server. Here, the TM-L6 complex shows greater stability (around \u00c08.9 kcal/mol) than any other complex.",

These groups and rings are themselves bonded together through a single bond and connected to the benzene ring, hence the ligands are positioned together on the first and second quadrants of the QSAR pattern. It can be concluded that their position in the same quadrants is due to having structural similarities. Therefore, the binding energies are also observed in the range of -8.8 and -9.8 kcal/mol. It is explored that L1, L2, and L6 give the best performance against the targeted protein that supports the generated QSAR pattern. On the other side, L12, L14, L17, L24, L27, L30, and L31 are containing formamidine, diphenylmethyl and propylguanidine groups along with naphthalene, biphenyl, pyrrolidine, and benzothiazole rings. These chemical fragments are attached to the secondary amide group in the corresponding ligand structures and the ligands are clustered together on the third and fourth quadrants for their structural similarities. QSAR pattern reveals that L17 is quite different from the others located on the first quadrant which is compatible with the lower binding affinity obtained from molecular docking. The reason can be due to the presence of more branching in the ligand structure resulting in a larger size, therefore, the interaction between ligand and protein becomes less as ligand size does not fit the binding pocket of the targeted protein. In contrast, L14, L27, and L24 give comparatively more binding energy and lie in the same quadrant of the QSAR pattern. For instance, the presence of dioxosulfide and sulfur groups might enhance the possibility of more interactions. However, L6 is analyzed as the best candidate from molecular dynamics. The reason might be having of formamidine group which contains two nitrogen atoms and one double bond; hence, the density of electrons can be higher and can influence the physical and chemical properties.",

Again, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profile of a drug is greatly affected by a drug transporter called Phosphorylated glycoprotein (P-gp) and also the absorption and bioavailability of a drug are boosted by the P-gp inhibitors. The ligands might have the potential to interact with p-glycoprotein which is characterized as ABC transporter. On the other hand, blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a serious obstacle to drug distribution to the central nervous system (CNS). Approximately the square route of molecular weight is inversely related to the BBB. The drugs having higher molecular weight cross the BBB sufficiently to affect the central nervous system (CNS) (Banks, 2009) . From the calculation, it has been found that the selected three ligands L1, L2, and L6 have relatively good BBB penetration probability and thus may not affect CNS function. From the observed data, it can be predicted that the selected ligands may be safe for humans.",

            "text": "In this study, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, QSAR analysis, PCA, and ADMET tools are employed to detect potent ligands for TMPRSS2, analyzing 7476 ligands from the zinc database. A strong binding affinity is obtained for three ligands (L1, L2 and L6). Significant number of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are detected. MD simulation is conducted to verify the stability of ligands, and found to be more stable, making more hydrogen bond interactions with TMPRSS-2, than the control NAM ligand. Here, L1, L2, L4, L5, L6, L10, L13, L16, L21, and L26 ligands contain amide as well as formamidine groups, naphthalene, biphenyl, and pyrrolidine rings. These groups and rings are themselves bonded together through a single bond and connected to the benzene ring, hence the ligands are positioned together on the first and second quadrants. On the other side, L12, L14, L17, L24, L27, L30, and L31 ligands have formamidine, diphenylmethyl and propylguanidine groups along with naphthalene, biphenyl, pyrrolidine, and benzothiazole rings. These chemical fragments are attached to the secondary amide group in the corresponding ligand structures and therefore, the ligands are clustered together on the third and fourth quadrants. The capability of MLR regression to predict accurately the binding energy of the validated ligands is measured by root-mean-square-relative percent errors (RMS%RE). The MLR regression revealed a high accuracy of 80% for the prediction of the binding energy of ligands compared with the binding energy obtained from molecular docking. It can be concluded that most of the selected ligands have shown promise and can be used to design effective antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV-2.",
