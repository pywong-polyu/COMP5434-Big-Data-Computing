A major limitation in most scRNAseq analysis pipelines is the reliance on manual annotations to determine cell identities, which are time consuming, subjective, and require expertise. Given the surge in cell sequencing, supervised methods-especially deep learning models-have been developed for automatic cell type identification (ACTI), which achieve high accuracy and scalability. However, all existing deep learning frameworks for ACTI lack interpretability and are used as \"black-box\" models. We present N-ACT (Neural-Attention for Cell Type identification): the first-of-its-kind interpretable deep neural network for ACTI utilizing neural attention to detect salient genes for use in cell-types identification. We compare N-ACT to conventional annotation methods on two previously manually annotated data sets, demonstrating that N-ACT accurately identifies marker genes and cell types in an unsupervised manner, while performing comparably on multiple data sets to current state-of-the-art model in traditional supervised ACTI. \u2021 Equal contribution",

To mitigate these challenges, researchers have developed automatic cell type identification (ACTI) pipelines, including deep learning (DL) models such as ACTINN (Ma & Pellegrini, 2019) , which learn from datasets that have already been annotated from the same (or similar) populations (see (Pasquini et al., 2021) for a review on ACTI).

We focus on unsupervised ACTI, which consists of the following stages: (Stage I) Generating labels through graph-based clustering followed by identifying five thousand highly-variable genes for efficient training (standard practice in scRNAseq pipelines), (Stage II) Training the N-ACT DL core to predict generated (or true) labels, with the goal of identifying salient genes to predict the correct cell types (labels), and (Stage III) Interpreting model predictions by extracting attention values, thus constructing a ranked list of \"attentive genes\" used to compare to existing literature (referred to as \"Querying Salient Genes\" in the figure) and thus predicting cell types. We describe each component in more detail in the Appendix. processing research (refer to (Chaudhari et al., 2021) for a review on attention in DL). Attention networks aim to mimic the way humans understand \"context\" in sentences or details in images by focusing on a subset of significant features for a given objective. The use of attention-based NN for scRNAseq analysis is still in its infancy, with only a few successful applications to date. To identify salient genes, we use an additive attention module (Bahdanau et al., 2015) in a feed-forward NN (similar to (Raffel & Ellis, 2015) ) aiming to learn the optimal weighting (importance) of all genes for each cell, given a downstream task.",

We design the projection blocks to be multi-headed (consisting of h \u2208 N separate linear operators), a concept shown by (Vaswani et al., 2017) as effective in learning different representations. Such design allows efficient consideration of different gene subsets and improves model performance without the need for numerous non-linear layers. N-ACT consists of k projection blocks, each consisting of h heads. Outputs from each head is then concatenated and inputted to a point-wise feed-forward network (equivalent to 1\u00d71 convolution layer) with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) (Nair & Hinton, 2010) that adds non-linearity. Through careful ablation studies, we found that k = 2 projection blocks with h = 10 heads provides the appropriate balance of accuracy and efficiency.

We show that N-ACT effectively identifies cell-types, in a supervised and, more importantly, unsupervised manner. N-ACT is a first attempt at providing interpretability in this context, and we believe our improvements and developments reduce subjectivity while significantly minimizing the time needed for annotating scRNAseq datasets. Optimizing the scRNAseq annotation process will accelerate translational and basic research by enabling scientists to focus on the underlying biological questions. Our results demonstrate that N-ACT accurately identifies salient genes that are known markers for the underlying populations, without prior knowledge of the system or species. Moreover, the interpretability of our framework is useful for predicting the correct cell-types, and for better understanding the data when there is ambiguity (e.g. Appendix G) or when the model makes mistakes. As such, N-ACT provides a powerful tool for facilitating discovery, even if its top prediction is ultimately incorrect. Using our model, cells can be assigned cell-types by new users without prior expertise in the given system, within minutes. From these conclusions, we hypothesize that attention can be further utilized to identify unique relationships between different genes and cells, which would not otherwise be apparent. Despite successful application of DL in scRNAseq space, most DL models are not interpretable. Biologically-interpretable DL models, such as N-ACT, can provide crucial information on the algorithm's decision making, while assisting scientists in understanding underlying complex biological networks.",

Our ablation studies show that adding a residual connection improves model performance (Table A. 3). Skip connections are added to projection block outputs and normalized using Layer-Norm (Ba et al., 2016) ) before being used as input for the next layer.",

To test our hypothesis regarding residual connections, we tested N-ACT (10 heads, 2 projection blocks) with and without skip connections.

Residual connections are identity mappings added to the output of each layer, with this quantity normalized and used as inputs for subsequent layers. ",

We tested training N-ACT for more epochs and found that the accuracy of predictions increases; however, a learning rate scheduling is beneficial in avoiding overfitting (when training over 100 epochs). When training for longer epochs, we employed an exponential learning rate decay with \u03b3 = 0.95 and a decay schedule of every 10 epochs. We chose 50 epochs to balance accuracy and training time efficiency. Given that many manual annotations are typically performed with only a few genes (often two or three (Luecken & Theis, 2019) ), it is possible to have populations that are broad and ambiguous. This was the case with two populations of COVID PBMC data (Yao et al., 2021) , namely the original annotations \"Proliferating Lymphocytes\" and \" Unidentified Lymphocytes\" (Fig. A.8 ). Here we utilize N-ACT to disambiguate these broad annotations without re-clustering or further complex analyses.",

Intuitively, these results are expected given the quantitative and qualitative similarity of this population with the CD8+ T cell population. It is important to note that the difference in gene overlap percentages of top three predictions, namely CD8 proliferating T, CD4 proliferating T, and proliferating natural killer populations is very small, which may explain why the original annotations were left broadly as proliferating lymphocytes. Enrichment analysis for \"unidentified lymphocytes\" yielded natural killer cells as the most probable cell type, with other viable populations also being statistically significant. Similar to the previous population, our results are possibly intuitive given the closeness of the proliferating lymphocytes to CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. Additionally, there is known overlap in the gene sets between of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. Lastly, we note that the second most probable population based on attentive genes are CD8+ effector memory T, suggesting that the \"unidentified lymphocyte\" population could likely be refined into two or more populations. These results further signify the utility of N-ACT for unsupervised annotation, and the applicability of our framework in tandem with other annotation forms to provide interpretability and validation.",

            "text": "The idea behind the N-ACT projection block is to learn various representations for different gene subsets in each cell. Projection block design was inspired by the multi-head attention architecture presented in (Vaswani et al., 2017) ; however, the projections are not multi-head attention mechanisms. One way to think about the multi-head projection block is to view it as a set of h linear projections, with each l h : R B\u00d7N \u2192 R B\u00d7d (B is the number of samples and N is the number of genes) done sequentially and independent of one-another (e.g. in a for loop). However, as noted by (Vaswani et al., 2017) , these projections can be done more efficiently through creating a tensor L \u2208 R B\u00d7h\u00d7d , which acts the same way as the collection of the individual linear operators. In this formulation, 0 \u2261 N (mod h), and the last projection component, the Appendix G. Utility of N-ACT for Disambiguation of Broad Annotations ",
