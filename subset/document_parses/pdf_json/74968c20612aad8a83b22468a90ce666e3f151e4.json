These modes combine pressure and volume modes by delivering a targeted volume via a pre-defined pressure range (minimal and maximal inspiratory positive airway pressure) set on the ventilator [31] . There is no support in the literature for the use of these modes in long-term NIV. So why opt for them when the simple bi-level ST-PSV modality is widely used by prescribers and accepted by the patients?

Firstly, although the survey was conducted among members of the ERS assembly for NIV, specifically dedicated to noninvasive respiratory support, results may not be representative of physicians' clinical experience and perceptions of long-term NIV treatment of patients with RTD across Europe. Secondly, the 22% response rate could be considered as relatively low. However, it is in line with reported response rates for electronic surveys. In addition, some RTDs are rare diseases, sometimes managed only in few dedicated and specialised centres: this could have further affected the overall response rate. Thirdly, there may be a selection bias in this survey, with almost two-thirds of responders working in university teaching hospitals: this may impact on severity of cases, and choice of devices and settings.",

Compared to the previous EUROVENT survey, it showed different reasons to initiate LTHNIV and goals to be achieved. Patterns of ventilation and modes used have changed considerably, highlighting the increase in use of combined modes in LTHNIV. Follow-up of these patients before the COVID-19 pandemic was mainly via outpatient visits or home care programmes with an in-person appointment. We expect that after the COVID-19 global pandemic, common practice will change significantly via the use of telemonitoring and telehealth techniques. Further studies are needed to evaluate what has changed in the clinical practice of LTHNIV in these patients affected by rare NMD.",
