In 2016, Taiwan completed its modernization of the Communicable Disease Control (CDC) and Disaster Prevention and Protection (DPP) Acts to provide legal support for emergency curfew, materials requisition, interjurisdictional coordination and economic stabilization [3] . These empowered the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) to mobilize resources from civil administration (such as police and fire departments etc.), transportation and even the national defense system. To establish public cohesion, the CECC was activated early on in January 2020; this has been central to Taiwan's success in facilitating information transparency, case-based responses and population-based interventions [1, 2] .",

Over the years, Taiwan has rehearsed its Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) surveillance and response system through H1N1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and avian flu scenarios. To prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed by crowds of COVID patients, Taiwan has integrated quarantine infirmaries, surge facilities and major medical centers into a sophisticated support network aimed at curbing community transmission [1, 2] . As early as mid-January 2020, Taiwan's healthcare facilities started shifting to crisis operation mode by implementing visitor entry control, patient flow reconfiguration and zone compartmentalization [1, 2, 4] . Hospitals are required to place all admitted COVID patients in isolated wards, and to follow the evidence-based treatment guidelines issued by CECC. Taiwan's National Healthcare Insurance (NHI) has also provided advanced payment plans to ensure hospitals' financial sustainability during the pandemic.",
