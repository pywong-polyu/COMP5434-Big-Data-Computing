This word is more complicated than previously studied words w a/b in two major ways. Unlike all words w a/b whose structures were previously known, the natural description of w 5/4 is not as an image under a coding of a fixed point of a morphism, since \u03c4 (z) is not a factor of w 5/4 . Additionally, the value of d in the image \u03d5(n j ) = u (n + d) i varies with j. The sequence 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, . . . of d values is periodic with period length 8, hence the 8 types of letters. These properties make the proofs significantly more intricate.",

We use a method based on [2, Section 6]. However, this is another situation in which the structure of the word w 5/4 is more complex. The sequence 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, . . . of increments d in Notation 2 is periodic with period length 8, but each of the first five columns is periodic with period length at most 4. In other words, the factors starting at positions i and i + 24 are possibly equal when i is sufficiently large. Therefore we need to run the following procedure for two different sets of positions instead of one. These two sets are (\u03d5(s) ). We also need to specify a set N of integers that, roughly speaking, represent the possible values that each symbolic n can take. Let S be a set of positions, and let N be a set of integers. As in Lemma 5, the set N represents values of n such that the last letter of \u03c4 (\u03d5(n j )), namely n + d for some d \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, is a letter in p\u03c4 (\u03d5(s)). We maintain classes of positions corresponding to possibly equal factors starting at those positions. Start with = 0, for which all length-0 factors are equal. Then all positions belong to the same class S. At each step, we increase by 1, and for each position i we consider the factor of length starting at position i, extended from the previous step by one letter to the right. We break each class into new classes according to the last letter of each extended factor, as described in the following paragraph. We stop once each class contains exactly one position, because then each factor occurs at most once. Note that this procedure does not necessarily terminate, depending on the inputs.

Now if |x| \u2265 2, the subscripts of the penultimate letters of x and x are even and either equal each other or differ by 4. They cannot differ by 4; otherwise \u03c4 (x ) = \u03c4 (x ) since the subsequence of letters with even subscripts in \u03d5(s) is a factor of (0 0 0 2 1 4 1 6 ) \u03c9 . So they must be equal and then \u03d5(x ) = \u03d5(x ). Then p\u03c4 (\u03d5(z))w = p\u03c4 (\u03d5(z))\u03c4 (\u03d5(u )) contains the 5/4-power \u03c4 (\u03d5(x y x )) as a suffix. Therefore, decreasing that letter n + 2 to c introduces a 5/4-power in p\u03c4 (\u03d5(s)) ending in position i. Case 2.2. Suppose that xyx starts before \u03c4 (u ) in p\u03c4 (u ). In particular, \u03c4 (u ) is a suffix of xyx. Since i \u2265 331040, the first x is not a factor of p. Otherwise, we have i \u2212 |p| \u2212 6|z| + 1 6 = |u| = |\u03c4 (u )| \u2264 |xyx| = 5|x| \u2264 5|p|, which implies i \u2264 31|p| + 6|z| \u2212 1 = 331039. Therefore, the first x overlaps p but is not a factor of p. Suppose the overlap length is at least 5. Then the first x contains 20003 as a factor. But since 20003 is never a factor of \u03c4 \u2022 \u03d5, this case does not happen. Now suppose that the overlap length is less than or equal to 4. Then the first factor x = sv is made of a nonempty suffix s of 0003 followed by a nonempty prefix v of \u03c4 (u ) such that vyx = \u03c4 (u ). Write v = \u03c4 (v ), x = \u03c4 (x ) and y = \u03c4 (y ) where v y x = u . To get around the fact that p does not have subscripts, we use z instead. Recall that 0003 is a common suffix of p and \u03c4 (z), and the corresponding suffix in z is 0 0 0 1 0 2 3 3 . So let s be the suffix of 0 0 0 1 0 2 3 3 such that s = \u03c4 (s ). Now observe that x = s v is a subscript-increasing factor of zu , overlapping z. Thus \u03d5(x y x ) is a subscript-increasing suffix of \u03d5(zu ), overlapping \u03d5(z). Similarly to Case 2.1, since \u03c4 (x ) = \u03c4 (s v ) = sv = x = \u03c4 (x ) and |x| \u2265 2, the subscripts of x and x are equal. Consequently, x = x and \u03d5(x ) = \u03d5(x ). Then p\u03c4 (\u03d5(z))w = p\u03c4 (\u03d5(zu )) contains the 5/4-power \u03c4 (\u03d5(x y x )) as a suffix. Therefore, decreasing that letter n + 2 to c introduces a 5/4-power in p\u03c4 (\u03d5(s)) ending in that position i.",
