Previous studies usually model drug information constrained on a single view such as the drug itself, leading to incomplete and noisy information, which limits the accuracy of DDI prediction. In this work, we propose a novel multiview drug substructure network for DDI prediction (\"MSN-DDI\"), which learns chemical substructures from both the representations of the single drug (\"intra-view\") and the drug pair (\"inter-view\") simultaneously and utilizes the substructures to update the drug representation iteratively. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MSN-DDI has almost solved DDI prediction for existing drugs by achieving a relatively improved accuracy of 19.32% and an over 99% accuracy under the transductive setting. More importantly, MSN-DDI exhibits better generalization ability to unseen drugs with a relatively improved accuracy of 7.07% under more challenging inductive scenarios. Finally, MSN-DDI improves prediction performance for real-world DDI applications to new drugs.",

            "text": "Drug combinations can provide therapeutic benefits but also increase the risk of adverse side effects, caused by the physicochemical incompatibility of the drugs [1, 2, 3] . The identification of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remains a challenging task considering that the huge number of drug combinations lead to the pharmaceutical research and clinical trials highly expensive and inefficient, even with high-throughput methods. There lots of computational methods for prediction of side effects caused by DDIs have emerged, which have proven to be an effective and alternative way to alleviate the challenge [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . Most of these methods follow the assumption that drugs with similar features are more likely to have similar interactions. In order to make full use of the raw features of drugs, i.e., drug structures, chemical properties and molecular fingerprints, recent works mainly focus on utilizing the powerful feature extraction ability of deep neural networks [9, 10, 11, 12] . As a drug can be represented as a graph based on its molecular structure, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown the impressive representation learning ability of drug molecules. Existing GNN-based methods for DDI [13, 14, 15] usually take the advantage of GNN's topological and semantic representation capabilities to model the drug itself, and then learn the representation of drug pairs based on the respective representation of each drug. Finally, the representations of drugs or drug pairs are used for final DDI prediction.",

Existing works can be roughly classified into two categories: implicit and explicit manners, depending on how the substructure is used. The implicit manner usually takes substructure features as inputs of the model, which doesn't explicitly learn a specific substructure through the neural network [17, 18] . As a contrast, the other approach, including SSI-DDI [19] , GMPNN-CS [20] and so on, extracts the respective substructures of a pair of drugs in drug representation learning stage and predict DDI effect by identifying pairwise interactions between two drugs' substructures in the final readout module, leading to an improvement in performance over previous methods. However, the extracted substructures of a drug pair are only combined and used in the readout module for final DDI prediction instead of playing a direct role in the drug representation learning.",

For example, MHCADDI [21] considers external message passing mechanism between drugs' structures to integrate joint drug-drug information during the representation learning phase for individual drugs. GoGNN [22] leverages the dual attention mechanism to capture the information from both entity graphs and structured-entity interaction graph, hierarchically.

This makes the model equally applicable to inductive settings where only the chemical structure of the drug itself is accessible. MSN-DDI consists of the following main components, including repetitive multi-view substructure extraction blocks as the encoders (MSN encoders) to model different orders of neighboring information, layer-wise substructure pooling layers as the substructure extraction module to learn substructures from different perspectives and the self-attention scoring function as the MSN decoder for final DDI prediction. Specifically, we regard the drug representations as the intra-view and drug pair interactions as the inter-view and thus define graph attention network layers respectively to learn two sets of substructures corresponding to each view. The two sets of substructures are further used to update node representations for the next MSN encoder block. Our comprehensive evaluation on DrugBank and Twosides datasets demonstrated that MSN-DDI has achieved 19.32% relative accuracy improvement on the transductive setting and 7.07% relative improvement to unseen drugs on the inductive setting. Furthermore, the AUC reaches 99.47% on DrugBank and 99.90% on Twosides for the transductive setting respectively, which indicates MSN-DDI almost has solved the DDI prediction task for existing drugs. In addition, MSN-DDI exhibits the usefulness of DDI prediction to new approved drugs and could also show some clues to interpret the DDI effect to interactions among substructures of the drug pair. All these results suggest that MSN-DDI can act as a useful tool for DDI prediction and thus greatly facilitate the drug design and discovery process.",

Specifically, as demonstrated in the ablation study, intra-view and inter-view are two variants of our model, which remove the inter-view interaction and intra-view interaction, respectively while the multi-view panel is the full MSN-DDI neural network. We first used the SAGpooling layers to obtain the contribution scores of each atom in drugs, and extract the top k atoms as important atoms based on contribution scores for each block (k = 10 for Hydroxychloroquine and k = 15 for Azithromycin). Then, we count and select the important atoms with more than 3 occurrences in all blocks as the final learned substructures and highlighted them with shadows colored in green ( Figure 3 ).",

As a comparison, important atoms learned by MSN-DDI are centralized to some certain regions of the drug chemical structure to form steady substructures and these atoms can be regarded as stacking the important atoms from both the inter-view and intra-view. As a result. MSN-DDI with multi-view made a perfect prediction (i.e., a prediction score of 0.99) for this case. This analysis implies that MSN-DDI is not only a good DDI predictor but also could provide some clues to interpret the DDI effect to possible interactive atoms, which may facilitate detecting the underlying mechanism of the combination of drug pairs.",

Extensive experiments have verified the state-of-the-art performance for DDI prediction on both transductive and inductive settings. The MSN-DDI has achieved significant improvements with 19.32% accuracy on Twosides in transductive setting compared with the SOTA methods. More importantly, the performance of our proposed method has achieved significant improvement in more challenging inductive scenarios, with an average improvement 7.07% on DrugBank and 5.40% on Twosides in accuracy compared with the SoTA methods. By performing intra-view message passing within each drug, as well as inter-view message passing between two drugs, we have demonstrated the power of integrating joint drug-drug information during the substructure representation learning phase for DDI prediction. Future directions could put more attention on the generalization of the model for new drugs in the inductive learning setting, which approximates a real-world scenario where there is a new drug without knowing prior associated drug interactions.",
