In randomized clinical trials, treatment with baricitinib plus remdesivir has been shown to reduce recovery time and improve clinical symptoms in patients with COVID-19 [1] . Baricitinib was approved by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare as a therapeutic drug for COVID-19 on April 23, 2021; therefore, three drugs, namely dexamethasone, remdesivir, and baricitinib, have now been approved for treating moderate or severe cases of COVID-19 in Japan. A randomized, double-blind study has demonstrated that the additional administration of baricitinib to standard therapy (corticosteroids or corticosteroids plus remdesivir) reduces the mortality rate for COVID-19 patients who required oxygenation [2] . Besides, a recent retrospective observational study has shown that combination therapy with baricitinib, remdesivir, and dexamethasone is safe and effective in moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients in real-world clinical practice [3] . Based on these backgrounds, the three-drug regimen is expected to become a promising treatment for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients. While treating COVID-19 patients with combination therapy comprising these three agents, we have observed unusual transient leukocytopenia in the early phase of the combination therapy.",

Blood cell counts including total and differential leukocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, and platelet count were retrospectively analyzed from samples collected at the following three time points: before the start of combination therapy (period 1), within 24 h of starting combination therapy (period 2), and within 48 h of period 2 (period 3). The data are expressed as the median with interquartile range (IQR). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The ManneWhitney U test was used for the analysis of continuous variables. Results with a pvalue < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.",

The median duration from onset to admission was 9 days. Eight cases required standard oxygen therapy from a nasal cannula, two required oxygen therapy from a high-flow nasal cannula, and one required mechanical ventilation support. Nine of the 12 patients had underlying diseases including respiratory disorders. All patients received systemic corticosteroids, remdesivir, and baricitinib soon after admission. The blood cell counts of each individual case are summarized in Table 2 . The leukocyte count on admission (period 1) of all patients was within the normal range. As shown in Fig. 1A , the leukocyte count significantly decreased at period 2 with combination therapy compared to period 1 (median, 4915/mL; IQR, 4302.5e5910 vs. median, 2580/mL; IQR, 2355e3107.5, p \u00bc 0.0006), and subsequently increased at period 3 (median, 7205/mL; IQR, 5972.5e8605, p \u00bc 0.0001; Fig. 1A ). There was no significant change in hemoglobin concentration or platelet count from period 1 to period 3 ( Fig. 1B and C) . We also analyzed changes in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in the nine patients whose leukocyte fractions could be evaluated. As shown in Table 1 Fig. 2A , the neutrophil count was significantly decreased at period 2 compared to period 1 (median, 4669/mL; IQR, 4039e5024, vs. median, 1631/mL; IQR, 1264e2161, p \u00bc 0.019), and significantly increased at period 3 (median, 5453/mL; IQR, 4383.5e6642.5, p \u00bc 0.018; Fig. 2A ); however, no significant change was observed in lymphocyte count from period 1 to period 3 (Fig. 2B ).",

The mechanism of transient leukocytopenia soon after combination therapy is unknown; however, considering that leukocytopenia occurred in a very short period, the temporally abnormal distribution of leukocytes may be a potential cause. Indeed, inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation reduces intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression [4] , which may inhibit the adhesion of neutrophils to blood vessel walls and facilitate extravascular migration. Given that baricitinib is a reversible inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) 1/JAK2, which suppresses cytokine-induced phosphorylation of STAT3, baricitinib potentially induces short-term leukocyte depletion in blood, and thus, transient leukocytopenia.",

Nevertheless, we believe that transient leukocytopenia in 11 of 12 cases ( Table 2 ) was unlikely to be a coincidence. Second, the cause of transient leukocytopenia could not be precisely determined in this study. Since changes in leukocyte count occurred during the combination therapy, drug-induced effects may have resulted in the leukocytopenia. Considering the mechanism of action of baricitinib [7] , it is a potential candidate for inducing transient leukocytopenia.
