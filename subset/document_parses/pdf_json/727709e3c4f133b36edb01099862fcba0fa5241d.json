A parallel-group (intervention and control) study was conducted amongst 72 overweight airline pilots (body mass index > 25) over a 12-month period following the emergence of COVID-19. The intervention group (n = 35) received a personalized dietary, sleep, and physical activity program over a 17-week period. The control group (n = 37) received no intervention. Measurements for subjective health (physical activity, sleep quality and quantity, fruit and vegetable intake, and self-rated health) via an electronic survey, and objective measures of body mass and blood pressure were taken at baseline and at 12 months. Significant interactions for group \u00d7 time from baseline to 12-months were found for all outcome measures (p < 0.001). Body mass and mean arterial pressure significantly decreased in the intervention group when compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Outcome measures for subjective health (physical activity, sleep quality and quantity, fruit and vegetable intake, and self-rated health) significantly increased in the intervention group when compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Results provide preliminary evidence that a brief three-component healthy sleep, diet and physical activity intervention can elicit and sustain long-term improvements in body mass and blood pressure management, health behaviors, and perceived subjective health in pilots and may support quality of life during an unprecedented global pandemic.",

Following the World Health Organization's characterization of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, the global commercial airline industry experienced an approximate 60-80% decrease in flight operations during the proceeding months [2] . Accordingly, airline pilots have been affected by decreased work availability [1] , job security, financial concerns, increased time spent confined to the indoors due to self-isolation requirements during travel [3] , and limited control over food choices during hotel self-isolation after flying internationally. The consequent psychosocial impacts of these conditions may adversely affect the engagement in health promoting behaviors [4] .",

Measurements of blood pressure were conducted according to the standardized aviation medicine protocol [37] . Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) readings were used to calculate mean arterial pressure (MAP) with the following formula: DP + 1/3(SP\u2212DP) [38] .

These results are important for researchers and health care professionals to provide insight into prolonged health and quality of life perturbations resulting from COVID-19 that may have potential implications to flight safety.

            "text": "Another gap in the literature base is whether body mass gain observed during lockdown conditions is associated with increased blood pressure, which remains largely unexplored. The body mass gain evident in our control group was associated with a 3.8 mmHg increase in SBP at 12-months, compared to a reduction of 10.3 mmHg observed in the intervention group. The SBP reduction observed in the intervention group is comparable with previous research, which reported a 9.5 mmHg reduction in SBP at 12-months following an intensive diet and exercise lifestyle intervention [51] . Correspondingly, in our intervention group we observed a DBP reduction of 2.9 mmHg, and a further 4.9 mmHg at four-months and 12-months, respectively. Compared with our present findings, a similar longitudinal relationship between body mass and blood pressure following intentional weight loss has been reported [52] . Stevens and colleagues reported participants who succeeded at weight loss maintenance at 36 months post-intervention also maintained blood pressure reduction obtained after the intervention, whereas participants who gained weight also experienced increased blood pressure [52] .",

Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated associations between sleep and mental health [53] . Further, negative changes in sleep quality during the pandemic have been associated with negative affect, worry and elevated psychosocial stress [54, 55] . These findings may be contributed to by additional factors acting on the pilot population during the time of this study, including decreased work availability [1] , job security, financial concerns, increased time spent confined to the indoors due to self-isolation requirements during travel [3] , and limited control over food choices during hotel self-isolation after flying internationally.",

Weight loss factors such as restrictive diets and restrictive caloric patterns have been suggested as effective in the short term, but often have a poor long term success rate, leading to weight regain [56] . Whereas the methods utilized in the present study supported a physically active lifestyle, managing life stress with health behaviors, accountability, and facilitation of autonomy via self-determined goal setting, all of which are associated with successful weight loss maintenance [57] . Airline pilots have been reported to exhibit higher personality scores for maturity, emotional stability, and intelligence when compared to general population norms [58] . These characteristics may positively influence intervention engagement and adherence, thus presenting an important consideration when generalizing our findings to the general population.",

Firstly, although the sample size provided adequate power to distinguish statistically significant effects in the key outcome variables, the differential recruitment strategies and participant self-selection may have contributed to the differences which were observed at baseline for age, fruit and vegetable intake, weekly walking minutes, PCS-12 and MCS-12 scores, sleep duration, and MAP, with healthier characteristics in favor of the control group. Further, those who voluntarily participated in the intervention may have had strong motivation to engage in healthy change, which may have supported the magnitude of intervention effects observed. Thus, it is advisable that future research implements a randomization design, assigning conditions to participants. Secondly, for feasibility purposes the present study utilized self-report measures for health behaviors, which inherently produce lower accuracy to more invasive objective measures. To enhance outcome measure validity and reliability, utilization of objective methods would be preferential such as actigraphy to monitor sleep and physical activity, and photo logging of dietary behaviors to quantify health behavior metrics; however, this would be somewhat difficult to achieve over a period of 12-months.",

Further, body mass, blood pressure, and weekly MVPA continued to improve at 12-months compared to post-intervention, whereas other health parameter improvements demonstrated non-significant trivial to small magnitudes of decay from post intervention. These findings suggest that achievement of these three guidelines promote physical and mental health and improves quality of life among pilots during a global pandemic, yet more regular monitoring post intervention may further strengthen behavior change maintenance. Our study provides preliminary evidence that a multi-behavior intervention may be efficacious during a pandemic and that similar outcomes may be transferrable to other populations.",
