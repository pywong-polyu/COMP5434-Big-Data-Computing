Five were female and six were male. The mean age at presentation was 7.8 years (range 18 months\u221213 years). Six children had been seen and discharged in the week prior to their subsequent diagnosis. Their initial diagnoses were COVID-19 infection, scarlet fever, migraine, viral upper respiratory tract infection, suspected bacterial sepsis and bacterial tonsillitis. The mean time between first presentation and admission was 2.7 days (range 0-5 days). The most common symptoms at first presentation for these six patients were fever (six patients), vomiting (four patients), headache (three patients) and rash (three patients) (table 1) . Two patients were ambulated on intravenous antibiotics while the remaining were discharged with no follow-up. All three patients who had blood tested on first presentation had a raised C-reactive protein (CRP) (range 58-137 mg/L) and lymphopenia (range 0.63-0.83\u00d710 9 /L), two had hyponatraemia (results 132 and 134 mmol/L).",
