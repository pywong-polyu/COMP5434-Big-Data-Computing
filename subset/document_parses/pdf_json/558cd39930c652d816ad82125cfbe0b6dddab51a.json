The term was originally coined to denote co-eternal binary opposition and has been especially studied in philosophy. For example, there is duality in ethics (good -bad), in human beings (man -Nietzsche's\u00fcbermensch or man -god) and in logic (true -false). In addition, dualism determines in a great extent our everyday lives (ugly -beautiful, happyunhappy, etc.), and our relations with other people (rich -poor, black -white, love -hate, etc.). None of these concepts can be understood without their dual concepts, since this duality and opposition generates their meaning and interpretation. Dualism is also crucial in mathematics and physics (e.g., matterantimatter), and is the power behind our whole information society and our binary data.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction: Why Dualism Is Important"}, {"text": "Moving from philosophy, sciences and everyday life to information retrieval, we find a very vague situation.

In such tasks users do not accurately know their information need and can not be satisfied by a single 'hit' [5] . Consequently, users spend a lot of time reformulating queries and investigating results, in order to construct a conceptual model regarding their information need. Information needs that include non-monosemous terms can be considered such exploratory tasks.

We shall hereafter use t t to denote that the terms t and t are antonyms. Building on the \"capitalistic\" example of the previous section, according to the online dictionary Wordnet 1 , socialism capitalism, and war peace. Now, we can generate all possible queries, denoted by Q, where non-monosemous terms of the original query are substituted by their dual ones, as expressed by their antonyms. For example, the query \"capitalism and war\" will generate three extra queries: \"socialism and peace\", \"capitalism and peace\" and \"socialism and war\". Based on Q we can now define two vector spaces. In the first case, the space has |Q| dimensions, where each query is a dimension of the space. Each document is placed in this space according to its relevenace to each query. In the second case we assume a space with only |Q| 2 dimensions. Each dimension represents a pair of dual queries, where each query in the pair contains the antonyms of the other. We denote with q q , that the queries q and q are dual. For our running example, the first pair is (\"capitalism and war\",\"socialism and peace\") and the second one is (\"capitalism and peace\",\"socialism and war\"). Each pair defines an axis, therefore the two pairs define a 2D space against which we can evaluate the \"value\" of each document.

Such criteria include the bias of documents to specific queries (e.g., the original user query), the purity to a specific query, the overview factor of a document regarding either a dual query or all queries, and the diversity of the returned set of documents with respect to these queries. In general, we need to define appropriate ranking methods, that will take into account the relevance of the documents to the available queries for different criteria.

The case of verbs and adverbs is more complicated since they require a kind of grammatical and language analysis (i.e., exist not exist, lot total, a lot bit, etc). There are three categories of antonyms: (a) gradable, (b) relational and (c) complementary. We have gradable antonyms (e.g., hot cold) in cases where the definitions of the words lie on a continuous spectrum. We have relational antonyms (e.g., teacher student) in cases where the two meanings are opposite only within the context of their relationship. The rest are called complementary antonyms (e.g., day night). In general, the selection of the \"right\" antonyms raises various questions. In many cases more than one antonyms exist, so one should decide which one(s) to select. Sometimes this can depend on the context, e.g., the antonym of \"action\" is \"apathy\", but in terms of physics or sociology the dual of \"action\" is \"reaction\".", "cite_spans": [{"start": 184, "end": 187, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 188, "end": 191, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Gordian Knot Solution"}, {"text": "Notice that the proposed approach can be exploited in any context where the aim is to retrieve semantically opposing entities, information, etc. As an example consider the Argument Web [2] , where the approach could be used for retrieving contradicting arguments and providing support for each one of them.

For each task, they were given two lists of results. One contained the results of the query from a popular WSE, and the other one was constructed by interleaving the results of the same WSE for the dual queries of this task (i.e., first the top result of the original query, then the first result of its dual, etc.). The two kinds of lists were given in random order for each task. The users were asked to select the most preferred list and to provide a grade of preference taking values in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, where 5 means that the selected list was preferred much more than the other one. In the background, when users prefer the results of the dual approach, we change the sign of the score and make it negative. The users were not aware how the lists were constructed and were not guided in any way by the evaluator. In Fig. 3 we provide two graphs that describe the results of the evaluation. Figure 3 (a), shows the aggregated scores given by all users to each query, while Fig. 3 (b) shows the aggregated scores given by each participant to all queries. Regarding the first one the results are not the expected ones, although we hypothesize that the users mainly penalized the dual approach because of the 'irrelevant' results to the original query in terms of query tokens and not in terms of relevant information. For eleven of the queries there is a strong preference towards the non-dual approach. The EPR type of queries belong to this category, showing that users are probably not interested for reviews with the opposite direction of what they are looking for. This is especially true for Q 12 , where the dual approach provided results about winter vacations and was the least preferred. For two of the tasks, the approaches are almost incomparable. Both of these tasks belong to the MT group. There are also two queries, Q 3 and Q 15 , where the dual approach is better, especially in the last one. In their comments for these queries, users mention that the selected (i.e., dual) list \"provides a more general picture\" and \"more relevant and interesting results, although contradicting\". Regarding the second graph we have the interesting result that the proposed approach appeals to specific users. It seems that nine users (26% of the participants) have an exploratory nature and generally prefer the dual approach (six of them strongly), while for four of them the two approaches are incomparable. The rest are better served with the non-dual approach. This is an interesting outcome, and in the future we plan to identify the types of users that prefer the dual approach.
