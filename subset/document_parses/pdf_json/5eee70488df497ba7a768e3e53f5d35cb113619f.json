            "text": "Background: The novel coronavirus disease pandemic is the second global health emergency the world has faced in less than two decades, after the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009-2010. Spread of pandemics is frequently associated with increased population size and population density. The geographical scales (national, regional or local scale) are key elements in determining the correlation between demographic factors and the spread of outbreaks. The aims of this study were: (a) to collect the Mexican data related to the two pandemics; (b) to create thematic maps using federal and municipal geographic scales; (c) to investigate the correlations between the pandemics indicators (numbers of contagious and deaths) and demographic patterns (population size and density). Methods: The demographic patterns of all Mexican Federal Entities and all municipalities were taken from the database of \"Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda\" (INEGI). The data of \"Centro Nacional de Programas Preventivos y Control de Enfermedades\" (CENAPRECE) and the geoportal of Mexico Government were also used in our analysis. The results are presented by means of tables, graphs and thematic maps. A Spearman correlation was used to assess the associations between the pandemics indicators and the demographic patterns. Correlations with a p value < 0.05 were considered significant. Results: The confirmed cases (ccH1N1) and deaths (dH1N1) registered during the H1N1 Influenza pandemic were 72.4 thousand and 1.2 thousand respectively. Mexico City (CDMX) was the most affected area by the pandemic with 8,502 ccH1N1 and 152 dH1N1. The ccH1N1 and dH1N1 were positively correlated to demographic patterns; p-values higher than the level of marginal significance were found analyzing the % ccH1N1 and the % dH1N1 vs the population density. The COVID-19 pandemic data indicated 75.0 million confirmed cases (ccCOVID-19) and 1.6 million deaths (dCOVID-19) worldwide, as of date. The CDMX, where 264,330 infections were recorded, is the national epicenter of the pandemic. The federal scale did not allow to observe the correlation between demographic data and pandemic indicators; hence the next step was to choose a more detailed geographical scale (municipal basis). The ccCOVID-19 and dCOVID-19 (municipal basis) were highly correlated with demographic patterns; also the % ccCOVID-19 and % dCOVID-19 were moderately correlated with demographic patterns. Conclusion: The magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic is much greater than the H1N1 Influenza pandemic. The CDMX was the national epicenter in both pandemics. The federal scale did not allow to evaluate the correlation between exanimated demographic variables and the spread of infections, but the municipal basis allowed the identification of local variations and \"red zones\" such as the delegation of Iztapalapa and Gustavo A. Madero in CDMX.",

It was very different from H1N1 viruses formerly identified and, therefore, vaccination of seasonal flu offered little cross-protection (Fraser et al., 2009; Lim & Mahmood, 2011) . Most young people did not show immunity to this virus (Crum-Cianflone et al., 2009 ), but around one-third of the elderly manifested antibodies probably acquired from exposure to other H1N1 virus in their youth (CDC, 2020) . The symptoms of the Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 in people have ranged from mild to severe and include fever, cough, sore throat, nose, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting (Witkop et al., 2010; Petrova & Russell, 2018; Saunders-Hastings et al., 2017) . There were approx. 2.8 million Influenza cases and between 151.7 thousand to 575.4 thousand deaths worldwide (April 2009 -April 2010 mostly people younger than 65 years (CDC, 2020) . Many countries, especially in Africa and Southeast Asia, lacked the ability to perform detection tests and still today, there is no certainty about factual pandemic deaths (WHO, 2020) . Mexico was among the first countries to notify the World Health Organization (WHO) of viral respiratory disease \"Swine flu\" and was, also, one of the most affected nations by this pandemic (Kain & Fowler, 2019; CDC, 2020) . The H1N1 Influenza confirmed cases (ccH1N1) were approx. 72.4 thousand while the deaths (dH1N1) were 1.2 thousand (data updated to 10th April, 2010) (http://www.cenaprece.salud.gob.mx/). On August 10th of 2010, the WHO declared the end of sanitary emergency related to Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic. However, the A (H1N1) pdm09 virus continues to circulate as a seasonal flu virus causing several hospitalizations and deaths in many developing countries every year (WHO, 2020) .",

People with diabetes increased the odds to develop severe symptoms or die from COVID-19 by 2.7 (Williamson et al., 2020) . Patients that suffer from hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease were up to three times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms than people in good health . Williamson et al. (2020) suggested that the risk of mortality from COVID-19 increase in patients with asthma or respiratory disease. The risk of severe symptoms or death from COVID-19 significantly increase in people with cancer, moreover, among patients with blood cancers the mortality rate is twice that of patients with solid tumors (Meng et al., 2020) . According to Simonnet et al. (2020) , people that suffer from obesity increase seven times the odds of developing severe COVID-19.",

Epidemics in smaller cities are generally focused on a shorter period (Dalziel et al., 2018) , while the incidence is diffuse in the bigger urban areas leading to more interaction among local residents, workers and tourist which make them potential hotspots for pandemics spread; therefore, communication routes such as national highways or freeways, and public transport that is, subway, buses and trams could magnify the impact of the outbreaks. Understanding the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 confirmed cases (ccCOVID-19), and their association with demographic factors can benefit to isolate the areas of highest risk of infection and the most vulnerable groups of the population at local scale. The geographical scales (national, regional or local scale) are key elements in determining the correlations between demographic factors and spread of outbreaks.",

The rural zones, as well as the degraded peripheral areas, in most cases, have structural gaps that is, small and poorly efficient hospitals, precarious sanitary conditions that could accelerate the spread of infectious diseases. In regard to COVID-19 pandemic, several countries are facing a second wave of infections, however, Mexico has not been the case yet and this study does not cover that scenario.",

According to Zepeda-Lopez et al.

Even more, while music events such as Est\u00e9reo Picnic, Lollapalooza Chile, Argentina y Brazil were reprogramed for next year, the \"Vive Latino\", one of the most important Rock festivals in Latin America took place in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic, on 14th and 15th March at the Foro Sol Stadium in CDMX, gathering more of 40,000 people. The government and festival organization, instead of suspending the musical show and postpone it on another occasion, have chosen to take health preventive measures installing eight medical tents, filters with infrared thermometers at the entrances, and a team of 92 paramedics, 10 doctors and 8 ambulances (Salud, 2020) .",
