            "text": "Sociologist Rodney Stark concluded that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints was emerging as a \"new world religion \u2026 on the threshold of becoming the first major faith to appear on earth since the Prophet Mohammed rode out of the desert.\" 13 Stark projected approximately 4 percent annual membership growth going forward from 1980 (based on prior growth rates reported by the LDS Church up to that time). His most conservative formulation estimated that, within approximately 100 years (2080), LDS total membership worldwide would be close to 64 million. Keeping track of his projections, Stark noted in 1996 that growth over the prior fifteen years had exceeded his \"highest projection by almost a million members.\" 14 Also in 1996, Bennion and Young projected that there would be between 36.4 and 121 million LDS members worldwide, 15 while acknowledging that \"this prediction \u2026 may well prove wrong.\" 16 Since that time, LDS membership growth has decelerated rapidly, falling from over 5 percent in the late 1980s to 2.03 percent in 2013 and 1.21 percent in 2018. 17 Annual convert baptisms per missionary halved from 7.6 in 1990 to 3.6 in 2018. In 2017, LDS growth rates declined to their lowest levels since 1937, and convert baptisms fell to a thirty-year low. , growth receded further as baptisms of \"children of record\" (i.e. children belonging to already member parents) dropped to 102,102, and convert baptisms changed little from the prior year at 234,332 (compared to the 1990 total of 330,000, the highest number of one-year convert baptisms reported in LDS history). The suspension of in-person proselytism and recall of many missionaries worldwide at the time of this writing, due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, 18 will likely lead to a further decline in church growth (see a similar projection by Evans in Chap. 30 ).",

It is unclear what it means to refer to over 16 million members of the LDS Church today, or what projections based in official membership numbers mean, when only a fraction of nominal members participate in church activities or identify the LDS Church as their faith of preference. Many of the trends which factored in the decline in LDS Church growth over the past two decades were present, and information was available about them at the time, but they were not considered in the projections of Stark, Bennion and Young, and some others. Issues dampening LDS growth were systematically identified in this author's 2003 report. 19 These trends have been further expounded in part by other researchers. 20, 21, 22 Systematic and robust evaluation of both institutional and societal data is necessary for a realistic appraisal of future growth prospects.",

            "text": "The challenges of LDS growth are much greater than official membership numbers suggest: church-reported membership statistics do not take into account the actual level of participation or current belief in LDS teachings of members of record. Phillips observes that \"the church meticulously counts those who join but does not attend to those who leave.\" 23 There is thus a substantial gap between counting people who are formally baptized as members of record and counting people who actually consider themselves to be LDS. Census and sociological data from other sources indicate that LDS official figures correlate with self-identified religious preference at a rate of 90 percent for LDS members in the United States but only 28 percent for international members of record. 24 Church leaders have cited theological reasons for their membership counting practice, which is unlikely to change. 25 A majority of new members in fact are not retained. Many years ago, sociologist Armand Mauss observed that LDS congregational growth trending far below nominal membership growth was a \"clear indication of a retention problem.\" 26 Subsequently Mauss observed in 2001 that \"75 percent of foreign [LDS] converts are not attending church within a year of conversion. In the United States, 50 percent of the converts fail to attend after a year.\" 27 International convert retention rates have been low for decades prior to these observations. 28 Based on weighted data from national censuses, Lawson and Xydias estimated the number of self-identified Latter-day Saints worldwide in 2017 at 8.6 million, or just over half of the Church's nominal 16.1 million members at the time (compared to 27.7 million self-identifying as Adventists and 17.2 million as Jehovah's Witness). 29 LDS Church attendance rates are lower than selfidentified religious preference, although member participation varies widely by country. In 1992, weekly church attendance was estimated to be approximately 40-50 percent in North America, 35 percent in Europe and Africa, and 25 percent in Asia and Latin America. 30 Activity rates have declined modestly since that time. Overall member activity worldwide, or the number who attend at least once monthly, is now estimated at approximately 30-33 percent, or approximately 5 million of the 16.4 million nominal LDS members of record 31 Another 10-15 percent may be \"less-actives,\" that is, those who attend occasionally.",

It drains energy and resources that could otherwise be directed to community outreach and can sap the enthusiasm of active members in local congregations.

The Pew Research Center reported in 2015 that eight in ten US Mormons had a spouse or partner within the faith and that Mormons age 40-50 had an average of 3.4 children. 41 Few LDS members outside of the United States, however, have large families. Heaton reported in 1989 that Latter-day Saints in Britain and Japan had higher fertility rates at that time than the national average in their countries, but fertility was lower than the national average in other countries, like Mexico. 42 However, contemporary Mormons have been marrying later and having fewer children. The 2016 Next Mormons Survey found that adult LDS members in the United States had a mean of 2.42 children, and that 57 percent of Mormon Gen X-ers had zero, one, or two children. 43 LDS couples today are divorcing more frequently than non-LDS couples a generation ago. This trend was already emerging some years back; sociologist Timothy Heaton reported from his studies in the late 1990s that the divorce rate of US Mormons lagged only 5-10 percent behind the national average of 50 percent. 44 The increasing uncertainty of Mormon marriages, intended to endure for \"time and all eternity,\" coupled with modern financial pressures, have made higher education and full-or part-time employment necessities for most LDS women. Brigham Young University sociologist Marie Cornwall noted back in 2002 that US Latter-day Saint women \"have one more child than the national average, [and] are in the labor force at the same rate as other women, but [are] more likely to be in low-paying jobs.\" 45 Declining viability of traditional gender roles in modern societies makes a substantial increase in future LDS birth rates unlikely.",

Nevertheless, LDS youth retention is eroding. Riess reports that whereas approximately 50 percent of members in prior generations remained active in the LDS Church, only 25 percent of Millennials remained active, with an average age of 19 at disaffiliation. 52 The combination of declining birth rates and declining youth retention creates a demographic \"math problem\" for the LDS Church. 53 The intergenerational transmission of Mormonism in its heartland (the intermountain-west area of the United States) has now fallen below the replacement rate. Based on demographic data, sociologist Ryan Cragun predicts that members of the LDS Church are likely to be a minority in Utah by the 2040s. 54 These demographic facts have an impact on convert growth through proselyting: The LDS missionary effort has experienced diminishing results from compounding factors of declining birth rates, which result in fewer young people available at mission ages (18 for males, 19 for females), fewer young people serving missions (due to lower youth retention), and fewer converts per missionary.",

(By contrast, in 2017, the Seventh-day Adventist Church reported average church attendance of 146,351 in its two Indonesian Unions. 64 ) In South Asia, the LDS Church is located mainly in India, with some members in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Membership in these countries increased from 3964 in 2000 to 15,592 in 2018, with an estimated 6000 currently active members. The number of congregations over this same period increased from thirty-one to sixty-five. The recent growth trajectory suggests that the LDS Church is unlikely to gain significant traction in India. Among other obstacles, the Indian government only permits into the country a limited complement of foreign missionaries from a particular religious faith. From 2014 to 2018, LDS membership in India increased from 12,257 to 13,570, an increase of just 2.6 percent annually. If LDS growth were to continue at this rate into the future, by 2068 there would still be under 50,000 nominal Latter-day Saints in India, including fewer than 20,000 active members. Relative to the overall population of India (which stood at 1.33 billion in 2018), the number of Mormons, active or not, will be tiny. (In contrast, in 2017, the Seventh-day Adventist Church reported average church attendance of 791,398 in India. 65 ) Low LDS growth in major population centers of Asia does reflect a number of external obstacles, including government restrictions and lack of cultural receptivity in largely non-Christian nations. Nonetheless, the LDS Church has erected additional barriers to growth, including mandating that most church services be held in English, entering few new areas that would be open to proselytizing, and failing to translate church materials into major languages spoken by tens of millions (which would require recruitment of many native speakers to assist in such an enterprise). Few native missionaries have been recruited, and local member missionary programs remain weak. Such outcomes do not appear to comport with the Church's professed mandate for reaching every individual in their own language. 66 Contemporary LDS paradigms do not appear to allow for more than meager growth and auger no real prospect of achieving wide outreach or becoming a major faith in the Asian region.",

As but one example, Chen points out that, in Taiwan (as in much of the world), \"English becomes another, if not the, official language in Church buildings,\" and in the same vein observes an \"unwitting effort to import American/Utah youth culture as a gospel norm.\" 72 She further comments that Scholars of Mormonism \u2026 point out that international success has, in fact, led to central control from Church headquarters. The claim of being a universal church often deemphasizes the need to integrate the Church into local societies. This universalistic view tends to overemphasize the similar, compatible parts of local culture (e.g., family values in Confucianism) but shuns the incompatible parts of local tradition. 73 Instead of engaging in substantial adaptations and allowing broad local autonomy to find indigenous expressions of faith, LDS leadership has doubled down on the primacy of the American church. In consequence, LDS members \"in many places outside the American continent \u2026 face a double marginalization, a marginalization manifest both inside the Church and in their own country,\" 74 and international converts have consequently experienced low retention. 75 Currently, the LDS Church experiences a vast needs-resource-allocation mismatch that reflects the priority afforded to the American-based church and more generally to LDS missionary enterprises in the Western Hemisphere and Latin America.

They lack accountability and incentive for emphasizing quality converts and for building strong local congregations, since these outcomes are not their primary mission objectives.

Full-time missionaries incur higher expenses for travel, housing, and board than in-place members preaching locally. They also experience a learning curve with culture and often learning a foreign language, which lessens their effectiveness for a portion of the relatively short term of their mission calling. Severe limitations on missionary visas to populous nations like India, the constitutional prohibition of foreign religious proselytizing in China, 79 laws in Russia forbidding public proselytism and requiring the identification of missionaries as \"foreign agents,\" and other restrictions elsewhere, make reliance on foreign missionaries impractical for most unreached areas of the world.

Identity-based discrimination is anathema to many people born in the last half-century, who were raised amid secular mantras of tolerance, diversity, and inclusion. By contrast, today's senior LDS Church leaders grew up in an era of racial segregation, gender chauvinism, and widespread homophobic prejudice. The unhappily formulated Exclusion Policy was reversed in 2019, but only after four years of sustained protests, especially among younger LDS members. Riess and Knoll found that the policy had acted \"as one of several factors that, when added together, contributed to higher levels of disillusionment and disaffiliation,\" and that \"for some, particularly those who were already on the fence to begin with, this resulted in resignations and inactivity.\" 87",

Church leaders, especially the prophet-president, have wide-ranging authority and can speak on any matter. Their individual counsel in individual situations is considered virtually on par with scripture when they claim revelatory guidance by the Holy Ghost. However, when matters of momentous portent for the whole church are involved, it is only the president-typically in concert with his counselors (\"The First Presidency\") and sustained by unanimous support of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles-who can officially alter or replace existing teachings (or teaching-based policies). These attributions permit much potential flexibility in policy making, allowing new teachings to be introduced for new circumstances rather than relying exclusively on the interpretation and continued implementation of ancient scriptures. But this sort of change is typically slow-coming in practice, hindered as it is by devotion to traditions, bureaucratic caution, and the restraining, long-held assumptions of elderly leadership.",

Modern LDS Church authorities are administrators with little or no personal involvement in finding and teaching non-Mormons. This disconnect has been propagated downstream to lower-level functionaries. The LDS Church has had a good deal of dedicated and skilled pastoral leadership in its mission fields, but, although committed, there is decidedly less proficient leadership supervising mission outreach efforts at headquarters in Salt Lake City. Based on interviews, this author has found that core principles of mission outreach are a \"black box\" to many mission leaders, who continue to hold stylized views of outreach and conversion methods propagated in the absence of their own regular personal involvement in these activities. Almost all mission presidents I have known have formulated policies and issued directives without ever having gone door to door to make new contacts and without teaching a single missionary lesson to a prospective convert. This lack of leadership involvement in frontline implementation limits insights and impairs responsiveness to emergent outreach needs. Policies that, retrospectively, prove to be problematic, may be less likely to be implemented if mature leaders are regularly engaged in proselytism and thus in a position to develop broader insights and more effective approaches.",

For instance, not a word of condemnation was issued regarding a worsening crisis of violence setting new highs annually with over 25,000 murders in Mexico in 2017, 33,000 in 2018, 113 and 35,000 in 2019, 114 primarily at the hands of criminal cartels which engage in drug trafficking and human smuggling.

These changes have implications on a number of levels, but at least one practical result is allowing completion of mission service for young people prior to university study (and military service in some countries). 128 The 2004 publication of the Preach My Gospel manual represented a major missionary program reform. Elements of American culture and psychology from prior missionary manuals were removed, and the missionary role in convert retention was emphasized. However, many remedies in this manual represent half-measures, and substantial problems remain. 129 For instance, notwithstanding an ostensible emphasis on the preparation and retention of prospective converts, teaching time was shortened from six lessons to four lessons, each lasting thirty to forty-five minutes; abbreviated summaries were included that can be taught in as little as three to five minutes and counted as full lessons. The Preach My Gospel manual continues to instruct missionaries to ask listeners to commit to baptism at the end of the second lesson, unless missionaries specifically feel guided by the Holy Spirit not to do so (even though most investigators receiving this lesson likely have not attended church and have read only a few selected passages in the Book of Mormon). Prohibitions against alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee are raised only in the last lesson before baptism. Not one of the recommended nineteen baptismal interview questions asks whether the prospective convert is currently adhering to the LDS health code (\"The Word of Wisdom\"), attending church, reading scriptures, and keeping other commitments taught by the missionaries. Quick-baptize practices continued widely after the publication of the Preach My Gospel manual and continue in some mission areas today.",

The increasing accumulation of inactive members on official membership rolls exerts an inhibitory \"drag\" on church growth. Membership growth rates have experienced progressive decline for both converts and member children. At the same time, convert growth rates have fallen markedly as the number of baptisms per missionary has dropped. The fertility of LDS US women in the United States has continued to decline. Fewer member children become active adults, leading to proportionally fewer missionaries. All of these trends have continued in a declining mode since the 1980s. Stabilization of these trends, and even some recovery, would be necessary to provide confidence that the bottom has been reached.

However, across a range of indicators, societal factors impacting church growth are considerably less favorable today than in the late twentieth century. Christianity is in sharp decline in Europe 131,132 with the United States following behind, 133 and religious nominalism is prevalent across much of Latin America. Fewer young people are attending religious services, and perceptions of Christianity are less favorable than a generation ago. 134 These trends reflect changing societal norms as well as rising perceptions that associate traditional Christianity with hate, bigotry, and intolerance. 135 Human rights are also now waning in large areas of the world, which include increasing restrictions on expressions of religious freedom, 136, 137 freedom of speech, 138,139 and freedom of the press, as competing political groups seek to consolidate power and control over information, 140,141 trusted information sources break down, 142 polarization worsens, 143 and misinformation abounds. 144 Freedom of speech, press, religion, and conscience are basic human rights, recognized as self-evident and universal by the 1948 United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and enshrined in many (but certainly not all) national constitutions. Religious freedom includes the right to freely adopt or abandon faith without prohibition or coercion; to practice one's chosen faith (or none at all) while respecting the rights of others; to share one's beliefs; to critique and disagree both publicly and privately; and to receive equal treatment. Other human rights are essential to personal freedom as well as providing religious faiths the opportunity to rise or fall on their merits through fair and ethical proselytism. The status of these rights around the world is important to the LDS Church's future growth prospects. Freedom of press and freedom of speech have been integral to the spread of Mormonism. Unfortunately, press freedom in large portions of the world is waning. Reporters without Borders reported in 2019: \"The number of countries regarded as safe, where journalists can work in complete security, continues to decline, while authoritarian regimes continue to tighten their grip on the media.\" 145 Prospects for improvement are dim, as human rights violators, including states which have engaged in arbitrary 146 and extrajudicial executions, 147 have been largely accommodated quid pro quo by Western governments. 148, 149 Presently, only a few nations which allow proselytism (primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa) do not have an LDS Church presence. But prospects for missionary entry into restricted nations appear considerably dimmer than for the Church's entry into Eastern Europe after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Van Beek documented that the LDS Church's \"USA connection \u2026 in just a few decades has shifted from an asset to a liability\" 150 not only with regard to geopolitical rivals like China and Russia, or populous nations like India, but even for receptivity in European nations with positive relations.",

The Jehovah's Witness organization has found success through its intensive member missionary proselytism and has become a dominant protest movement to national faiths in a growing number of nations. Both of these religious movements, which were organized decades after the LDS Church, have substantially overtaken it in active membership. Future years will see this gap widen as LDS growth flattens while Adventists and Witnesses pull away. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints struggles to project a contemporary identity that transcends being just an \"American church,\" in the view of international critics, that will resonate more broadly among populations outside of North America and in a few other predominately island nations. Whether the LDS Church is able to successfully implement effective changes that could produce a more palatable international identity will greatly impact its trajectory over the remainder of the twenty-first century. The LDS Church has already taken some meaningful steps, and more are likely needed. Not all eventualities can be anticipated, and new challenges will require further adaptations. Even optimal changes instituted very late may be less impactful than approximate adjustments instituted early.",

While much can be done to enhance engagement and improve member skills and participation in personal evangelism, the status quo is difficult to change when most members have systematically \"tuned out\" earlier member-missionary exhortations, and leaders themselves rarely participate. The new ministering program provides an important step in this direction, although further development is needed. Asking members as part of the temple recommend interview if they are making regular efforts to share the gospel with others, to the extent of their health, opportunity, and ability, would reflect its importance as a core scriptural obligation and could stimulate engagement in a way that empty admonitions from the pulpit have not.",

The assignment of two apostles to Chile and to the Philippines in 2002-2004 was a crisis response, related to low convert retention and member activity levels, that produced significant improvement in these areas. But rather than stop-gap measures, there are many similar extant needs around the world which would be better addressed proactively and which require longterm local experience to accurately appraise and develop insights to resolve. Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, with the currently highest LDS growth rates, would benefit from long-term assignment of one or even two apostles. Substantial challenges remain across Latin America, which also warrant longterm assignments of senior church leaders. With over 1.3 billion people, India would surely warrant the long-term assignment of an apostle, which would undoubtedly help remedy the current neglect of outreach and unproductive mission policies. Indonesia, with over 264 million people (twice the population of the Philippines, where the LDS Church has 23 missions), would also benefit from the assignment of senior leaders to address the pattern of stagnation and the lack of any serious growth strategy. Even Europe, where the Church is experiencing contraction, would benefit from the insights of a senior leader, who could evaluate and implement new approaches to support existing members and to promote a sustainable future for the European church.",

Over this period, the number of congregations grew commensurately from 564 to 2145 (281 percent increase). Activity across the region was estimated at approximately 43 percent in 2013, with wide variation from a low of approximately 23 percent in Uganda to 75-80 percent in Rwanda, Gabon, and Burundi. 59 These higher rates reflect areas where congregations have been established relatively recently and are likely to diminish in time. LDS membership is skewed toward West Africa and South Africa. In 2018, the LDS Church reported 730 nominal members in Burundi, 748 in Rwanda, 1726 in Tanzania, 1933 in Ethiopia, and 16,823 in Uganda. The LDS Church has a larger presence in West Africa, reporting 83,651 members in Ghana and 177,280 in Nigeria. (By way of comparison, the Seventh-day Adventist Church reported an average weekly church attendance in 2017 of 133,362 in Burundi, 542,057 in Rwanda, 400,045 in Tanzania, and 154,200 in Ethiopia, 251,815 in Uganda, 171,767 in Ghana, and 205,929 in Nigeria. 60 )",
