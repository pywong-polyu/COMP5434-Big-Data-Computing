Usually, a primary health-care provider connects to a specialist at a distant place for specialty T elemedicine translates as \"healing from a distance.\" It has influenced the modern practice of medicine by serving as a crucial platform to deliver health care. Telemedicine has aided in cost-effectively overcoming economic and social barriers reducing the burden of travel and waiting time to consult physicians. This has proven to be pivotal in catering for older adults as they are vulnerable populations with multiple comorbidities. 1 They encounter more mental and physical disabilities and hence face major challenges in accessing healthcare facilities at the right time. Over the past decade, multiple observations on delivering and addressing mental health needs on tele-based consultation platforms for this group have shown Telemedicine in Geriatric Psychiatry: Relevance in India ABSTRACT Telemedicine has evolved as a novel tool in delivering health care in the modern world. With the advancement in video conferencing technology at an affordable price and innovative digital medical instruments, it has grown from guiding paramedics in managing patients to aiding physicians in providing direct consultation. Delivering care for older adults has always been challenging due to comorbidities that may warrant a multidisciplinary approach leading to frequent visits across specialties. As per the preliminary reports of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India, 55% of this population suffers from any chronic illness, of which 40% have some form of disability and 20% deal with mental health issues. Over the years, telepsychiatry care for older adults has received increasing acceptability. Videoconferencing with improved connectivity and transmission rates has aided in evaluating, assessing, and providing mental health interventions at ease. The recent regulation of telemedicine practice in the country by rolling out the Telemedicine Practice Guidelines 2020 and Telepsychiatry Operational Guidelines 2020 has fast-tracked its utility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns of physical examination, psychological satisfaction of consulting physician in consultation or advice. 3 Later, Electronic Health Records in 2013 added robustness to telehealth services. The recent Telemedicine Practice Guidelines 2020 define the use of images, documents, text messages, audio, and/or video calls as approved methods in delivering care through telemedicine. 4, 5 The luxury of having such a facility was not possible in the past, but reducing the cost on the Internet and video call apps is affordable to almost all health-care sectors. 5 As innovations develop in health care with advanced treatment, the expense on health care is on the rise. Most of these recent treatment options come with minimal side effects, lesser monitoring, and few review visits. But these newer interventions are almost and always available at higher tertiary care centers, which makes it difficult for many to benefit from. 3,5 Though Telemedicine may not be feasible for all such novel treatment protocols; it can surely prove to be a convenient tool for aftercare purposes, cutting down on follow-up visits altogether. 6, 7 It also facilitates health education and training health-care providers at their workplace, reducing their travel and boarding expenses. 8, 9 One such example is training of primary care doctors in their live, real-time general consultation by a specialist (e.g., psychiatrist); this is called \"on-consultation training.\" 10 With the advent of the Electronic Health Record system, telemedicine also has provision to store medical records securely for easy access to the patient and the care provider. 3 With the need for travel and waiting period to seek medical care been taken out of the equation, telemedicine ensures timely access to appropriate care with minimal cost.",

It has been projected that the older adult population would reach 340 million by 2050. 11 Care for the aged has always been challenging due to multiple and chronic coexisting conditions. They need multidisciplinary care at all times, which warrants visiting different specialty clinics over days either within or across hospitals/institutes. 3 With the need for frequent evaluation and monitoring, repeated visits may be warranted, but not all yield drastic changes in management except for a minimal change in drug dosing, ordering, and reviewing investigations. 12, 13 Many older adults are frail, and a significant proportion of them may live only with their spouses. With children staying away from their aged parents, making arrangements for health-care visits could be mentally taxing and distressing for the whole family 3 . Due to such factors, older adults visit emergency care more often than in routine outpatient departments (OPD). 14 Thus, home-based care was always a convenient and popular approach to cater to this group. Selfmonitoring at home is now possible by using equipment such as digital blood pressure monitors, glucometers, basic pulse oximeters, and weighing machines. Thus, combining home-based self-monitoring with telemedicine support medical consultations can be optimised 15 -this aids in preventing emergency visits and optimizing OPD visits.",

The Longitudinal Aging Study in India report finds 20% of this population to have mental health problems, 11 and only less than one-third of this affected group receives treatment. The most common reasons for this treatment gap are low awareness, stigma, financial constraints, low priority of health-care needs of elderly in the family, difficulty in transportation, and scarcity of resources, especially in rural areas. 16, 17 Mental health issues significantly impact the quality of life and are also associated with high morbidity and contribute to increased mortality. As in any case, the lack of specialists and trained personnel in geriatric mental health poses significant challenges in delivering quality care. Even with the wide implementation of the District Mental Health Program and other community programs held by non-profit organizations, the demand is huge, thereby contributing to challenges in closing down the treatment gap further. 18 Thus, embracing the innovations in technology via telemedicine would fast-track the process of meeting the current and future needs.",

With the pandemic bringing the whole world to a standstill, patients had to find alternate routes to reach their doctors for continued care. This could be even more challenging for the elderly for reasons discussed earlier. The factors (as described below) are considered to be vital for both the prescribing doctors' and the receiving patients' decision in utilizing telemedicine as an effective tool. 19 1. The extent of benefit/perceived usefulness: It implies the degree to which the services translate from a conventional in-person consultation to tele-based consultation meeting/ fulfilling the targeted needs. 2. Ease of use: It depends on the difficulty level in navigating through the software/application and utilizing the services effectively with minimal technical hiccups. 3. The cost incurred: Though currently there are more than a few apps available free of cost with affordable data charges, this factor could be pivotal in influencing the popularity of its use in the future. In addition, the time and energy in planning for visits and the cost of travelling are also less consuming. 4. Societal perception: Societal perception influences one's attitude in accepting and trying out naive platforms. While doctors' decisions could be influenced by their colleagues and seniors, patients would consider taking opinions from their fellow patients, family, and friends. 5. Security of data and privacy: Fear of confidentiality breach via cyber fraud is the primal concern regarding health-related information for either parties, which can lead to legal conflicts. 6.

Almost every patient (either hailing from rural or urban residence) accepted that teleconsultation is convenient as there is easy access to technology, convenience in consultation including review with the same doctor, affordability of free mobile apps, and data charges. 1, 23 In addition, studies have demonstrated greater expediency 23, 25 and positive perceptions among the practitioners and the patients regarding telemedicine services, especially in geriatric psychiatry. [26] [27] [28] Many have recommended models for implementing digital geriatric mental health services in long-term facilities and via remote old age memory clinics. 12, 29, 30 Older adults often face difficulty in mobility due to physical impairment/ disability, leading to challenges in access to health care. With the advent of such models of technology-based geriatric care, apprehension on the availability of ramps, dedicated queue for registration, and waiting time shall be completely avoided. Moreover, the hassle of bringing them to the hospital, whether in rural areas where access to specialty care is challenging or urban areas where patients have difficulty reaching hospitals amid congested traffic, is completely ruled out. 31",

[35] [36] [37] [38] [39] One of the studies conducted with 120 older adults has shown that modified telephonic interview of cognitive status (TICS-m) takes less time than mini-mental status examination (MMSE) and is appropriate for testing the cognitive status of older adults. 35 Limitations in conducting a complete physical examination are addressed by performing a partial physical examination based on inspection; a model called ViPE, that is, inspection-based virtual physical examination. 40 Along with diagnosis and assessments, interventions like group therapy, occupational therapy, cognitive-behavioral, and other therapies have also been proven effective over this platform. It can be used for family meetings where family members stay away from the patients, meetings that need multidisciplinary physicians across specialties, or within mental health teams. 9 Thus, overall, the reliability of psychiatric assessments through video-based telepsychiatry has proven to be good almost to replace in-person visits in most instances. 31",

While consulting alone with the capacity to consent: In this scenario, teleconsultation shall happen with an implied consent of the older adult. 2. While consulting with a family member/caregiver (see Figure 1 ): The older adult's capacity assessment for attaining consent must be done. If the capacity to consent and willingness for consultation are present, teleconsultation can proceed. Advice for in-person consultation if the capacity to consent is absent during all first consultations. If the capacity to consent is absent during online follow-up, check for advance directive availability (AD). If AD is not available, consent should be taken from the family member/nominated representative via video consultation and documented. However, if there is suspected coercion from family, advice for in-person consultation anytime. 22 Figure 1 summarizes the steps via a flowchart. 3. In case of a health-care worker consulting the psychiatrist along with the older adult (see Figure 2 ): In this case, the requesting health-care worker shall check for patient identity proof and attempt for assessing capacity to consent. If capacity and consent for consulting a psychiatrist online is present, then the health-care worker can initiate contact. If capacity is absent, then the health-care worker shall check for advance directive and follow accordingly. In case of AD not available, the consent can be taken from the nominated representative. The consulting psychiatrist shall then verify these prerequisites again during the teleconsultation. 22 Figure 2 summarizes the steps via a flowchart. In case of a Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP) seeking advice from psychiatrist over teleconsultation, (according to the Telemedicine Practice Guidelines 2020) the RMP shall be responsible for treatment and other recommendations given to the patient. 4",

The possibility of online schema-based therapy for dementia patients and caregivers demonstrates the benefit of nonpharmacological interventions via this mode. 20, 21, 45 Similarly, a randomized controlled trial for tele-based psychotherapy showed that older adults with depression showed significant improvement in their depressive symptoms. 46 Consulting Elderly with Family Member/Patient via Telemedicine (Adopted from Telepsychiatry Practice Guidelines 2020) A qualitative study with caregivers of persons with dementia reported that video and telephonic-based consultations are extremely helpful for caregivers in understanding and playing an active role in managing behavioral problems of their affected older adults. 48 Another study with 433 older adults with symptoms of anxiety and depression has shown that internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy effectively reduced the symptoms when delivered in either clinician-guided or self-guided format. 49 In developing countries, efforts are being undertaken to develop an online video-based group therapy module for caregivers for dementia to understand and manage behavioral and psychological symptoms. 13 Thus, Telemedicine has made it possible to provide comprehensive care with a multidisciplinary approach virtually by overcoming the physical and social barriers.",

The prevalence of mental health issues is likely to be higher in older adults with socioeconomic challenges. 11 There is a low literacy rate and lesser access to digital technology in rural areas compared to their urban counterparts due to the limited availability of specialists warranting patients to commute from far-off distances to seek adequate care. 11 On the other hand, the latter has better resources in bridging the needs of the former without the need for investing in setting up camp visits and balancing the unevenly distributed specialists across geographical differences. 50, 51 Several initiatives to promote telemedicine in rural areas of India have also been undertaken. Telemedicine mobile clinics using satellite links provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation and Digital Nerve Centre initiative by the Tata Community Services are some examples. 52 In a systematic review on the cost-effectiveness of telepsychiatry services, it was observed that in 60% of the reports, the service was economical. 53 Another study report telepsychiatry to be cost-effective in chronic conditions needing rehabilitation in older adults. [53] [54] [55] A cost-effectiveness study reports that telepsychiatry practice was 50 times more economical than visiting a distant tertiary care center and four times more economical than a community outreach service. 54 Improving network connectivity and digital access to the health and wellness centers in rural areas under the Ayushman Bharat initiative and enabling the availability of additional human resources to support the telemedicine facility in rural areas will promote equitable access.",

This could be due to poor understanding of recent regulations and lack of first-hand experience in practicing telepsychiatry. Investments in developing, maintaining, and upgrading infrastructure and technical support could be detrimental for low resource and standalone practitioners. 31, 57 The other shortcoming is restriction of prescribing antidementia medications during the first teleconsultation as per the Telepsychiatry Operational Guidelines 2020. 22 This can be tackled with initial consultation being a collaborative video consultation with an RMP onsite and then switching to direct teleconsultation with the patient during follow-ups. 15 However, with most cases needing regular monitoring of vital parameters and nursing care, even reviewing a severely physically ill person with or without sensory and or cognitive impairment via teleconsultation shall prove effective. 13, 31 Having said that, managing substance abuse Consulting Elderly via Telemedicine along with Healthcare Worker or Physician (Adopted from the Telepsychiatry Operational Guidelines 2020) could be challenging as older adults have been found to misuse benzodiazepines and opiate analgesics, which are used as replacement and substituting agents for management. 58 In addition, lacunae in performing a detailed physical examination, especially in this group, which are vulnerable to physical complications, will remain debatable. The attitude and satisfaction of older adults towards telepsychiatry in comparison with in-person consultation could be challenging to replace. 27 Such challenges in the Indian context require further studies to add evidence to existing data and develop feasible alternative solutions to demonstrate the maximum utility of the tool in low-resource settings.",
