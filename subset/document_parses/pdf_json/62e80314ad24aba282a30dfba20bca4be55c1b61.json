This disease was classified in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic due to its extremely rapid spread across the world. Though a large percentage of the COVID-19 infected people showed mild or no symptoms, others experienced and developed severe respiratory symptoms, even leading to death. The latest statistics showed that the number of infected people reached about 200 million, and the number of deaths exceeded 4 million. COVID-19 impacted almost all aspects of our lives in all sectors with novel and strictly imposed constraints. These include the education sector, various businesses, living habits, the use of technology, hygiene awareness, and the health sector.",

These include full/partial lock down, the implementation of very strict safety measures, travel and gathering restrictions, and more importantly, the early and fast detection of COVID-19 infected individuals. The last action in the list put a tremendous amount of pressure on the public health sector (mainly hospitals) to cope with a very large proportion of potentially infected individuals showing COVID-19 symptoms yet waiting for the analysis confirmation. Among the few existing COVID-19 detection techniques, the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the most reliable and adopted technique that consists of taking a nasal swab sample from patients, which is then analyzed and combined with other chemical products (namely, the fluorescent dye) to detect the existence of the COVID-19 virus [1] . Though the PCR-related detection mechanism showed a high level of accuracy with few false positive instances being reported, it had many drawbacks, such as the manual detection process which may take more than 24 h before results are reported, and the relatively high cost of such analysis for less fortunate individuals and governments in mainly the third world countries. This pushed the scientific community to support the current PCR detection technique with less costly, automated, and fast detection approaches [2] .",

A survey of the literature shows that DL-based models tackling this type of classification problem outnumbered ML-based models [4] . High classification performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-measure was reported in most of these studies. However, most of these classification models were trained and tested on relatively smaller datasets (attributed to the scarcity of COVID-19 patient data after more than one year since this pandemic started) featuring either two (COVID-19 infected vs. normal) or three classes (COVID-19 infected, pneumonia case, normal) [5] [6] [7] . This dataset size constraint makes the proposed models just a proof-of-concept of COVID-19 patient detection, and therefore these models require re-evaluation with larger datasets.",

            "text": "The exponential increase in the COVID-19 infected individuals worldwide put a tremendous amount of pressure on medical facilities to assist potentially infected patients by initially detecting infected individuals and then eventually accommodating them for potential care and treatment. Several COVID-19 analytical-based methods were considered in the detection and diagnosis of potentially infected individuals such as the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), serological testing, and point-of-care testing [8] . Even though these clinical tests have their own significance in identifying patients for COVID-19 infection, they are time-consuming and prone to errors. Hence, researchers in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) domains resorted to automated and accurate approaches for the classification of chest X-ray images [9] [10] [11] . In this domain of research, the Deep Learning (DL) approaches attracted lot of attention recently due to their inherent advantage of extracting features from the images automatically and avoiding tedious extraction of hand-crafted features for classification [12] [13] [14] . Several attempts were made to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the DL domain to develop classification models for classifying X-ray images of COVID-19 patients (e.g., AlexNet and nCOVnet) [15, 16] . Researchers improved the performance of CNN models with the techniques of pruning and handling the sparse (imbalanced) nature of X-ray images datasets [17, 18] . Even though both Deep Learning (DL) and non-DL-based models were considered in the detection of COVID-19 patients [19] [20] [21] , the DL-based models tackling this classification problem outnumbered ML-based models [4] .",

Though the authors used the data augmentation technique to deal with the relatively small dataset size (a total of 400 images where only 100 images correspond to COVID-19 affected individuals), a larger dataset needs to be considered to validate and improve the model accuracy. A similar deep learning-based detection study was conducted in [22] , but on non-CT scan images (for simplicity). The authors designed a new model which is based on a Residual attention network. The model was trained and tested on a dataset of size 239 images where 50% of the images belonged to COVID-19 patients. Though the performance in terms of accuracy was 100%, the small dataset size still remains a concern to draw comprehensive conclusions about a DL-based model.",

CNN is designed to adaptively and automatically acquire spatial hierarchies of features, from low-to high-level patterns. One important characteristics of CNN is that it does not require manual feature extraction. A typical architecture of CNN consists of multiple blocks with three kinds of layers: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Feature extraction is performed by the convolution layer, which has convolution and nonlinear activation operations. The input image is divided into small segments called tensors. A feature map is obtained by the element-wise product of kernel and tensor. Different number of feature maps can be obtained by using multiple kernels. A convolution operation allows weight sharing across the input image, which enables the extraction of different features with the same weights, and thus, reduces the total number of parameters as shown in Figure 1 . Output feature map (ofmap) is generated by multiplication of input feature map (ifmap) values (X) by weights (W) in the filter window and addition of the results generated from the multiplications. The convolution layers can be characterized by diverse parameters such as the number of kernels, kernel size, and padding. These parameters are set before the training process and kernel weights are learned during the training. The result of convolution is given to a nonlinear function such as a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit). A good activation function usually speeds up the learning process.",

Care must be taken so that the model does not overfit the training data, and hence, lose generalization and perform poorly with new data. The possibility of overfitting can be reduced by training on large datasets. Data augmentation and regularization are other ways to minimize the possibility of overfitting.

The image categories of Lung Opacity and Pneumonia are included as part of our study as they have striking similarity with those X-ray images where a person has COVID-19 infection [31] . Since lung opacity can happen due to various reasons including tuberculosis, cancer, COPD, etc., we included identification, classification, and diagnosis of these diseases under the umbrella of the Lung Opacity category. Now, since the quality of images were not adequate for the training purposes, image enhancement techniques were utilized. The enhancement process is done through several phases, including contrast manipulation, anisotropic diffusion filter, Fourier transform, shifting zero-frequency component, and finally, inverse Fourier transform. To further increase the number of images in the dataset, data augmentation techniques are applied. These include rotation, translation, and scaling, which together produce a sizable number of synthetically modified images.

This dataset was collected from different open access chest X-ray datasets with a challenge to develop a unified COVID-19 infected entities dataset. X-ray Images were categorized into 4 categories as follows: (1) COVID-19 positive instances, (2) Normal instances, (3) Lung Opacity instances, and (4) Viral Pneumonia instances. The lower part of Figure 2 shows sample images from the studied dataset for each of these 4 categories. The COVID-19 images were collected from padchest dataset, Germany medical school, SIRM, GitHub, Kaggle, and Tweeter; the Normal images were collected from RSNA and Kaggle; Lung Opacity images were collected from the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) CXR dataset; and the Viral Pneumonia images were collected from the Chest X-ray Images (pneumonia) dataset. The resolution of the various dataset varies in the range of 1112 \u00d7 624 to 2170 \u00d7 1953 pixels.

This technique, however, keeps the strong edges as they are by choosing a threshold value that defines the minimum intensity amplitude of the strong edges to be left unchanged, while simultaneously providing the required smoothing and enhancement. We chose 0.2 as the threshold value and 0.5 as the enhancement value during the image enhancement process. Smoothing the contrast of the modified images is done using anisotropic diffusion filter. Fourier transform is applied to shift the zero-frequency component to the center of the spectrum. Figure 4 shows the results of applying the enhancement technique to the original images of four different types: COVID-19, viral pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal patients.

However, the augmented image might be larger in size than the original image, and thus, the final image is cut to size so as to match the original image size. Using all these augmentation techniques, the dataset size is increased to a size suitable for DL algorithms. In our research, the enhanced dataset (shown in Figure 5 ) of COVID-19, Pneumonia, Lung Opacity, and Normal images is achieved with three different position augmentation operations: (a) X-ray images are rotated by \u221210 to 10 degrees; (b) X-ray images are translated by \u221210 to 10; (c) X-ray images are scaled by 110% to 120% of the original image height/width.

These architectures use small convolution filters to increase network depth. The inputs to these networks are fixed size 224 \u00d7 224 images with three color channels. The input is given to a series of convolutional layers with small receptive fields (3 \u00d7 3) and max pool layers as shown in Figure 6 . The first two sets of VGG use two conv3-64 and conv3-128, respectively, with a ReLU activation function. The last three sets use three conv3-256, conv3-512, and conv3-512, respectively, with a ReLU activation function. Each set of convolutional layers is followed by a max-pooling layer with stride 2 and window 2 \u00d7 2. The number of channels in the convolutional layers is varied between 64 to 512. The VGG19 architecture is the same except that it has 16 convolutional layers. The final layer is a fully connected layer with four outputs corresponding to four classes. AlexNet is an extension of LeNet, with a much deeper architecture. It has a total of eight layers, five convolution layers, and three fully connected layers. All layers are connected to a ReLU activation function. AlexNet uses data augmentation and drop-out techniques to avoid overfitting problems that could arise because of excessive parameters. DenseNet can be thought of as a extension of ResNet, where the output of a previous layer is added to a subsequent layer. DenseNet proposed concatenation of the outputs of previous layers with subsequent layers. Concatenation enhances the distinction in the input of succeeding layers thereby increasing efficiency. DenseNet considerably decreases the number of parameters in the learned model. For this research, the DenseNet-201 architecture is used. It has four dense blocks, each of which is followed by a transition layer, except the last block, which is followed by a classification layer. A dense block contains several sets of 1 \u00d7 1 and 3 \u00d7 3 convolutional layers. A transition block contains a 1 \u00d7 1 convolutional layer and 2 \u00d7 2 average pooling layer. The classification layer contains a 7 \u00d7 7 global average pool, followed by a fully connected network with four outputs. GoogleNet architecture is based on inception modules, which have convolution operations with different filter sizes working at the same level. This basically increases the width of the network as well. The architecture consists of 27 layers (22 layers with parameters) with 9 stacked inception modules. At the end of inception modules, a fully connected layer with the SoftMax loss function works as the classifier for the 4 classes.",

The performance evaluation of the proposed methodology is achieved using different evaluation measures including accuracy, precision, recall, F1measure, and confusion matrix. All these evaluation measures are derived based on the following four scenarios. The experiments are performed using randomly normalized dataset based on the minimum number of images in Viral Pneumonia class, as well as using the actual number of images for each class in the dataset. Similarly, the experiments are also performed using the freeze weights of different DL models as well as nonfreeze weights, where we proposed to keep the top 10 layers frozen and the rest of the weights unfreezed to train them again. Table 1 shows the results of using the various optimized deep learning algorithms; VGG19, VGG16, DenseNet, AlexNet, and GoogleNet with weights frozen and applied to the non-normalized data in the dataset. Results indicate that the best accuracy is achieved using DenseNet with an average value of 87.41% and 94.05%, 95.31%, and 94.67% for precision, recall, and F1-measure, respectively.

Here, the larger dataset increases the accuracy by approximately 0.3% for VGG16. The highest accuracy was again achieved by VGG16 with an average value of 94.23%, precision of 98.88%, recall of 99.34%, and F1-measure of 99.11%. The lowest accuracy is again reported using the GoogleNet, with an average value of 89.15%. Using the augmented normalized dataset along with nonfreeze weights, the experiments are repeated using the same DL algorithms and the results are shown in Table 4 . Again, the results indicate an increase in accuracy. Even though it is a minor increase of 0.03%, this leads to a better combination that would increase accuracy dramatically as compared with results shown in Table 1 . The increase in accuracy is extremely important when it involves the diagnosis of a serious medical condition such as COVID-19. The highest reported accuracy was again achieved using VGG16 with an average value of 94.26%, precision of 99%, recall of 99.18%, and F1-measure of 99.09%. The lowest accuracy is again reported using the GoogleNet with an average value of 90.38%. Returning to the original non-normalized data after applying the enhancement algorithm on it and using the non-freeze weights, the experimental results using the optimized DL models are shown in Table 5 . This scenario gives the best results as compared to that of the experiment shown in Table 1 . As can be seen, the enhancement of images increased accuracy dramatically compared with those reported in Table 1 , with the highest accuracy achieved by VGG19 with an average value of 94.92%, precision of 99.37%, recall of 99.28%, and F1-measure of 99.33%. The lowest accuracy is reported using the GoogleNet, with an average value of 89.2%. The experiments are repeated using the enhanced normalized data with nonfreeze weights using the optimized DL models and shown in Table 6 . The results are better as compared to the results obtained in Table 2 . Again, we observe an increase in accuracy, with the highest reported accuracy using the VGG16 with an average value of 94.98%, precision of 100%, recall of 97.63%, and F1-measure of 98.8%. The lowest accuracy is reported again for GoogleNet, with an average value of 84.76%. Enhancement of data improved the accuracy for both normalized and non-normalized data. Now combining the augmented enhanced normalized dataset along with nonfreeze weights, the contribution of this work becomes evident as the accuracy continues to increase with the highest average accuracy of 95.63% achieved using the VGG16 along with the precision of 99.18%, recall of 98.78%, and F1-Measure of 98.98%, as shown in Table 7 . The lowest accuracy achievement continues to be for the GoogleNet with an average value of 88.43%. These results show that with a sizable dataset, an acceptable higher level of accuracy is achieved using the optimized DL models. Using a sizable dataset, these are some of the highest accuracies reported when compared to those available in the extant literature. The confusion matrix-based comparison obtained for the various experiments performed above with the best performing VGG16 model is shown in Table 8 . The results obtained clearly show that the four classes are classified with low confusion and high accuracies. For example, using the sizable dataset proposed in this paper, which is the enhanced augmented normalized dataset with nonfreeze weights, COVID-19 was correctly classified with an accuracy of 98.13%, pneumonia with 95.47%, lung opacity with 99.72%, and normal patients with 89.63%. Figure 7 shows a comparison for the training and testing validation accuracies for the enhanced augmented normalized data for the different deep learning models. The results for the transfer learning-based VGG16 model indicate that the overfitting and underfitting problems were accounted for in this research, with no underfitting or overfitting problems reported.

Until an effective vaccine that prevents infection is developed or this disease is eradicated, humanity must keep developing technologies to combat this disease in various arenas [41] . As we are aware, early detection can result in quicker response actions, such as isolation or prevention of others from being infected. In this paper, we proposed, implemented, and evaluated an efficient automatic COVID-19 detection and diagnosis approach based on optimized deep learning (DL) techniques. The largest available dataset is used and augmentation techniques were applied to make the dataset even larger, and the proposed approach was able to differentiate among COVID-19, viral pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal cases. Thus, the COVID-19 infection, which produces flu-like symptoms, was detected and differentiated from other diseases with similar symptoms through chest X-ray scans. More specifically, we proposed, implemented, and tested an enhanced augmented normalized X-ray image dataset with the use of optimized DL models, namely, VGG19, VGG16, DenseNet, AlexNet, and GoogleNet. Our proposed approach produced results where the highest average classification accuracy of 95.63% was achieved, which exceeds the classification accuracy performance of various similar models proposed in the extant literature. As an extension to this research, we plan to devise a combinational approach of image processing with data analytics, where the data from X-ray images and the data from clinical tests will be consolidated together to ensure more efficient and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 (or similar) infections.
