COVID-19 infection symptoms include respiratory tract illness, acute viral pneumonia with respirational failure, and death [1] . There are various ways to diagnose COVID-19 infection, of which monitoring breathing rate (BR) is considered one of the most significant indications of COVID-19. Therefore, investigating the BR and its connection with COVID-19 symptoms is now a popular area of research [2] . BR is usually defined as the number of breaths an individual takes per minute when resting. A normal BR is 10 to 24 breaths per minute (bpm), while an abnormal BR for adults can be categorized as hyperventilation (bpm > 24), hypoventilation (bpm < 10), or apnea [3] . For non-COVID scenarios, BR may increase with fever, illness, and other medical conditions.",

The BR can be measured through manual counting; however, this method is unreliable and prone to error. Therefore, measuring BR usually involves the expertise of a health professional, so it is usually performed in the hospital. The best method for BR measurement in hospitals is spirometry, which calculates the airflow during inhalation and exhalation. Other methods include electrical impedance pneumography (EIP), capnography, and inductance pneumography (IP) [5] . However, these methods require hospitalization. Due to the clinical emergency caused by COVID-19, BR monitoring of the COVID patients increases the risk of virus spread by visiting hospitals. Most patients do not show breathing distress at first, and healthcare professionals must send these patients back home for self-monitoring. According to medical research, patients with minor clinical conditions may worsen in the second week of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, patients with normal breathing functions do not necessitate hospitalizations and must be monitored using telemedicine methods during self-isolation [6] . In contrast, for patients facing acute breathing distress, real-time BR monitoring is very much mandatory.",

Breathing abnormalities can have breathing patterns that are shallow, deep, or fast. These abnormal patterns include eupnea, bradypnea, tachypnea, Biot, Kussmaul, sighing, Cheyne-Stokes, and CSA. Eupnea is normal breathing with a uniform pattern and rate, while BR is faster in tachypnea than in eupnea. Deep breaths characterize biot respiration with regular periods of apnea, and Kussmaul is deep and fast breathing. Bradypnea is shallow and slow breathing with a uniform pattern, while sighing is normal breathing punctuated by sighs. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is defined by a gradual increase and decrease in BR, whereas CSA is breathing that repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. Details of the breathing patterns and their causes is given below in Figure 1 .",

Therefore, classifying breathing patterns using ML is worthwhile and of great significance. The dataset of breathing patterns required for building the ML model is obtained by assessing test subjects' breathing patterns. This approach for capturing different breathing patterns yields a limited set of data during pandemic situations, insufficient for developing a reliable ML model. Therefore, there is a need for simulated breathing patterns to overcome the scarcity of real-time breathing data from actual patients. This research collected real-time breathing patterns data through a non-contact approach using the software-defined radio (SDR) platform. Subsequently, a large dataset of simulated breathing patterns was generated using the curve fitting technique. The obtained results were validated by evaluating various ML algorithms based on accuracy, prediction speed, and training time. This approach can be utilized for COVID as well as non-COVID scenarios and has many innovative healthcare applications. and training time.

            "text": "Furthermore, RF-based technology for breath monitoring includes various technologies, including radar, Wi-Fi, and SDR. For RF-signal sensing, these technologies can exploit channel state information (CSI) or received signal strength (RSS). There are numerous techniques for radar-based breath monitoring, including the Doppler radar [11] and frequencymodulated continuous-wave (FMCW) [12] . These radar-based techniques require high-cost, specialized hardware working at high frequency. Furthermore, the Vital-Radio system [13] uses a FMCW radar to track breathing and heart rates with a wide bandwidth from 5.46 GHz to 7.25 GHz. For Wi-Fi-based breath monitoring, numerous approaches using RSS and CSI are mentioned in the literature. The authors of [14] explored the use of RSS measurements on the links between wireless devices to find the BR and location of a person in a home environment. Similarly, a complete architecture for finding breathing signals from noisy Wi-Fi signals was presented in [15] . A further study [16] provided a non-contact CSI-based breath monitoring system. Schmidt [17] applied the Hampel filter on the CSI series to eliminate outliers and high-frequency noises, and then, BR was measured by performing FFT on all the CSI streams targeting frequencies between 0.1 Hz and 0.6 Hz. Wang et al. [18] proposed a BR monitoring system using the CSI through a single pair of commercial Wi-Fi devices. Wi-Fi-based RF sensing has several advantages, such as cost-effectiveness and ready availability. However, it also has disadvantages, such as lack of scalability and flexibility, and under-reporting Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers [19] .",

After that, reference data symbols are inserted in each parallel frame. On the receiver side, the reference symbols will be used for channel estimation. Then in each frame, zeros are positioned at the edges and 1 zero at DC. Next, frequency domain signals are converted into time-domain signals by applying inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). Subsequently, a cyclic prefix (CP) is introduced in every frame by repeating the last one-fourth of the points at the start. On the receiver side, the CP will be used in the elimination of frequency and time offset.",

In this work, the dataset size was enhanced by introducing a large amount of simulated breathing data. Furthermore, random five-fold cross-validation was applied for classification purposes. ",

In contrast, the receiver block consists of a receiver PC and receiver USRP. Omnidirectional antennas are also used to capture the variation in the CSI due to breathing. The RF signal generated by the transmitter reaches the receiver through multipaths in the indoor lab environment. When an individual is present in the lab environment, an additional path is created due to the human body's diffraction or reflection of signals.

To assess the performance of each ML algorithm, a confusion matrix was used, with eight predicted and true classes. The diagonal entries of the matrix represent the cases where the actual class and predicted class are matched. The cell values other than the diagonal entries show where the ML algorithm performed poorly. The performance of the ML algorithms was evaluated based on prediction speed, accuracy, and training time. Prediction speed is measured as observations per second, accuracy is calculated as a percentage, and training time is measured in seconds. Initially, the real-time breathing patterns data were trained by four ML algorithms. The confusion matrix results are shown in Table 4 , and it can be seen that all algorithms classified these breathing patterns successfully. Then, data from ten thousand simulated breathing patterns were trained through the ML algorithm. Finally, the confusion matrix results are shown in Table 5 , and it can be seen that these algorithms can classify breathing patterns even more successfully.

It can be observed that accuracy is improved for all algorithms for simulated breathing data compared to real-time breathing data. For example, for cosine nearest neighbor classifiers (KNN), accuracy is increased from 97.5% to 99.3%, while for complex tree algorithms, accuracy is increased from 96.8% to 98.4%, and for ensemble boosted tree algorithms, the accuracy is increased from 85.6% to 94.7%. Furthermore, for linear support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, the accuracy is increased from 75.5% to 84.9%. The performance comparison of ML algorithms in terms of accuracy is also elaborated in Figure 8 . It can be observed that accuracy is improved for all algorithms when the breathing patterns dataset is increased through simulation. ",

            "text": "In this article, a solution is proposed for the problem of collecting a large dataset of abnormal breathing patterns during the pandemic. This approach improves the classification accuracy of the ML model. A non-contact SDR platform was used to collect real-time breathing patterns data based on variations in CSI. The real-time data was used to generate a large, simulated dataset through the curve fitting technique. This increases the dataset size, which will help in building a reliable ML model. Different ML algorithms were exploited for breathing patterns classification for real-time as well as simulated breathing data. It was verified that accuracy improves by introducing simulated data for training purposes. This research work can be used for COVID and non-COVID scenarios. The results indicate that the developed platform is accurate and robust for monitoring human breathing, and its accuracy can be further enhanced by introducing more simulated breathing data. The future applications of this research work are numerous, for example, it can be used as a pre-examination tool for patients to provide clues about the nature of the illness, it can be used in homes for individual monitoring during the day, and it can even be deployed in public places for infection monitoring in crowds. This work has a few limitations, including that experiments were performed on single subjects in an indoor lab environment, and actual patients were not chosen for data collection. So, future recommendations for this research work would remove all of the limitations stated in this research.",
