The website presents meeting reports and reading guides for over 70 novels. The aim of this work was to raise awareness of the bookclub and increase website engagement. In 2019, events designed to reach new audiences maintained an increase in page views from the end of 2018 (around 200 per month). In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic forced bookclub meetings online (Zoom). These, with podcasts and some Twitter discussion, increased page views with a peak of 400 per month. Membership increased, and global 'attendance' was facilitated. Feelings and observations related to each book and the pandemic were noted in meeting reports. A survey of current and previous bookclub members carried out early in lockdown with the aim of determining the future direction of the bookclub revealed the continuing value of both literary and scientific experiences to members. The bookclub has engaged scientists and non-scientists in meaningful discussion about infectious disease. Reach is modest, but the resource is significant, with potential impact in education and engagement.",

Similarly, storytelling (Dahlstrom 2014) and poetry (Illingworth 2020 ) are used to engage audiences with science: both the scientists and their audiences benefit from these activities. Work of this nature encourages scientists to meditate on their subject (Dubos 1952) and enhances communication beyond their discipline. The shared interactions also help allay fears of science popularization and over-simplification (Scharrer et al. 2016) .",

It originated from teaching practice whereby art (including literature) was used as a medium to help undergraduate microbiology students to communicate their science (Verran 2010a), echoing the premise that fostering effective communication is integral to supporting deeper forms of learning (Brookfield 2015) . The decision to launch the bookclub was taken with the support of the Manchester Beacon for Public Engagement (www.publicengagement.ac.uk/nccpe-projects-and-serv ices/completed-projects/beacons-public-engagement) and the Society for Applied Microbiology (www.sfam.org.uk). The first events comprised a screening of the movie Outbreak (dir: Petersen 1995) during National Science Week 2009, followed by a discussion about The Hot Zone by Richard Preston (1994) , held during the Society's Summer Conference. These two events were promoted via various email lists and websites. Around 60 people attended the screening, and eight came to the bookclub meeting, comprising a mix of microbiologists and non-microbiologists: the core of the subsequent reading group. Around half of this original group have remained members, with others attending for varying periods of time.",

Thus for all participants, the novel is the common denominator, providing a level platform with all members able to contribute to discussion, whether it be about the author, the plot or the disease. The focus has been on 'bad' bugs primarily due to the lack of fiction about 'good' ones. Pathogens provide a key plot device, and without aggression, there is little jeopardy. However, we did read appreciate the significant contribution made by microorganisms to the different ecological habitats in the spaceship en route to Aurora (by Kim Stanley Robinson [2015] ).",

At any meeting, the date for the next meeting is agreed, along with the selected book. Anyone can suggest the next book: if more than one book is suggested, a vote is held (on-site or online). Email invitations for meetings are sent to existing bookclub members, but an open invitation is made on the website. The meeting format has remained unchanged. Questions are prepared by the bookclub leader (the author of this paper, JV), and are used to guide the discussion. When books have been suggested by other bookclub members, they preferred this structure, rather than leading the discussion themselves. The questions explore both the literary and scientific aspects of the novel, particularly focusing on the pathogen of concern (Verran 2019a). These questions are refined and then posted on the website as the 'reading guide'. The location, context and content of each meeting is written as a prose narrative, and posted on the website as a 'meeting report'. On occasion, meetings are coupled with other public engagement events, such as for World AIDS Day (Verran and Setterington 2010) , Manchester Science Festival (Redfern et al. 2018) and National Science Week (Harper 2009 ) Joint meetings with other bookclubs have been hosted where appropriate (Verran et al. 2014 ). The bookclub format has also been used to encourage literacy and discussion amongst biology and biomedical science undergraduates (Verran 2013; Verran 2019a) , and for children's literature (Verran 2010b (Verran , 2015 : the format has of course been used successfully elsewhere in science education (Calman et al. 1988 , Aaronson 2008 .",

The most obvious route for reaching this academic audience would be peer-reviewed articles, articles in professional magazines, conferences or social media. However, little proactive effort was made to promote the site (since there was no wish to increase the size of bookclub meetings), and page views were relatively few (in 2017, only around 10-20 per month). In 2018, numbers had increased, particularly if there were a bookclub meeting, and, spectacularly following a podcast entitled 'the zombie condition in literature' (wwwnc.cdc.gov/eic/podcasts/volume-24) complementing an article published in the journal Emerging Infectious Disease (Verran and Aldana Reyes 2018) where page views increased from 50 to 100 per month to almost 400. The article and podcast considered the value of using the zombie as a model pathogen and as a vehicle for discussing infectious disease with lay audiences. The absence of subclinical infection, combined with 100% transmission and 100% 'mortality'as well as changing zombie behavior in more modern literature provided a rich resource for public engagement.",

All commemorative bookmarks were taken; one person took notes, another suggested the talk should be made into a book; questions included 'do you ever get authors factchecking?'; 'what is AMR?' A spinoff 'Junior' bookclub was established for Years 10 and 11 students at the local secondary school. Its first meeting (Nemesis by Philip Roth [2010] ) was held in November, with JV in attendance: student feedback was positive, for example 'you can meet other people and discuss the same book because everyone interprets the book differently and it's interesting to see what other people thought. And also because we're reading about science books I've learnt about polio which is pretty cool. A book club is a great idea because you can find new books, learn new things and other ideas'. The advertising that the Kirkwall library organized attracted an audience of around 30. The first half of the event comprised a summary of the bookclub aims and progress, and in the second part each of the five suggested books was considered. This prior reading experience provided a useful hook for discussion during the hour-long session. Representatives of a local bookclub brought suggestions for further reading, in particular recommending the remainder of the Louise Welsh trilogy because the third book (No Dominion [2017] ) was set on Orkney. There was no evidence of any subsequent related activity.",

The questions were both useful and enjoyable. The following Twitter Q&A then enabled a broader engagement with members of the public via social media, who were able to join in the discussion about AMR, disease and other topics that came up, in a way that was both entertaining and accessible: something I believe to be important, as people can struggle with scientific concepts that they find hard to grasp.

A wide variety of delivery methods and analytic tools were used to investigate reach and impact, but information acquired in this context tended to be quantitative. It is perhaps not surprising that the use of social media and online events increased the reach of the bookclub. The survey carried out to assess the value of the bookclub to its members generated more qualitative data, providing a subjective and emotional dimension to feedback from both scientists and non-scientists (as well as to authors). At meetings, participants have been able to discuss their experiences of social distancing, lockdown, isolation and community spirit in the context of the (non-coronavirus) novels being discussed, alongside more scientific and even political concerns around clinical trials, prejudice, population segmentation and the news. The contributions of members of different ages, and from different countries at different stages of the pandemic, enabled different perspectives of the pandemic to be considered, for example regarding lockdown and vaccine implementation. This unique and unwanted global situation meant that we were all learning together, as a diverse group that would otherwise not have met. It has been heartening and comforting to engage in these conversations.",

Some excellent non-fiction publications about emerging diseases have been updated (Honigsbaum 2020) ; experts in accessible narratives about the 1918 influenza pandemic are in great demand from the media (Spinney 2017); and some publications arrived just in time for a coronavirus slant to be included (for example Roberts 2020). Otherwise, new novels about influenza pandemics have provided a more familiar backdrop to fiction of interest to the Bad Bugs Bookclub (McKay 2020; Wright 2020). Reading about microorganisms other than viruses does however, provide a welcome break! To satisfy national and international interest, the Bad Bugs Bookclub will continue as an online presence, but the face-toface local meetings will also likely return in due course. Demand remains for the meetings amongst its members, and the amount of available relevant reading material is still significant. It is hoped that the higher profile and reach of the bookclub that have occurred as an indirect result of the coronavirus pandemic will attract a larger and broader audience, and encourage the formation of more bookclubs.",
