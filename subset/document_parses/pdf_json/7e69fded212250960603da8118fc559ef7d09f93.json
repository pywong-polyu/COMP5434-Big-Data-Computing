The comparisons were adjusted on the baseline characteristics that were unbalanced between groups or had clinical relevance (age at admission, sex, history of venous thrombo-embolic event, diabetes, chronic renal diseases, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, antiviral treatment, renal replacement therapy, coagulation parameters at admission as d-dimer level, AT, prothrombin time and factor V and UFH). For the comparison of strokes, we used Firth's bias reduction method to deal with the problem of separation in logistic regression [16, 17] . Results are presented as odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. Sensitivity analyses were performed using a propensity score. The score was created using a logistic regression model with the treatment variable as the independent variable and the set of adjustment variables from the multivariable model as the dependent variables. The treatment effect was then estimated by adjusting on the propensity score. A p-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

However, it is likely that this strategy will not be sufficient to completely prevent thrombotic events.

The thrombotic process probably begins in the early inflammatory course of COVID-19, even whilst patients are still ambulant at home or on medicine wards, and the risk of thrombotic event is increasing with the progression of the underlying disease [5] . Although Tang et al. [25] suggested that anticoagulant therapy mainly with low molecular weight heparin would be associated with better prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients fulfilling sepsis-induced coagulopathy criteria or with markedly elevated d-dimer, higher anticoagulation targets was not associated with better prognosis in our cohort. Indeed, neither ICU length of stay nor ICU mortality were decreased in therapeutic group compared to prophylactic group.",

Finally, the lack of routine screening for thrombotic events is also a limitation, and has probably led us to under-estimate thrombotic complications. Results from prospective randomized controlled trial will therefore be necessary to confirm our results.
