We address this gap by highlighting scenarios that lead to biased performance of algorithms developed for image reconstruction from undersampled MRI measurements; the latter is a real-world example of an inverse problem and a current frontier of DL research (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) .",

Sub-Nyquist sampling is commonly applied to shorten the traditionally lengthy MRI scan time, and image reconstruction algorithms are used to recover images from the undersampled data (14) (15) (16) (17) . Therefore, the development of such algorithms ideally should be done using raw k-space data. However, the development of DL methods requires thousands of examples, and databases containing raw k-space data are scarce. To date, only a few databases offer such data (for example, refs. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , whereas many more offer reconstructed and processed magnetic resonance (MR) images (for example, refs. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The latter offer images for postreconstruction tasks, such as segmentation and biomarker discovery. Nevertheless, due to their availability, they often are downloaded and used to synthesize \"raw\" k-space data using the forward Fourier transform; the synthesized data are then used for the development of reconstruction algorithms. We identified that this common approach could lead to undesirable consequences; the underlying cause is that the nonraw MR images are commonly processed using hidden pipelines. These pipelines, which are implemented by commercial scanner software or during database storage, include a full set or a subset of the following steps: image reconstruction, filtering, storage of magnitude data only (i.e., loss of the MRI complex values), lossy compression, and conversion to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) or Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initative (NIFTI) formats. These reduce the data entropy. We aim to highlight that when modern algorithms are trained and evaluated using such data, they benefit from the data processing and, hence, tend to exhibit overly optimistic results compared to performance on raw, unprocessed data.

The term inverse crime describes a scenario in which an algorithm is tested using simulated data, and the simulation resonates with the algorithm such that it leads to improved results (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . Specifically, the authors of ref. 34 described an inverse crime as a situation where the same discrete model is used for simulating kspace measurements and reconstructing an MR image from them. They showed that compared with reconstruction from raw or analytically computed measurements, this leads to reduced ringing artifacts. A second example is evaluation of MRI reconstruction algorithms on real-valued magnitude images. In this case, k-space exhibits conjugate symmetry; hence, it is sufficient to use only about half of it for full image recovery. This symmetry often is leveraged in partial Fourier methods such as Homodyne (15) and projection onto convex sets (36) , where additional steps are applied for recovery of the full complex data. However, neglecting the fact that the data are complex valued results in better conditioning due to the lower dimensionality of the inverse problem. This may lead to an obvious advantage when evaluating algorithms on such data as opposed to raw k-space data. However, to the best of our knowledge, inverse crimes have not been studied yet in the context of machine learning or public data usage.",

To demonstrate these scenarios, we took raw MRI data and \"spoiled\" them with carefully controlled processing steps. We then used the processed datasets for training and evaluation of algorithms from three well-established MRI reconstruction frameworks: compressed sensing (CS) with a wavelet transform (37), dictionary learning (DictL) (38) , and DL (39) .

First, we reveal scenarios in which algorithmic bias of inverse problem solvers may arise from off-label usage of open-access databases and analyze them through large-scale statistics. Second, we find that CS, DictL, and DL algorithms are all prone to this form of subtle bias. While recent studies identified stability issues of MRI reconstruction algorithms (5, 40) , here we identify a common vulnerability of canonical algorithms to data-related bias. Third, we demonstrate the potentially harmful impact of data crimes by showing that methods trained on processed data but applied to unprocessed data yield lower-quality image reconstruction in realworld scenarios. Fourth, our experiments reveal limited generalization ability of the studied algorithms. Finally, by introducing the concept of data crimes, we hope to raise community awareness of the growing problem of bias stemming from off-label usage of open-access data.",

We first consider a data-processing pipeline that is implemented inside many commercial MRI scanners for reconstructing the scanner output (i.e., the MR image). The k-space data are typically acquired using a multicoil array, and the pipeline includes the following steps ( Fig. 1A ): 1) image interpolation, implemented by zero padding the raw multicoil k-space data; 2) application of the inverse discrete Fourier transform; and 3) multicoil image combination via a square root sum of squares (RSS) step. Notice that although the acquired data are complex valued, the RSS step produces a magnitude image. The scanner output, therefore, is an interpolated real-valued nonnegative image; this is the type of image most prevalent in online MRI databases.",

Common subsampling masks typically are based on variable density (VD) sampling schemes, which sample the center of k-space more densely than its periphery. These VD schemes are used because they produce incoherent aliasing artifacts that can be removed by sparsity-promoting, optimization-based reconstruction algorithms (37) .

Then we measured the effective sampling rate, which we defined as the sampling rate in the nonpadded areas only (yellow boxes in Fig. 2A) , and plotted it against the zero-padding rate (Fig. 2B) . The results indicate that for VD subsampling (both weak VD and strong VD), the effective sampling rate is much higher than the global rate. In the case of 2\u00d7 zero padding, which is often applied by default in commercial scanners, the measured effective rates are 24% (R = 4.1) and 38% (R = 2.6) for weak and strong VD sampling, respectively. These are much larger than the global rate of 17% (R = 6). Nevertheless, because researchers often miss this subtle effect, only the global rate is reported.

In the experiments described in Results, we demonstrate that this gives rise to overly optimistic algorithm performance. Data Crime II: JPEG-Compressed Data. The second studied pipeline involves JPEG compression of the scanner image (Fig. 1B) . Such compression is commonly used to reduce storage footprint, and it is sometimes applied as part of the DICOM data-saving pipeline, which is highly prevalent for storage of A B C Fig. 1 . Data crimes: how retrospective subsampling of processed data leads to biased results. (A) A common data processing pipeline often implemented inside commercial MRI scanners includes k-space zero padding, application of the inverse Fourier transform, and coil combination via an RSS step. The output image, which is interpolated and nonnegative, is stored in a database. In data crime I, this image is later used for synthesizing new k-space data; this yields artificial data in previously zero-padded areas. (B) A common data storage pipeline includes JPEG compression. In data crime II, the compressed image is later used for retrospective experiments. (C) Standard research pipelines commonly involve retrospective subsampling of fully sampled k-space data. In the data crimes scenarios, the fully sampled data are based on processed data; hence, image reconstruction algorithms benefit from the early processing. Moreover, because the gold standard image is based on the same processed data as the reconstructed one, error metrics become blind to the processing and, therefore, also are prone to bias. medical images. To demonstrate the JPEG effect, here we neglect the zero-padding scenario, although the two effects are sometimes combined. In the scenario of data crime II, the JPEG-compressed image is stored in an online database and later downloaded and used to synthesize a new k-space, which is used for algorithm development (Fig. 1C) . However, because JPEG compression reduces the data entropy, using JPEG data in retrospective subsampling experiments leads to improved reconstruction fidelity. We aim to show that this leads to an artificial improvement of image reconstruction algorithms.",

Generally, the visual quality of all the images (gold standard and reconstructed) reduces when the JPEG compression level increases (left to right in Fig. 6 ); this is expected from compressed data. However, the NRMSE metric shows an unexpected effect: It improves with the compression (i.e., the reconstruction error reduces, although the image's visual quality degrades). The reason for this phenomenon is that in retrospective experiments, the reconstruction quality is measured with respect to a gold standard image that is based on the same underlying processed data. The error metrics, therefore, are blind to the data processing. Strikingly, the NRMSE could show a misleadingly large improvement even when the human eye cannot see any difference, as demonstrated in the left two columns of Fig. 6 . Although the reconstructions from noncompressed and QF = 75 data are visually similar, the NRMSE of the latter is 30% lower. This reflects the bias induced by data crime II. The JPEG compression effect was further observed in a statistical analysis of an experiment in which the algorithms were trained and tested on the four types of data (noncompressed, QF = 75, QF = 50, and QF = 20) (Fig. 7) . As illustrated, the error metrics exhibit a consistent improvement with the compression.

At present, there is growing interest in identifying sensitivities of Although the compression reduces the visual image quality, the NRMSE surprisingly reduces with increased compression, reflecting a seemingly better image quality. The reason is that in the retrospective experiments, both the gold standard and reconstructed images are based on processed data; hence, the error metric is blind to the processing and prone to bias. Strikingly, although the reconstructions from noncompressed and default-compressed data are visually similar, the NRMSE of the latter is lower by 30%. This demonstrates the implicit bias induced by training and evaluating algorithms on JPEG-compressed data.",

While reviewing papers, we noticed that such usage is becoming increasingly more common due to the growing availability of public databases that offer various types of MRI data.

These factors suggest that data crimes might be more common than intuitively expected. While our research highlights two sources of bias related to data use, many other sources may exist and affect algorithmic results in published literature. As mentioned above, neglecting the complex-valued nature of MRI data and evaluating reconstruction Fig. 7 . Statistical results demonstrating data crime II. The CS, DictL, and DL algorithms were applied to datasets with no compression and increasing JPEG compression levels. The graphs depict the mean and SD computed for the test set. Notice that all the curves show the same trend: The error metrics improve consistently with increased JPEG compression. This improvement is artificial and stems only from the data processing, which reduces the data entropy. The results, therefore, demonstrate the subtle bias caused by training inverse problem solvers on JPEG-compressed data. algorithms on magnitude-only data improves the inverse problem conditioning and leads to overly optimistic results. Bias also may arise when some physical and physiological effects, such as contrast changes along echo trains, motion, or spatial phase variations, are not modeled in simulated data. Additionally, bias could arise from the choice of method used for computing ground truth images. For example, in parallel MRI, different methods for coil combination could lead to different results (53, 54) . These issues are not limited to MRI. Bias also could arise from the usage of simulated or processed data in other applications that solve inverse problems, such as X-ray computed tomography (55), electrocardiography (56) , bioluminescence tomography (57), microwave tomography (58) , acoustic wave propagation inversion (59) , and light curve inversion (60) . These issues remain open for further research. We suggest several guidelines that could help reduce data crimes. First, we strongly recommend that data curators provide a consolidated and comprehensive description of all data-processing steps. Second, for studies in which raw MRI data are not available and usage of processed data is necessary, we suggest the following: 1) Examine k-space and search for evidence of zero padding (see, for example, Fig. 2C ). If such evidence is found, k-space can be cropped to remove these areas. 2) Report the data-processing steps in detail. By reporting them, studies based on processed data could be evaluated in the appropriate context. 3) Try to identify and estimate any bias that could stem from data processing by, for example, simulations (as in Figs. 5 and 7) . Moreover, it is important to try to estimate any performance gap that could arise between implementation to processed and unprocessed data (see, for example, Fig. 8 ). Such estimations would further provide a more appropriate context for evaluating published results.",

For example, by using data subject to data crimes, one could claim good reconstruction quality from 10\u00d7 acceleration, even if the effective acceleration without the crime was (for example) only 2\u00d7. The harm is that careful researchers may not be able to replicate such high accelerations on real data and, therefore, would find it more difficult to publish their work because it may not look competitive enough.

We ran the grid search over 10 images from a subset of the data that were reserved for hyperparameter tuning. We then computed the mean NRMSE over those 10 images, and the value of \u03bb that corresponded to the lowest mean NRMSE was chosen. Because in the experiments of data crime I the image size varied with the zero padding, we repeated this procedure for each image size separately. However, we empirically observed that the same \u03bb value was chosen for all image sizes.

The DictL algorithm reconstructs the image x by jointly learning an image domain patch dictionary D and a sparse code A. The dictionary, which is used for reconstruction of patches, is a sparsifying transform that is learned directly from the subsampled k-space data. In this method, the image is reconstructed by representing it as a sparse linear combination of dictionary atoms, x = DA. The DictL algorithm jointly solves for the image x, the dictionary D, and the sparse code A (38) . The algorithm adaptively learns the dictionary from the subsampled k-space while reconstructing the image; that is, it is trained without any other examples or access to the fully sampled k-space data. The learning is done over image patches.",

Due to the varying image size in the zero-padding experiments, we repeated the calibration process for each image size separately; this added another dimension. Furthermore, we repeated the search for a set of five images that were reserved for hyperparameter tuning (the number of images was dictated by the need for vast computations). Altogether, we trained the DictL algorithm five times for each combination of the six parameters; this resulted in the evaluation of 77,686 DictL instances. For each combination, we computed the mean NRMSE over the five images and chose the hyperparameter values that produced the lowest NRMSE.

The patch size was 0.25 of the image size in each dimension, and a single patch was extracted randomly from each image. We also computed the k-space of the patch and used it in the MoDL DC blocks.
