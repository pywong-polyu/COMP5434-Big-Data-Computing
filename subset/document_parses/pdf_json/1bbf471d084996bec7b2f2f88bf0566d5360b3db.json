            "text": "In China, according to \"The New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Plan (Eighth Edition),\" close contacts are defined as those who had contact, without effective protective measures (such as without wearing proper personal protection equipment), with suspected and confirmed cases within 2 days before the onset of symptoms or within 2 days before the sampling of asymptomatic infected persons (China State Council, 2021) . Tracing close contacts according to the scale of this definition was able to control the spread of COVID-19 caused by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (Lai et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, the criteria of contact tracing may need to be more inclusive (such as expanding contact tracing to a longer time frame) for the prevention of variants with higher transmissibility, such as the Delta variant. On May 21, 2021, a local case of the Delta variant was detected in Guangzhou, China. It then caused a local outbreak in the following days and weeks. This epidemic provides an opportunity to estimate transmission parameters, such as the incubation period and serial interval of the epidemic, as well as the transmission dynamics among the close contacts of index cases infected with the Delta variant. Other epidemical characteristics of the Delta variant can also be observed. Cycle threshold (Ct) value is an important indicator when studying the epidemical characteristics of COVID-19, as it may be associated with mortality (Huang et al., 2020) , disease severity (Liu et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) , and biochemical and hematological markers (Azzi et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) .

In this study, the median serial interval (3 days) was shorter than the incubation period (5 days), which indicates that presymptomatic transmission is likely to have occurred and may even be more frequent than symptomatic transmission (Nishiura et al., 2020) .

A potential reason may be that females have higher angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) levels (Bhatia et al., 2013) , because the ACE2 gene is located in the X chromosome.

We were also unable to estimate the transmission risk of household contacts by the timing of exposure because the exposure time for intra-family transmissions was difficult to pinpoint.
