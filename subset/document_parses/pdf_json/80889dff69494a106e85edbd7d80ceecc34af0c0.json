            "text": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far caused over 108.2 million confirmed cases and over 2.3 million deaths all over the world as of February 14, 2021. 1 Among inhospital patients with COVID-19, the mortality was approximately 28%, however, the percentage increased to over 60% among critically ill patients, and over 80% among those who require mechanical ventilation. 2 Treatment of these severe patients is becoming one of the major challenges. It has been hypothesized that a cytokine storm is the main cause of illness progression which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and organ failure. For this reason, corticosteroids and/or immunomodulatory drugs have been extensively used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the clinical efficacy of corticosteroids remains controversial. Moreover, corticosteroid therapy was reported to delay the clearance of SARS-CoV-2, and a high dose of corticosteroid was found to be associated with death in severe COVID-19. 3 Therefore, to identify patients most likely benefit from corticosteroid and give precise corticosteroid therapy is essential for the management of severe COVID-19 and saving lives.",

Patients were defined as severe cases when they met any of the following criteria: (1) respiratory distress, respiratory rate >30/min; (2) mean oxygen saturation \u226493% in the resting state; (3) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2 )/oxygen concentration (FiO 2 ) \u2264300 mmHg; (4) lung involvement on imaging >50% within 24-48 h. Patients who died within the first 48 h of admission were excluded because it was difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroids. Demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory findings, and chest computed tomography, and treatment details of each patient were collected and checked independently by two clinicians. The outcome was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis on factors affecting all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients and stratified by factors including age, hypertension, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), and lymphocyte count. Continuous variables were converted to categorical variables. Interaction effects were also examined between outcomes and selected variables. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and R package (version 3.4.4) (Fig. 1a) .",

The dosage and duration of corticosteroids used for the patients were chosen according to age, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and lab tests. There was no significant difference in age, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, symptoms, comorbidities between the two groups (Supplementary Table  S1 ). However, patients with corticosteroid treatment had significantly lower levels of platelet, lymphocyte, monocyte, albumin, hs-cTnI, and significantly higher neutrophil, transaminase, CRP, and D-dimer levels. In consistent with previous studies, older age, leukocytosis, cardiac injury, high levels of CRP and D-dimer, and lymphopenia were associated with the death of severe COVID-19 (Supplementary Table S2 ). Intriguingly, in the unadjusted model, mortality was higher in the corticosteroid group than in the usual care group, with deaths reported in 51 of 232 patients (22.0%) and in 32 of 259 patients (12.4%), respectively (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.23-3.24; P = 0.005), however, the use of corticosteroids was not associated with all-cause mortality in the adjusted model (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.45-1.72; P = 0.705) (Supplementary Table S2 ).",

Therefore, it is important to identify such a population of patients who would benefit from corticosteroids before initiation of the therapy. In our study, the improved outcomes associated with corticosteroid in patients with lymphocytopenia is intriguing and maybe clinically important. In severe COVID-19, lymphocytes were significantly reduced, and lymphopenia was considered a potential indicator for disease severity, therapeutic response, and disease outcome. It was speculated that high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 could induce lymphocyte deficiency. Improved outcomes with corticosteroids in this population may indicate benefit in this hyperinflammatory situation. Patients with higher lymphocyte counts were less likely to have CSS and may experience more harm than benefit when receiving corticosteroids. Furthermore, it has been suggested that early low-dose corticosteroid therapy (within 14 days from onset of symptoms, 40 mg) accelerates the recovery of CD8 + T cells in critical COVID-19 patients 4 while high dose (>200 mg hydrocortisone equivalent) and early initiation (\u22643 days from hospitalization) of corticosteroids were associated with a higher 28-day mortality rate and delayed viral RNA clearance. 3 Therefore, timely intervention and dosage are also of importance when using corticosteroids.",

However, our cohort did not find corticosteroid use was associated with lower mortality in terms of higher CRP. However, there are still several limitations in this study. Since it was a single-center study, the results may not be generalizable. As a retrospective analysis, it is subject to confounding factors and bias.
