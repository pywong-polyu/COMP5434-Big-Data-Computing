            "text": "Introduction Hypertension is the biggest contributor to the global burden of cardiovascular diseases and related death, but the rates of hypertension awareness, treatment, and control remain largely perfectible. Methods During the XVII World Hypertension Day (May 17th, 2021), a nationwide cross-sectional opportunistic study endorsed by the Italian Society of Hypertension was conducted on volunteer adults \u2265 18 years to raise awareness of high blood pressure (BP). A questionnaire on major demographic/clinical features (sex, age, employment, education, BP status awareness, hypertension family/personal history, antihypertensive medications use) and BP measurement habits (\u22651 BP measurement in the previous month/week) was administered. Due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, BP was measured with standard procedures in a subset of participants (24.4%). Results A total of 1354 participants (mean age 56.3 \u00b1 15.3 years; 57.3% women; mean BP: 131.2 \u00b1 17.5/81.6 \u00b1 10.5 mmHg; 42.3% self-declared hypertensive; 41.4% on antihypertensive medications) were enrolled; 73.6% declared being aware of their BP status. Among treated individuals with measured BP, 26.9% showed BP levels within the predefined therapeutic goals. Interestingly, BP status awareness rates were the highest among individuals with uncontrolled hypertension (85.1%) and the lowest among those with normal measured BP (54.4%). Conclusions This survey provides an updated insight into hypertension awareness and control in a setting of daily clinical practice, emphasizing the centricity of patients in the therapeutic alliance for a successful reduction of cardiovascular risk.",

Volunteers were recruited at local sites using convenience sampling. Specifically, individuals who entered the participating pharmacies or attended the hospital medical center affiliated with the Italian Society of Hypertension and who provided their formal consent to take part in the survey were enrolled. Herein, only data from the hypertension clinics at the 16 participating Italian hospitals are reported. Staff at participating sites received specific training on BP measurements and administered a questionnaire on major demographic and clinical features (sex, age, type of employment, education, BP status awareness, family and personal history of hypertension, whether on antihypertensive medications), as well as on participants BP measurement habits (at least one BP measurement in the previous month and week; whether BP was measured on the survey day).",

In fact, nearly 9 in 10 treated individuals who did not achieve the BP target recommended by guidelines were aware of their BP status, compared with only half of those with normal measured BP. Although similar findings were also observed in previous surveys performed with the same methodology [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , our analysis provides some new evidence regarding the actual rate of hypertension awareness and control in the real world practice. First of all, treated individuals with BP levels above the predefined therapeutic goals declared more frequently than others to have measured BP at least once in the previous month and week, suggesting that they had been sensitized to the importance of BP monitoring. In keeping with this, our survey was performed during the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, which heavily limited periodic BP assessment and clinical consultations in hypertension units or outpatients clinics, due to regulatory rules for home isolation or health restrictions. Paralleling these observations, BP status awareness increased with self-reported hypertension. Interestingly, the relatively high rate of BP status awareness among untreated participants with elevated BP did not translate into substantial changes in home BP measurement habits. In fact, the proportion of participants in this group reporting monthly and weekly BP measurements was half that of treated participants having BP levels above the predefined therapeutic goals. This finding might reflect an increased motivation of treated patients to monitor the effectiveness of therapy, possibly as a consequence of an effective, patient-centered communication strategy. In the lack of an active patient involvement in the therapeutic alliance, in fact, adherence to BP self-monitoring might decrease.",

Frail individuals, including elderly people and those with underlying medical problems such as high BP and CVD, are more susceptible to develop a more severe form of COVID-19. In keeping with this, recent evidence from 45418 adults with hypertension (mean age 67 years; 44.7% men) indicates that those with more advanced atherosclerosis and target organ damage were at increased risk of dying from COVID-19 than those without [20] . This observation strengthens the need for multimodal cardiovascular preventive strategies that disrupt and reverse the progression of cardiovascular remodeling and related disease, aiming at achieving a good control of major cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension as early as their diagnosis. In parallel, recent observational evidence on a cohort of 464,585 US individuals (53.5% women, mean age 45.7 years) assessed for their BP by trained personnel for three consecutive years before and after the pandemic sprout (2018-2020) reveals that larger BP increases were seen in the period from April to December 2020 than in 2019, a finding that was not explained by weight changes and that was more pronounced in women than in men [21] . In this context, before the implementation of telemedicine becomes effective [22] , home BP monitoring (HBPM) represents an invaluable resource that improves medication adherence and BP control [18] . By providing largely reproducible BP data as well as enabling the detection of white-coat and masked hypertension, the information gained through HBPM increases BP awareness and strengthens the doctor-patient alliance through the active involvement of the latter in the therapeutic process, with increased success rates [18, 23, 24] .",

            "text": "As reported for previous studies [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , also this study has some limitations. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, only about one quarter of participants underwent onsite BP measurement, and data was mostly self-reported. No information on antihypertensive medications type, dosage, and compliance with treatment, as well as on possible conditions affecting BP profile [25] [26] [27] [28] was available. Similarly, data on concomitant cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking habits) was not available. The observation of a slightly higher prevalence of self-reported hypertension in comparison with the national average [29] , as well as that of high rates of uncontrolled hypertension, might be the expression of a selection bias in a survey that was conducted on self-referred volunteers at hypertension clinics, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Nevertheless, this study provides an updated insight into BP awareness across the spectrum of BP and hypertension control, emphasizing the centricity of patients in the therapeutic alliance for a successful reduction of cardiovascular risk.",
