One hundred and sixty-three consecutive patients who underwent non-T-cell-depleted allo-HSCT and met the criterion of LOHC after allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. The median time from allo-HSCT to the occurrence of LOHC was 29 (range, 4-155) days. Pathogens identified in blood and/or urine samples from 143 patients were mostly viruses. All of the patients with LOHC received intravenous fluid hydration, alkalization, and forced diuresis, of which 2 patients achieved complete remission (CR) after these treatments. The remaining 161 patients received anti-infection therapies and 71 achieved CR after the therapies. Corticosteroids were additionally applied to 83 out of 90 patients who did not achieve CR after anti-infection therapies, and 88.0% (n = 73) of them showed a grade 3 to 4 LOHC at the beginning of corticosteroid therapy. Thirty-five patients showed an immediate response (CR or downgraded at least one grade) within 1 week after the beginning of the corticosteroid therapy. Sixty-four patients (77.1%) achieved CR after corticosteroid therapy, and the median period from the beginning of corticosteroid therapy to CR was 17 days. Thus, we observed that viruses were the most common pathogens in LOHC after allo-HSCT and that anti-infection therapies were critical. For patients not showing a satisfactory response to anti-infection therapies, additional corticosteroid therapy may help to achieve CR.",

Although LOHC tends to be selflimiting after 1 or 2 weeks, some patients, particularly the patients who received alternative donor allo-HSCT, can show refractory LOHC which can persist for several months [6] . Refractory LOHC may lead to poor quality of life, even mortality, after allo-HSCT. Given the assumption that alloimmune injury might also be involved in the pathogenesis of LOHC [7] , Huang et al. [8] used corticosteroids to treat patients with refractory LOHC, and all of them achieved complete remission (CR). However, the small sample size of the patients (n = 11) in this pilot study limited the ability to further identify the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of LOHC. Thus, in the present retrospective study, we aimed to further evaluate the treatments, particularly the use of corticosteroids, in patients with LOHC after allo-HSCT.",

[19] showed that CMV viremia is a risk factor for LOHC (RR = 2.20; 95% CI, 0.9-4.22; P = 0.08). Han et al. [26] showed that the cumulative incidence of LOHC at day 100 in patients with and without CMV viremia (prior to or at the onset of LOHC) was 56.3 and 16.7% (P = 0.018), respectively, and that CMV viremia (HR = 3.461; 95% CI, 1.005-11.922; P = 0.049) was an independent risk factor for the development of LOHC. Thus, decreasing the occurrence of CMV viremia is important to decrease the risk of LOHC after allo-HSCT. However, we observed that CMV was identified in urine in only 7 patients, and CMV loads were lower in urine than in plasma. Thus, the role of CMV in LOHC pathogenesis should be further elucidated.",

            "text": "Although infection may be the most important cause of LOHC in allo-HSCT recipients [30] , some patients showed unsatisfactory response to anti-infection treatments, particularly for those with severe LOHC. In the present study, only 12.5% of patients with grade 3 to 4 LOHC could achieve CR after anti-infection therapies alone. Thus, other pathogeneses, such as immune injury, may also contribute to the occurrence of LOHC after allo-HSCT. Ost et al. [31] suggested that post-engraftment LOHC represent uroepithelial GVHD. Several studies also reported the association between acute GVHD and LOHC after allo-HSCT [19, 28] . In the present study, we observed that more than 60% of the patients showed acute GVHD. Thus, the association of LOHC with GVHD regarding timing, incidence, and severity suggests that its pathogenesis may involve a local inflammatory environment, cellular immune responses, effector mechanisms, and HLA as well as non-HLA genetics [5] . In addition, several infectious agents can trigger autoimmunity via different mechanisms [32] , and several studies have observed that infections, particularly viral infections, can trigger a graft-versus-host reaction [33] [34] [35] . In the model of Leung et al. [7] for LOHC, infected uroepithelial cells are attacked by donor lymphoid cells, leading to tissue destruction. Thus, the role of additional corticosteroid therapy after anti-infection and supportive therapies is worth considering in the treatment of patients with LOHC, particularly those showing unsatisfactory responses to anti-infection therapies. Huang et al. [8] reported that 11 patients with refractory LOHC received a low dose of corticosteroids, and all of them achieved CR. In the present study, although 88.0% of the patients who showed an unsatisfactory response to supportive and anti-infection therapies and received additional corticosteroid therapies had severe LOHC, more than half of them showed an immediate response to corticosteroid and 77.1% finally achieved CR. Thus, the additional corticosteroid therapies may be able to significantly shorten and change the course of LOHC and it may be a potential therapy for LOHC patients showing unsatisfactory response to antiinfection therapies.",

Second, we might have underestimated the occurrence of virus-associated LOHC in this study, because the number of viruses that could be tested was relatively small. Third, the several, varied treatments for LOHC introduced heterogeneity into our study results and reduced the reliability of our conclusion about the advantage of corticosteroid therapy for clinical outcomes in patients with LOHC.
