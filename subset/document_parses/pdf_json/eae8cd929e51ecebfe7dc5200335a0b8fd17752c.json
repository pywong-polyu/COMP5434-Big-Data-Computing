In this work we describe the application of computational fluid dynamics in assessing the performance of a prototype extraction hood as a means to contain a high speed aerosol jet. Whilst the particular prototype device is intended to be used during tracheotomies, which are increasingly common in the wake of COVID-19, the underlying physics can be adapted to design similar machines for other AGPs. Computational modelling aspect of this study was largely carried out by Barcelona Supercomputing Center using the high performance computational mechanics code Alya. Based on the high fidelity LES coupled with Lagrangian frameworks the results demonstrate high containment efficiency of generated particles is feasible with achievable air extraction rates.",

            "text": "Healthcare workers are facing severe challenges to protect themselves effectively from COVID-19. Global scarcity of protective equipment, together with limited initial understanding of the virus and lack of testing capacity translated to many professionals being infected (bbc, 2020) . In the first months of 2020, healthcare workers represented 20% of all cases in Spain, 10% in Italy and 4% in China and US (elp, 2020) . A few months ago, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) estimated that healthcare worker COVID-19 fatalities worldwide could be more than 20,000 (icn, 2020). A number of surgical and medical procedures have been classified as Aerosol Generating Procedures (AGPs) and there is naturally great interest both in quantifying the aerosol generated in such procedures and in designing engineering controls to better protect healthcare workers. One such procedure is tracheotomy. Briefly, a tracheotomy is the creation of an opening (stoma) in the trachea to the exterior, facilitating ventilation. Strictly tracheostomy refers to the created opening and tracheotomy to the procedure, but the terms are often interchanged. Tracheotomies are performed on approximately 10% of all COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions in the UK. Hence, according to this data, tracheotomies are executed in around 1% of the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 (National Tracheostomy Safety Project, 2020) .",

            "text": "Airborne diseases are those that are spread through the air by small particles. These include tuberculosis, influenza and coronavirus. Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria, while influenza and coronavirus are viruses; however, they share similar mechanics of propagation. Pathogens are spread from infected individuals though bioaerosols, generated in increasing quantities by breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. Aerosols of the order of 1 \u03bcm can remain suspended for hours and, in the absence of data, are assumed to remain infectious for equally long periods. When coughing, some of the surfactant and infected epithelial cells might be pulled from the lungs and into the environment (Mason, 2020) . These might also mix with the mucus in the trachea and saliva in the mouth, making them infectious as well. In a study of SARS and H1N1 influenza (Robinson, Stilianakis, & Drossinos, 2012) , state that ''small droplets (\u2248 0.4 \u03bcm) generate a negligible infectious force due to the small viral load and the associated duration they require to transmit infection. In contrast, larger droplets (\u2248 4 \u03bcm) can lead to an infectious wave propagating through a fully susceptible population or a secondary infection outbreak for a localised susceptible population'' (Robinson et al., 2012) . As yet we cannot quantify the relative importance of parameters such as aerosol size, concentration and exposure time in terms of risk of infection, all of which depend on the strain of virus and the particular context. The context of interest here is with minimising short time exposure of health care staff to airborne particles in tracheotomy and similar procedures. A few measurements of particle generation during tracheal procedures are now available, including Brown et al. (2021) and Dhillon et al. (2020) on aerosol generation during tracheal intubation/extubation procedures. These were each small studies on non-Covid-19 patients. Both reported elevated aerosol generation during intubation and extubation. Brown et al. reported lower aerosol generation in extubation than in a volitional cough, though caution that their study did not include patients with respiratory comorbidities. Depending on the level of sedation, coughing can also be associated with extubation. Aerosol generation was also found to occur during various phases of a percutaneous tracheotomy procedure in a single uncomplicated case, Ramesh, Collin, Gregson, and Brown (2020) , in which lower aerosol production was recorded than in a cough. However in a case report of a surgical tracheotomy on a SARS-Cov2-positive patient, McGain et al. (2020) , inadvertent bronchial intubation led to a very large increase in particle release, which the authors suspected as due to an increased airway pressure surpassing the endotracheal tube cuff pressure. Moreover as described in O'Mahony and Martin (2020), procedures such as moving from endotracheal tube to tracheostomy has potential for aerosol generation, while change or removal of tracheostomy involves suctioning, triggering forceful coughing. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the design requirements used in this study, Section 3 describes the test case, Section 4 presents the construction and tests performed for the prototype, then Section 5 exposes the computational model used following by the results (Sections 6 and 7) while the conclusion is presented in Section 8.",

The device should be proven to work under the worst-case scenarios, should be simple to manufacture and reasonably economical. There have already been a number of AGP protective devices, which aim to limit the spread of aerosols and droplets from a patient undergoing procedures such as extubation. Broadly these can be classified as methods relying on a physical barrier (e.g. as simple as plastic sheeting Matava, Yu and Denning (2020) or rigid boxes), methods using enclosures combined with a degree of suction, (e.g. as described by Perella, Tabarra, Hataysal, Pournasr, and Renfrew (2021) and Phu et al. (2020) ), and methods which may include some shield or barrier, but which primarily rely on capture of aerosol by suction. An example of the latter is described in the model study reported by , in which the capture performance is studied for a conical nozzle placed 25-35 cm above the mouth of a mannikin.",

In the case of COVID-19, this is difficult because the range goes from the elderly (low body mass index (BMI), short) to adult overweight male patients (high BMI, tall). This means the device needs to adapt to the patient and have a certain degree of flexibility or it needs to be designed for one extreme case scenario and proved to work for the other. In terms of the patient position, tracheotomies are carried out with the patient lying supine (face up) on an operating table, with very limited movement (highly sedated). The table's height can be adjusted to the surgeon's preference. The machine should not interfere with the surgeons and should be optically clear to allow good visibility. Hence an open hood structure of transparent material was selected in contrast to a closed portable hood as described in Perella et al. (2021) or Phu et al. (2020) .",

Low power suction pumps are generally cheaper and more readily available since they can be sourced from commercial vacuum cleaners. Furthermore, lower suction vacuum pumps are normally quieter and possibly easier to filter, as they require smaller filters.

It was decided to perform high resolution computations considering only one unsteady jet flow rate with a simplified on/off temporal profile. Given a suitably energetic jet, this should meet the twin objectives of both investigating the performance of the device and providing accurate data to check lower resolution simulations of this and future devices.

After some further testing, it became clear that the problem with the simulation was that both the applied suction and the flow jet from the cannula commenced at the same time. If the jet is started too early, it escapes the hood before the suction flow has become fully established. Since the Mk 1 hood is large and has a long extraction pipe, the velocity field would take a time to settle (estimated as long as the volume below the hood divided by the suction rate, i.e. of order 2-3 s).

In fact, on the left and right side of the neck, the air is free to flow towards the jet and to be entrained without obstacle, which is not the case for air above and beyond the neck, because of the presences of the head and chest. Thus, this creates an imbalanced configuration of ambient air flowing into the jet. Other reasons are the initial condition exposed previously and the effects of the suction, expected to reduce the angle of the jet. All of these facts made comparison with the jet literature and the jet analytical solution impossible.",

In this study a simplified model of uniform particle distribution is used. Based on Anand and Mayya (2020) 30 and 100 \u03bcm to cover the likely range of emitted particle sizes, from those that move with the flow to those where the ballistic component is of growing magnitude. They are initially released at the beginning of the jet period and reinjected every 1 ms until the end of the jet (2 s). 50 000 particles for each type are released in the domain to ensure constant deposition value independent of the number of injected particles. No change in deposition proportions was found for particle numbers exceeding 17 000, even for the smallest and most sensitive type. The initial velocities of the particles are assumed to be the same as the inflow velocity at the entrance of the cannula. The total time of the simulation is 5 s to observe the total suction of the aerosols from the hood extractor, see Fig. 7 (which is a screenshot of the animation available in the supplementary material). It is observed from the animation that almost all the particles are deposited or out of the extractor after 5 s. A deeper analysis is now carried out to accurately quantify the fate of the bioaerosols. All the aspects of the particle transport equations and deposition modelling are exposed in the Appendix section.",

Table 2 and Fig. 8 show the fate of the particles released during the incision for the tracheotomy. Following individual particles provide information of trajectory, for example; if they cross the virtual boundary located from the edge of the shield extractor, up to the patient, we can evaluate the efficiency of the extractor. Fig. 9 shows some trajectories for each type of particle diameter. As expected the largest particles (100 \u03bcm, blue colour) with higher inertia are almost all deposited in the shield with 99.6% of deposition due to the deviation of the particle paths, see Fig. 8 . The medium-sized particles (10 and 30 \u03bcm, white and red colours, respectively) are mainly sucked out of the computational domain through the extractor; due to the smaller inertia, the particles mostly followed the streamlines of the flow and a very low percentage of the particles remain still floating in the room. The most important mechanism of deposition for the 10, 30, and 100 \u03bcm are the inertial impaction. Now concerning the deposition for the smallest particle size (1 \u03bcm, black colour) this is less straightforward since it is a mix of deposition mechanism: the inertial impaction and the turbulence dispersion occurring during the jet. The latter produces a shear layer on the boundary of the jet core which favours the dispersion of the smallest particles due to the turbulence. Table 2 Results of particle deposition represented in percentage, with \u210e deposited particle on the shield and the body. Extracted: particles going out of the computational domain through the extractor. Crossing: particles crossing the virtual curtain located to the extended shield. Still floating: particles still in the computational domain after 5 s of simulation. It is well known that the vortical structures called the rings of the jet will create clusters of particles which in this case are the smallest. These structures enhance the dispersion of the smallest particles in the near vicinity of the jet as only 0.014% of 1 \u03bcm particles cross the virtual curtain of the extended shield extractor and 9.2% are still floating in the room. Those trajectories are not shown in Fig. 9 . This study proves that the extractor is an effective way in avoiding extensive contamination in the operating theatre.",

The specific interest was to explore numerically the dynamic aspect of a narrow, high speed transient jet flow issuing from a tracheotomy site and to be able to track the bioaerosols released into the operating room. There are limitations in the scope of the study performed and the modelling used, for example the neglect of aerosol particle shrinkage due to evaporation, and the focus on a single condition. These are areas for further work. However thanks to a novel machine designed in a collaboration between Mercedes AMG F1 Team and Imperial College London and the computational effort from Barcelona Supercomputing center the simulations demonstrate the efficiency of shield-augmented suction as an aerosol extraction device for use in surgical tracheotomy. This type of device offers advantages in reducing significantly the contamination of protective clothing and the surrounding theatre equipment and space, whilst allowing good access and freedom of movement for the surgical team; it may also be of relevance to other surgical operations.",

(2007) who provide an extended study which can be summarised as the ''wall roughness region enhanced particle capturing effect'' or other study (Ghahramani, Abouali, Emdad, & Ahmadi, 2017 ) who compared deposition of different level of surface roughness replicas (see Fig. 11 Model A,B,C) from Kelly, Asgharian, Kimbell, and Wong (2004) with LES simulations.",
