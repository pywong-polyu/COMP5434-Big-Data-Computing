            "text": "The public's participation rate in performing arts in Hong Kong has historically been low, and the Arts Participation and Consumption Survey in 2018 indicated that the primary reason was 'a lack of interest' and that education in the arts could increase public involvement. The survey data clearly indicate the significance of education as a driver to develop future audiences. There are nine major performing arts organisations funded by the Hong Kong government, and they share the responsibility of shaping the performing arts landscape. This study explored the role of outreach and education within these major performing arts organisations and how they impact audience development. In addition to document analysis and fieldwork, the researcher interviewed five cultural leaders from the nine performing arts organisations. The findings of this study indicate that while the organisations' outreach and education engagement help to achieve various important educational goals, direct impact on ticket sales is not easily quantifiable and may occur in the long run. This study concludes by offering a proposed conceptual framework for outreach and education when they are positioned in non-profit performing arts organisations. The four layers in the proposed conceptual framework involve cognitive, affective, ethical, and behavioural dimensions. It contributes to reframing the conceptualisation of audience development for the performing arts and sheds new light on the future of outreach and education in arts organisations and policymaking in arts and culture, with far-reaching implications for other non-profit cultural organisations in Hong Kong and globally.",

            "text": "Hong Kong is a metropolitan city of over seven million people where Western and Chinese cultures meet; the HKSAR government has devoted substantial resources to the development of arts and culture. As shown in Fig. 1 , in 2020/21, it allocated over $700 million to arts and culture, excluding capital works (Home Affairs Bureau 2020). These resources primarily covered the provision of performance venues, funding support for arts groups, arts education, advocacy, and relevant administrative costs. Of the $700 million, more than $52 million (8%) was designated for the MPAOs and $23.5 million (3%) was given to the Arts Development Council to support small to medium-sized performing and visual arts organisations. In addition to ticketed performances, arts education, audience-building activities, and audience outreach and education are among the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the MPAOs (Home Office Bureau 2019). Tremendous effort and resources have been allocated to both outreach and education in many MPAOs. Through documentary analysis (e.g. annual reports of the MPAOs and other government documents), website research, and the researcher's fieldwork, the OEPs of the MPAOs can be categorised into three types: (1) in-house training, which encompasses masterclasses, workshops, class series, and rehearsals; (2) schoolbased training, including in-school concerts, interactive performances, school tours, teacher training, workshops, and exhibitions; and (3) community outreach, including outdoor concerts, lunchtime concert series, dance parties, caring community visits, and competitions. Table 1 summarises the categories and major types of OEPs offered by the MPAOs.",

According to Kawashima (2000, 8) , cultural inclusion 'targets the group of people who for apparently social reasons are the least likely to attend the arts'. This notion is largely substantiated by the prevalence of high-income earners, the middle-aged, and well-educated people who attend the theatre (Scollen 2008; Throsby and Withers 1979; Gourdon 1992; Bennett et al. 1999; Woolcott Research 2000) . Kawashima (2000) explains that extended marketing focuses on people who have high attendance potential but are not yet theatregoers. Swollen (2008) indicates that this group are likely to be highly educated with high incomes (see also Bennett et al. 1999; McCarthy et al. 2001) . Kawashima (2000, 9) defined taste cultivation as a strategy that 'seeks to introduce different art genres and forms to attenders of specific art forms to nurture theatre-goers' tastes and broaden their experiences in the arts'. Kawashima (2000, 9) describes audience education as an approach that 'tries to enhance [new or potential audiences'] understanding and enjoyment of the arts which existing attenders currently consume, enhancing the audience's artistic literacy to facilitate enjoyment'.",

For example, the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis was purposively built in an undeveloped area of the city in conjunction with high-end condos and parking garages, surrounded by built-up urban areas with the intention to shorten the distance between the audience and its ability to access the theatre (Markusen and Brown 2014) . This location was also thought to offer increased engagement opportunities with the performing arts and thereby create audience appeal for the performances. 'Test Drive the Arts', a 1-year audience development programme in Australia, provided participants with two complimentary tickets to attend a live performance (Scollen 2009 ). Participants were also invited to attend a second performance at a discounted rate and a third performance with other incentives such as a complimentary drink. Another well-known audience development programme in Australia, 'Talking Theatre', provided participants with complimentary tickets to three live performances. Participants were then invited to attend future performances with occasional incentives. Both 'Test Drive the Arts' and 'Talking Theatre' gained positive results-an average of 30% of participants purchased tickets as a result of the programmes.",

Further, according to Kawashima (2000) , extended marketing is also a vital type of audience development, and it refers to efforts made to entice people who have high attendance potential, but who are not yet customers (i.e. well-educated and high-income earners). Ms. Meggy Cheng, Director of Marketing of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, has identified that people who take early retirement are highly likely to be concertgoers and orchestra customers:",

For example, the City Contemporary Dance Company's mission statement says, 'As an agency for dance education, the CCDC organises the most comprehensive education and outreach programmes, with an emphasis on long-term projects in Hong Kong and in mainland China'.

Despite the equal distribution of music, dance, and drama within the nine MPAOs, there has been little collaboration, and the opportunities for extending audiences' interest in the performing arts may have been hindered. In fact, the combined artistic merits and audience bases of these performing arts organisations have great potential to contribute to taste cultivation by broadening audiences' scopes of interest in performing arts. Fisher and Preece's (2002) study revealed that performing arts events are complements rather than substitutes; the more often an audience member attends performances of a specific art form, the more likely they are to commit to another. This helps dispel the notion of competition among performing arts organisations and thus encourages them to collaborate more closely to optimise audience building and to address their diverse needs and interests. For example, cross-over programming (i.e. a combination of different art forms in a single performance or throughout the season) is a potential way to satisfy an audience's diverse needs and broaden its base. Furthermore, as suggested by Ms. Meggy Cheng, the 'cultural passport' concept could be integrated into the Hong Kong performing arts context; with a single purchase, the passport allows and encourages a person to sample a variety of art forms. Such initiatives may be a way to nurture and broaden a person's artistic taste, knowledge, and interests.",

To date, despite the growing importance of arts education components in performing arts organisations, there is no conceptual framework for this aspect of performing arts organisations. The framework could have significant implications for the future sustainable development of outreach and education in non-profit performing arts organisations and can serve as an important reference for further validation of this line of research. Specifically, this study has clearly demonstrated that the MPAOs in Hong Kong have devoted substantial efforts to outreach and education engagement with the aim of achieving a range of educational goals that the formal education system may have overlooked or failed to address. The four layers in the proposed conceptual framework involve cognitive, affective, ethical, and behavioural dimensions (Figure 2 ). Successful application of the framework, in addition to audience building, can augment the formal education system in several ways. The four proposed layers are explained below.",

As shown by this study, OEPs have significant potential to enhance social well-being, especially among lower-class and underprivileged people in the community, through the provision of various arts experiences. Indeed, the themes of many arts programmes are socially related (e.g. the community art project 'Muse Up!' by the Chung Ying Theatre Company).

These outcomes can serve in many ways to augment formal education.

This framework can help to inform future developments and programming in the outreach and education sector in non-profit performing arts organisations. Additionally, it will provide a frame of reference for positioning outreach and education within non-profit performing arts organisations and for policymaking in arts and culture, with wider implications for other non-profit cultural organisations (e.g. visual arts and new media arts) in Hong Kong and globally. All research has its limitations, and my recommendations for future research stem from the limitations of this study. First, it was small in scale and only involved nonprofit performing arts organisations. In addition, collecting the perspectives of other stakeholders (e.g. teachers, school leaders, participants, and parents) of performing arts organisations was beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, it can be viewed as an important reference for future policymaking and development of outreach and education programmes. Future studies could include a wider population, with samples from other stakeholders in non-profit performing arts organisations in Hong Kong. A longitudinal study could also be designed to investigate the various long-term impacts of OEPs on young people. Importantly, the proposed four-layer conceptual model of the role of outreach and education in non-profit performing arts organisations can support and enable further validation of this line of research.",

With such an awareness of the unique features of outreach and education, performing arts organisations should view their dedicated efforts and resources in outreach and education engagement with a long-term vision.",
