In addition to mitigating transmission of SARS-CoV-2, these public health measures have also functioned in slowing the spread of other endemic respiratory pathogens. Surveillance data from South Africa indicates low circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) throughout the 2020-2021 Southern Hemisphere winter seasons. Here we fit age-structured epidemiological models to national surveillance data to predict the 2022 RSV outbreak following two suppressed seasons. We project a 32% increase in the peak number of monthly hospitalizations among infants \u2264 2 years, with older infants (6-23 month olds) experiencing a larger portion of severe disease burden than typical. Our results suggest that hospital system readiness should be prepared for an intense RSV season in early 2022.",

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa has experienced four large waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection driven by different variants, with varying levels of control. A 5-level alert system was put in place to quantify the strength of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate COVID-19 in March of 2020 [2] .",

These NPIs had major effects on behavior and repressed circulation of a range of communicable respiratory diseases, with record low RSV and influenza seasons reported in 2020 [2, 3] . As NPIs were relaxed in the spring of 2020, RSV made a late out-of-season resurgence that persisted into 2021. Despite this rebound, RSV transmission has remained historically low [2] . Understanding the potential hospital burden of RSV in 2022 following two suppressed seasons, and possible shifts in the demography of affected children, is a key public health question.",

Almost all infants are infected by the age of 2 years, but severe infections occur primarily in infants 6 months of age [6, 7] . Infections among infants are \u2264 primarily driven by transmission from older siblings in high-contact settings, such as schools and childcare centers [8] . Children may be reinfected as RSV immunity wanes on short time scales, but secondary infections are unlikely to result in hospitalization [6] . It is uncertain whether milder infections at older ages are a product of more mature immune systems or immune protection from prior infections [9] . Regardless, preventing and treating severe primary infection to RSV in the first two years of life has been the primary focus of disease mitigation strategies [10] . The distinct age-structure of RSV burden may have implications for hospitalizations during future outbreaks; this is because the implementation of NPIs throughout the pandemic reduced endemic pathogen circulation globally, enabling the buildup of fully naive individuals 2 years \u2264 old [11] . This poses the risk of a large and potentially severe RSV outbreak as NPIs are relaxed and a large number of infants are exposed to RSV for the first time.",

We predicted that older age groups (6-23 months) will experience the largest proportional age shift in hospitalizations, driven by an increase in the population susceptible to primary RSV infection. Hospitals may consider preparing for a larger number of babies experiencing severe primary infections at older ages than typical. We recommend the healthcare system prepares for a condensed RSV season, with an earlier than usual peak number of RSV-related hospitalizations in early April 2022. In response to this possibility, hospitals may consider increasing the availability of prophylaxis to high-risk infants in order to prevent severe infection and hospitalization, although there is limited use of these expensive treatments in routine in South Africa. More broadly, countries around the world such as France, Japan, and Australia, among others, have reported large, out of season RSV outbreaks following the lift of COVID-19 NPIs, reflecting a global pattern in the nature of RSV resurgence in response to pandemic-related public health measures [8, 16, 17, 18] .",

Without strong NPIs in place throughout the typical RSV season, South Africa is likely to see a larger than average RSV outbreak in 2022 as modeled in this study. Given that no additional NPI measures were put in place in response to the rise of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in late 2021 and NPIs continue to remain relaxed in early 2022, it is unlikely that RSV circulation will be suppressed for a There are several caveats to our model predictions. First, we use an age-contact structure derived from European data in our model; although some local data exist from South Africa, the fit of the model using these data was not as good (not shown). This study uses a short duration of RSV immunity (150 days), on the basis of it producing an optimal model fit to pre-pandemic data, as information on this parameter is scarce. In order to test the validity of this parameter, immunity was varied between 2-24 months (Appendix II). For immunity lasting beyond 150 days, the model overestimated the length of the typical RSV season in South Africa. Further, the model used does not distinguish between primary and secondary infections in relation to transmissibility and severity. We assume instead that age is the primary predictor of whether an infection will result in hospitalization. By fitting the age-structured model to age-structured observations, we show that the model predicts the distribution of hospitalizations among the studied age groups with confidence. We additionally conduct a sensitivity analysis by fitting a time-series SIR (TSIR) model which assumes a fully immunizing infection (lifelong immunity) to observed data [24] . Using the TSIR model we predict that the outbreak will .

Comparison between the two models suggest that the age-structured short-term immunity SEIRS model may trend towards underestimating potential hospital burden; hence projections presented in our main analyses should be deemed conservative. Overall, the two modeling frameworks, TSIR and SEIRS, bracket the space of plausible RSV trajectories; it is notable that both consistently support the possibility of an intense outbreak in 2022.",

We find that low levels of NPIs (\u03b2 reduced by <20%) have a negligible effect on model predictions, with projections still showing an intense 2022 outbreak. At stricter levels of NPI (\u03b2 reduced by > 35%) we determine the possibility of an intense but smaller 2022 RSV season, further increasing the buildup of susceptible individuals and leading to a more intense 2023 outbreak relative to 2022 predictions. As the length of the NPI period increases to 3 years, we find that the likelihood of a large outbreak occurring when measures are lifted decreases and transmission returns to typical dynamics more quickly as a result of transmission persisting during the NPI period.",

Most educational institutions have maintained mask mandates into 2022, potentially reducing transmissibility among children in high-contact settings [23]. This study focuses primarily on modeling the impact of lockdowns including school closures on RSV transmission, but implicitly captures the effect of masking at school in fitting the model to surveillance data from the pandemic period. Our sensitivity analyses suggest that persistence of low levels of NPIs, consistent with masking, would have a negligible effect on model projections and would not substantially attenuate the intensity of the 2022 outbreak. Future studies however should explore the specific role of masking in preventing the transmission of RSV in educational settings.",
