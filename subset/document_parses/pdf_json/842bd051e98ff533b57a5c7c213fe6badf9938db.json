Here we investigate in detail the effects at the population level of interventions that provide an asymmetric protection between the people involved in a single interaction. Masks of different filtration types, either protecting mainly the wearer or the contacts of the wearer, are a prominent example of these interventions. By means of analytical calculations and extensive simulations of simple epidemic models on networks, we show that interventions protecting more efficiently the adopter (e.g the mask wearer) are more effective than interventions protecting primarily the contacts of the adopter in reducing the prevalence of the disease and the number of concurrently infected individuals (\"flattening the curve\"). This observation is backed up by the study of a more realistic epidemic model on an empirical network representing the patterns of contacts in the city of Portland. Our results point out that promoting wearer-protecting face masks and other self-protecting interventions, though deemed selfish and inefficient, can actually be a better strategy to efficiently curtail pandemic spreading.",

            "text": "The recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown how fragile world societies are when confronted to the runaway spreading of a new virus strain [1] . In stark contrast with other diseases, however, the combination of recent scientific advances, liberal funding by governments and the availability of large scale manufacturing, has allowed to create and deploy world-wide vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus at unprecedented speed [2] , a fact that has without any doubts greatly diminished the death toll expected in this pandemic. Despite this huge effort, however, more than nine months lapsed between the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic by WHO in March 2020 and the approval of the first vaccine in December 2020. The large-scale deployment of vaccines worldwide required additional months and is still an unsolved problem in many areas of the planet. Moreover, the protection guaranteed by vaccines against recently emerged new variants is far from perfect. In this context, societies have had and still have to fight the propagation of the virus by adopting also more traditional non-pharmaceutical interventions [3] . These interventions, aiming at limiting the spread of a disease [1] , include collective actions, such as school closures, prohibition of large meetings, closing of public transportation, curfews or lockdown orders [4] . At an individual level, non-pharmaceutical interventions include, among others, physical distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene, and face masks. Understanding the impact of each of these interventions at the level of the single transmission event among individuals and how this translates at the community level is a crucial goal, which has attracted a huge scientific interest [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

Given the evidence for the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by means of droplets and aerosols [18] , recent research has shown that face masks are a very effective way to reduce the spread of COVID-19 [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Different types of masks exist, characterized by very different protecting performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Some protect mainly the mask wearer, such as valved masks endowed with an exhalation valve. Others mainly protect the contacts of the mask wearer, such as surgical or cloth masks. Such asymmetric efficacy is however more general. For example, vaccines reduce the susceptibility of individuals to being infected upon contact with an infectious person, but they need not be equally effective in reducing the capability of vaccinated infected individuals to transmit the pathogen further if they ever catch the disease [27] . Also, symptomatic treatment reducing cough and sneezing hinders the possibility to transmit the disease onward but it does not reduce the chance to be infected.",

Using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical calculations we show that the adoption of asymmetric PIs leads to surprisingly different scenarios. In particular interventions protecting the adopter turn out to have a stronger effect at the population level. If PIs of the same efficacy in reducing infectivity/susceptibility are available, it is better to use PIs protecting the adopter, as they suppress more the global circulation of the disease. We investigate the origin of this unexpected finding and show that the conclusion holds also when considering more realistic interaction patterns and disease dynamics.",

The properties of this transmission are mathematically encoded [30, 31] in terms of an infection rate \u03b2, representing the probability per unit time that the infection is transmitted from an infected to a susceptible along a single contact. Protecting interventions induce a reduction of this infection rate in two possible manners. An intervention involving the infected individual diminishes the infection rate along any edge emanating from him/her by a factor \u03b1 o . An intervention affecting the susceptible individual decreases, by a factor \u03b1 i , the infection rate of any edge pointing to him/her. For example, in the case of airborne transmission, a mask may reduce the number of viral particles exhaled by an infected individual and also reduce the number of viral particles that a susceptible can inhale from the environment [20] . As the example of masks shows, the factors \u03b1 o and \u03b1 i are not necessarily equal. For example valved masks strongly protect the wearer \u03b1 i 1 while they do not impede viral transmission towards the others \u03b1 o \u2248 1. For cloth masks the opposite is true. We compare scenarios where a single type of PI (with given \u03b1 o and \u03b1 i ) is adopted by a fraction f of the population.

In other words, while using more effective SELF interventions (i.e., reducing \u03b1 i ) decreases R \u221e , imposing more effective OTHER interventions (i.e reducing \u03b1 o ) creates the opposite result, an increase of R \u221e . This signals that SELF interventions, protecting the adopter, are more effective than OTHER interventions, protecting the contacts, at reducing the overall spreading of the disease at the community level. This is confirmed by integrating numerically the homogeneous mean field equations (D6)-(D12), for generic values of \u03b1 i and \u03b1 o (see Fig. 1(a) ). Most of the parameter space results in R \u221e (OTHER) > R \u221e (SELF), i.e. a larger circulation of the disease when OTHER interventions are adopted. The comparison of SELF and OTHER scenarios provides remarkable insight also at the level of the individual.

This means that adopting interventions offering more protection to contacts (i.e. reducing \u03b1 o ) has exactly the same effect on the prevalence of adopting and nonadopting individuals. In particular, if OTHER PIs are used, since \u03b1 i = 1 then R 1 (\u221e) = R 0 (\u221e), for any value of \u03b1 o . In such a case, from the point of view of a given individual, adopting an intervention is perfectly equivalent to not adopting it, as the probability to be eventually infected is exactly the same. With the benefit of hindsight this result is not so odd: If \u03b1 i = 1, PIs do not provide any protection against the transmission from others to the adopter, hence for the individual adopter the risk of being infected cannot be smaller than for a non-adopter. However, Eq. (4) reveals that, while adopting a PI always implies some degree of inconvenience (think for example at the bother of wearing a mask), no immediate utility exists for the individual adopting an OTHER PI, while such a utility exists for SELF PIs. See the concluding section for further discussion. From now on we mostly focus on the comparison of the effects at the population level of SELF and OTHER interventions with exactly the same efficacy \u03b1 (\u03b1 i = \u03b1 for the SELF case, \u03b1 o = \u03b1 for the OTHER case). For reference we consider also the case NONE, where no intervention is adopted, corresponding to \u03b1 i = \u03b1 o = 1, and the case BOTH, given by \u03b1 i = \u03b1 o = \u03b1, and representing equally protecting performance in both directions. In this last case (i.e., along the diagonal in Fig. 1 (a)) SELF PIs outperform OTHER PIs for any value of the fraction f of adopters. This is checked by considering R \u221e (OTHER)\u2212R \u221e (SELF) as a function of \u03b1 and f . The values plotted in Fig. 1(b) , which are nonnegative for any value of \u03b1 and f , demonstrate that in all cases SELF interventions are better than or equal to OTHER interventions in curbing disease diffusion. These conclusions remain true for other values of the infectivity \u03bb > \u03bb c as we can see from The numerical solution of MF equations also allows us to determine the height I m of the peak of incidence over time. This is a crucial quantity that must be kept as low as possible in order to avoid the saturation of health care systems by an inflow of too many seriously ill individuals. Fig. 1(c) shows clearly that also in this respect SELF PIs perform better than the OTHER counterparts, as witnessed by the asymmetry of the plot with respect to the diagonal. The same conclusion is confirmed by Fig. 1(d) : I m (OTHER) \u2212 I m (SELF) \u2265 0 for any value of \u03b1 and f . Adopting SELF interventions \"flattens the curve\" more effectively than the adoption of OTHER PIs does. A comparison between panels (b) and (d) in Fig. 1 reveals also that PI adoption affects differently the total number The previous predictions have been obtained within the mean-field framework. The comparison with numerical simulations, to check whether the picture derived above remains true, requires to take into account the phenomenology of the stochastic SIR model in finite systems (see Appendix B), but reveals new interesting features. Fig. 7(a) shows that, also in numerical simulations, the better efficacy of SELF interventions at the population level remains valid for any value of the infectivity \u03bb. Indeed the average size R \u221e of extensive outbreaks is smaller when SELF PIs, rather than OTHER PIs, are adopted. Different values of the asymptotic prevalence for long times R \u221e reflect a different temporal evolution. The mean-field approach predicts (see Appendix A 4) that the initial growth is exponential, with a characteristic time scale depending only on the threshold value, and thus on the product \u03b1 o \u03b1 i , and hence is equal for both SELF and OTHER scenarios with the same \u03b1 i = \u03b1 o = \u03b1. The difference in the value of R \u221e stems from the fact that this exponential growth ends later in the OTHER case, thus corresponding to a higher value of the peak incidence I m . Notice that this is different with what happens for the NONE (\u03b1 i = 1, \u03b1 o = 1) or BOTH (\u03b1 i = \u03b1 o < 1) scenarios. In these other cases already the exponential growth rate is different. Performing simulations of the stochastic SIR model (see Appendix B) and analyzing the temporal evolution of the number of infected individuals (see Fig. 7 (b)), these differences are clearly observed. The maximum value of the incidence in the SELF case is in general lower than in the OTHER case: adopter-protecting interventions are more effective than contact-protecting interventions in \"flattening the curve\" and thus reduce the maximum instantaneous pressure on health care systems.",

Figure 8 shows that also in this case SELF interventions flatten the curve of the number of infected people more effectively than OTHER interventions with the same individual efficacy. With respect to the final prevalence R \u221e , adopting SELF PI reduces the value in the absence of interventions R \u221e (NONE) = 0.595 to R \u221e (SELF) = 0.487, which is significantly (beyond stochastic fluctuations) smaller than R \u221e (OTHER) = 0.510, while for interventions with both SELF and OTHER efficacy the prevalence is R \u221e (BOTH) = 0.406. On the scale of the city, extrapolating these values for a population of N P = 652, 503, the adoption of SELF PI instead of OTHER PI would imply a reduction of around 15, 000 in the total number of cases. For the maximum number of simultaneously infected people, we obtain the values I m (NONE) = 0.238, I m (SELF) = 0.166, I m (OTHER) = 0.180, and I m (BOTH) = 0.130, which on the city scale implies a reduction of around 9, 000 concurrently infected individuals when SELF interventions are used instead of OTHER interventions.",

In agreement with many other publications, we find, of course, that no matter how imperfect, the adoption of PIs reduces the circulation of an infectious disease with respect to the case of no adoption, and that a higher efficiency at the individual level guarantees a higher protection for the whole community. Contrary to naive expectation, however, we find that interventions protecting the adopter (SELF PIs) or interventions protecting mostly contacts of the adopter (OTHER PIs) have not the same effect, even for equal efficacy of the individual intervention. SELF PIs turn out to reduce more the overall incidence of the infection and to \"flatten the curve\" more efficiently, i.e., they reduce more drastically the peak value of the number of individuals simultaneously infected. Although we have focused on purely SELF (\u03b1 o = 1, \u03b1 i < 1) and purely OTHER (\u03b1 o < 1, \u03b1 i = 1) interventions, the same picture applies when SELF (OTHER) PIs provide some small level of protection also in the other direction, i.e. \u03b1 i \u03b1 o (\u03b1 i \u03b1 o ), respectively. Our results are presented in terms of a mean-field theory for the simple SIR and SIS models of disease propagation in homogeneous networks, that can be readily extended to heterogeneous contact patterns, and are backed up with numerical simulations. Additionally, we consider a SEIR model, often used for COVID-19 analyses and estimations, on an empirical network representing contact patterns in the city of Portland. This last analysis allows us to confirm the expected effect of the different kinds of PIs in a realistic scenario. Our results can be interpreted in the framework of the general theory for heterogeneous agents put forward by Miller [32] , predicting that control strategies having a heterogeneous impact on susceptibilities are more effective in reducing epidemic size while strategies with heterogeneous impact on infectivities reduce more the probability of large outbreaks.",

To investigate this issue we considered a system where the choice of the PI is not individual-based, but contact-based: in other words, \u03b2 ij is still a quenched random variable given by (1), but the variables m i and m j are extracted independently for each edge. Hence, considering the example of mask wearing, an individual i can use a mask when interacting with contact j 1 and not use it when interacting with contact j 2 . In such a case, see Fig. 9 , SELF and OTHER scenarios give exactly the same results. Therefore asymmetry arises at the community level only if each individual consistently adopts (or does not adopt) the protecting intervention in every interaction.",

The usage of PIs can be imposed by ordinances issued by the government, but the adoption of individual PIs, even if policed by authorities, always involves a personal choice. As shown above, the adoption of an intervention that protects only the contacts of the adopter (\u03b1 i = 1) does not imply any direct utility for the adopter: The probability to be eventually infected is exactly the same for adopting and nonadopting persons. On the other hand, adopting an intervention (for example wearing a mask) is a burden, so that the net direct utility for adopting an OTHER PI is negative. A positive overall payoff for the individual adopting an OTHER PI can be obtained only if many people cooperate so that the common good is achieved, overcoming the inconvenience implied by the adoption. Thus OTHER PIs are both less effective at the population level and less likely to be adopted at the individual one. No such barrier to adoption exists for self-protecting (SELF) PIs: In such a case it is not only beneficial at the collective level, but also in the selfish interest of each individual to adopt a protecting intervention. Hence the overall higher effectiveness of self-protecting interventions at the community level is further enhanced by the fact that they are more likely to be spontaneously adopted.",

Averaging at fixed time the value of I(t) over many such realizations leads to a spurious bending as a function of time. Moreover, the duration of the initial stochastic regime (and hence the size of the spurious bending) is different in the various scenarios, further complicating the analysis. To overcome these difficulties, as it is customary, we start from a larger number of initial infected nodes, namely 50, so that the initial regime dominated by fluctuations is strongly suppressed.",

While it is expected that the effect of PIs grows with efficacy (small \u03b1) and widespread PI adoption (f close to 1) it is surprising to see that in a large domain of the parameter space R \u221e (NONE) \u2212 R \u221e (OTHER) is very close to zero (PIs do not significantly change the number of people eventually infected) while I m (NONE) \u2212 I m (OTHER) is rather large: OTHER PIs do not lead to an overall reduction of the outbreak size but indeed substantially flatten the curve.

In this regime, the final prevalence (density of infected individuals) is given bywithA non-zero solution \u03c6 \u221e = 0 is obtained when the condition d\u03a8(\u03c6\u221e) d\u03c6\u221e \u03c6\u221e=0 \u2265 1 is fulfilled, leading towhich leads to the threshold valueFrom Eqs. (D16) and (D17) we can recover a relation between R 1 k (\u221e) and R 0 k (\u221e), namelyanalogous to the one obtained for homogeneous networks.Appendix E: Heterogeneous mean-field theory for the SIS modelThe HMF equations for the SIS model [47] in a general network can be written in terms of the densities of infected adopting and nonadopting individuals of degree k, I 1 k and I 0 k , respectively, that in this case take the for\u1e41where \u03b8, in random uncorrelated networks, is defined byThe steady state condition,\u0130 1 k =\u0130 0 k = 0, corresponding to the large time behavior, leads to the equationsInserting these expressions into the definition of \u03b8, we obtain the self-consistent equation(E5) The non-zero solution, corresponding to a finite prevalence, appears when the condition d\u03a8(\u03b8) d\u03b8 \u03b8=0 \u2265 1 is fulfilled, which leads toand to the thresholdAppendix F: Details on the network and the epidemic model for COVID -19 We consider as the contact pattern for the SEIR dynamics the static contact network determined in Ref. [34] for the city of Portland, Oregon, before social distancing measures were enacted. The network has N = 214393 nodes and M = 1538092 edges, so that the average degree is k = 14.4. Further details on network statistics can be found in the original publication. The network is undirected and weighted, with each contact weighted according to its duration.On top of this network we perform simulations of the SEIR epidemic model in continuous time, using the Gillespie algorithm. The model is characterized by three parameters. An exposed node E spontaneously becomes infectious (I) at a rate \u03b1, while the transition between the infectious state E to the recovered state R occurs spontaneously at rate \u00b5. In the absence of PI, an infectious node i transmits the infection to a susceptible neighbor j at a rate \u03b2w ij where w ij is the weight associated to the network edge. In the presence of PIs this quantity is further modified as in Eq. (1) . The values of the parameters are the same calibrated for COVID-19 in Ref. [34] : \u03b1 = 1/3, \u03bd = 1/14, \u03b2 = 1.337. The initial condition for simulations is that a fraction 10 \u22123 of the individuals is infected and the rest is susceptible.",
