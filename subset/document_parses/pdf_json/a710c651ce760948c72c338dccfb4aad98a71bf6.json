A survey was administered between July-August of 2020, including validated measures of resilience and anxiety, a scale to measure COVID-19-related worry, and self-reported substance use. Compared to HIVuninfected participants (n = 80), those living with HIV (n = 116) reported fewer anxiety symptoms, less COVID-19-related worry, and higher resilience. Those with more anxiety symptoms and lower resilience engaged in more frequent alcohol consumption, binge drinking, and cocaine use. Alcohol misuse was more common among HIV-uninfected participants. Cocaine use was reported by 21% fewer participants during the pandemic compared with 7.3 \u00b1 1.5 months earlier. Possibly due to their experiences with HIV, PLWH responded with higher resilience and reduced worry and anxiety to the adversities brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In addition to the current COVID-19 crisis, South Florida has one of the highest HIV incidence rates in the nation [17] , an epidemic that has been strongly linked to drug use in Miami, Florida [18] [19] [20] . The clinical impact of HIV infection on the natural history of COVID-19 is uncertain, although limited evidence suggests that PLWH are not at greater risk of infection, severe disease, or death than the general population, if they are effectively treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) [21, 22] . Therefore, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on vulnerable and marginalized communities, and the intricate relationship between mental health and drug use in the context of HIV and the COVID-19 pandemic warrants examination.

The aim of this study was to examine resilience, mental health and substance use patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic among people living with and without HIV from the MASH cohort. The data used in this analysis was collected between July and August of 2020, in the midst of rising COVID-19 cases and deaths in Florida after easing of restrictions that were placed to mitigate the spread of the disease. Our findings revealed that PLWH reported higher resilience and less anxiety symptoms and COVID-19-related worry than HIV-uninfected peers. Our findings also suggest that higher resilience partially explains why PLWH displayed lower anxiety and worry. Significant relationships were found between mental health, particularly anxiety, and substance use. Our results indicate that, compared to their peers, many PLWH may be protected from psychosocial stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic via psychological resilience, which they have built over time through the management of the HIV infection [10] . Our study emphasizes that public health efforts to promote resilience in vulnerable populations may enable such groups to cope with and overcome the adversities generated by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This, in turn, might have equipped PLWH with coping mechanisms that allow them to adapt and manage their anxiety and worry about the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater degree than individuals with the same race/ethnicity and similar socioeconomic status who are uninfected with HIV. PLWH have been living with HIV for an average of 16 \u00b1 9 years and are highly engaged in HIV care and are adherent to treatment, as evidenced by the great majority of them (86.2%) having suppressed HIV viral load.

In comparison, a population-based study of PLWH reported a 19% prevalence of anxiety symptoms during 2015-2016, also using the GAD-7 [29] . Among the general U.S. population, the rate of anxiety reported in 2019 was 8.2% and rose to approximately 30% during the COVID-19 pandemic [30] , similar to the rate observed among HIV-uninfected participants in the MASH cohort. Likewise, the proportion of participants who reported high levels of COVID-19-related worry was significantly lower among PLWH (64.7%) than among the HIV-uninfected participants (81.3%). Higher resilience among PLWH may in part explain the lower prevalence of anxiety symptoms and COVID-19 related worry when compared to HIV-uninfected participants. Indeed, resilience attenuated the effect of HIV status on mental health, particularly anxiety symptoms. These findings are consistent with prior reports. A large multicenter study of PLWH in the United Kingdom found that resilience was inversely related to the prevalence of depression and anxiety [31] . Resilience has been found to be a protective factor for the mental health of HIV + men who have sex with men [32, 33] . Additionally, our study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted substance use in the MASH cohort. Cocaine use is a major cause of drug-related deaths in South Florida [34] ; yet, we found a significant decline in its use during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to 7.3 \u00b1 1.5 months earlier, prior to lockdowns. While cocaine use was higher among HIV-uninfected participants than PLWH prior to the pandemic, the frequency of use during the pandemic did not differ between the two groups. We did not observe significant changes in alcohol consumption, but alcohol misuse was more prevalent among the HIV-uninfected participants during the pandemic. Interestingly, the prevalence of alcohol misuse during the pandemic among PLWH was 29%, similar to what has been reported for PLWH in the U.S. before the pandemic (27%) [35] .",

            "text": "The reduction of cocaine use follows a reduction in the supply chain of the drug, imposed by the measures to contain the pandemic, rather than individual decisions or circumstances [36, 37] . In fact, the participants reported that the drug had become more expensive and harder to obtain. During the pandemic, cocaine prices have sharply increased in Miami [36] , and 76.3% of our study population earned $15,000 or less annually, which made the existing illicit market too expensive to sustain with their income. A report prepared by the United Nations Office on Drug Crime Global Research Network showed that new patterns of drug use have emerged during the pandemic [37] . While there has been an overall decrease in consumption of drugs, there are concerns about increased use of more easily obtained substances (e.g. alcohol) and more harmful patterns of drug use among people with SUDs [15, 37] . Table 3 Comparison of anxiety symptoms, worry, and resilience between PLWH and HIV-uninfected participants during the COVID-19 pandemic a When we examined the relationship between resilience, mental health, and substance use during the pandemic, we found that anxiety symptoms correlated with alcohol misuse, binge drinking, and cocaine use. Resilience was inversely correlated with binge drinking. COVID-19-related worry was correlated with alcohol misuse only among HIV-uninfected participants. Mental health disorders, such as mood and anxiety disorders, often co-occur with SUDs [38] [39] [40] . In the general U.S. adult population, almost 20% of all persons with a diagnosis of SUD had at least one co-occurring anxiety disorder [38] . These connections underscore the crucial role of mental health in the successful treatment of SUDs and in preparing and supporting populations for dealing with crises, such as pandemics and natural and man-made disasters. Some have called for a larger emphasis on resilience in the treatment of SUDs, as it may have behavioral and biological benefits [41] . Because psychological resilience may offer a level of protection against mental health disorders [42, 43] , strategies to promote resilience at the individual and community levels may offer substantial benefits during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Chandra et al. described psychological (and physical) health as one of the core components of community resilience [44] and how health promotion is a key lever to enhance community resilience [45] . Not surprisingly, PLWH in the MASH cohort report healthcare access and utilization in greater proportions than HIV-uninfected participants. Federally-funded programs like the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program support PLWH with insufficient financial resources with medical and support services including mental health and treatment for SUDs. This type of support may contribute to resilience among PLWH and may partially explain the results of this study. Consequently, increased access to mental health and substance use services could play a role in increasing resilience, mitigating anxiety and stress, and addressing social needs that may arise during the COVID-19 pandemic among HIV-uninfected people who may not have access to medical care and other support services. While the COVID-19 pandemic has presented with significant challenges to public mental health, it is also an opportunity for improvements in mental health services [46] . To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, health systems should facilitate the continuation of mental health services for those with pre-existing conditions, as well as increase access to those who develop mental health problems during the pandemic whether they are HIV-infected or not [46] . Community outreach, through partnerships between healthcare providers and other social services, can help promote mental health literacy, identify stressors in the community, and encourage vulnerable individuals to seek care [46] .",

In addition to health promotion, Chandra et al. delineate education as a way to improve risk communication [44, 45] . Tailored educational materials can raise awareness, encourage protective behaviors, and relieve stress and anxiety by informing and empowering the community. The integration and collaboration of governmental and non-governmental entities are essential to building and strengthening community resilience [44] and build trust with minorities that often mistrust government and medical systems [48] [49] [50] .

            "text": "Several strengths and limitations of our study must be acknowledged. Our study was conducted in a well-characterized cohort of an underserved and vulnerable population living in South Florida, largely comprised of low-income minorities living with and without HIV and high rates of comorbidities. As mentioned earlier, PLWH in the MASH cohort have been living with HIV for nearly two decades on average and are highly engaged with HIV care. Subsequently, our findings may not be generalizable to some groups of PLWH within the U.S., such as those recently diagnosed and those that may not be receiving treatment. On the other hand, the MASH cohort resembles a large portion of the U.S. population of PLWH in that they are on average middle-aged, Black non-Hispanic, and receiving HIV care [17, 51] . The HIV-uninfected participants from the MASH cohort were recruited from the same community as their HIV + peers, therefore representing middle-aged, low-income minorities with several social and economic disadvantages. Validated and frequently used measures of resilience and anxiety symptoms were used, allowing for comparisons to other communities and populations. However, the data was self-reported, thus subject to bias and under-reporting of substance use. Nonetheless, surveys were administered by trained research staff working with these participants every 6 months, which limits potential misunderstanding of the questions from the respondents. Lastly, the cross-sectional study design does not allow for causation to be inferred. Thus, longitudinal follow-up of the MASH cohort based on this study's findings may help us identify the unique social disparities and mental health challenges of a highly vulnerable community and inform public health practices to improve mental health relief during times of crises. The dissemination of our results can increase the public visibility and awareness of the mental health vulnerabilities faced by marginalized communities amid the COVID-19 pandemic and unify efforts to eliminate mental health inequities.",

Our findings support the assertion that PLWH, by chronically dealing with a potentially deadly disease (i.e. HIV infection), have acquired tools to build resilience, worry less about COVID-19, and experience fewer anxiety symptoms than their HIV-uninfected peers. Nonetheless, the high prevalence of anxiety and worry during the COVID-19 pandemic warrants improved public health efforts for mental health relief. A decline in cocaine use was observed; however, the decline is likely due to reduced availability and higher cost of the drug rather than personal choices. There is much to be learned from exploring how vulnerable communities are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging changes on their mental health and substance use patterns. Research is needed to identify psychosocial factors that can improve the ability of marginalized communities to cope with the pandemic by providing strategies to build resilience to better prepare populations before, during, and after broadly impacting crises.",
