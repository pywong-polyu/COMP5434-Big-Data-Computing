Most data suggest that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 invasion into cells, is widely present throughout the cardiovascular system. 2, 3 Theoretically, the virus may invade cardiac muscle cells through this receptor and cause myocardial injury, leading to cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury include direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon-mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by T cells, coronary plaque destabilisation and hypoxia. [4] [5] [6] Myocardial injury has been reported to be associated with increased mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. 7, 8 Therefore, it is necessary to detect potential myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients as early as possible. There have been several reports on myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients on admission, but the cause and risk factors for myocardial injury are variable. 9, 10 Understanding the risk factors for myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients may enable clinicians to improve treatment strategies and thereby reduce mortality rate.",

The mean levels of biochemical indicators related to myocardial injury, including CK, CK-MB, TNI, MYO and pro-BNP, did not exceed the ULN by more than twofold, showed a mild degree of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients on admission.

Thus, we did not consider the cause of the highest CK was myocardial injury and distinguished it from the diagnoses of rhabdomyolysis and myositis.

The rate of severe illness was 8% in our study, which was considerably lower than that in Hubei and most other parts of China. 11 Furthermore, the incidence of severe illness in the myocardial injury group was significantly higher than that of the group without myocardial injury, and all death cases (n = 7) were in the myocardial injury group, similar to the results of previous research. 14 role of the ACE2 receptor in SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous studies speculated that the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor (ACEI/ARB) can play long-term cardioprotective effects on COVID-19 patients. 15 However, it was strange that more patients in our myocardial injury group took ACEI/ARB, which was attributable to the fact that more patients in that group had hypertension and complications. Indeed, until now there is no clear basis to prove the risk and benefit for the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. However, coronary heart disease and diabetes were apparently unrelated to the myocardial injury in our study, which is different from the results reported in previous studies. 16 Although more than 80% of patients had fever and 60% had respiratory symptoms, these symptoms were not associated with myocardial injury. Laboratory blood test results showed that the median WBC level of all patients was 4.83 \u00d7 10 9 /L, which was closer to the normal lower limit of the reference value, and there was no significant difference between the two groups, suggesting that the patients in our research were mainly only infected with SARS-CoV-2 on admission and did not have signs of bacterial infection. Furthermore, patients with low lymphocyte counts were found to be more likely to have myocardial injury on admission. Consequently, we speculated that the SARS-CoV-2 infection was related to myocardial injury on admission. Unfortunately, the quantitative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the peripheral blood samples of patients at the time of admission could not be collected, and therefore, the correlation could not be directly analysed. The pathological anatomical data from COVID-19 patients showed thromboses in the arteries, veins and even in the microcirculation. Intravascular thrombosis is likely to lead to myocardial injury or even acute myocardial infarction. During the epidemic period, patients often did not receive early intervention, leading to death. 17 Our study also confirmed that the D-dimer level in patients with severe COVID-19 was significantly increased. 18 Some researchers have speculated that the viral receptor ACE2 protein exists on vascular endothelial cells. Following the destruction of these vascular endothelial cells by the virus, intravascular coagulation would occur in various organ systems in the body, including the cardiovascular system. This mechanism may explain why COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury had significantly higher levels of D-dimer than patients without myocardial injury in this study. Finally, we indicated that age, critical illness, comorbidities, hypertension, history of ACEI/ ARB use, higher D-dimer level and lower LYM levels on admission were associated with myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients, similar to the results of previous studies; however, only age was an independent risk factor for myocardial injury.",

It is necessary to conduct basic experiments and prospective, in-depth, multicentre, large-sample analyses of the findings from dynamic biochemical indicators, ECG, and echocardiography related to myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients to validate the preliminary findings of this research and develop individualised treatment plans by disease severity. In our study, the proportion of critically ill patients was lower than that in severe epidemic areas, 3, 11 whereas the incidence of myocardial injury was higher than that of the previously reported. This may be related to the national and regional epidemic control measures and medical economic conditions. Shanghai, as an international city, has comprehensive inspection means and can quickly screen out patients with abnormal indicators for treatment. Infected patients are generally diagnosed early, which reduces the overall mortality.",
