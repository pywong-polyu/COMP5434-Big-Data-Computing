The flash flood problem is a natural hazard and one of the most frequent events, which is caused mainly by heavy rains within a short duration of time (heavy rainfall) and the limited water drainage infrastructure [1] [2] [3] . Therefore, the flash flood events are related to the frequency of rainfall, the properties of drainage basins, the physical properties of the land, the land use and cover characteristics [3, 4] . For example, the increase in urbanization with limited spaces to absorb and hold rainwater will increase the risk and possibility of flash floods. Globally, floods disasters which occurred between 2001 and 2018 were responsible for 504 billion USD financial losses and a 94,000 death toll [5] .",

The basic composition of an EFWS that ensures high functionality was described and reviewed in [13, 14] . However, the EFWS introduced in the literature focused on systems suitable for rivers and valley areas and does not present a system suitable for cities. For example, in Kenya, an EFWS was introduced to reduce flash flood disaster risks and losses [15] . The proposed system by [15] used microwave communication links and a geostationary satellite system to collect rainfall information, which was analyzed to distribute warning messages through the mobile phone operator networks. In Belgium [16] a weather forecasting model was presented based on an ensemble numerical method and collected Sensors 2021, 21, 4598 3 of 26 data from the rainfall radar station to estimate the future rainfall and issue warning alarms. Apollonio et al. [17] presented the benefits of using a real-time measurement system for rainfall to identify hazard areas and create an estimating flood risk map. Most researches have focused on developing EFWS using rainfall-runoff models and considering regional parameters. For example, a wireless sensor network model was developed in Colombia to measure weather parameters such as temperature and humidity [18] . The weather information will be analyzed to select the probability of having heavy rainfall. Similarly, in another study [19] , a network of wireless sensors was utilized in an EFWS to collect hydrological data (water level and precipitation) and then use it for flood event analysis and simulation. The system was used to predict water-level reaching time and the level of hazard and to specify endangered areas for regions in Saudi Arabia. Another EFWS was developed in Florida (USA) based on using ultrasonic water level sensors and cameras to provide a data processing module, where this has the necessary information to determine the warning [20] . The water level sensors based on radar technology were used to develop an EFWS in Bonn/Germany [21] . The water level sends the real-time measurements to the fire brigade, and then the warning will be issued in case the water level exceeded the specified threshold value [20] [21] [22] . Overall, the previous models presented in the literature do not take into account the weather forecast error impacts on the EFWS and vulnerability of infrastructure in cities. In addition, there is a lack of developing an accurate and effective EFWS to predict flash floods. The machine learning algorithms have been used in [23] to solve energy consumption problems and find the wireless network structure. In another work, the machine learning algorithms have been employed to present a smart city proposal based on an intelligent transportation system [24] .",

            "text": "Recently, researchers tend to use new artificial techniques such as ANN to predict the flood events for rivers areas based on the water levels of rivers [22] and different complex applications [23, 24] . Wu et al. [25] and Aichouri et al. [26] developed an ANN model to estimate the variations in water level of rivers, and they proposed linear regression and nonlinear equations, respectively. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, Zhang et al. [27] developed an Elman ANN based on considering the previous and current time measurements. For forecasting stochastic events such as flash flood, which is a challenging task, new intelligence and new techniques are required [26, 27] . The ANN has been used in the literature to predict the water level and focus on increasing the reliability of the EFWS [22] . However, there is a lack of investigation on the ANN structural model, which will help to optimally select the ANN structure (input, hidden, and output layers). One of the objectives in this study is to develop a novel rolling EFWS for flash floods in streets (drainage system) using real-time measurement based on ultrasonic sensors and the ANN model. In the literature [22, 27] , the traditional and common optimization methodsnamely, steepest descent and gauss newton methods-are employed in ANN as a learning algorithm and guarantee optimal performance. In general, these traditional algorithms are efficiently limited in solving high level of uncertainties or stochastic application nature. Recently, new intelligent optimization techniques such as the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the Golden Ratio Optimization Method (GROM) have been employed in ANN to forecast the stochastic energy demand applications such as renewable energy [25] . The GROM as a modern learning algorithm aims to improve the ANN training and validation process by minimizing the tuning time to achieve the global optimal solution compared to other traditional optimization methods in ANN such as gradient descent training algorithm [25] . Therefore, it is important to examine new optimization algorithms such as the GROM technique to efficiently handle the uncertainties in EFWS such as weather and water flow data and increase the forecast accuracy. In this article, the GROM algorithm is used as a new metaheuristic optimizer to train the ANN to chive global parameters and weights within a minimum computational time. ",

            "text": "A flash flood is a sudden event that cause economic damages and human loss. In order to minimize the risks caused by flash floods, early warning systems are required. To design a suitable early warning system, it is necessary to understand weather information, hazard monitoring and disaster risk assessment [13, 16, 17] . In this project, the EFWS integrates many subsystems (or elements) that include a real-time water level measurement system, a communication system, water flow and level estimation model based on the weather forecast data, forecasting flash flood model and hazard monitoring model as shown in Figure 1 . Flash flooding estimation is subject to a wide range of variables such as weather information and water sector infrastructures. Therefore, the warning system needs to include a forecast system that handles a range of potential events. The actual measurements and updated information from the site will be used as feedback to update the forecast and warning model. As shown in Figure 1 , the project proposed model includes a real-time monitoring system for water level using an ultrasonic sensor powered by a PV system. The real-time monitoring system will be mounted on the top of the water drain. Here, the GSM technology will be used to send and receive the data from the monitoring system to the PC workstation (as a control station). the forecast and warning model.

The proposed design in this project aims to increase the awareness time before flooding occurs to reduce disaster risks. Flash flooding estimation is subject to a wide range of variables such as weather information and water sector infrastructures. Therefore, the warning system needs to include a forecast system that handles a range of potential events. However, the weather and flash flood forecasts have a high level of uncertainties which increase the challenge of developing an accurate flood forecast profile. The main aim of the proposed EFWS concept is to develop a flood warning system that is taking both the real-time water level measurements as well as the vulnerability of infrastructure (drainage system) by calculating the estimation of water level based on weather forecast data. The basic strategy principle of the proposed EFWS is introduced in Figure 2 . Firstly, the collected available data about the infrastructure of the area from the government side (depth, diameter and roughness coefficient) and channel slope data are used to find the hydraulic and hydrologic analysis and calculate the water drainage flow and maximum discharge of the drainage channel using Manning formula method. Then, the weather forecast data and the level of water from sensors are the main requirements for a system that generates an early warning plan and a flash flood forecast that will be provided for days ahead. In the next stage, the workstation receives the updated water level and flash flood prediction data. These data are used to generate a warning plan for days ahead. Furthermore, the warning plan will be updated at every time step. This process aims to minimize the impact of the forecast error on the warning system and avoid an unnecessary or misleading warning plan. The warning plan is then evaluated based on a risk analysis tool to generate an emergency plan or publish awareness. The actual measurements and updated information from the site will be used as feedback to update the forecast and warning model.

This compensation helps the EFWS model to be more accurate and reliable compared to the traditional warning model. Figure  3 presents the main mechanism of the flood forecasting and early warning system (EFWS). The real-time measurements and updated information from the site will be used as feedback to update the forecast and warning model. As shown in Figure 3 , the proposed EFWS model includes a real-time monitoring system to measure the water level in the drainage system using an ultrasonic sensor powered by a PV system as a sustainable solution. The real-time monitoring system will be mounted on the top of the water drainage system, as shown in Figure 4 . Here, the GPRS/3G/4G communication modules will be used to send and receive the data from the monitoring system to the PC workstation (as a control station). On the other hand, the weather forecast data (rainfall/rain intensity) and drainage system data will be used to calculate and estimate the new water level during flash flood events. To present the drainage system characteristics and calculate the water drainage flow and discharge, the Bentley FlowMaster computer program was used. The output data (water drainage flow and discharge) and weather forecast data (rainfall/rain intensity) will be fed to a Matlab model developed in this study to calculate and estimate the water level based on the rational method equation [2, 19] , further details in Section 3.1. Finally, both data (real-time measurements and future water level estimation) will be used to feed the rolling forecast model, in Section 4, and issue a warning alarm if necessary. ",

This compensation helps the EFWS model to be more accurate and reliable compared to the traditional warning model. Figure 3 presents the main mechanism of the flood forecasting and early warning system (EFWS). The real-time measurements and updated information from the site will be used as feedback to update the forecast and warning model. As shown in Figure 3 , the proposed EFWS model includes a real-time monitoring system to measure the water level in the drainage system using an ultrasonic sensor powered by a PV system as a sustainable solution. The real-time monitoring system will be mounted on the top of the water drainage system, as shown in Figure 4 . Here, the GPRS/3G/4G communication modules will be used to send and receive the data from the monitoring system to the PC workstation (as a control station). On the other hand, the weather forecast data (rainfall/rain intensity) and drainage system data will be used to calculate and estimate the new water level during flash flood events. To present the drainage system characteristics and calculate the water drainage flow and discharge, the Bentley FlowMaster computer program was used. The output data (water drainage flow and discharge) and weather forecast data (rainfall/rain intensity) will be fed to a Matlab model developed in this study to calculate and estimate the water level based on the rational method equation [2, 19] , further details in Section 3.1. Finally, both data (real-time measurements and future water level estimation) will be used to feed the rolling forecast model, in Section 4, and issue a warning alarm if necessary.

According to a governmental study [8] , the flash flood in downtown that happened on February 2019 has mainly occurred due to the limitation of water drainage systems such as the size, efficiency and quality of the system to handle the rainfall. As previously mentioned, the downtown area has a vulnerability of infrastruct (water and stream drainage system) and a lack of information and data. Therefore, for hydraulic and hydrologic analysis, we firstly used Google Earth Pro simulation to e mate the channel slope of the stream drainage system. In this study, due to the lack information related to the infrastructure such as the water pipe slope in the water drain system, the slope of streets is used to estimate the water pipe slopes. Here, the Goo Earth Pro simulations are used to find and determine the slope of streets. Then, the lected available data about the infrastructure of the area from the government side (dep diameter and roughness coefficient) and channel slope data is used as input data for most common program in hydraulic and hydrologic engineering called Bentley FlowM ter software. This software has been used here to calculate the water drainage flow maximum discharge of the drainage channel using the Manning formula method [2, 3, 19] . As shown in Figure 6 , to estimate the adding water level in the drainage system to rainfall events, it is important to know firstly the discharge rate of the drainage sys (which is previously completed using Bentley FlowMaster software). Secondly, we n to estimate the new water flow and level coining from the rainfall event. The weat forecast data (rainfall/rain intensity) and area information (the path of rainwater, drain area) are used to calculate and estimate the water level rise based on the rational meth equation [2, 3, 17] , and for this purpose, a Matlab program has been developed in this per. The EFWS process is based on two main points: the current water level, L, which be measured on real-time basis using the ultrasonic sensor model, as described in Sect 3.2, and the estimation of the water level rise, \u0394L, as shown in Figure 7 . The \u0394L is difference between the water level rise due to rain and the channel discharge rate. In F ure 7, the estimated new level of water in the drainage system, H, where = + \u2206 , be used to issue a flood warning if it reached the threshold water level. The warning mo will be discussed in Section 3.3.

            "text": "Generally, the prediction of flash flood events or water levels during storm conditions is a challenging and complex problem, consisting of several nonlinear relationships such as weather status, infrastructure and human factors. A wide range of ANN techniques and structures are used to predict and estimate different applications such as energy and control model due to their flexibility and ability to solve complex and nonlinear relationships [30] [31] [32] . Recently, researchers tend to use ANN to predict the flash flood events for river areas based on the water levels of rivers [25] [26] [27] . However, there is a lack of investigation on the ANN structural model, a model that will help to optimally select the ANN structure (input, hidden, and output layers). One of the objectives of this study is to develop a novel rolling EFWS for flash floods in streets (drainage system) using real-time measurement based on ultrasonic sensors and the ANN model. In addition, this article aims to examine the impact of using different exogenous variables on the ANN forecast and investigate the optimal ANN structural model for forecasting the flash flood in Jordan. An artificial neuron model mimics how biological NNs of the central nervous system operate and learn. The mathematical model of ANN is constructed by multiple layers (input, hidden and output) of neurons which are interconnected by synaptic weights from each neuron in one layer to each neuron in the next layer, as shown in Figure 13 . In the standard structure of an ANN model, the output of each individual neuron will represent the output of the previous layer neurons (as input signal) multiplied by synapse weights and modified by an activation function [24] . The activation function aims to modify the summation of input signals in the neuron before being output by using a nonlinear function such as a sigmoid and tangent (tanh) functions. The output of each neuron, as shown in Figure 13 , can be mathematically represented in Equations (1) and (2):",

The majority of the current ANN models use sigmoid functions, due to its differentiability which make it computationally easy to calculate. The main aim of including activation functions as scalar functions in the ANN structure is to introduce the nonlinearity into the prediction model, which helps it to solve nonlinear and complex problems and limit the neuron output [24, 30] .",

The validation set is used as a final performance check for the trained network before testing the model with around 10% of the training set. The reason for this structure is to avoid a specific good forecast on the training set which turns out to be inaccurate in the test set. In addition, this way aims to avoid \"overfitting\" by selecting a forecast that is over-trained on the training set. Finally, the testing set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final forecast model and is typically 10% to 30% of the training set. The ANN forecasts for EFWS application are evaluated for different parameters and structures in order to determine the optimal and suitable model parameters. The impact of the number of hidden layers and neurons and different input variables on the forecast model accuracy are examined. In the following section, Section 5, the analysis and results of each parameter will be presented.",

The Levenberg-Marquardt with back-propagation algorithm modifies the weights by calculating the error in a backward order, from the output layer to the input layer. In general, the ANNs use the training set to learn the key patterns between the input and output information by suitable synaptic weights. When each pattern is read, and the training reaches a satisfactory level, the ANN holds the synaptic weights and uses the trained network to predict the future or make decisions. The network trains over a range of patterns, by using the back-propagation algorithm. This training process aims to improve the performance of the ANN model by minimizing the total squared error, Err, as described by Equation (3) .

However, these traditional methods need to simultaneously satisfy smoothness, continuity and differentiability criterion of the objective function (error evolution method) to find the local optimal weights and parameters in ANN. In general, these traditional algorithms are efficiently limited in solving high level of uncertainties or stochastic application nature. Therefore, it is important to examine new optimization algorithms such as the GROM technique to efficiently handle the uncertainties in EFWS, such as weather and water flow data, and increase the forecast accuracy. In this article, the GROM algorithm is used as a new metaheuristic optimizer to train the ANN to achieve global parameters and weights within a minimum computational time. The GROM is used a growth searching patterns nature, namely the golden ratio, was presented by Fibonacci in [25, 33] . The growth searching in GROM angle and magnitude are determined based on the golden ratio, as described by Equation (4).",

The use of the GROM aims to improve the searching technique and find the optimal solution with lower computational cost. The ANN forecast model based on GROM procedure is presented in Table 3 . In addition, the GROM technique is suitable for complex and timely problems where it does not include any tuning steps. This helps to minimize the convergence rate and the running simulation time (computational cost), especially the EFWS working with 10 min time resolution. In this paper, the GROM model parameters have been optimally selected over a wide range of values, as in [33] . In general, there are many optimization algorithms such as Adam optimization algorithm and Root Mean Square propagation (RMSProp) have been used in solving stochastic objective functions in ANN. However, the Adam algorithm is mainly employed with deep learning process and showed better results compared to RMSProp but with high computational cost. There are many heuristic optimization algorithms as part of modern optimization such as GROM algorithm has been recently used for different engineering problem. For example, GROM evaluated in [25, 33] by using different 35 benchmark test problems outperformed a number of well-known optimization algorithms. The employing of modern heuristic optimization algorithms such as GROM are a consideration of this work; there are limited number of studies that consider the benefit of using metaheuristic optimization algorithms. Where no optimization algorithm can effectively solve all the optimization problems, it is significant to employ different methods with different applications. For example, the results in [32, 33] showed that there is a difficulty for a specific optimization to a suitable solver for all application and ANN models. This gives a motivation to use new metaheuristic optimization method, GROM, algorithm with ANN where it can be beneficial for imprinting the accuracy of the ANN forecast model for EFWS with high uncertainty. In addition, the studies on furcating the water level or flash flood by using new optimization problems are sparse in the literature and there are no studies using the GROM. Table 3 .

Table 5 shows the mean of the daily MAPE results for the reference ANN model, Model A, with different hidden neurons from 10 to 50. The minimum mean of the daily MAPE value was 1.1% for 20 neurons at each hidden layer. In general, the MAPE values increased with increasing the number of hidden neurons and achieved 4.8% as a maximum mean of the daily MAPE values. Therefore, the optimal number of hidden neurons are 20 at each layer for the EFWS and this data set. The input exogenous variables: the reference forecast model, Model A, with \u2206L(t) and L (t \u2212 10) as input exogenous variables are used to be compared to other models by adding new exogenous variables to the reference model. The new exogenous variables, (A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 ), which have been added to Model A are described in Table 6 . Figure 14 shows that adding A 1 exogenous variables to Model A improved the forecast model performance and achieved 0.9% daily MAPE. It is mainly related to the high relationship and correlation between current water level H(t) and these external variables which are associated more with the water level compared to other variables.

The rolling process aims to generate a water level prediction profile for one day ahead with 10 min time resolution, and then the model will be updated every time step by using the real-time measurement and forecast error, as shown in Figure 12 . The rolling process will help to minimize the impact uncertainties and improve the forecast model accuracy compared to a fixed forecast model using the testing data sets. The fixed model aims to forecast the water level over one day ahead without any updating for the data or model during the daytime. Figure 15 presents the daily (seven days) MAPE scores for the fixed and rolling forecast model. The comparison results showed that the performance of the rolling forecast models (traditional and ANN optimized by GROM) significantly improved the MAPE scores compared to the fixed forecast model. For instance, on Day 2 the MAPE score decreased from 6.3% to 0.7% for traditional ANN and from 5.7% to 0.5% for the ANN model optimized by GROM. The maximum improvements in the daily MAPE score were on Day 6 by 93.5% for the GROM model and 92.4% for the traditional ANN model on Day 7. These results indicate that the rolling forecast (updating the model each time step) will increase the forecast model accuracy.
