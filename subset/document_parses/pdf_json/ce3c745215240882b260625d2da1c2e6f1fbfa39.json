Little is understood about (a) resilience as a mental health protective factor during these stressors, and (b) whether families from Eastern and Western cultures cope differently. This study examines how individual resilience and family resilience moderate the associations between pandemicrelated stressors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in two culturally distinct regions. Methods: A total of 1,039 adults (442 from Minnesota, United States, and 597 from Hong Kong) living with at least one family member completed an online survey about COVID-19-related experiences, mental health, individual resilience and family resilience from May 20 to June 30, 2020. Predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were examined separately using hierarchical regression analyses. Results: In both regions, pandemic-related stressors predicted higher symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Individual resilience and two domains of family resilience were associated with positive mental health. In Minnesota, higher levels of individual resilience buffered the negative relationship between pandemic-related stressors and depressive symptoms; higher levels of family communication and problem solving also buffered the negative relationship between pandemic-related stressors and stress symptoms. In Hong Kong, higher familylevel positive outlook magnified the negative relationship between pandemic-related stressors and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Individual and family resilience is protective against the adverse psychological effects of pandemic stressors, but they vary across cultures and as exposure to pandemic-related stressors increases.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a public health emergency and produced a profound ripple effect on individuals, family systems, communities, and societies through the world. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, governments have launched lockdown policies and emphasized the need for social distancing measures to mitigate the rapid transmission of COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020) . As a result, many individuals and families are forced to stay at home and are physically cut off from extrafamilial supports in the early outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. While virtual connections may help maintain some social relations, these social distancing measures seem likely to produce a significant loss of social support from outside the home. Although lockdowns might provide opportunities for renewing connections with family members, interpersonal friction could also be magnified when staying in close proximity for an extended period (Lee, 2020) . Altogether, the uncertainty and social isolation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to an unprecedented mental health crisis. Indeed, recent systematic reviews of population-based studies worldwide consistently demonstrate high rates of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms during this pandemic (Cooke et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021) . However, some individuals and families may be at greater risk for mental health symptoms depending upon the extent of their exposure to pandemic-related stressors. Those working in healthcare or other \"frontline\" positions have faced elevated stress, as have those experiencing pandemic-related unemployment as well as illness and death of family members (Amerio et al., 2020; Connor et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "Drawing upon Bronfenbrenner's (1979) Ecological Framework, individual adjustment is influenced by the interaction processes with both family and sociocultural contexts during the pandemic. The family adjustment and adaptation response (FAAR) Model posits that individual and family stress responses are moderated by the perception of the stressor and the resources available to the family (McCubbin & Patterson, 1983) . At the family level, the FAAR Model suggests that family systems with resources, such as collaborative problem solving skills and a positive outlook, may buffer the negative impact of pandemic-related stressors on family processes and individual adjustment. However, family discord and marital conflicts may also threaten individual and family well-being (Lee, 2020) . At the cultural level, individuals from various sociocultural contexts may adapt various coping strategies when facing pandemic-related stressors. Individuals from individualistic, Western cultures tend to embrace independent self-construal (i.e., autonomy and separation), while individuals from collectivistic, Eastern cultures tend to embrace interdependent self-construal (i.e., connecting with others; Markus and Kitayama, 1991) . Given these differences, it is possible that individuals and families representing these cultures will demonstrate unique responses and coping strategies when faced with pandemic-related stressors.",

Individual resilience is a dynamic process in which individuals are able to adaptive positively after exposure to adversity or trauma (Lutha and Cicchetti, 2000) . In the face of a pandemic, high individual resilience serves to buffer stress and psychological distress throughout the crisis (Hou et al., 2021; Prime et al., 2020; Riehm et al., 2021) . Past research has focused on evaluating the impact of individual resilience on mental health following a major public health event (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003; Bonanno et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2004) . Recent studies explored the relationships between individual resilience and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., Havnen et al., 2020; Hou et al., 2021; Riehm et al., 2021) . For example, adults in Western societies such as the United States and Norway reporting low resilience experienced marked increases in mental distress during the pandemic (Havnen et al., 2020; Riehm et al., 2021) . Resilience was associated with lower levels of anxiety in Hong Kong (Hou et al., 2021) .",

Family resilience is as an active process of personal and relational transformation through which family members emerge stronger and more resourceful through their shared efforts in confronting family challenges (Walsh, 1996) . Family resilience focuses on three key processes when dealing with challenges, including family belief systems (i.e., meaning making and positive family outlook), family communication processes (i.e., collaborative problem solving) and organization processes (i.e., family connectedness, flexibility to adapt, and family resources; Walsh, 2016) . Emerging evidence indicated that family resilience buffered the association between family stress and adjustment of single parent families in an Eastern culture (i.e., Korea; Hyun, 2007) . However, no empirical studies to date have investigated how family resilience processes may facilitate or hinder individuals' and family units' ability to cope with social disruption during the pandemic.",

For example, a review on culture and social support provided evidence that Asians or Asian Americans are more reluctant than European Americans to explicitly ask for support from close others (Kim et al., 2008) . Furthermore, we are not aware of any studies that have simultaneously examined whether individual and family resilience factors moderate the association between stressors and mental health of individuals facing a public health emergency such as a pandemic. Thus, a better understanding of how resilience may function across cultures will facilitate the design and implementation of timely, culturally-sensitive psychoeducation and/or interventions to support mental health when facing crises such as pandemics.",

Rather than surveying the U.S. nationally, we selected a single state, Minnesota, to sample. Because of the wide variability in COVID cases across states as well as state-level social distancing mandates, a focus on a single state allowed for greater consistency in these variables. The two regions surveyed for the current study share some similarities and many differences that may influence individuals' experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic. Minnesota and Hong Kong are of approximately the same population size (5.6 to 7 million at the time of the study), and each launched a social distancing policy in approximately the same timeframe. Notably, the course of the pandemic progressed differently in the two regions. In Minnesota, the first COVID-19 case started in early March, with an average of 436 new daily COVID-19 cases (range = 143-984) between mid-May and June. In Hong Kong, the first COVID-19 case started in late January, with fewer than 30 new daily COVID cases between mid-May and June.",

Further, family communication and problem solving significantly moderated the association between pandemic-related stressors and depression, F(1, 427) = 4.62, p = 0.032. Specifically, the negative association between pandemic-related stressors and depression was tempered with increasing levels of family communication and problem solving (see Fig. 1b) . Simple slope analyses revealed that the association between pandemic-related stressors and depression was significant when family communication and problem solving was low, t = 3.02, p = 0.003.

Table 3b shows the results of the hierarchical regression analyses for the Hong Kong sample. For the main effect models in step 3, older age (p < 0.01) was associated with three positive mental health. Caregiving responsibility for children or grandchildren (\u03b2 = 0.13, p = 0.005) was associated with higher stress symptoms; while caregiving for adult family members (i.e., older parents or spouses) was associated with higher symptoms of depression (\u03b2 = 0.08, p = 0.043) and stress (\u03b2 = 0.09, p = 0.021).

Our findings were generally supportive of our hypotheses. In both Minnesota and Hong Kong, pandemic-related stressors were associated with more mental health symptoms (H1). Individuals who experienced more stressors from the pandemic not surprisingly also reported more depression, anxiety, and stress.

While this finding is counterintuitive, we speculate that this may be explained by the Chinese stress and coping pattern known as fatalistic voluntarism. Fatalistic voluntarism is described as the combination of an acceptance of present adversities and an exertion of personal efforts to change the situation, with hope and confidence for a better future (Lee, 1995 as cited by Chui and Chan, 2007) . At lower levels of pandemic-related stressors, believing that the family can cope with the present challenges of the pandemic is beneficial to individuals' psychological adjustment. However, there is a mismatch between expectations and reality when facing high level of pandemic-related stressors in closely-connected families. An overly positive outlook could create cognitive dissonance with the reality of the challenges facing a family. It may be that the protective effects of having a family-based positive outlook vary as exposure to pandemic-related stressors increases. Additional research will be important to further elucidate the complex relationship between family-level optimism and coping with varying levels of stress.",

Consistent with existing pandemic research (Cooke et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020) , a high proportion of adults in Minnesota and Hong Kong had elevated levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Our findings also elucidated an association between caregivers' roles and mental health outcomes in both Minnesota and Hong Kong. Other research has supported the impact of a caregiving role on mental health during the pandemic, also noting the increased stress associated with caregiving responsibilities may negatively impact family relationships (Russell et al., 2020) . Although older adults are more vulnerable to the COVID-19, our findings were also consistent with previous studies demonstrating that older adults had better mental health than younger adults in both regions (e.g., Havnen et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020; \u00d6 cal et al., 2020) . We found that older adults, aged 60 or above, in Minnesota experienced relatively few pandemic-related stressors when compared to younger adults. For example, older adults in Minnesota are more likely to be retired and may have found it less intrusive to stay at home in accordance with social distancing recommendations. Furthermore, older adults in both Minnesota and Hong Kong reported higher levels of individual resilience, relative to young adults, also supporting their ability to cope with pandemic-related stressors.",

We need to be aware of the unique cultural context and pandemic experiences of each region. For most Minnesotans, this was their first experience with a pandemic and many of the recommended public health measures (e.g., social distancing, mask wearing) were newly encountered and viewed by some as governmental intrusion or overreach (Fairchild et al., 2020) . Hong Kong has previously experienced a SARS epidemic, making public health strategies more familiar and perhaps faced with less resistance (Lau et al., 2020) . Both regions also experienced social unrest during the study period, and we acknowledge that it is hard to disentangle the psychological distress simultaneously triggered by the mass protests and the pandemic.",

Regardless of individualistic or collectivistic cultural orientation, individual resilience and family resilience are protective factors in supporting global mental health. We call for universal interventions strengthening individual coping and resilience when facing pandemic-type stressors. This type of intervention may help reduce negative impacts on mental health and support the ability to rebound successfully post-pandemic. Our results also highlight the importance of careful consideration of family and cultural context when considering how to support mental health during a pandemic. It is equally important to adapt culturally-specific interventions targeting different elements of family resilience. Families from the West may be more likely to privilege clarity with family communication and collaborative problem solving, while the East may be comfortable with uncertainty and the unknown with a positive family outlook (Lee, 2020) . Furthermore, it is essential to provide additional psychosocial support to vulnerable populations, such as family caregivers.",

Our findings highlight the role of cultural context in coping with a global pandemic. Across two distinct cultures, aspects of individual and family functioning related to individuals' successful coping and supported mental health. The similarities as well as unique sources of resilience in each region are suggestive of universal as well as culturally-specific intervention targets. Through supporting processes most likely to support coping within each culture, interventions may most effectively ameliorate the negative impacts of a global pandemic and promote mental health. ",
