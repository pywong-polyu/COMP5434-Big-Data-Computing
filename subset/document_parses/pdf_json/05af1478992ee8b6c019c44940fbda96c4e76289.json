The disruptions to daily life and the associated stresses of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have been perhaps most acutely felt by Black and Latinx children from low-income families, including first-generation and undocumented immigrants. 1 Structural inequities, such as the lack of employer-sponsored insurance in the service and retail industries; barriers to applying for public benefits, even for those who qualify; chronic poverty; and the lack of linguistically and culturally effective services have contributed to the disproportionate impact. In this article, the authors consider how structural inequities have rendered Latinx children particularly vulnerable to the devastating physical and psychological effects of the pandemic, identify risk and protective factors that are related to mental health outcomes, and recommend ways in which child and adolescent psychiatrists can respond to the escalating needs.",

Also, 21.9% started using substances to cope with pandemicrelated stress and emotions, 18.6% seriously considered suicide in the last 30 days, and 52.1% had more than one adverse mental health or conduct-related symptom. 7 These statistics were found to be 40%-135% higher for Latinx than for non-Latinx Whites. Before the pandemic, Latinx families were more likely to work in low-wage service jobs, such as in the service industry and food production. Most of these jobs were declared by the government as essential work, creating situations of increased risk of exposure to COVID-19. Immigrant and Latinx families often live in multigenerational, highly congregate households that make social distancing difficult and increase the risk for transmission. Many undocumented Latinx are not provided with appropriate protective equipment and are not eligible for government relief benefits-all while facing increasing xenophobia and discrimination. Latinx who have continued to work during the pandemic have had to rely on relatives for child care, the separation increasing both the child's risk of exposure to COVID-19 and anxiety about parental exposure.",

Child and adolescent psychiatrists need to provide evidencebased, culturally responsive treatment for Latinx children and address structural inequities as part of their clinical practice, research, teaching, advocacy, and collaborative leadership. From a family-centered approach, child and adolescent psychiatrists can proactively evaluate and address the mental health needs of overstressed families and identify any increased risk for suicide, domestic violence, and child maltreatment and practice cross-cultural competence, humility, and awareness of one's own personal biases 10 by recognizing cultural barriers to mental health care access and engagement (eg, stigma, explanatory models, fears of discrimination, immigration status).
