With a number of vaccines having been developed and the NHS vaccination programme rolling out successfully there is much room for optimism. A vaccinated team is important. However, immunisations are voluntary and some may voice reluctance. The main point here is to look at the science and reassure your team.",

As the prevalence of the pandemic responds to the vaccination programme it might be that such a term is not needed. This will be reviewed in due course. In any case, such a term cannot be imposed on an existing employee without their agreement.",

Though, this stance is somewhat out of line with requirements over Hepatitis-B, so it is foreseeable that it may, in due course, change. The basis for this could be the interpretation of the GDC Standards for the Dental Team, Principle 1 'Put patients' interests first': AE 1.5: You must treat patients in a hygienic and safe environment AE 1.5.2: You must make sure that you have all necessary vaccinations and follow guidance relating to blood-borne viruses. 2 With guidance that has been adopted UK-wide, Public Health England also provides crucial direction for the profession. Its publication Immunisation Against Infectious Disease (the Green Book), at Chapter 12 on Immunisation of healthcare and laboratory staff states: AE Any vaccine-preventable disease that is transmissible from person to person poses a risk to both healthcare professionals and their patients. Healthcare workers have a duty of care towards their patients which includes taking reasonable precautions to protect them from communicable diseases. Immunisation of healthcare and laboratory workers may therefore: AE Protect the individual and their family from an occupationally-acquired infection AE Protect patients and service users, including vulnerable patients who may not respond well to their own immunisation AE Protect other healthcare and laboratory staff AE Allow for the efficient running of services without disruption. 3",
