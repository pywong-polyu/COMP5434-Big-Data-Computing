Life-threatening systemic fungal infections occur mainly in immunocompetent and immunocompromised humans, such as patients with AIDS, immunosuppressanttreated organ transplant patients, and recently patients with COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] . Candida infection has shown an increasing prevalence and severity with an increase in AIDS prevalence, chemotherapy, and organ transplantation. Candidemia accounts for approximately 9% of nosocomial bloodstream infections, and when C. albicans invades the internal organs, it can cause severe candidiasis with a mortality rate of approximately 40%.",

            "text": "Morphogenesis is critical for the pathogenicity of C. albicans [4, 5] . It has two main forms: yeast and hyphal. The dimorphism that allows the ability to switch between yeast and hyphal growth forms is essential for pathogenicity. The yeast form is required for adhesion and colonization of the epithelial cells of the host, while the hyphal form is required for the penetration and invasion of the endothelial cells of the host [6] . Morphogenesis has various environmental cues, such as nutrient limitation, alkaline pH, quorum sensing molecules, serum, elevated temperature, and elevated CO 2 [7, 8] . For in vitro experiments, serum exposed to elevated temperature (37 \u2022 C) was used for hyphal formation [9] . Therefore, novel drugs that have the ability to inhibit the morphogenesis of C. albicans must be screened. In C. albicans, MAPK and Ras/PKA-dependent pathways regulate nutrient sensing and acquisition, stress response, and pathogenesis, as well as play a potent role in hyphal formation [10, 11] . The small GTPase Ras1 in this fungus affects both pathways and acts as a switch for hyphal formation signals, such as serum, elevated temperature, and nutrient limitation [11] . As one of the MAPKs, Cek1 has a role in biofilm formation and filamentous growth in C. albicans, while another MAPK, Mkc1, has a function in the formation and maintenance of cell wall structure [10] . CaUme6 is a transcription factor that maintains filamentous growth in hyphal formation and upregulates hyphal-specific genes (HSGs) encoding hyphal cell-related components, such as Hwp1, Als3, and Ece1 proteins [12] . The transcriptional repressor Nrg1 works with Ume6 as a negative feedback loop to control the expression of HSGs in hyphal growth environmental signals [13, 14] .",

Other antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin B (polyene) and echinocandin target the fungal membrane and cell wall synthesis, respectively. In the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, azoles inhibit ERG11, which encodes 14\u03b1-demethylase (cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol demethylase) [15] . The azole-resistant C. albicans strains have been isolated from patients prescribed chemotherapy drugs. The azole-resistant C. albicans strains have some features, such as point mutations and the overexpression of ERG11, azole target, and overexpression of drug efflux pumps Cdr1 and Mdr1. To effectively treat infections caused by these drug-resistant C. albicans strains, the necessity of new antifungal drugs that have different targets from those of the commonly used drugs is emphasized.",

They have been shown to exhibit antifungal activity against a variety of fungi, including C. albicans, but the exact underlying mechanism has not been studied. In our previous study, we investigated the correlation between vacuolar activity and pathogenicity in C. albicans through deletion of V-ATPase subunits vma4 and vma10 [19] , and the results suggested that targeting vacuoles with novel fungicidal agents would be beneficial. In this study, 31 compounds containing a carbazole structure were synthesized as a result of preparing an analog, such as bafilomycin A1 with vacuole inhibitory activity. Molecule B and Molecule C were selected through the screening and evaluation of 31 carbazole derivatives. Both showed excellent efficacy in inhibiting morphogenesis and pathogenicity but did not significantly affect the vacuolar activity in C. albicans. Here, we describe Molecule B and Molecule C, which inhibit the Ras1/MAPK pathway to prevent hyphal morphogenesis and consequently attenuate the pathogenicity in C. albicans. Overall, this study focused on elucidating the mechanism of action and evaluating the antifungal activity using both in vitro and in vivo models to confirm the potential of Molecule B and Molecule C as novel antifungal drugs for Candida infection.",

The MIC of Molecule B was 8 \u00b5g/mL, which showed the best effect among the 31 carbazole derivatives (Figures 1a and S1a, and Table 2 ). In addition, Molecule B was noncytotoxic in mammalian cells up to a concentration of 16 \u00b5g/mL (Figures 1b and S1c) . The noncytotoxic concentration of Molecule B, 16 \u00b5g/mL, corresponds to twice its MIC, 8 \u00b5g/mL, so it was considered suitable for the experiment, and Molecule B was selected as one of the leading carbazole derivatives. Carbazole derivatives with a MIC of 16 \u00b5g/mL were Molecule C, Molecule C-M5, Molecule C-M6, Molecule C-M10, Molecule F, and Molecule N (Figure 1a) . However, Molecule C-M5, Molecule C-M6, Molecule F, and Molecule N were excluded because their MICs showed cytotoxicity in mammalian cells (Figure 1b ). Molecule C and Molecule C-M10 were noncytotoxic to mammalian cells even when their concentration was 32 \u00b5g/mL, which corresponds to a double MIC, 16 \u00b5g/mL (Figures 1b and S1c) . Of the two, Molecule C was water-soluble; thus, it was considered advantageous for new drug development. Therefore, Molecule B and Molecule C were selected as the two leading carbazole derivatives in this study. Surprisingly, the MICs of Molecule B and Molecule C for fluconazole-and caspofungin-resistant C. albicans strains showed the same MIC as that of the reference strain (Table 2) . Molecule B and Molecule C both showed the same MICs (4 \u00b5g/mL) in BY4741, a wild-type strain of S. cerevisiae ( Figure S1b ). These results suggest that Molecule B and Molecule C have growth inhibitory activity against C. albicans, including strains that are resistant to existing drugs. ",

On the other hand, the mice treated with Molecule B and Molecule C by tail vein injection showed higher survival rates (Figure 3a) . The degrees of Candida infection of the kidneys, which are a major target of C. albicans [35] , were also markedly lower in the groups administered Molecule B and Molecule C by tail vein injection (Figure 3b ) than the control group. It was also observed that the survival rates of the mouse groups fed water containing Molecule B and Molecule C for autonomous intake were also very high (Figure 3c ). In addition, the mice that drank water containing Molecule B and Molecule C showed a very low infection rate compared to the control group (Figure 3d ). Through these results, it was confirmed that Molecule B and Molecule C were effective in inhibiting morphogenesis in vitro as well as in inhibiting pathogenicity in vivo. ",

In C. albicans cells treated with Molecule B and Molecule C, the expression of ECE1 encoding Ece1, a cytolytic peptide toxin essential for mucosal infection [37] , was inhibited (Figure 4a ). The expression of ALS3, encoding Als3, which plays an important role in cell adhesion and host surface adhesion [36, 38] , was also reduced (Figure 4a ). In addition, the expression of HWP1, a cell-surface adhesion function in the hyphal cell wall [39, 40] , was markedly reduced (Figure 4a) . Furthermore, it was confirmed that the expression of HGC1, which encodes a hypha-specific G1 cyclin-related protein essential for hyphal morphogenesis [41] , was reduced ( Figure 4a) . Moreover, we continued to investigate two proteins, Nrg1 [13, 14] and Ume6 [12] , which act as negative feedback regulators at the transcriptional level under filament growth conditions, affecting the expression levels of HSGs. The Nrg1 protein level of C. albicans cells treated with Molecule B and Molecule C from 0 to 2 h was higher (Figure 4b ) than the control. In addition, it was confirmed that the transcriptional level of NRG1 was significantly increased in C. albicans cells treated with Molecule B and Molecule C (Figure 4c ). On the other hand, Ume6 protein, which showed an increase with time in hyphae-induced C. albicans cells, was not detected at all time points in C. albicans cells treated with Molecule B and Molecule C (Figure 4d ). In addition, it was observed that the mRNA expression level of UME6 was significantly decreased in both the groups treated with Molecule B and Molecule C (Figure 4e ).",

It was also shown that the protein expression levels of Ras1 were significantly reduced in C. albicans cells treated with Molecule B and Molecule C (Figure 5b) . To investigate the MAPK signaling pathway involved in the hyphal formation of C. albicans [43] , mRNA and protein levels of MKC1 and CEK1 were investigated. The mRNA expression levels of CEK1 and MKC1 were decreased in C. albicans cells treated with Molecule B and Molecule C (Figure 5c,d) . The protein levels of Cek1 and Mkc1 in C. albicans cells treated with Molecule B and Molecule C were not significantly different (Figure 5e ). There was no difference in the change in the level of P-MKc1, an activated form of Mkc1 (Figure 5e ). However, it was confirmed that the level of P-Cek1 was significantly reduced in C. albicans cells treated with Molecule B and Molecule C (Figure 5e ). These results suggest that Ras1 is the key switch responsible for the antifungal effect of Molecule B and Molecule C through the Cek1 cascade activity in the MAPK pathway, which is well-known to be associated with the morphological transition in C. albicans. Western blotting was performed with an anti-myc antibody to detect Nrg1-myc and Ume6-myc.

(b) In western blotting, CaRas1 was detected using the anti-Ras10 antibody, and \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control.

            "text": "In this study, we first evaluated the inhibitory activity of 31 carbazole derivatives on the growth of C. albicans and their cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Our results showed that Molecule B and Molecule C are appropriate agents for the growth inhibition of C. albicans. In addition, Molecule B and Molecule C were found to be nontoxic to mammalian cells at each tested MIC. We also confirmed the inhibitory effect of Molecule B and Molecule C on the growth of fluconazole-and caspofungin-resistant C. albicans strains. Many studies have suggested that the processes of biofilm formation [33] and morphogenesis [44] of C. albicans are closely related to pathogenicity. We found that Molecule B and Molecule C could inhibit the pathogenicity of C. albicans by inhibiting morphogenesis and biofilm formation. In addition, as a result of studying the survival rate of candidiasis mice by treatment with Molecule B and Molecule C in the in vivo experiment, it was confirmed that the pathogenicity of C. albicans was reduced. Surprisingly, not only candidiasis mice treated with Molecule B and Molecule C via tail vein injection but also mice given Molecule B and Molecule C dissolved in drinking water showed high survival rates. Both mice that drank water containing Molecule B and Molecule C and mice treated with Molecule B and Molecule C via tail vein injection had very low levels of Candida infection in the kidneys compared to controls. We predict that the results of this in vivo study were due to the inhibitory effect of Molecule B and Molecule C on the morphogenesis of C. albicans. Therefore, Molecule B and Molecule C could be effective candidates for the development of novel antifungal agents.",

            "text": "Fluconazole (azole) and caspofungin (echinocandin), which are commonly used as antifungal agents, target enzymes essential for cell wall ergosterol biosynthesis and the process of fungal cell wall synthesis, respectively. In order to control the growth of C. albicans strains resistant to these drugs, novel antifungal agents with different targets than those commonly used are needed. Our results showed that Molecule B and Molecule C regulate the activity of Ume6 and Nrg1, which are involved in the expression of HSGs, as well as disrupting the Ras1/MAPK pathway, which is mainly used for morphogenesis in C. albicans. In addition, it was confirmed that the MAPK pathway signaling components STE11 (MAP-KKK), HST7 (MAPKK), and CEK1 (MAPK) were inhibited at the mRNA level by Molecule B and Molecule C. The effect of inhibition of biofilm formation even at concentrations lower than the MIC can be attributed to the suppression of the expression of ALS3 and HWP1 by Molecule B and Molecule C. We believe that the inhibition of the expression of ALS3 and HWP1 by Molecule B and Molecule C at a step corresponding to the surface adhesion step in the biofilm formation process makes biofilm initiation no longer possible. Als3 and Hwp1 have also been reported to play an important role in biofilm formation [40, 45] . Given that Molecule B and Molecule C caused a reduction in the Candida infection of the kidneys in the candidiasis mouse model, we can conclude that Molecule B and Molecule C suppressed the pathogenicity of C. albicans by inhibiting hyphal formation through the Ras1/MAPK signaling pathway.",

Molecule B and Molecule C regulate the 'RAS1 and CEK1'-mediated MAPK pathway (STE11-HST7-CEK1) which is associated with the hyphal cell wall construction and invasive growth. In this study, we introduced Molecule B and Molecule C, which reduce the virulence of C. albicans by inhibiting morphogenesis via the Ras1/MAPK pathway. Our findings suggest that Molecule B and Molecule C are promising compounds for the development of new antifungal agents for the treatment of systemic candidiasis and possibly, for other fungal diseases. Molecule B and Molecule C inhibit Ras1 and affect the PAK kinase Cst20, thus affecting the Cek1 MAP kinase cascade, resulting in a decrease in the levels of the transcription factor Cph1. The level of Ume6, which is regulated by the signal of Cph1, also decreases as the amount of Nrg1 increases.",
