We similarly use a dimensionality reduction technique, the locally linear embedding to map the high dimension of the data set into a low dimensional embedding parameter space, while keeping the local geometry and the similarities of the neighbouring data points. After three consecutive steps, we assign one parameter to each binary star, which well scales with the \"detachness\", i.e. the sum of the relative radii of the components. This value is in good agreement with the morphology types listed in the OGLE catalog and, along with the orbital periods, can be used to filter any morphological sub-types based on the similarity of light curves. Our open-source pipeline can be applied in a fully automatic way to any other large data set to classify binary stars.",

The OGLE collection of eclipsing and ellipsoidal binary stars currently contains more than 48 000 systems in the Magellanic Clouds ) and over 450 000 binaries in the field of galactic bulge . The observations are collected in two optical photometric bands, Johnson V and Cousins I bands, of which the latter is the default with about 15 times more epochs than the former. The obtained light curves mostly have high signal-to-noise ratios and their types are confirmed by experts, which makes the sample very reliable. The catalog consist of all kind of binary star types from detached, semi-detached and contact systems to more exotic objects such as RS CVn stars, cataclysmic variables, HW Vir binaries, double periodic variables and even some planetary transits. These samples are characterized by exceptionally high levels of completeness and purity, therefore they serve as a framework for various astrophysical applications. The fourth phase of the survey (OGLE-IV) has started in 2010, but due to the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2), the regular observations has stopped on 18 March 2020.",

First of all, an extensive period search has been conducted using Lomb-Scargle periodogram (Scargle 1982) and the Box-Least Squares (BLS) period-search algorithm (Kov\u00e1cs et al. 2002) . While the former is sensitive to sinusoidal light curve shapes, the latter capable of finding boxshaped periodic signals, which is common in detached eclipsing binaries. Due to the large number of stars, a Random Forest (RF; Breiman 2001) algorithm has been trained on the BLS statistics using the best-sampled OGLE-IV fields as a training set. The RF classifier yielded the first classification labels. The second step was to phase fold and normalize each light curve into the range of 0-1 and cross-correlate them with a collection of template curves. Finally, all light curves have been visually inspected at least once and obvious noneclipsing stars were removed from the sample.",

These authors use supervised machine learning algorithms to separate binary stars from other variable star classes or to assign one of the four main morphological categories to each binary star. Although Valenzuela & Pichara (2018) tested their unsupervised (i.e. non-labelled) algorithm on OGLE-III data set, they only considered binaries as one of the classes to be separated from others. The first unsupervised classification based on similarity of light curve of eclipsing binary stars was performed by Matijevi\u010d et al. (2012) . They used locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm (Roweis & Saul 2000) to assign continuously measured values to stars observed by the original Kepler mission (Borucki et al. 2010) . Later Armstrong et al. (2016) used the same method to separate detached, semidetached and contact eclipsing binaries observed by the K2 mission in its campaigns 0-4. The Gaia eclipsing binary and multiple systems have also been classified based on their light curve morphology using a supervised classification tool, linear discriminant analysis (Mardia et al. 1979) , which provides a similar morphology parameter as the LLE for Kepler targets (S\u00fcveges et al. 2017a,b) . Although these authors aimed to use machine learning techniques to classify binary stars into a small number of distinct groups, these algorithms have a great advantage, besides the speed of the process, which is almost not comparable to the human inspected way, they do not depend on human impressions, which may lead to unreliable results. Moreover, similar eclipsing binary light curves can be more efficiently selected for well-aimed studies if a continuously measured number is assigned to each of them.",

The T 0 and P values can be used to phase fold light curves center-ing the primary minimum at zero phase. However, we found that in several cases the T 0 is misaligned, and finetuning the period may decrease the scatter of the phase curves. Therefore, we adjusted the T 0 values by shifting the primary minima of the fitted polynomial chain models (see later) to zero phase. To refine the periods we used the Phase Dispersion Method (PDM; Stellingwerf 1978) , which calculates the scatter in each bin of phase folded and binned light curves and minimize this value with respect to the scatter of the full phase curve by adjusting the period. We assumed that the OGLE period is close to the true value, which made possible to tighten the period search range to \u00b10.01 days around the initial value. As the precision of the period is dependent on the number of period samplings, the finer the period grid the preciser the result, we used the PDM algorithm implemented in the GPU-based Python code cuvarbase 2 , which utilize the speed of graphics processing units. This way the time required to calculate a spectrum on a fine grid reduced significantly. For each star, we defined the grid in frequency range with 100,000 equidistant steps.",

We tested second and fourth order polynomials, where the former is usually sufficient to fit sinusoidal shaped light curves, while the latter is needed to fit sharp eclipses. The initial location of knots were chosen in two ways, firstly, an automatic search was carried out to locate points below the mean of the light curve by 0.5 standard deviation, secondly, we predefined typical values both for W UMas and Algols.

Unfortunately, the detached and semidetached stars have the same labels, but if we take a look at the light curves corresponding to the different region of the figure, we will see that the right hand side of the LLE curve is dominated by the Algol type binaries. On the left hand side, the location of those stars that show continuous brightness variation are overlapped. By inspecting the light curves, it can be revealed that the leftmost the point, the more sinusoidal the shape of the curve. There are some stars in the right side of the LLE curve that obviously should not be there. The light curve of these objects are a combination of a continuous variation and a sharp eclipse and the dominate feature defines the location of the star in the LLE manifold.",

To do so, we scaled the values along the 1D arc into the range of 0-1 in the following way. First, we measured an angle with respect to an arbitrary point, then using a seventh order polynomial, we adjusted the scale. Then we assigned a single value to each data point based on their distance to the curve by selecting the nearest one. This value is called the morphology parameter c as it scales with the \"detachness\" of the eclipses. The \"detachness\" is a measure of the sum of the relative radii of the components, thus it can be used as an indicator, however, it should not be represented as an accurate physical unit, because the physics of eclipsing binaries is way more complicated than to be merged into a single parameter. The variation of parameter c along the 2D LLE curve is shown by the labels in the lower panel of Fig. 1 . Some example polyfits representing the measured light curves that correspond to the different morphology parameters can be seen in Fig. 2 .",

We tried to scale our c val- ues as similar as possible to those by determining the morphology of a set of Kepler light curves and comparing them to those listed in the Villanova Kepler Eclipsing Binary catalog , however, our parameters are probably slightly off of those due to two main reasons. Firstly, the LLE algorithm is sensitive to both the initial set of weights and the diversity of the training set. Running the algorithm two times even with the same data set can be resulted in slightly different LLE shapes, especially in the direction of the axes. Secondly, Matijevi\u010d et al. (2012) did not publish the way how they exactly transformed their LLE parameters into a single value. The presented morphology parameters can be used as a guideline to select different type of eclipsing binaries. From Fig. 2 , it is not easy to put strict limits between the classes, but we can see that the range of c \u2264 0.5 is dominated by detached binaries, the semi-detached systems lie between 0.5 < c \u2264 0.7, and above c \u223c 0.7 the light curves become more sinusoidal, where the ellipsoidal and overcontact systems can be found.

            "text": "To study the characteristics of each subtype separately, in Fig. 4 . we shows the correlation between the morphology parameter and the orbital period, from top to bottom, for the contact, ellipsoidal and the detached and semi-detached systems, respectively, in the field of galactic bulge. Contact stars are clustered in a well defined area with periods shorter than \u223c1 day and parameter c larger than \u223c0.65. In contrast, ellipsoidal variables comprise three distinct horizontal strips with average periods of 200, \u223c10 and 1 days. The first group consists of genuine ellipsoidal variables. The second groups was discovered by Pawlak et al. (2014) , who classified those objects based on their location on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as Red Clump stars. As ellipsoidal variables that form the sequence E (introduced by Wood et al. 1999) in the period-luminosity relation should not have such short periods, the last group probably has been misclassified based on their light curve shapes that show alternating minima. Unfortunately, detached and semi-detached binary systems are not distinguished in the OGLE-IV catalog, thus they can be found everywhere along the whole parameter space. Nonetheless, seemingly these stars form two merged features. A horizontal strip with period shorter than \u223c1 day and c value greater than \u223c0.6. Presumably, these stars are semi-detached variables with continuous brightness variation and alternating minima. The other feature lies mainly between periods \u223c1-100 days with two tails at the edges. This should be formed by Algols, where less detached systems tend to have shorter periods. The well separated Algols, with probably elliptical orbits, have the longest orbital periods, much longer than 10 days. Finally, those points that lie outside of these regions correspond to stars with light curves dominated by reflection effect or misclassified objects. The morphology parameter -orbital period correlation for the binary stars in the field of Magellanic Clouds (MCs) is shown in Fig. 5 . The most notable difference compared to the sample of galactic bulge stars is the very low number of objects that show sinusoidal-like variability, that is, have large morphological values. In the short orbital period range, these are mainly binaries consists of W UMa type stars, which are missing from the OGLE catalog, due their low brightness, which are typically fainter than 21 mag, and the catalog only contains stars brighter than 20.4 mag in I-band ). In the long period regime stars are usually red giants that show ellipsoidal variation and have intrinsically large luminosities. The low number of this kind of objects can probably be explained by the age of the population. As it was revealed by Pawlak et al. (2016) from the position of stars in the color-magnitude diagram, the majority of MC binaries are main sequence stars belonging to the young population, thus the lack of low mass evolved giants. As it can be seen, this kind of behaviour can be revealed with the help of our automatic morphological classification. Table 1 . lists all the newly derived parameters, i.e. the fine-tuned periods and times of minimum brightness, and the estimated morphology classifications (c values) for each star.
