A lot of literature exists in COVID-19, but most of them talk about the social and psychological side of the COVID problems. COVID-19 has affected our day-to-day life and its effects are extensive. Most of the literature presents the adverse effect of the pandemic, but there are very few state-of-the-art approaches that discuss its beneficial effects. We see the multiple faces of the pandemic in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that presents the pros and cons of the pandemic. We present a survey that surrounds over effects on education, environment, and religion. The positive side of COVID-19 raises an alarm for us to wake up and work in that direction.",

Billions of academic learners became devoid of their knowledge acquisition during this pandemic. The teachers, students, schools, and families -all became a victim of this bitter truth. The world has gone under complete reorganization during this period be it any sector, the education sector is not left apart. The speed of the pandemic and the closure of schools was so fast that it was difficult to come up with a solution with all facilities. The closure of educational institutes will not only have short term impact, but leave a footprint on economic and societal components.

According to the statistics given by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the in-ternational student population with demographic changes is likely to reach 8 million by 2025 [36] . Most of the international students prefer either the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, or Australia for their higher education [37] as shown in Fig. 2 . As per the statistics in 2019, the top host countries involved in sending students to other countries include China, India, South Korea, and France [35] as shown in Fig.  3 . The pandemic has brought a sluggish impact on the movement of students across the border. The travel restrictions during lockdown and the fear of pandemic will affect the cash flow at the universities. Parents are afraid to send their ward across any border in this situation. The universities in these countries are undergoing extreme pressure on student admission. If this problem persists, there is a possibility of decline in international higher education in the com-ing years. The pandemic has brought a devastating effect on the global education system. The pandemic has shrinked the world under their own home and hometown and cross border movements seem to be a threat to the life of an individual.",

When physical presence is a risky situation, an alternative has to be taken at various levels of learning. Online learning is a new strategy embraced by the education system in this time of pandemic. The transition from active learning to passive learning was very rapid during this pandemic. The curriculum was not designed for passive learning, so the viewers are losing their interest in the content. The shift in developed countries to the online learning system does not pose any problem, but for developing and under-developed countries -it is a challenging situation. The rural areas of these countries do not have the basic infrastructure to facilitate the online learning. The pandemic has posed a threat to the overall development of the underprivileged in these countries resulting in shattering their economies. The video telephony softwares is being used for distant learning. The concept of keeping the electronic gadgets far from the children has been loosened even for a primary school going child during this pandemic. The online learning has removed the commuting time for the learners but on the other hand, made them addicted to electronics devices leading to many social, psychological, and physical disabilities.",

Due to the sudden change to the online learning in the education system, the preparedness of the tutors was a concern. An inhibition of this sudden change was found in the tutors during the beginning phase. The course curriculum was not made for passive learning. The 3 sudden shift in the teaching system with inadequate preparation from the learner side was also noticeable. Teaching is a knack that everybody is not gifted with, so many tutors are not so effective in an online mode. In countries like India, where there is a huge shortage of technology savvy tutors, this model of learning would not work out. Lack of infrastructure and resources in the rural parts of these countries is an obstacle for teachers for a complete preparation of imparting the knowledge. An unavailability of dedicated online platforms is posing a threat for outcome based education. The tutors are adjusting the platforms with the video telephony platforms. If the problem of pandemic persists, there is a need for creating dedicated learn-ing platforms.",

The mortality has reduced to 58% due to less traffic on roads in the USA. Less roadkill reduces the ecological imbalances. Some animals have successfully adapted to live alongside humans and their survival is dependent on them. An absence of human activity endangers some wildlife species. Some governments mobilize funds to feed and preserve these animals, and the lockdown hindered their progress.

All these practices are hindered during the pandemic. Entire paradigm shift was seen in the religious fraternity. The religious holidays and celebrations were practiced at home. The key moments of rituals were experienced in their own home. Religious leaders were bound to ask their followers to stay at home during pandemics. They started releasing double the amount of messages for the community to cope up with the stress during the pandemic. The religious organizations started doing more charita-ble services. People started living with faith rather than religious places. Social distancing would be the most tricky in places of worship. The survey concludes that the public has become comfortable staying at home and practising their faith till the resumption of the normal situation [74] .",

There was an increased interest ever recorded in search of prayer as per the daily data recorded from Google for 95 countries. According to Tearfund COVID19 Prayer Public Omnibus Research [76] conducted in the UK during the lockdown period gauged the responses to spiritual practices. The statistics was conducted on 2,101 UK adults aged 18+ and shows that nearly half (44%) of UK adults pray regularly and a quarter (24%) of UK adults attended online religious service during lockdown. One in twenty UK adults (5%) who attended religious service have never gone to church and Twothirds (66%) of UK adults agree that prayer changes the world. Generally, religion is more appealing to the older generation, but during the lockdown period the reli-gious revival was seen in younger ones.
