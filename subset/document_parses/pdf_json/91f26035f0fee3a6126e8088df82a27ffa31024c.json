Primary data were obtained from 400 respondents in four communities in Brong Ahafo and Greater Accra Regions of Ghana, using a structured questionnaire. Data were analysed by using STATA software version 15. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression were conducted on all independent variables and statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. e study identified the following as the most perceived frequently disposed nonfaecal matter into FS: sanitary pads and diapers (38.5%), fabrics/rags (23.2%), toilet rolls (20.8%), razor/shaving sticks (10.3%), and others (7.2%). Gender, state of toilet facility (roof or unroofed), presence of container for collecting other types of waste in the toilet room, and state of container in toilet room either covered or uncovered were the factors found to be significantly associated with the disposal of solid waste (SW) into FS at 95% confidence level. e fear of exposing used sanitary materials for rituals, the use of fabric as an alternative to toilet rolls, and the desire to conceal aborted pregnancies from the public were some of the reasons alluded to the disposal acts. Education and awareness campaigns on proper SW disposal practices, appropriate use of toilet facilities, and the resource potentials of FS were found to be the best way forward to discourage indiscriminate disposal of SW into FS.",

Waste management in \"First Nations\" communities such as Garden Hill and Wasagamack in Canada has also become a problem, though Canada is ranked 24th among 178 countries on the Environmental Performance Index 2 [3] .

Sponges, bones, wood, textiles, plant seeds, stones, plastics, and sand are usually found in FS extracted from onsite facilities [10] . During their field trials in South Africa, Bakare et al. [11] also observed a large amount of household SW in the FS of their study population. Gudda et al. [12] disclose that latrines that serve as reservoirs for FS and the environment are now areas where SW is purposefully or randomly disposed in Kenya. Mourad's [13] report on sewer blockage in Australia during the most recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from the extensive cleaning with wet wipes, tissues, and paper towels due to the shortage of toilet rolls raises concern about people's indiscriminate disposal of SW into FS. In a most recent study of some communities in Accra, Ghana, an estimated 2.17 kg of SW per cesspit truck of FS (0.24 kg/m 3 ) was identified [5] .",

Mwiinga [15] absolutely blames the rise of indiscriminate disposal of SW on defective attitudes, perceptions, and faulty evaluation of waste disposal issues. Some community dwellers have considered FS and SW as waste which are of no value at all; so, assume the practice of disposing SW into pit latrines which exclusively serve as containment for FS as an acceptable practice. As such, disposing other equally unwanted materials into them should be suitable. Yet, the effect of dumping SW into FS has been well documented to include the shortening of the fillup rates of latrines [8, 9, 16] , the frequent blockage of sewers, and thus dents' community sanitation. e design specifications of the FS treatment plant highly hinge on FS variability and so must depend on the local characteristics of the FS to include the presence of SW in the sludge [17] . is aids appropriate and accurate design to resolve treatment challenges [18] . Quality of treatment is significantly affected by the screening efficiency of the plant [19] ; thus, the presence of all kinds of SW in FS can render its treatment problematic as most treatment plants may not have design specifications to deal with these kinds of waste. e prevention of SW accumulation in FS is therefore paramount.",

High percentage of plastic proportion of domestic waste can pose high exposure to waste accumulation in FS. Although waste bins were mainly used to store domestic waste, their sizes were perceived by the respondents to be too small to contain the volumes of waste generated and as a result, respondent mostly found waste scattered around bins [4] . An estimated distance of more than 500 metres between the waste dump site and households does not only project a high risk of deposition of domestic waste along the path to the dump sites but into latrines and other obscure places closer to them as most respondents for this study estimated the distance from their houses to the waste dump sites as far.",

However, other researchers also opined that waste disposed into the FS is as a result of the toilet rooms without bins inside or lids covering the bins if they were provided and not necessarily the absence of roofing. ese bins without lids in the toilet facilities also present a high risk of deposition of SW into the FS and therefore pose a significant nuisance which discourages the use of toilet facilities, especially when shared with others [4, 22, 23] .",

Although there was a significant difference in the patronage of public toilets/latrines without bins among community members as confirmed by Obeng et al. [23] , Ghana has about 85% of households relying on communal latrines and open defaecation. It also had the highest population that depends on shared toilet facilities. Most toilet rooms were found unclean [24] because users do not take up the duty to clean up [9] and therefore pose a high risk of accumulation of sanitary waste into FS. ey rather expect city authorities to be responsible for cleaning since they alleged paying for the maintenance of the facility as enshrined in the pay-per-visit tariff policy. According to Oduro-Kwarteng and Pieter van Dijk [2] , users will be unwilling to pay for using the facility when they presume that the services rendered are of poor quality. e act of burying, burning, and dumping of waste into bushes, pits, or domestic waste bins among community members is popular modes of disposing sanitary waste other than the normal practice of disposing them into bins provided or supposed to be available inside the toilet rooms. Sanitary pads and used diapers were the most frequently disposed waste into FS [24] and pose a significant risk of increasing SW accumulation in FS, in addition to are fabrics, razors, toilet rolls, and foetus. Other reasons that could be attributed to the disposal of solid waste into FS other than the ones mentioned by Murphy [24] are the perception that children and scavengers were safe when razors, syringes, and others are deposited into FS instead of bins.",

He added that the toilet rolls crises resulting from their extensive use in the period of the pandemic in Australia also saw wipes, tissues, and towels viewed flushable but not all such materials have similar properties like the toilet rolls to be flushed into toilet facilities since they do not easily break down and therefore block sewers. He further explained that the disposal of SW into toilet facilities was as a result of behavioural induced factors and so advised that make-up wipes, cleaning wipes, cigarette butts, cotton buds, nappies, sanitary pads, condoms, dental floss, left-over medication, and hair should never be flushed down the toilet.",

Respondents also identified the possible tendencies of the contraction of diseases from the usage of toilet facilities laden with SW as one of the challenges SW poses when disposed into FS. ey also submit that the cleanliness of the toilet facilities is as important as the safety of those places, not necessarily because of the ease cleanliness it may provide, but also because the protection it will give against diseases.

Efforts to keep them clean were left to city/community authorities since people held the view that they pay for the usage of the facility and so the maintenance of the facilities must be the responsibility of the authorities. Sanitary pads, diapers, fabric, toilet roll, and condoms, among others, were alleged to be the kinds of waste mainly disposed into FS. Gender, state of toilet facility (roof or unroofed), presence of waste bins in the toilet room, and state of container in toilet room either covered or uncovered were the factors found to be significantly associated with the disposed of SW into FS. e fear of exposing one's used sanitary materials for rituals and the use of fabric as an alternative to toilet rolls were some of the reasons alluded for the inconsiderate disposal acts. Although disposal into FS may sometimes be accidental or spontaneous as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, this not only results from the reasons above but also hinges on the erroneous perception that FS is itself waste (unwanted) and so it is usual to dispose unwanted items into it.",
