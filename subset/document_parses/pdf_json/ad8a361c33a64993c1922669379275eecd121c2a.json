This behaviour is known as a deterministic chaos and its investigation attracted many researcher during last few decades. Chaotic behaviour exists in many natural systems and disciplines, as for instance, meteorology, sociology, economics, engineering, ecology, chemistry, medicine, including covid-19 pandemic crisis management, and so on. One of the most popular chaotic system is a Lorenz oscillator.",

The Lorenz attractor was named according to Edward Norton Lorenz, who derived it from the simplified equations of convection rolls arising in the equations of the atmosphere in 1963. He for the first time used the term \"butterfly effect\" in his lecture named \"Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?\" presented on December 29, 1972, at the conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In chaos theory it means sensitive dependence on initial conditions and parameters. Small variations of initial condition or parameters of a dynamical system may produce large variations in the long term behaviour of the system. The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the atmosphere that may ultimately alter the path of a tornado or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in a certain location. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale alterations of events.",

Here we considered the fractional-order modifications of these type systems by illustrative examples. Moreover, for the first time a new general form of the fractional-order Lorenz-type system (3.5) was presented as well. New general form defined in this paper covers not only known systems and bridges between them but even conjugate systems [24] also know as hyperbolic system [3] , when parameter \u03c4 = 1 in (3.5). Some other Lorenz-type systems, which are not considered in this article are also particular cases of the general form (3.5), defined in this paper, as for example, Sprott systems (a few of 19 examples in [23] ), Li system [9] , Pehlivan-Uyaro\u01e7lu system [17] , model for El-Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon [5] as well as a whole zoo of systems from the Lorenz-type family (several of 150 examples described in [16] ).",
