[7] [8] [9] Pandemic fatigue with the PHSMs refers to a waning motivation to follow some recommended protective behaviours against infection, which can be driven by various underlying psychosocial and practical factors. 10 Intense PHSMs applied during the pandemic resulted in high social and economic costs and posed a serious threat to the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to the reduced compliance to the measures in the public. Modelling studies suggested that population compliance to social distancing measures might substantially affect the effectiveness in control of the spread of COVID-19, 11 ",

The biggest epidemic wave starting from late November 2020 in Hong Kong was originated from clusters of cases linked to several dance clubs. 14 Similar intense PHSMs were implemented over the epidemic waves alternating with periods of relaxation. We have been conducting population-based surveys to investigate the psycho-behaviour patterns in Hong Kong population in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It provided us with an opportunity to investigate the phenomenon of pandemic fatigue and its potential association with COVID-19 transmission with the data collected from the two consecutive outbreaks in June-July and November-December 2020.",

In the surveys included in the analysis, participants (\u22641%) who answered 'don't know' or 'refuse to answer' in the questions about their behaviour in response to COVID-19 were included into the denominator for calculation of the adherence percentages (online supplemental appendix table S2).",

In response to the surges of cases, the government introduced a package of PHSMs which seemed to have suppressed the transmission of COVID-19 with broadly similar physical distancing interventions across the epidemic waves (online supplemental appendix table S1). The PHSMs applied in Hong Kong included suspending schools, restricting public gathering, requiring restaurants to operate at reduced capacity and for shorter hours, closing bars, nightclubs and karaoke centres, allowing civil servants to WFH, mandating mask-wearing in public areas and so on. The daily reported case numbers had returned to a low level within 2-3 months since the earliest surge of cases in each epidemic wave ( figure 1A) . In Hong Kong, all laboratoryconfirmed cases were isolated until recovery (defined by two consecutive negative PCR tests and/or positive IgG antibody titre), and their close contacts were traced and placed in designated quarantine facilities for 14 days after their last exposure to the confirmed case. 17 In total we interviewed 31 332 participants in the 40 surveys (online supplemental appendix table S3) after Percentages indicate weighted proportions of respondents who adopted the specific behaviour to prevent contracting COVID-19 in the past week. Starting from May, questions about hand hygiene practice were specifically asked for immediate actions after certain behaviours, such as going outside and touching common objects. The shaded areas in Panels B and C indicate the time periods selected for analysis of the survey data in the June-July wave (blue) and the November-December wave (red).",
