            "text": "A key characteristic of the spread of infectious diseases is their ability to use efficient transmission paths within contact graphs. This enables the pathogen to maximise infection rates and spread within a target population. In this work, we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within human-contact networks (proximity graphs). Experimental results of disease spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease spreading. However to stop disease spreading, contact tracing requires both significant visibility (at least 60%) into the proximity graph and the ability to place half of the population under isolation. We find that pro-actively isolating super-links -key proximity encountershas significant benefits -targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on 35% visibility into the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak. It turns out that isolating super-spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less effective than targeting super-links. We highlight the important role of topology in epidemic outbreaks. We argue that proactive innoculation of a population by disabling super-links and super-spreaders may have an important complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a sophisticated public-health response to epidemic outbreaks.",

            "text": "Early work modeled outbreaks of infectious diseases as a randomised stochastic process where every possible contact between an infected and a susceptible individual was equally likely [26, 27, 47] . These models assume a disease transmission network that is modeled by an Erd\u00f6s-Renyi graph [18] , which is mathematically interesting but does not model real-world contact patterns accurately. In real networks, the infection chain may consist of individuals who are likely to be pairwise acquainted. In the case of a respiratory disease like Covid-19, for successful transmission, two individuals must be in contact that is sufficiently close enough to enable the transmission of the respiratory disease [19] . Thus it is likely that many successful transmissions involve pairwise acquaintances rather than contact between random individuals. In other words, while the random contact model is a good first approximation, in real networks the path-lengths are likely to be a lot smaller leading to faster disease transmission than modeled previously. This is known as the 'small-world' concept and it was first popularised in the context of social networks by the sociologist Stanley Milgram in 1967 [37] . Indeed existing epidemiology models use the reproduction number R 0 parameter as central component of their framework. R 0 represents the average number of infections caused by an infected person, and is assumed to be distributed according to a Normal distribution (assuming a purely random contact contact pattern).",

Epidemiologists and medical practitioners expend much effort in tracking down people who were in the proximity of an infected person, followed by isolating them, and testing them. Techniques such as proactive screening of the population and testing random samples for pathogens all require significant effort. Additionally, these measures are said to work best when dealing with local clusters of infection. In particular, they don't scale to protect large populations especially against a virus like SARS-CoV-2 that has a significant incubation period of 7 days [2] . When diseases start spreading over networks of interpersonal contacts, responders can rapidly lose control of the situation. In the absence of appropriate interventions the numbers of infections and deaths rapidly increase and responders may be left with no other option but to isolate the entire population (lockdown). Aside from the severe economic and social repercussions, a lockdown does not stop the disease as transmission resumes soon after the suspension is lifted. As such social lockdowns are a one-off emergency measure that cannot be repeatedly applied due to the volatility they induce within human societies.",

The intuition is that a small number of key individuals are believed to play a major role in disease transmission. Indeed many countries have successfully disrupted the spread of HIV/AIDS by targeting sex workers [41] . In contrast the efforts to contain Covid-19 have been largely restricted to the deployment of contact tracing combined with testing and isolation [11, 3, 24, 50, 21, 51, 48] . As an disease response strategy this is fairly \"leaky\" -even if a fraction of contacts remain untraced or unknown, then the disease continues to spread picking up pace soon after. As such \"leakages\" are hard to detect and expensive to contain. To automate contact tracing, apps based on pseudonymous Bluetooth beacons are at a stage of early deployment in many countries. However they require at least 60% of the population to adopt it in order to gain control of the disease. Current reports [16] indicate the adoption rates to be in the range of between 12% to 40%, crucially limiting the efficacy of a targeted strategy based on contact-tracing. There are a number of example contact tracing applications, for example bluetrace [3] and [11] .",

Is it possible, for example, to slow down or entirely stop the spread of an epidemic by pro-actively isolating (or quarantining) key individuals who play a vital role in disease spreading due to their positionality in the contact network. Is it possible that a low vertex-order node who has contacts within different groups of people who may otherwise have no contact with each other should be encouraged to self-isolate? There is loose precedent in epidemiology literature which discusses the concept of super-spreaders defined as high vertex-order nodes play a disproportionate role in disease spreading. However such nodes may simply be individuals with essential roles such as a bus driver or a nurse, who happen to interact with a large number of people within a short span of time. We answer key research questions: Is it possible to identify key individuals that must pro-actively self-isolate using the contact graph alone? Is it possible to identify such individuals even at low rates of app adoption? and, how to achieve this in a privacy-preserving manner, moving away from extremes such as undertaking pan-societal lockdown measures.",

As one possible definition, super-spreaders are high vertex-order (high degree) nodes that influence disease propagation due to the numbers of susceptible individuals they interact with. Vertex-order nodes [40] are special nodes that owing to their position in the network topology broker large amounts of proximity encounters. The risk of fully visible transmission chains is significantly higher in a topology where hubs only connect to other hubs, and are responsible for a majority of the network's proximity encounters. If disease responders can locate and strategically target individuals that play the role of a hub (super-spreaders) or host a weaktie, then the percentage of transmission chains that start and end within the subset of contact-tracing app users can be significant. This property is known as assortativity [39] , defined as the affinity of a node to link to others that are similar or different in some way. Vertex-order super-spreaders: In a centralised approach, vertex order is computed by adding up the number of neighbours for each node. To estimate vertex-order in the decentralised case, we use long random walks. A long random walk of length O(Log d N) steps where d is the average degree and N = |V | is the population size is used to compute the degree distribution on the proximity graph. The stationary distribution of a proximity graph is its degree distribution. A random walk that is long enough (O(LogN)) to achieve stationarity, results in a probability distribution over the nodes of the graph which is also its degree distribution. Thus detecting vertex-order super-spreaders in a decentralised manner is the same as computing the result of a long random walk over a distributed graph. We provide a concrete privacy-preserving mechanism for this task in Section 4.",

            "text": "A complimentary approach is to isolate proximity links (graph edge) between certain individuals that play an important role in transmission. Super-links [25] are edges or proximity links that are responsible for significantly reducing average path-lengths in networks of tightly knit communities such as social networks. This is important in the context of community transmission of an infectious disease. Super-links inter-connect dense clusters of nodes. Consequently disabling a super-link seems a natural defense against disease spreading, yet this has not been investigated before. Better still, disabling a set of k links (a k cut) by preventing those people from getting in close proximity partitions the graph and stops the spread of the disease with high probability. Here's why. Consider a k-cut that partitions a graph into several components of similar size. The likelihood of a node on the tour belonging to the same partition as the predecessor node is denoted by p, so with 1 \u2212 p the next node on the tour could belong to a different partition. The likelihood of a tour comprising all m nodes from the same partition is then given by f p ( j, m) where j is the number of consecutive infected nodes already in the same partition is defined as: f p ( j, m) = p f p ( j + 1, m). As m increases, lim m f p (0, m) \u2192 0 for 0 < p < 1. As a concrete example, for p = 0.5, the likelihood of a 15-step transmission chain not traversing a mincut, is less than 1 per 65 per million transmission chains (regardless of graph size), decreasing to almost zero per million transmission chains of 20 steps. Having established that any path taken by the pathogen will include at least one edge of the mincut, with probability close to 1, what does that mean for spreading efficiency? The public-health responder can leverage this understanding to construct a highly effective intervention strategy that maximises her utility regardless of the spreading dynamics -to block all transmission paths by placing monitoring or quarantine orders to disable transmission along every edge of the k-mincut. Further, the k-mincut presents a theoretical limit on the number of disjoint transmission chains available to the pathogen, as any chain must involve at least one edge from the mincut. Note that this includes paths that are not shortest paths between a pair of consecutive nodes on the proximity graph.",

Thus the output of Botgrep is various graph subsets with different mixing characteristics.

A number of protocols for set intersection have been proposed most of the efficient designs [5, 22, 28, 29, 32, 10] are proposed in the semi-honest model. Notable among these is the Cristofaro-Tsudik scheme where compute time scales linearly in the number of elements. Some progress has also been made in developing schemes that work with weakly-malicious adversaries [45] but these are up to three times slower. We propose the use of a protocol that has a linear runtime cost and linear communication cost in the number of elements in the two sets; i.e., both runtime and communication costs are O(|V i | + |V j |) [43] .

Thus a single step of disease spreading would take approx. 20 000 seconds to compute.

We consider the following strategies in our study: null response -where the responder does nothing, contact tracing -a widely used strategy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, super-spreader suppression, and super-link suppression.

This process repeats until there are no more susceptible individuals. In each round, we measure the transmission potential to measure the extent of disease spread within the network. It is worth noting that the full propagation network is available to the pathogen for disease spreading, i.e only the responder has partial visibility whereas the disease spreads on the full topology. Dataset: We use real world contact traces from the Brightkite social-proximity network. This consists of 58228 nodes and 214078 edges. An edge between two nodes indicates a social link. In Brightkite, an edge between individuals is created when they interact with each other at least ten times. Studies find a close link between the existence of social links and proximity encounters [8] , specifically a substantial social link greatly increases the chances of a proximity encounter. Specifically, we know that human proximity encounters exhibit structural patterns owing to the influence of social relationships and geographical constraints. We therefore selected a location-based online social networks to study the dynamics of disease spreading in response to public-health interventions.",

On the graph, node isolation is implemented by removing all its edges from the graph topology. These nodes form the set of infected but non-infectious nodes. Since the isolation budget is spent upfront, there is no isolation capacity available for demand arising from secondary infections.

Our results indicate that topology has some influence on the ability to stop a disease outbreak. Our work may pave the way for developing efficient strategies for increasing resilience against an epidemic within a given population. As it turns out, contact tracing is useful but it is possible to do much better -while contract tracing only works reasonably well once the visibility is greater than 60%, super-link detection is as effective as contact tracing at just 10% visibility. This is a significant improvement making graph-based approaches practical. Collaboration at many scales: Our experiments show that it is possible for multiple entities to safely collaborate in defending populations against an epidemic, and in the presence of partial observations. These entities can be as small as individuals (micro-collaboration); or, a regional or national health agency (macro-collaboration); and, still work with each other (mixed-collaboration). However, several practical issues remain. For best results, macrocollaborations are likely to lead to better outcomes over micro-or mixed-collaborations due to the economics of distributed disease propagation analysis. This is because a regional or national health agency working together may result in a better overall perspective whereas the threshold of the number of individuals working together will be relatively higher and the one-off costs involved will result in inefficiencies.

Aside from economics, the security assumption of semi-honest adversaries lends support to macro-scale collaborations where such assumptions can be codified into a legally enforceable contract. This is necessary since the encrypted random-walk data may reveal sensitive information or violate privacy of individuals. Application and containment: The ability to quickly identify infections via a comprehensive testing regime is a pre-requisite for a successful intervention via graph-based approaches including super-link isolation. Our technique can be seen as a sophisticated version of its fat-fingered cousin, the full social lockdown [14] -instead of disabling all proximity encounters, it is enough to disable a carefully selected fraction as part of a targeted intervention. It is likely that such a step would be more socially sustainable as opposed to a full social lockdown. It is also important to note that to be effective, super-link isolation must be applied pre-emptively before the onset of a wave of infections (outbreak). Our intervention approach is symptom agnostic -it does not consider whether the person has symptoms or has been in the proximity of an infected individual. We can see that activities, such as opinion diffusion and more generally all diffusion processes will also be slowed or stopped by our techniques. We believe that super-link detection needs to be combined with appropriate testing to identify initial sources of infection. A wholesale application of the technique in the absence of an appropriate testing regime would be wholly undesirable and counterproductive. Super-Link isolation is not an societal inoculation strategy nor is it a universal safeguard or defense against the spread of epidemics. It is at best a carefully chosen strategy as part of a broader public-health response. To read more into it would be unsupported by scientific evidence. Limits of conventional epidemiological approaches: A fundamental challenge within current epidemiological models [17, 19] of disease transmission is the assumption that R 0 , the mean infections per individual is estimated by a normal distribution. However, real-world contact graphs have a skewed distribution such as a power-law distribution [8] , since social links influence proximity as well as random chance. Consequently, using R 0 to drive a disease mitigation strategy can result in significant errors. Removing a high vertex-order node might appear as a good strategy to reduce R 0 , however a low vertex-order node may play a bigger role in disease spreading due to its ability to connect multiple clusters.",

The upper bound of the probability that a transmission chain (random walk) of length t goes through t A nodes of A is given by Gilbert [23] : Pr[t I = t] \u2264 1 + (1\u2212\u03c0(I))\u03b5 10 e \u2212t (1\u2212\u03c0(I)) 2 \u03b5 20 . However, given that this probability exponentially decreases with increase in t, a small increase in the length of the transmission chain will negate the benefits of the contact tracing intervention. As t increases the probability that a transmission chain is fully visible to responders decreases exponentially with the length of the chain. The length of the chain is primarily a function of the incubation period which is approx. 7 days [2] , offering a significant window of opportunity for the disease to spread. Therefore we argue that contact tracing is a fairly leaky process which while helpful in slowing down the spread of the disease can by no means prevent its spread, as empirically demonstrated by our experiments.",

This highlights the need for a more efficient method for controlling the spread of a virus without enforcing a 100% lockdown. Research in the field recognises this, with a large focus being on contact tracing mechanisms [11, 3, 24, 50, 21, 51, 48] . Likewise, some have pursued graph based modeling for justifying contact tracing [19, 17] . This work builds on these contributions, to develop novel non-pharmaceutical techniques based on isolating super-links and mitigating the need for a nationwide lockdown. The use of centrality measures to stop disease propagation has been investigated before. Lee et al. [34] were the first to point out the existence of super-spreaders. They showed that graph centrality metrics can be used to define super-spreading locations that result in the greatest numbers of infections. They identify super-spreading cities based on the metrics of degree, closeness, and betweenness. Instead of nodes at the level of cities, our focus is on edges at the level of individuals. Specifically, we find that the isolation of high-conductance elements within a disease propagation network efficiently prevents an epidemic outbreak, whereas the isolation of super-spreaders is sub-optimal.",

They suggest an alternative method to this by making use of EGP graphs. This removes the key player nodes, which will be a smaller number, and this has the impact of a reduction of immunization dosages, as the key player nodes, creating clusters of localised groups. These localised groups are not longer connected due to the removal of the key player node, which means lesser dosages of immunizations are required as the virus may not spread to the same extent of not removing key nodes.",

That is, if there are individual clusters on the node, which are separated, and only one cluster is infected, then it's not possible for the other uninfected clusters to become infected as there's no edge (interaction) for the infection to travel across. In this paper, they offer an alternative method of identifying the spreaders in a graph by using an algorithm which is robust and able to identify the key spreaders who would cause connectedness in clusters.
