The beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil is uncertain due to the low number of tests done in the country. The excess number of deaths can suggest the beginning of the pandemic in this context. In this article, we used an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to investigate possible excesses in the number of deaths processed by the S\u00e3o Paulo Autopsy Service according to different causes of deaths: all-cause, cardiovascular, and pulmonary causes. We calculated the expected number of deaths using data from 2019 to 2020 (n=17,011), and investigated different seasonal patterns using harmonic dynamic regression with Fourier terms with residuals modeled by an ARIMA method. We did not find any abnormalities in the predicted number of deaths and the real values in the first months of 2020. We found an increase in the number of deaths only by March 20, 2020, right after the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, which occurred on March 16, 2020.",

The first reported case of the new coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, was in early December in Wuhan, China (2) , and as of August 11, 2020 , the disease has killed more than 732,000 people and infected almost 20 million worldwide (1) . As of December 3, 2020, Brazil was the second country with most deaths and infections due to COVID-19 with more than 3 million reported cases and 101,049 deaths, only behind the United States of America that has almost 5 million reported cases and 161,547 deaths (1). The first death by COVID-19 in Brazil occurred in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo on March 16, 2020. Most initial cases of COVID-19 in western countries were of individuals returning from China (3) and Italy (4), but many countries still have an issue for establishing when the first case of local transmission occurred. This is a consequence of many problems; one of them is the existence of a fraction of asymptomatic individuals (due to mild or lack of symptoms) that facilitated the dissemination of the coronavirus before its detection by the health system (5) , combined with insufficient testing, which limited the capacity to count the number of infections and, consequently, establish the real timeline of the coronavirus infection. On the other hand, the excess mortality rate can provide valuable information about the dynamics of the pandemic (6) . Recently, this approach was used in several studies. Li et al. established that a great number of infections in China happened long before social restrictions and control policies took place, revealing a large number of undocumented cases (5) . Also, Delatorre et al. (7) confirmed such findings for multiple countries, including the USA, UK, and Italy. For Brazil, they found that COVID-19 was already circulating in the Brazilian population in early February (between January 31st and February 7th), 2020.",

One of them is the auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The ARIMA model, or Box-Jenkins model, was developed in 1976 by George Box and Gwilym Jenkins, who introduced the concept of transforming nonstationary data into stationary (8) . Data is considered stationary when its parameters, mean and variance, do not depend on time (i.e., are constant throughout time) (9) . The transformation introduced by Box and Jenkins is called seasonal differencing and consists of computing the differences between consecutive observations.",

The algorithm uses a stepwise search to transverse the solution space to find the optimal p and q parameters. This step consists of searching for the best model defined by the lowest AICc among the simple ARIMA models and making variations to the best model until no lower AICc can be found. To perform the residual analysis, checking if the model had adequately captured all the information in the data and can be used for prediction, we visually checked for correlations in the residuals using autocorrelation plots (ACF) and partial autocorrelation plots (PCF).",

In S\u00e3o Paulo, the health crisis due to the pandemic started around the end of April, when the ICU hospitalization rate for COVID-19 reached 67% and the number of deaths due to the virus reached 1,124 confirmed cases and 1,603 suspected cases (19) . Therefore, we did not expect to find an excess in the number of deaths for the all-cause mortality related to the pandemic. InfoGripe, a system from Fundac\u00b8\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz that monitors cases of hospitalization and presents alert levels for cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Brazil, recorded a ten-fold increase in the historical average of hospitalizations on April 31, 2020 (20) , that is, after the notification of the first case in Brazil on February 25, 2020. Because of that, we expected to find possible abnormalities or excess deaths due to pulmonary causes, especially for pneumonia and SARS. Nevertheless, for pneumonia, we only found an excess in the number of deaths on March 15th (1 more than expected) and March 20th (5 more than expected), the latter being the last day of our daily time-series and when the city of S\u00e3o Paulo started to apply public policies to contain the pandemic because of the first death on the 17th of March. The increase above the forecasted confidence intervals matched the overall health crisis that started in S\u00e3o Paulo, with social distancing policies being enforced to prevent more infections. Furthermore, we found an excess of deaths on the same dates due to respiratory disease, mainly driven by pneumonia. Finally, for coronary artery disease death cases, we found a few days with an excess in the predicted number of deaths by our model, but they lacked a constant increasing pattern that could be related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Second, due to the context of the pandemic, many autopsy protocols suffered changes to reduce contamination risks. In S\u00e3o Paulo, the first official resolution by the Mayor's office of the City of S\u00e3o Paulo took place on March 20, 2020 (23) , establishing rules for the investigation of death cases including indirect and verbal autopsy procedures for suspected cases and expansion in the use of less invasive tools. It is worth mentioning that due to this resolution the SPAS stopped the conventional autopsy procedure on March 21, 2020.
