The presentation of the following clinical case highlights how the overlap between this clinical entity and mood disorders leads to characteristic psychopathology, which has not been sufficiently detailed. In particular, the delusions, which always starts from the idea of reference and the shame in the face of the judgment of others, takes on characteristics of guilt during the depressive phases and persecutory themes during the activation phases. This clinical observation, which obviously needs to be confirmed on a larger scale, encourages a renewed interest in the concept of Kretschmer's Sensitive Delusion of Reference and creates the possibility of intersecting multiple psychopathological levels, for a more complete perspective on the individual case.",

            "text": "The Sensitive Delusion of Reference is a clinical entity described by Ernst Kretschmer in 1918 and never integrated into mainstream nosographic systems. It represents a paradigm of the continuity between personality and delusional outbreak within the historical debate between those who conceive psychosis to be a process or a development in Jaspersian terms (1) (2) (3) . In fact, those who understand psychosis as a process underline its discontinuity with the person's temperament and previous life events. They argue that psychosis is an organic morbid entity that at a certain point in life creates a gap, which makes psychotic experiences incomprehensible to the observer. On the contrary, understanding psychosis as a development means appreciating its continuity with the personality prior to the onset of the disorder, and understanding delusions as the end result of a vulnerable constitution, and as an entity understandable in the light of the life history of the patient (4, 5) . Kretschmer, in describing these particular types of paranoid delusions, offers a prototype of this second position: the Sensitive Delusion of Reference is presented as the understandable development of psychotic symptoms starting from a personality with specific characteristics, triggered by a key event and often occurring in a particular social milieu (1) .",

Other nosographic systems would allow diagnoses that are more similar to those described by Kretschmer. For example, the diagnosis of Psychogenic Paranoid Psychosis (code: F23) is described in the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (7) . In fact, in this case, although there is no reflection on the personality characteristics that would make the development of psychotic reactions easier, the psychogenic and reactive origin of psychotic episodes is nevertheless conceived. Although, the RdoC project does not produce an autonomous and alternative nosographic system in respect to the classifications already discussed, it nevertheless represents an important opportunity for the integration, which is fundamental in the study of complex cases (8) .",

The environmental trigger seemed to have been a failed university course exam, after which the patient reported that he gradually developed the feeling that everyone was aware of his failure, and that they judged him for it. The extreme interpersonal sensitivity reached delusional characteristics during this period, structuring a real delusion of reference with persecutory aspects. C.M. described an experience of blame and shame, which he felt around him when he met people on the street, but also by what he saw on television or read in books. Ideas of guilt grew and worsened by the conviction that others could \"read his mind\" and therefore were aware of countless reasons to blame him. At that time, he reported the presence of derogatory auditory hallucinations blaming him. The episode, which lasted several months, resulted in a delay in achieving his degree, and then it resolved spontaneously and progressively without him seeing a psychiatrist. Although the episode was not accompanied by the execution of psychometric scales since the patient did not go to a psychiatrist, the characteristics of the episode satisfies the criteria for severe Major Depressive Episodes with Psychotic Characteristics, from the evaluation of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Clinician Version (SCID-5-CV) regarding previous episodes (12) . Later, he described a period of increased energy, busyness, decreased need for sleep, and increased selfesteem, during which the patient enrolled in the faculty of political science, wanting to obtain a second degree.

The thoughts and behavioral disorganization were however worsening, configuring a picture of severe psychotic anxiety, with emergent suicidal ideation. Finally, it was decided to discontinue clomipramine and continue only with haloperidol therapy up to 6 mg. After a few days, we witnessed the remission of the most evident psychotic symptoms, with the persistence of persecutory ideas and guilt, lived at the time in an ego-syntonic and at times in an ego-dystonic way. C.M. was gradually less anxious, less restless, and less dominated by intrusive thoughts.",

The mood seemed to improve both subjectively and objectively, in the absence of delusional ideation. The obsessive thoughts appeared less pervasive (although the interpersonal sensitivity and fleeting ideas of reference remained), the patient appeared to be less guarded with the medical staff. He was then discharged from our ward with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Episodes with Psychotic Behavior and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. We however suggested that the patient be admitted in a rehabilitation ward, in order to consolidate the achieved results. The patient accepted the suggestion. The patient follow up continued on an outpatient basis by psychiatric services, showing good compliance with the therapy and no further acute episodes at the one-year followup. Once the psychopathological compensation was reached and the acuity resolved, the patient was again subjected to personality assessment tests. The SCID-PD confirmed the diagnosis of avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, and paranoid personality disorder (20) . The patient was also subjected to further psychometric scales, such as the short version of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125) (21), Magical Ideation Scale (MIS) (22, 23) , Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) (24) , and Hypomanic personality scale (HPS) (25) .",

C.M. has always shown a prevalently depressive polarity, with experiences of inadequacy and marked interpersonal sensitivity also conveyed by his personality characteristics. However, it is possible to highlight in his history some characteristics of oscillation and cyclicality. In fact, while the major episodes with psychotic characteristics show environmental triggers, other mood alterations do not show such a clear correlation with life events. The case of C.M. clearly shows how the overlap between the sensitive personality and mood disorder gives rise to mixed pictures, which are difficult to categorize according to the DSM-5 nosography (6). In fact, in the intercritical phases, the aspects of interpersonal sensitivity and delusional interpretation prevail and then turn into experiences of guilt in the depressive phases and into experiences of persecution in the activated phases (1, 11, 36) . In this case, the use of clomipramine seems to activate the patient, generating a picture of anxiety, restlessness, and disorganization, which went into remission only after the antidepressant therapy was stopped and the antipsychotic therapy increased. With regard to obsessive symptoms on the other hand, the fluctuating adhesion to the delusion of reference in the coexistence of anancastic personality Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org characteristics as also confirmed by the SCID-PD, is expressed in characteristics similar to an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. The mood-dependent component of obsessive manifestations would make us think more of obsessive symptoms secondary to mood alteration (37, 38) .",
