Genetically similar strains have also been reported from other mammals, which reveals their wide host distribution. The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate the occurrence and genetic diversity of MRVs in bats in Slovenia, from samples obtained throughout the country in 2008 to 2010, and in 2012 and to investigate the occurrence of the novel SI-MRV01 MRV variant in Slovenian bats. Results: The detection of MRVs in bat guano was based on broad-range RT-PCR and specific bat MRV real-time RT-PCR. Subsequently, MRV isolates were obtained from cell culture propagation, with detailed molecular characterisation through whole-genome sequencing. Overall, bat MRVs were detected in 1.9% to 3.8% of bats in 2008, 2009 and 2012. However, in 2010 the prevalence was 33.0%, which defined an outbreak of the single SI-MRV01 strain. Here, we report on the identification of five MRV isolates of different serotypes that are designated as SI-MRV02, SI-MRV03, SI-MRV04, SI-MRV05 and SI-MRV06. There is high genetic variability between these characterised isolates, with evident genome reassortment seen across their genome segments. Conclusions: In conclusion, we have confirmed the presence of the SI-MRV01 strain in a Slovenian bat population. Moreover, according to genetic characterisation of S1 genome segment, all three MRV serotypes were present in the bat population. In this study, five independent MRV isolates were obtained and detailed whole genome analysis revealed high diversity between them.

This might at least partially explain the enzootic properties of the novel MRV, as well as its zoonotic potential. Most of the MRV-positive guano samples were recorded in 2010. Moreover, all of the positives from 2010 shared 99% nucleotide identity for the partial L3 genome segment with the isolate SI-MRV01, and no scores other than isolate SI-MRV01 were obtained. This was relatively surprising for us, in terms of one year that stands out so evidently for MRV positives. This one year of high prevalence can be explained as a probable outbreak of the SI-MRV01-like isolate among the bat populations. According to our data, the outbreak was not limited to one sampling location nor to one bat species, as in 2010, positive samples were detected for eight out of 17 sampling sites across Slovenia. However, this prediction of a single-strain outbreak was based on the partial L3 genome segment analysis, which does not guarantee identical strains in all of these positive bat species. As shown in previous studies [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , and as also confirmed in the present study, MRVs are genetically diverse, with frequent reassortments that can result in different strain variants. Thus, this one-segment comparison between these strains might not reflect the same situation for the genome similarity in other genome segments. The E. serotinus, was evidently the species that was most frequently infected with MRVs, followed by M. daubentonii, and M. myotis. Based on age, gender and lactation status, the most MRV-prevalent bat group was lactating females, with 13.5% showing positive samples, which represented 7.1% of all of the female bats included. On the contrary, the other female groups (i.e., adults, juveniles) had lower prevalence of MRV RNA, with no positives in the gestating females. The group of lactating female bats was also the largest group, as it represented approximately 50% of all of the tested female bats, and was more than the adult and juvenile male bats combined. The relative high prevalence in these lactating female bats might be due to the grouping of the lactating females in nurseries, where contact transmission of the virus might be more frequent. In the population of male bats, the most prevalent group was adult bats (10.1% MRV RNA prevalence).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 211, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1271, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1276, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1281, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1286, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1291, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In total five independent virus isolates were obtained from different bat species.

The bats were sampled mostly in the last gravidity phase of female bats and in the time, when juveniles were old enough to feed by themselves. This periods differ among bat species, for example at the end of June the juveniles of M. myotis were quite grown-up, but the females of R. hipposideros were only in a phase of delivery. The bats were classified by bat biologists from Centre for Cartography Fauna and Flora, Slovenia according to species, gender, age, gravidity and lactation status, and typed morphological criteria. The bat biologist determined bat species exclusively based on morphologic criteria (without biopsy and genetic classification) [18] . Bats age was estimated based on bats weight, ulnar length and colour of the fur [21] . Altogether, there were 68 sampling sites that were distributed throughout all 8 Slovenian regions (Osrednjeslovenska, Gorenjska, Gori\u0161ka, Primorska, Dolenjska, Savinjska, Podravska, Pomurska), with 18 bat species identified.
