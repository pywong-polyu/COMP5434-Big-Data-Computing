An indicator for malaria suspected cases with malaria test (MSCT) is proposed to measure the rate of testing on persons presenting to health facilities who satisfy the definition of a suspected malaria case. This metric does not rely on prior knowledge of fever prevalence, seasonality, or external denominators, and can be used to compare detection rates in suspected cases within and between countries, including across settings with different levels of transmission.",

Data was collected from 9 countries: Belize, Colombia (in areas with active transmission), Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama (September-March 2020). A sample of eligible medical records for 2018 was selected from a sample of health facilities in each country.

PCD encompasses the detection of malaria cases in people who seek care, usually with symptoms, from health providers or community health workers [1, 2] . The key challenge when an ill person presents to a health facility is determining whether they meet the criteria of a suspected malaria case and if a malaria test should be performed [2] . Medical staff first need to think of malaria and then determine if the clinical and epidemiological characteristics meet the case definition for malaria suspicion [2] . Malaria detection is the trigger for case investigations and active case detection [2] . In low transmission settings, misdiagnoses due to a lack of malaria suspicion have been shown to increase the risk of complications and death [3] and are also a potential route for re-introduction of imported cases [4] .",

For effective malaria surveillance, it is necessary to ensure that providers at all health facilities in the country suspect malaria when a case is presented [2] . The annual blood examination rate (ABER) has been used traditionally in areas with seasonal transmission [1, 8] . In theory, the ABER reflects the proportion of the at-risk population who met the case definition for malaria suspicion and were tested. The ABER considers screening the entire population of a malaria area, and blood examination of all fever cases and any other cases suspicious of having malaria. Passive and active case detection activities were considered adequate by the World Health Organization (WHO) if the proportion of blood slides examined during the previous 12 months reached a threshold [9] . Initially, if this rate exceeded 10%, case detection would be quantitatively adequate in all cases-currently, a specific threshold is not recommended [1] . In areas with seasonal transmission or with other epidemiological conditions, an ABER of 3-5% could be adequate, especially when determining criteria for discontinuation of spraying operations or for planning the number of microscopists needed [9] . However, the ABER has limitations: tests performed do not necessarily imply testing was conducted on suspected malaria cases-if a testing target is set, it could create perverse incentives to overreport; ABER has to be risk-adjusted for malaria transmission and population size, which complicates subnational comparisons; its interpretation relies on the assumption or knowledge of the baseline febrile illness for a given population and its seasonal variations, and it does not account for changes in the burden of other febrile illnesses. A more accurate metric reflecting how well patients are managed in health facilities is needed [10] .",

Fever is the most common clinical manifestation of malaria, especially in lowtransmission settings [3, 10, 13, 14] . Hence, presenting to health facilities with current fever or recent fever history was an initial consideration for malaria suspicion [1, 2] . Fever history is essential to account for the usual progression of the disease with intermittent symptoms [15] as well as the intake of fever-reducing medications. Nevertheless, febrile illness is not specific to malaria; many other conditions have a similar clinical presentation. In addition to fever, sweating and chills are other symptoms that complete the typical triad for malaria, especially for P. vivax [16] .",

The risk of infection is mostly related to malaria transmission status in a particular area [1] . In areas without active malaria transmission, the malaria risk is almost exclusively related to travel from areas with active transmission. In most countries, municipal-level malaria risk stratification was conducted by the RMEI partnership considering the number of malaria cases, receptivity (mosquito presence), and vulnerability (population movement). In Costa Rica, Belize, and El Salvador, locality-level stratification was conducted, and health facilities classified according to the highest strata found in the catchment area. Municipalities were grouped into four strata: stratum 1, not receptive and not vulnerable; stratum 2, receptive but not vulnerable; stratum 3, receptive and vulnerable without autochthonous cases in the past three years; and stratum 4, active transmission. For strata 1-3, to account for malaria risk, the suspected case definition required travel history to stratum 4 or residence in stratum 4 (either subnationally or internationally) in addition to fever in the suspected case definition. In strata 4, patients presenting with fever alone merit malaria suspicion. Nevertheless, if someone in strata 1-3 presents with fever, sweating, and chills, malaria should also be suspected.",

Although cases of mixed infections are not uncommon, in many circumstances, the clinician's judgment is needed to decide whether a malaria test is carried out. This exclusion ensures that the suspected case definition focuses on cases where a malaria test should have been performed without a doubt. Similar approaches have been recommended for settings with low endemicity [17] .

A list of all public health facilities in the country was obtained to select the sample of health facilities. In the sample, facilities in strata 3 and 4 were prioritized to represent areas at higher risk for malaria transmission, and facilities with testing capacity were over-represented to collect data for other indicators, due to sample size limitations. An initial random sample was obtained from facilities that provide primary care services for malaria. For each selected primary health facility, the associated ancillary units from the reporting chain (notification units, laboratories, referral hospitals) was included up to a fixed sample size defined to balance budget considerations with statistical power for analysis. In El Salvador, which has been free of transmission for over three years, strata 1 and 2 were also selected (stratum 1 facilities were referral hospitals for facilities in other strata). Upon elimination, providers in health facilities are expected to take over suspicion and detection of malaria cases in all areas [2] . From each primary health facility or hospital, a sample of medical records was selected. Depending on the facility's record-keeping system, a different sampling frame was used to select medical records: (1) if a book of fever cases or a complaint logbook was available, a systematic procedure was used to select records from the measurement timeframe, which included the possibility of selection for all suspected malaria cases in the calendar year of 2018 (this was the preferred sampling procedure); (2) if an electronic list of discharge records was available (usually with ICD-10 codes), a random sample from a predefined list of eligible diagnoses was selected for the measurement timeframe; (3) if a book with presumptive or final medical diagnoses was available, a systematic procedure was used to select cases from a predefined list of eligible diagnoses within the measurement timeframe. The list of diagnoses used to select records for each sampling frame are described in Additional file 1: Annex S1. If no sampling frame was available, a random sample of medical records was reviewed to find any fever encounters within the timeframe. If a medical record could not be found, it was replaced with another eligible record from a preselected list of substitutes. In all cases, the procedure entailed reviewing the medical record to check if exclusion criteria due to febrile illness with defined aetiology were present according to the suspected malaria case definition. Each of these ineligible records was replaced with an alternate record selected to a back-up randomly selected sample to ensure completion of the total quota for medical record reviews in each facility. In some primary care facilities, field personnel found an inadequate number of eligible attentions from the year 2018 to meet the quota, and all eligible cases from 2018 were reviewed. For medical records selected from presumptive diagnoses or discharge records, the procedure also entailed confirming the fever diagnosis when the target diagnosis did not necessarily imply fever (unless the health facility was in stratum 4 for signs and symptoms without febrile illness). The medical record selection process is summarized in Fig. 1 . ",

The study uncovered important challenges in healthcare provision and PCD that could hinder progress in these countries towards malaria elimination.",

            "text": "From a methodological perspective, the SMCT indicator offers several advantages for malaria elimination settings. First, the sampling process does not require prior knowledge of fever prevalence, malaria seasonality, or external denominators (such as population) [28] . The SMCT's numerator and denominator are self-contained in the medical record sample. The same metric can be used to compare PCD performance within and across countries, as granular as health facilities, and as aggregated as the sampling method allows. The interpretation of the resulting value is equivalent across different geographic units, levels of aggregation and time periods. Second, the suspected malaria case definition can be adapted to represent different operational guidelines or clinical protocols. Criteria may be adjusted to make the suspected malaria case definition more stringent or lenient depending on the testing strategy adopted. The combination of clinical and epidemiological criteria supports monitoring targeted testing efforts, instead of calculating detection efforts based on high-level estimates. Given that the results are based on actual observed cases, it is possible to make stakeholders accountable-health providers for suspecting malaria, regional managers for tracking supplies for tests, national decision-makers for planning adequate staffing, between others. While setting a target for ABER has been disputed, and a specific level is no longer recommended [1, 28] , it is possible to set a standard-based target for the SMCT indicator.",

The lack of registration of recent travel history in all countries, and place of residence in some countries, is troubling. Travel history is a significant indication of malaria risk for areas without active transmission [3, 29] . Although questions around travel history are part of malaria case investigation forms, these forms are only completed once a case is confirmed [2] . Assessing the travel history to screen fever cases is not only inexpensive compared to testing, but is also a relevant intervention for infectious disease surveillance in general. The lack of fever management processes, record-keeping, medical record management, and archiving practices adds complexity to the already demanding task of disease surveillance. Most of these issues have ramifications in the quality of care provided to patients beyond malaria and should be promptly addressed.",

For instance, it is not possible to determine if health providers inquired about travel history and did not record their findings, or if they did not inquire at all. The only way to confirm that processes are carried out systematically is by requiring documentation. In many situations, documentation is critical to determine the course of action, such as for case investigations and treatment failures. Studies have found that documentation increases adherence to clinical practices and improves outcomes [34, 35] . If data collection instruments are properly designed, data collection for the SMCT exposes problems with data quality, adherence to standard operating procedures, and record keeping. The resulting data can be used to adjust estimates and is a valuable input for healthcare quality improvement. The SMCT indicator, or its computational algorithm, should not substitute for clinical judgement. There are instances that merit malaria testing even if the suspected case definition is not met. Healthcare workers with experience are more likely to suspect from uncommon signs of disease [30] , and should have flexibility to suspect malaria even after a negative malaria test result [31] . Furthermore, to be effective, the country's malaria detection and diagnosis strategy must be strongly aligned with its case management and response strategy. Positive cases should receive prompt treatment and be rapidly investigated to trigger proactive case detection [11] . Considering that the sample represents areas and health facilities more likely to suspect and diagnose malaria, these findings underscore that strong surveillance, case management protocols, and guidelines are necessary but not sufficient. Ensuring guidelines are applied consistently by all health workers is crucial.",
