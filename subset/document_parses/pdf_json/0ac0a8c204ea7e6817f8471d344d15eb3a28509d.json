However, in response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, worldwide public health measures, such as social distancing, quarantine of affected communities, and limitation of population movements, have been proposed to reduce transmission [3] [4] [5] . Since healthcare facilities could be sources of contagion, hospitals were limiting visits from family and friends. Patients and families are facing distressing restrictions on their caring involvement due to contagious risk [6] . As a result, visitor restrictions have disrupted not only the connection among patients, their families, and health care professionals but also hindered the physician-patient/family face-to-face interaction, including family conferences. Goals-of-care discussions for COVID-19 and other serious illnesses have become more difficult because family members often cannot witness how ill patients have become, and physicians cannot easily communicate with multiple family members at Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 10801 2 of 12 the same time [7, 8] . To overcome the ramification of strict visitor limitations, a virtual family conference via telehealth represents an attractive and safe alternative for avoiding person-to-person contact and exposure in a crowded hospital [9] .",

With tough decisions, there is an even greater imperative to engage patients and their families regarding care options, creating a unique role for shared decision making (SDM) when conducting family conferences [10] . SDM, as incorporating individual values into best evidence practice to achieve an informed decision, gradually becomes center stage in health care as a cornerstone of person-centered care [11] [12] [13] . Family members of patients with acute or chronic illness as main caregivers often experience significant psychological distress that needs compassionate professionals to relieve the stress [14] . The existing evidence-based guidelines for family-centered care have suggested that physicians should use structured approaches, such as the \"VALUE\" approach (Value family statements, Acknowledge emotions, Listen, Understand the patient as a person, and Elicit questions) [15] . This communication strategy was validated by a multicenter randomized trial, in which physicians employed the VALUE approach for family conferences and had significantly reduced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety among family members at 90 days after the patients' death [16] . Furthermore, Zulman et al. also proposed an evidence-based framework-\"PLACE\" (Prepare with intention, Listen intently and completely, Agree on what matters most, Connect with the patient's story, Explore emotional cues) to foster physician presence and connection in clinical care that could also be used during the family conference [17] . Active listening, expressions of empathy, and making supportive statements around decision-making can facilitate physician-patient/family relationships [18, 19] .",

As family conferences transition from in-person to virtual context, questions emerge about whether it will impede the meaningful physicianpatient/family relationship due to lack of direct human contact during difficult discussions [26] [27] [28] . Our team had conducted a pilot study using smartphone-enabled telehealth to provide family conferences and effectively reaching a consensus on end-of-life care goals [29] . Nevertheless, virtual physician-family interaction, especially with emotion recognition and response, remains unclear [30, 31] .

The hospital set a restriction on family visits and allowed only one caregiver for each patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. Target participants were patients aged 20 years or older in the National Taiwan University Hospital inpatient and outpatient units. Family conferences were conducted if patients or their families required a medical update of prognosis, an open line to discuss the goal of care or a potential discharge plan during the study period. Consenting patients aged \u226520 years were eligible to enroll if they required a telehealth-based family conference. Those who declined to conduct virtual conferences or did not possess the technical skills to participate were excluded. We have conducted a pilot observational study using SDM concepts and VALUE approach in smartphone-enabled telehealth-based family conferences, and the result was highly satisfactory, especially in reaching a consensus on care decisions [29] . Physicians were trained to use the structured and templated SDM framework combining the VALUE and PLACE approach to share information and foster human connectedness in virtual family conferences ( Figure 1 ). Guidelines for conducting family conferences [12, 36, 37] and original researches on the VALUE [16] and PLACE [17] concepts were provided as supplement education. Group discussions and training seminars were held at the start of the study to reinforce physicians' practice skills. The family conferences were held by a medical team consisting of physicians specializing in family medicine and palliative care, clinical psychologist, and nurses. The prospective design allowed our study group to follow up on the participants' experiences over time.",

The communication goals of the conferences, the attending health care professionals, family members, and the duration of the conference were collected as baseline demographic data. For descriptive findings, data based on categorical variables were presented as percentages, while those based on continuous variables as mean with standard deviation (SD). The records of the communication process in the conference for analysis were under the themes of the VALUE approach, which included two main domains: 1. the patient and family's emotional cues, and 2. the physician's response and empathetic statement. The emotion cues from the patient and family were recorded based on consensus after the literature review and experts' discussion [38] . The emotional state of the patient and family included three categories: verbal emotional distress (i.e., expressions of anger, guilt, sadness, frustration, other), nonverbal emotional distress (i.e., crying, frowning, elevated tone of voice, other), or positive emotion (i.e., smiling, laughing, other). As for the physician's response, we employed the VALUE approach [16] to identify and classify the empathetic statements made by the physician. The empathy shown by the physicians and the emotional cues of the patient and family members were assessed and recorded by handwritten notes during the conference by all joining medical team members. The research assistant, who is also a clinical psychologist, was responsible for the integration of every member assessment after the conference, and the draft of these observations was thoroughly reviewed by all healthcare professionals to reach a consensus. Identifiable information was removed after the verification of records by medical teams to ensure the anonymity and privacy of the participants. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS INC, Chicago, IL, USA).",

The questions were \"How well did the medical team answer your questions about your loved one's illness and treatment?\", \"How well did the medical team listen to what you had to say?\", \"How well did the medical team ask about the kinds of treatments your loved one would want if s/he could speak for him/herself?\", \"How well did the medical team help your family decide about the treatments your loved one would want?\", \"Overall, how would you rate the medical team's communication with you during the conference?\", \"How well did this conference help you understand the choices and decisions that may need to be made?\", and \"Overall, how well did this conference meet your needs?\". The scoring system was a 10-point Likert scale, from \"strongly disagree\" [1] to \"strongly agree\" [10] . The Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, which is a measure of internal consistency reliability for measures with dichotomous choices, were used to assess this new measure.

As the observation of participants' behavior in the study, expression of emotional distress by family members is not an uncommon occurrence, which was consistent with other groups' findings [2, 38] . Ideally, family conferences should provide a setting where distress and emotion can be openly discussed and safely supported by skillful and experienced physicians. Our family conference model suggests that empathetic communication can be mediated by using the VALUE approach and PLACE emotional work. Emotional work refers to physicians' emotional engagement with the families and the content of the family conference [2] . While it was not possible to offer tissues or a comforting hand on the shoulder through telehealth, verbally acknowledging the emotion and expressing empathy (such as \"It is normal for family members to worry that the patient is in pain or gasping.\") can be an effective substitute to ensure the family felt heard and their emotions were validated. A previous study shows that when physicians catch the emotion cue and respond appropriately, the conversation progresses and is deepened, which enables physicians to learn new information about the family's fears and worries [43] . Empathy not only builds the physician-family relationship [44] but also helps physicians understand the patient and family's values. Apart from emotional distress, we also found some family members express some positive emotions, such as smiling and happily waving towards the camera. This reflects that not only distressing emotions but also joys and comforts the family can experience in the telehealth family conference.",

It includes ways to convey empathy across the screen by paying attention to the physician's appearance on the screen, remaining visually attentive, and exaggerating facial expression, body language, and verbal responses at times [18, 46] . In the study, the medical team used nonverbal gestures, such as nodding, leaning forward, and optimizing eye contact by looking directly at the camera to enhance the \"video presence\" and show signs of active listening.

Further study on a larger scale is required to learn if the intervention is sufficiently robust to implement in various settings. Secondly, we did not videotape the conference. Some subtle behavioral interaction information might be missing. In future studies, video recording should be considered. Thirdly, we only had short-term patient and family reported outcomes as satisfaction analysis. The willingness to participate in our virtual family conferences may add bias to the result of satisfaction surveys, which may lead to an overestimation of the level of satisfaction [58] . To obtain a fuller understanding of the implementation of telehealth with the VALUE approach and PLACE emotional work, the long-term impact on patient clinical management and family bereavement requires follow-up investigation. Lastly, the study lacked face-to-face family conferences as a comparison because of the strict visitor restriction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies assessing the effectiveness of the model in comparison with face-to-face contact are warranted.",

            "text": "It is of paramount importance to maintain person-centered care under the tremendous impacts of global COVID-19 pandemics. The modern technology of telehealth offered the opportunities to deliver good doctor-patient communication even under the strict infection control measures as restrictions of face-to-face interviews. However, the anxiety of the general public under threats of the pandemic and the burnout of medical professionals in the health care system may manifest as emotional exhaustion and disengagement during clinical encounters. Our study demonstrated that the telehealth family conference based on the 3-talk SDM model with the integration of the VALUE approach and PLACE emotional work is satisfying to the patients and family. With the help of the VALUE approach, we can better understand the patient as a person and elicit questions from the family members. Understanding the patient and family's values allowed physicians to provide care that was aligned with the patient's preference and thereby build a trusting relationship [59] . Communication skills that are applicable to face-to-face can be applied to telehealth as well. The model offered practical guidance for health care professionals in virtual family conferences to establish sound communication and rapport. The model could be adopted worldwide to improve the quality of care when using telehealth, not only during the COVID-19 pandemic but also for future care. Furthermore, the model had implications for the governments to adopt the policy on encouraging telehealth for medical care, and the evidence might help stakeholders to broaden the reimbursement of the payment for telehealth in the medical insurance system.
