The outer surface of medical masks may become contaminated while used, and as such, may create a fomite that facilitates contagion at the time of removal. 8 Considering that only 5 of the analyzed patients had COVID-19, it is probable that other viruses could be causing the patient's symptoms. One of our patients touched his face 80 times during his stay in the unit, while another adjusted the face mask 31 times.

Importantly, it is used alongside other PPE, which may protect infected droplets from entering the eyes. 7 Also, HCPs are probably better trained at doffing PPE and may have a smaller risk of hand contamination. Thus, we wonder whether the benefits of patients wearing face masks while awaiting medical attention outweigh the risks and reinforce the need for adequate hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, especially in high-risk areas.",
