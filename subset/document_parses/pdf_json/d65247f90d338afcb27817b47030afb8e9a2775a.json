The aim of this study was to identify new signaling pathways and repolarize macrophages by selected protein kinase inhibitors. HL-60 derived macrophages were chosen as model cells and human blood macrophages were used for comparison. M1 and M2 polarization of HL60 derived and human blood macrophages was promoted by LPS \u00fe IFN\u03b3 (LIF) and IL-4 treatments, respectively. In HL-60 derived macrophages, M1 polarization was mediated by Erk1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, while HSP27 phosphorylation was involved in M2 polarization. The inhibition of both MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways reduced the expression of NOS2, IP-10 and TNF\u03b1, IL-8 production was decreased by the inhibition of AMPK and PKD, the upstream kinase of HSP27. HSP27 phosphorylation was inhibited by NB 142, a PKD inhibitor. The expression of CD80 (M1 marker) was reduced by MAPK and JAK/STAT inhibitors, without increasing CD206 (M2 marker). On the other hand, CD206 was reduced by PKD and AMPK inhibitors, without increasing CD80 marker. Phagocytic capacity of HL-60 derived macrophages was higher in M1 macrophages and decreased by trametinib and a p38 inhibitor, while in human blood macrophages, where AT 9283, a JAK/STAT inhibitor also caused a significant decrease in M1 polarized macrophages, no difference was observed between M1 and M2 macrophages. Our results suggest that the repolarization of macrophages cannot be achieved by inhibiting their signaling pathways; nevertheless, the expression of certain polarization markers was decreased, therefore a \"depolarization\" could be observed both in M1 and M2 polarized cells. Selected protein kinase inhibitors of M1 polarization, decreasing NOS 2 and inflammatory cytokines may be potential candidates for therapeutical trials against inflammatory diseases.",

These factors regulate the transcription of various genes and the produced proteins are responsible for the different properties of classical M1 and alternative M2 type macrophages. In previous studies several components of the M1 and M2 polarizing signaling pathways were described. In the case of M1 polarization, receptors for Escherichia Coli LPS, IFN\u03b3 and GM-CSF were involved in ligand binding and the main signaling route is mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway (JAK 1/2 and STAT 1-3). In the case of M2 polarization, IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines are bound to their surface receptors, and the effects are mediated by other components of the JAK/ STAT pathway (JAK 1/2/3 and STAT6) [Lawrence and Natoli, 2011; Tugal et al., 2013] . More recently, the role of other signaling pathways has also been observed, including the PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis [Vergadi et al., 2017] , Notch [Lin et al., 2018] , and MAPK pathways [Cheng et al., 2018] .",

The signaling routes of Fc-dependent phagocytosis was described in detail [Garcia-Garcia and Rosales 2002] , but less data were available about complement-dependent phagocytic processes. According to an earlier review, Fc-dependent phagocytosis is related to proinflammatory processes, while complement-mediated phagocytosis is non-inflammatory [Aderem 2003 ]. Signaling routes include the role of integrins, Rho associated kinase (ROCK) and actin polymerization [Dupuy and Caron, 2008; Rosales and Uribe-Querol, 2017] . PI3K is also involved both in FcR and complement receptor (CR)-dependent phagocytosis, contributing to a Ca 2\u00fe -signaling [Nunes and Demaurex 2010] .

            "text": "The purpose of our study was to find kinase inhibitors to modify the polarization and function of macrophages, in order to influence inflammatory processes. We tried to detect new alternative signaling pathway(s) in macrophage polarization and to use various protein kinase inhibitors to change their polarization. HL-60 cell line was chosen as a suitable model, because it can be differentiated into macrophages by phorbol esters [Harris and Ralph, 1985 Aihara et al., 1991] , and polarized by cytokines. Specific kinase inhibitors, added during the differentiation/polarization process, may help to study the role of various signaling pathways in the polarization. As a first orientation step, a protein kinase and a cytokine array were used to detect simultaneous differences in the phosphorylation and cytokine patterns, using M1 and M2 specific cytokines respectively) . Based on these results, the occurrence of several M1-M2 polarization markers was examined both in the presence and absence of various kinase inhibitors, which can influence the previously detected signaling routes. We have also applied an alternative terminology for macrophages, using M LIF for macrophages treated with LPS \u00fe IFN\u03b3 and M IL4 for macrophages treated with IL-4. This idea was based on a recent publication discussing the problems of the M1-M2 treatment-marker correlations [Hoffman and Ponik, 2020] .",

Demonstration of macrophage character and morphological properties of PMA-differentiated HL-60 and human blood-derived macrophages. a: CD11b and CD-68 monocyte-macrophage markers were investigated by immunocytochemistry, using anti-CD11b anti-CD68 monoclonal primary antibodies and Northern Light 493 secondary antibody (green). Cell nuclei are counter-stained with DRAQ5 (blue). HL-60 derived cells: the expression of CD11b in PMA-treated HL-60 derived macrophages was much higher than in non-treated cells. Each PMA-treated cell population expresses CD68 and CD11b, but CD68 is localized intracellularly, while CD11b is mainly membrane-bound. Cell clusters and dendritic extensions were observed mainly in LPS \u00fe IFN\u03b3-treated (LIF) samples. Human blood macrophages: untreated cells, IL-4 (M2 polarized) and LPS \u00fe IFN\u03b3 (LIF, M1 polarized) treated cells all express CD68 marker (red). In this experiment, we used Northern Light 557 secondary antibody. b: Flow cytometric analysis of CD11b and CD68 in the plasma membrane of HL-60 cells and HL-60 derived macrophages. PI staining was used to exclude dead cells from the presented results, viable (PI negative) cells were marked with green color. Expression of CD11b (red) and CD68 (blue) were not detectable in non-treated HL-60 cells, compared to background control (w/o primary antibody) cells (gray). Morphological alteration of PMA treated HL-60 cells compared to their controls was clearly detectable on dot plots (cells marked with green). PMA treatment also induces expression of CD11b, however, elevated expression of CD68 was not detectable, compared to PMA-treated control cells (gray). Therefore, flow cytometry supports the different localization of CD11b and CD68 markers. IL-4 and LIF treatment did not cause any significant differences compared to PMA-treated controls.

            "text": "In this manuscript we studied a hypothesis if specific protein kinase inhibitors can modify the macrophage polarization by blocking signaling pathways mediating the polarizing effects. According to the previous studies, the opposite polarization by LPS \u00fe IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 are mediated by the JAK-STAT pathways, involving the phosphorylation of STAT 1, 2, 3 by JAK1/2 in M1 and STAT6 by JAK2/3 in M2 polarization, respectively [Murray, 2017; Mills et al., 2000; Mantovani, 2006; Mantovani and Sica, 2012] . Our first orientation test with phosphorylation and cytokine arrays (Figure 4) suggested the more important role of MAPK and p38 pathways in HL-60 derived macrophages. The significant increase of the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and p38 kinases in LPS \u00fe IFN\u03b3 treated (M1) macrophages was accompanied by a concomitant augmentation of the production of inflammatory cytokines (IP-10, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2). Similar results were obtained in other recent investigations [Cheng et al., 2018 , Jimenez-Garcia et al., 2015 Yang et al., 2016; Trav es et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2019; Islam et al., 2018] , These results supported the involvement of the MAP-kinase pathway. Based on ELISA assays, the production of IP-10 and TNF\u03b1 was reduced by DEL (Erk1/2 inhibitor) and by trametinib (MEK1/2-inhibitor). In addition, the level of TNF\u03b1 has also been reduced by the p38-15i inhibitor, and AT9283, a JAK inhibitor (Figure 7) . These findings suggest the involvement of both the MAP-kinase and the \"canonical\" JAK-STAT pathways in the M1 polarization of HL-60 cell-derived macrophages. This suggestion was supported by the decreasing effect of AT 9283, a JAK inhibitor, on the phosphorylation of STAT3 (Figure 4c ). The predominant role of MAPK pathway together with NF-\u03baB in PMA-differentiated HL-60 derived macrophages has been described recently, based on cytokine patterns, in HL-60 cells [Islam et al., 2018] . The inflammatory cytokine pattern of human blood derived macrophages was similar, but somewhat different: while TNF\u03b1 was significantly higher in M1 polarized cells compared to M2 macrophages, and p38-15i and AT significantly decreased it, IP-10 was not different in M1 and M2 polarized cells and was not reduced by the tested inhibitors.",

More recently, similar observations were published: NO is responsible for the \"break\" in the mitochondrial TCA cycle and citrate accumulation in M1 polarization, while the lack of NO can maintain substantial levels of OCR and TCA cycle intermediates [Palmieri et al., 2020a] . Moreover, the pentose phosphate pathway, activated in M1 polarization, can provide NADPH for NOS, while NO and its derivatives cause damages of the components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain [Liu et al., 2021] . It was demonstrated earlier, that NO has dual regulatory effects on iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 cells. When the local concentration of NO is low in the early stages of inflammation, iNOS expression increases. High concentration of NO has the opposite effect, downregulating the proinflammatory response of macrophages. The biphasic activity of NO can facilitate both the initiation of a defense response against pathogenic stimuli and the termination of this response decreasing tissue damage [Connelly et al., 2001] .",

The involvement of CREB in the mediation of the prostaglandin E 2 effect in M2 polarization has been described recently in various species [Luan et al., 2015; Montero et al., 2016] , but only sporadic data are available about the role of HSP27 in M2 polarization [Laudanski et al., 2007] . Since HSP27 is phosphorylated by protein kinase D, the inhibition of the latter may lead to a polarization shift from M2 to M1. The production of IL-8 is higher in M IL4 macrophages, as shown by the cytokine array ( Figure 4b ) and reduced by NB 142 PKD inhibitor in M2 polarized cells. The involvement of HSP27 phosphorylation has also been supported by a cell based ELISA test. Dorsomorphine (an AMPK inhibitor) also reduced the production of IL-8 in IL-4 polarized cells ( Figure 8) ; these data support the possible role of PKD and AMPK in M2 polarization [Sag et al., 2008; . Moreover, IL-8 level has been increased in M1 cells treated with the inhibitors of MAPK pathway (DEL and trametinib), suggesting a partial shift to M2 polarization. Similar results were obtained in human blood macrophages, where dorsomorphine reduced the IL-8 production.",

            "text": "The purpose of our studies was to modify the macrophage polarization with kinase inhibitors, influencing their signaling pathways. The repolarization of M2 macrophages would play an essential role in anti-cancer therapy (TAMs are M2 polarized cells [van Dalen et al., 2019; Mantovani et al., 2006] ). Other authors could promote M2 polarization, which may be important to attenuate acute inflammations [Labonte et al., 2014; Tran et al., 2015] or to counteract the pro-inflammatory effects leading to obesity and Type 2 diabetes . Nitric oxide regulates a metabolic reprogramming in M1 macrophages: NO not only impairs the mitochondrial respiratory system, but also blocks aconitase and pyruvate dehydrogenase directing the metabolism to glycolytic pathway, causing a shortage in TCA cycle metabolites. In this case, the anaplerosis of the cycle is dependent on glutaminolysis. On the other hand, this Warburg effect analogous process cannot be observed in NOS deficient macrophages (Palmieri et al., 2020b) . A more complex metabolism was described in tumor associated macrophages: NO blocks oxidative phosphorylation causing a higher rate of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway. This causes a cytotoxic effect of NO and ROS on the target tumor cells. However, in M2 polarization, which is characteristic of TAMs, the arginase pathway is predominant, resulted in the production of polyamines, which may be responsible for tumor proliferation together with an anti-inflammatory response [Nath and Kashfi, 2020] . Although TAMs are considered as M2 macrophages, their glycolytic rate is as high as M1 macrophages, which may be associated with angiogenesis and metastasis in certain tumors [Diskin and P\u00e5lsson-McDermott, 2019] . Nevertheless, only sporadic data are available about the trials of selective protein kinase inhibitors to modify the macrophage polarization [Chaudhuri, 2014; De Vries et al., 2019 . The involvement of the changes in p38-MAPK pathway (including Erk and p38) caused by the SARS-Cov2 infection in Vero 6 cells has recently been published [Bouhaddou et al., 2020] . Therefore, the inhibition of the production of inflammatory cytokines by protein kinase inhibitors may serve as a strategy against the cytokine storm (a suspected etiological factor in the fatal outcome of Covid-19 infections and other inflammatory processes). Nevertheless, this hypothesis requires further experimental studies.",
