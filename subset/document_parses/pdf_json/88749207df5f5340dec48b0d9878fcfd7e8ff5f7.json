The civil aviation industry has suffered especially severe consequences from the pandemic due to intense travel regulations and the restriction of intercontinental air travel, which is essential to curb disease transmission (Hon, 2013; Khan et al., 2009) . Therefore, to improve public health and mitigate the risk of infection brought by international air travel, appropriate travel policies are necessary to address these challenges (Burkle, 2006) . While China has successfully controlled COVID-19 domestically and prevented imported cases in March 2020 due to the implementation of stringent preventive and restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, strict requirements on mask-wearing, flight rerouting, and reductions in air service, the pandemic is likely to continue into the foreseeable future since global herd immunity and widespread vaccination has not yet established. In order to develop sound mid-and long-term strategies for the aviation industry to gradually restore global air service while maintaining the safety of international travel, the China aviation authority has implemented a series of new interventional strategies since June 2020.",

            "text": "For example, a policy named \"circuit breaker\" was implemented by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) on June 4, 2020. The policy mandates that all international passengers who arrive in China must be tested for the coronavirus upon border entry. If five or more passengers on the same flight tested positive, that airline shall be suspended for one week. If ten or more passengers on the same flight tested positive, the suspension increases to four weeks. 1 Shortly after, on July 20, 2020, CAAC, together with the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), jointly issued a new policy that required all international passengers (including both foreign visitors and returning Chinese citizens) to present negative COVID-19 Nucleic Acid test results (hereinafter referred to as \"negative NAT\") before boarding flights to China. The required negative NAT must be conducted within five days of embarkation at facilities designated or recognized by Chinese embassies in host countries (MFA, 2020a) . In order to further reduce cross-border transmission of COVID-19, a more stringent policy known as the \"double negative tests\" was implemented on November 7, 2020. This policy requires all Chinese and foreign passengers flying to China to take both nucleic acid, IgM anti-body tests and apply for green health codes or certified health declaration forms within 48 hours before boarding the flight. 2 While these policies have been widely reported and discussed, it remains unclear to what extent these response strategies are effective in terms of curbing the imported COVID-19 risk. In addition, although there is an increasing amount of literature that have attempted to examing the influence of COVID-19 on the aviation demand and risk performance (Tanr\u0131verdi et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021) , there is still a lack of empirical understanding on the performance and dynamics of various implemented countermeasure strategies.",

Specifically, our study has the following research contributions. Firstly, using the detailed epidemiologic survey data of 996 imported COVID-19 cases that arrived at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport and the corresponding inbound flight performance data for the period of May 1 -Nov 30, 2020, we provide an in-depth empirical assessment on the effectiveness of the three aviation interventional policies including the \"circuit breaker\" policy, the \"negative NAT\", and the \"double negative tests\" requirement. Secondly, using non-recursive structural equation modeling (SEM), the causal relationship between each of the three policies and imported cases was carefully examined with the latent variable of flight availability. Thirdly, mediation analysis was conducted through decomposing direct and indirect effects to evaluate the extent to which key external factors have led to the surge of positive cases. Hence, the implication provide important evidence for aviation sectors to develop more effective strategies to improve their resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Recent studies have revealed that airborne pathology through the inflight transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can lead to a secondary infection in long-term international flights if no preventive measures are taken. For instance, Khanh et al. (2020) suggested that various mediums within the cabin, such as \"aerosols\" and \"droplets\" lingering on hard surfaces, and activity, as well as seat adjacency, can all be spreading agents. Similarly, Choi et al. (2020) found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted through long international air travel through gene sequencing of the patients and crew members.",

In contrast, modern civil aviation capacity has substantially compressed travel time and made intercontinental flight duration a fraction of the incubation period of diseases (Budd et al., 2009) . This being said, before an asymptomatic case be identified to self-sequester or take other preventative measures (i.e., additional testing), a person may have already infected others with COVID-19. This is why identifying asymptomatic passengers and pre-symptomatic passengers (i.e., contagious infections before symptom onset) (Yu and Yang, 2020; He et al., 2020) in a timely manner is vital if no enhanced screening strategies but NAT testing are implemented. Until herd immunity can be established via widespread worldwide vaccination, we must continue to work on innovative and effective strategies to control the spreading of the virus and facilitate the recovery of the global aviation industry.",

Unlike the first wave, Italy experienced a more minor increase than other EU countries (e.g., France, Germany, UK, and Spain) in numbers by the end of September. Bontempi (2020) explained that this was due to the effective response of the Italian central government in terms of promoting suitable measures and regulations for individual protection and mobility. More importantly, Italy avoided a premature relaxation of travel interventions, which was found to be particularly effective in limiting the spread of the virus (Kraemer et al., 2020 (USCDC, 2007) , and a \"full pandemic control\" (e.g., strict quarantine, testing, and contact tracing) (Czerny et al., 2020; Matrajt and Leung, 2020) . 5 The second wave of covid-19 has sent much of Europe back into lockdown.",

Due to the implementation of these regulations, aviation services declined by 71% between December 2019 and April 2020 (Abu-Rayash and Dincer, 2020). In addition, using empirical data of Newfoundland and Labrador, Linka et al. (2020) reveal that if international air travel were fully restored, a new case would enter these two provinces every other day. Their research further suggests that international air travel restrictions should not be relaxed too hastily without proper control measures being implemented, such as implementing swifter enforcement of quarantine and epidemic tracking. In the US, several initiatives have been implemented since February 2020 to prevent the importation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In particular, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched entry screening at designated airports targeted at passengers from certain high-risk countries (USCDC, 2021) . For instance, since March 11, 2020, non-US citizen travelers from the Schengen Area, China and Iran were prohibited from border entry. 6 Shortly after its implementation, the list of bans was expanded to United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and Brazil. Furthermore, since March 19, a Level 4 Global Health Travel Advisory was implemented in the US to further curb the demand for international travel. 7 However, the effectiveness of these strategies has been questioned by various scholars. For instance, Sun et al. (2020) found that though international travel has mainly been restricted, the US still became one of the most critical nodal countries in May 2020 in terms of domestic air travel, given a surge of its domestic epidemics. Dollard et al. (2020) further revealed that although substantial health care resources were distributed for viral detection at US airports, the detection rate of COVID-19 cases per traveler screened was found to only be 1:85,000. Dollard et al. (2020) argued that the key factor causing this ineffectiveness of screening is the lack of targeted strategies to identify asymptomatic cases, as no specific clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 can be identified promptly during the incubation period (Quilty et al., 2020; Gostic et al., 2020) .",

By the end of May 2020, 1,084 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in Hong Kong, 70% of which had a history of international travel during the incubation period (Centre for Health Protection, 2020). Meanwhile, a series of measures such as strict border control and entry restrictions, mandatory quarantine, and contact tracing were implemented immediately after the outbreak by the local government agencies in Hong Kong. These strategies were found to be effective, as the number of COVID-19 cases from inbound travelers in Hong Kong declined significantly (Lam et al., 2020) .

In particular, the immediate restriction of international travel was found essential in slowing the speed of virus transmission from China to the rest of the world after the initial outbreak was detected in Wuhan (Chinazzi et al., 2020) . Thus, when COVID-19 importation risk began surging from February to April 2020, the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism on COVID-19 of China's State Council promptly reduced and adjusted international inbound flight services through a set of emergent policies, such as a suspension of flight services in phases (CAAC, 2020a), flight rerouting (CAAC, 2020b) and the \"Five One\" policy (CAAC, 2020c). Based on risk-index simulation on the importation cases using daily dynamic international air connectivity data from January to April of 2020, Zhang et al. (2020) showed that a strict restriction of inbound flights contributed to muting the case importation risk by half than the remaining status quo. In addition, Chen et al. (2021) revealed that the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism, including the implementations of a centralized quarantine and nucleic acid testing (NAT), flight service adjustment and border closure, effectively facilitated early identification of infected case. Specifically, the reduction of international flight service was found to contribute to a reduction of the mean intervals of diagnosis from arrival to lab confirmation by 0.44 days maximally.",

Next was the requirement for presenting the certificate of a negative result of the nucleic acid test (the \"negative NAT\") five days before boarding an inbound flight for China (CAAC, 2020d), and lastly was the requirement on presenting a certificate of dual negative results both in nucleic acid test and anti-body blood test (the \"double negative tests\") within 48 hours of boarding an inbound flight for China (MFA, 2020b).",

(2020) indicated that these \"outcome-based\" regulations would lead to a series of unfavorable consequences for airline operations due to the potential uncertainty of operational scheduling, interference in operations, and the correlated operational costs. These policies may also generate an equity issue for air travel demand, as the importation risk of COVID-19 through intercontinental transmission is out of airlines' control. Other scholars, such as Sun et al. (2020) argued that although the variation in air traffic flow may affect airlines' competitiveness, these strategies may slow the spread of the virus. In fact, as \"justified\" by CAAC, the \"circuit breaker\" policy is implemented together with incentive policies. According to MFA (2020a) , if the number of positive cases from each flight of a certain air route remains at zero for three consecutive weeks, the affiliated airlines are permitted to run one additional flight per week to the route as an award. 8 Compared to prior aviation policies implemented by CAAC, such as the \"Five-one,\" new measures emphasize on improving the accountability of coronavirus screening before boarding instead of after arrival. In this regard, the new measures comply with the latest Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan issued by the National Health Committee of China (NHC, 2020) . While an increasing number of studies have investigated air traffic interventional policies adopted by China, these new air travel interventional measures have been surprisingly absent from the current COVID-19 preventative policy impact assessment. Novel insights on safe and healthy travel are at the core of airlines' coping strategies in COVID-19 risk management (G\u00f6ssling, 2020) in the sense of survival and recovery. Therefore, in the following section, this paper will proceed into the central analytical construct in the effectiveness of these newly implemented air interventional policies.",

The motivation for using SEM for the analysis was due to the following considerations. Firstly there is a potential endogeneity issue between the positive inbound carrier and the interventional policies. On the one hand, there is likely to be an unobservable factor, which we call flight availability that may be influenced by the interventional policies. On the other hand, it may affect the positive inbound carrier. The ignorance of such an effect can cause covariance problems between predictors (such as the \"circuit breaker\" policies) and error terms. SEM can address any underidentification problems compared to the conventional OLS model (Acock, 2013) . This is because the influential/independent factors are examined through the built-in endogenous hypothetical correlations to the outcome/dependent variable, where sometimes appears on the right side of the equation (i.e., it's a \"cause\"), and sometimes it appears on the left side (i.e., it's an \"effect\"). This is how the term \"structural\" works as the causal dependencies embedded in the model (Bollen and Pearl, 2013) . Hence, SEM is a confirmatory rather than exploratory method because one variable on another is required to construct in terms of a system of unidirectional effects (Golob, 2003) . In addition, SEM can disaggregate direct (represented as an arrow in a path/flow diagram) and indirect effects (a set of paths/flows) and provides an estimate of both the indirect and direct interrelationships among multiple dependent and independent variables through mediation analysis (Gefen et al., 2000) . Since SEM is superior to other statistical analyses in terms of distinguishing the direct and indirect effects in an endogenous problem setting, this is the other key reason why it was adopted.",

To fill this gap, our assessment utilizes a non-recursive SEM, which estimates the reciprocal causal effects through feedback-loops (in which interaction exists between two variables with a correlated disturbance). Unlike recursive/conventional SEM in which all variables are going in the same direction, non-recursive SEM allows us to model reciprocal paths, which tends to provide a more robust and realistic estimation of the impact of aviation policy on the inbound cases control than conventional SEM. This is because a non-recursive SEM offers more flexibility in model specification to deal with complex problems than OLS-based models in which the parameters are easily identified but restrictive. Meanwhile, the consistent estimation of reciprocal paths requires quite strict assumptions to be met (Sturgis, 2018) . The detailed specification of the model was introduced in section 3.2.3.",

However, the synergistic combinations of the possibility of being exposed to the coronavirus of each passenger exist randomly and heterogeneously. Because personal health conditions are not predictable, we assume that the passengers who tested positive after arrival are associated with the transmission levels from where they departed from, which can be tracked from the daily cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases (Case) of the original country. Moreover, as proven by Hu et al. (2020) , individual economic wellbeing correlates with COVID-19 infection risk (more impoverished, higher incidence rate); because of this, we adopted GDP per capita (GDP_pc) of the original country from which the passenger departed as another external indicator. Thirdly, given that the importance of airport node and competition has been found to be inversely correlated with COVID-19 transmission control (Sun et al., 2020) , we assumed that the inbound flight frequency of each air route (Route) correlates with the inflow of coronavirus carriers indirectly through the availability of inbound flights. Lastly, flight service adjustment, in terms of three key policies (P1, P2 and P3), is considered to reflect management initiatives on airline risk and joint efforts for imported COVID-19 risk control, so we assume they directly correspond to flight supply and flight availability (Availability).",

As a direct result of interventional policies, the availability of international travel is severely affected by service reductions, increased airfare and testing requirements. To capture the linkages between interventional policies, together with other external conditions introduced in 3.2.1 and the number of positive cases found among inbound air passengers, this study considers international flight availability as an endogenous latent factor. Since the volume of inbound passengers is determined by flight availability (see 3.1), neglecting the importance of this latent linkage could lead to an endogeneity problem during estimation, in which the errors can be correlated with explanatory variables on the right-hand side of the model. In an SEM, a latent variable is processed in two steps. The first step is a measurement and the second step is a path estimation (Acock, 2013) . Availability can be measured through certain observable factors, such as travel time (Travel). These factors capture the length of the trip from the country of origin to Guangzhou. They also include the period when the initial NAT results are available upon arrival (Response), and the number of positive carriers (Positive) imported through international flights. In order to estimate how the latent availability affects the consequence of flight suspension meanwhile bridging with the external factors, hypothesis 3 was developed as follows.",

Therefore, we assume the delay in flight suspensions may impact the availability of international travel, which could further impact the number of positive carriers as a \"loop-effect\". Especially when the breaker policy is triggered again yet a previous violation has not been officially implemented or even released, CAAC usually requires a longer time to process both violations.

This indicates that an enhanced flight availability certainly enabled the arrival of more coronavirus carriers. In addition, the estimates of the relation \"Response \u2192 Positive\" in H2 of SEM 1 & 2 listed in Table 3 suggest that a more extended response interval of NAT results upon arrival was correlated with slightly fewer positive tests (by 0.33-0.34 off). This result indicates that the time window of the initial NAT response is key, as the shorter the response interval, the more positive carriers that can be identified. Furthermore, from the estimates of the relation \"Travel \u2192 Positive\" in H2 of SEM 3 showing in Table 3 , a longer trip duration correlated with a decrease of about two positive cases. This indicates that inbound international flights with relatively shorter trip durations require closer attention, as they were associated with an increased inflow of positive cases.",

            "text": "To examine the loop effect, we now investigate the structures in H1. The estimates of the relation \"GDP_pc \u2192Availability\" in H1 of SEM1 & 2, as summarized in Table 3 reveal that countries with greater economic wellbeing (in the logarithm terms of GDP_pc) correlated with slightly lesser availability of international flights to Guangzhou by 0.07 units during the enaction of \"circuit breaker\" and its conjunction with \"negative NAT.\" This can be partially explained by the travel bans and lockdowns launched by most of the developed countries in Europe and North America, which themselves suffered from a surge of COVID-19 cases, such as the United States and Italy, as evidenced from the inverse relation (of \u2212 0.07-0.09 days) between \"Case (in logarithm terms)\" and \"Travel\" in H2 of Table 3 in all three SEMs. The other part can be interpreted as a result of the monopolization of air routes and subsequent lack of competition, which consequently impaired accessibility. According to our data, two types of countries which the air routes connecting themselves with Guangzhou are served by a single airline, first are regional hubs (e.g., Ethiopia, Turkey), the rest are those with a GDP_pc above US$ 20,000 (in 2019 US dollar) 10 . Fig. 3A illustrates the change of the daily number of imported positive cases identified at the Guangzhou Baiyun International airport and the change in risk levels along with the implemented aviation policies during May 1 -November 30, 2020. The numbers vary substantially before and after the implementation of various aviation policies. Given that the trend of reduction in global flight seat capacity has slowed from June (\u2212 21%) to November (\u2212 5%) of 2020, according to The Frequency and Capacity Statistics Report for December 2020 released by OAG, 11 it is reasonable to believe that the observed variations may reflect the rising demand for the global aviation market re-openness. In terms of the regional distribution of imported positive cases, Fig. 3B shows that most of the positive inbound cases originate from Southeast Asia (22.4%), Africa (22.4%), South Asia (22%) and the Middle East (20.4%), while the geographic distribution of the last departure prior to Guangzhou was found to be slightly different (South Asia: 28.3%, Middle East 27.5%, Southeast Asia 14.9%, Africa 13.7%, Europe 9.8%, and etc.). Although such a variation is not significant, it implies an increased risk among the connecting flights between major hub cities in South Asia and the Middle East and Guangzhou. Another factor that may lead to a reduction of flight availability is the number of airlines serving each air route that connects overseas countries with Guangzhou. The relation \"Route \u2192Availability\" in H1 of SEM3 of Table 3 suggests that for each additional route that was added, 0.08 units of availability were lessened. This finding also reflects the fact (summarized in Appendix 1) that among the air routes operated weekly by multiple airlines, the route from Dhaka, Bangladesh to Guangzhou was found to have experienced the highest frequency of service suspension (seven times), which mostly occurred in November with an activated \"circuit breaker\". In terms of the comparison by routes served by a single airline, the highest number of suspensions, for example, Emirates, which served the route from Dubai to Guangzhou, has triggered the service suspension four times.",

We disaggregated the effects of critical variables involved in the \"circuit breaker\" mechanism. Hence the direct (two variables with a directly connected path), indirect (two variables associated by a third variable via two separate paths in a unique direction) and total effects (direct and indirect) were calculated and reported in Table 5 . As highlighted in Fig. 4A -C, three groups of mediation relations were identified from the SEMs among all the paths, which are all the impact of GDP_pc on Availability mediated by Suspension_lag, with Suspension_lag is the mediator. Given GDP_pc may cause the mediating variable Suspension_lag, and the Suspension_lag can cause Availability, then as shown in Fig. 4 , path ab is the indirect effect, path c \u2032 is the direct effect, and \u02ddc \u2032 + ab\u02ddis the total effect. The mediation effects were calculated based on the three-step method according to Baron and Kenny (1986) and results were reported in Table 4 . Among the three mediation models as summarized in Table 4 , the full mediation effects were found in SEM1 and SEM3, in which Suspen-sion_lag has a significant mediation effect on the linkage between GDP_pc and Availability. The result indicates that due to the indirect effect (which 17% and 18% of this linkage was explained by path ab in SEM1 and SEM3, respectively) mediated by Suspension_lag, the direct effect of GDP_pc on Availability turns to zero (where the path c \u2032 = 0). In SEM2, this full mediation effect was partially reduced (as the effect of the path ab has reduced to 16%, but is still larger than zero), which suggests that GDP_pc has a direct impact on Availability (where the path c \u2032 \u2215 = 0) Notes: 1. Full mediation refers to the case in which variable X no longer affects Y after M has been controlled, making the estimated coefficient of the path from X to Y becomes zero. Partial mediation refers to the case in which the estimated coefficient of the path from X to Y is reduced in absolute size but is still different from zero when the mediator is introduced (Baron and Kenny, 1986).",

These results further confirm that the cases of positive carriers were found much lower from those flights connecting developed countries, which as a result, could be indirectly caused by the reduction of the suspension lag period of the affected flight service. Conversely, the positive cases were found much higher among those flights connecting the third world countries. Part of the reason was the lack of alternative flight service to China from these countries (as Guangzhou was assigned as the only gateway to China from these countries during the pandemic).

However, given the limited information on how individuals' immune system responds to COVID-19, it is not well understood when it is appropriate to adopt anti-body tests (Peeling et al., 2020) to screen travelers besides NAT. Hence, this result should be interpreted with caution and further research to strengthen its justification is still necessary. (3) A longer travel time and larger response interval of initial NAT results were found to be associated with a decrease in the number of positive cases identified. The finding suggests that shortdistance inbound flights are associated with an increase in positive cases. In other words, flights connecting the neighboring countries with Guangzhou appear to have a higher risk of COVID-19 importation. In addition, the study also reveals that the action of flight suspension (in terms of rapidity) has significant but various influences on the availability of flights connecting different countries. A more timely suspension of flight may lead to a lower level of flight availability, leading to a lower risk of imported cases, and vice versa.",

Secondly, timely and effective evaluations of intervention strategies are also important. The uncertainties of aviation management and the related unprecedented high costs burdening international passengers can be avoided given sound and comprehensive evaluations. Thirdly, since the influence of the COVID-19 on the aviation sector is likely to last at least 2-4 years (Gudmundsson et al., 2021) , in addition to the implementation of the stringent inbound case-control measures as examined in this paper, the aviation sector should also take a more proactive role, such as through international collaboration and adopting scientific assessments, as advocated by Sun et al.
