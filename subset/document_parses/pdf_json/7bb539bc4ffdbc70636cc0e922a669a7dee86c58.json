            "text": "Objectives: To explore the etiology, previous cardiac procedure methods and outcomes of redo aortic root replacement after cardiac surgery. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 41 patients who underwent aortic root replacement surgery in our hospital from February 2010 to February 2020 who underwent at least one cardiac surgery in the past, including 27 males and 14 females, with an average age of 49.5 \u00b1 10.2 years old. Indications for reoperation include: aortic sinus dilation and ascending aortic aneurysm in 20 cases (48.8%), recurrent aortic dissection in 7 cases (17.1%), pseudoaneurysm of aortic root in 4 cases (9.8%), prosthetic valve endocarditis in 5 cases (12.2%) and paravalvular leakage in 5 cases (12.2%). According to whether the previous procedure involved aortic root surgery, they were divided into 2 groups, namely aortic root surgery-involved (ARS) group and non-aortic root surgery-involved (NRS) group. After the patients were discharged from hospitals, follow-ups were carried out through outpatient clinic or telephone for 5 years. Kaplan-Meier was used for survival analysis. Results: All patients underwent Bentall procedure with a median sternum incision. Six patients (14.6%) died during the postoperative hospitalization and 3 patients (8.6%) died during the follow-up. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival in ARS group were 92.6, 92.6, and 92.6%, respectively; the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival in NRS group were 100, 85.7, and 85.7%, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in the cause of redo aortic root replacement, procedure time, postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, hospital mortality, and 5-year cumulative survival (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Redo aortic root replacement is difficult and high risk. Bentall procedure is still a reliable surgical option for redo aortic root replacement, with good short-and mid-term results. The prognosis of redo aortic root replacement is not necessarily related to the etiology of patient's surgery and the methods of previous cardiac procedure.",

Since then, the success rate of aortic root surgery has been significantly improved, and a new era of aortic surgery has been opened. Subsequently, Cabrol and Kouchoukos each improved the technical details of the classic Bentall surgery. At present, Bentall procedure has become the standard procedure for the treatment of aortic root aneurysms and aortic A-type dissection with aortic regurgitation. The advantages of Bentall procedure are that the postoperative effect is good, the diseased aortic tissue can be completely removed, the operation is relatively simple, and it is easy to promote. The disadvantages are that it may require lifelong anticoagulation after procedure, and the coronary artery opening may form a true or false aneurysm.",

            "text": "All forty-one patients underwent thoracotomy with a median sternum incision. During the establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), only 2 cases were intubated through the ascending aorta, and the remaining 39 cases were intubated through the femoral artery. After thoracotomy, 4 patients underwent axillary artery or innominate artery cannulation according to their condition. The femoral vein or superior and inferior vena cava cannulation was selected according to the specific conditions of these patients, and CPB was established by right atrium cannulation in 4 patients. The most important issue for reoperation is to safely perform thoracotomy to avoid death due to hemorrhage. Our principle is to evaluate the distance between the sternum and the aorta and right ventricle through imaging examinations before surgery (Fig. 1) . When the distance is close or the right ventricular pressure is high, peripheral CPB is established first to avoid heart injury and hemorrhage during thoracotomy. Fortunately, none of these patients experienced severe bleeding or other complications when sawing the sternum. In terms of myocardial protection, except for one patient who received intermittent retrograde perfusion with cold-blooded myocardial protective solution due to pulsating pseudoaneurysm of the aortic root, the rest were all intermittent antegrade perfusion Fig. 1 Lateral chest X-ray (A) indicates that the right ventricle is closely attached to the sternum, axial CT image of the chest (B) indicates that the distance between the aortic root pseudoaneurysm and the sternum is small, and sagittal CT image (C) shows the ascending aorta is closely attached to the sternum with medium-low temperature cardiopulmonary bypass, and the lowest body temperature was 24.7~32.8 (30.7 \u00b1 1.9)\u00b0C. All patients underwent Bentall procedure, and to avoid reoperation, artificial mechanical valves were used. For coronary artery transplantation, if the adhesion around the coronary artery opening is severe and it is difficult to dissociate, and the coronary artery opening is not obviously displaced, we used the direct anastomosis method in 4 cases (13%), and the rest of 37 cases (87%) were carefully dissected to isolate the coronary artery opening and use button-shaped anastomosis method. One patient underwent a great saphenous vein anastomosis to lengthen the right coronary artery due to difficulty in right coronary artery anastomosis, and one underwent a bypass from the great saphenous vein to the proximal right coronary artery due to the narrow opening of the right coronary artery, and the right coronary artery opening was closed at the same time. During the same period, 3 cases of mitral valve replacement, 4 cases of mitral valvuloplasty, 8 cases of tricuspid valvuloplasty, 4 cases of coronary artery bypass grafting, and 3 cases of Sun's operation (Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "Aortic surgery is becoming more and more mature in our country, and aortic root replacement surgery or Bentall surgery has become a routine surgery in some cardiovascular centers. Some literature reports that the surgical risk of aortic root replacement has been greatly reduced in recent years [2] [3] [4] . However, redoing aortic root replacement, especially for patients who have previously unergone aortic root surgery, is still a technically challenging operation [5, 6] . It is reported that the mortality of redo aortic root replacement was as high as 18% [7] . This may be closely related to the patient's perioperative management, choice of reoperation methods and previous surgical methods. However, our research has found that the hospital mortality of redo aortic root replacement is not necessarily related to the previous operation method. Although the incidence of some serious complications that require reoperation seems to have dropped, the number of patients undergoing reoperation due to various complications has increased, which may be related to the following points. First, with the improvement of imaging technology, some patients with mild or no symptoms have been detected early and received the necessary surgical treatment. Second, the increase in the use of biological valves and the increase in valve-sparing operations have increased the reoperation rate. Third, as the age of patients undergoing cardiac surgery increases, reoperations due to postoperative aortic degeneration also increase. All cardiac surgeries during thoracotomy are dangerous, especially for patients undergoing reoperation, because the mediastinum and pericardium are fixed due to postoperative adhesions, or the huge ascending aortic aneurysm is close to the sternum, causing the distance between sternum and aorta and right ventricle becomes shorter. If you do not take preventive measures, blindly sawing the sternum, may cause serious consequences such as hemorrhage. It is reported [8] that the complications of re-thoracotomy are still relatively high, although various preventive methods are also clinically applied. Therefore, we recommend that all patients undergoing redo cardiac surgery undergo routine chest X-rays and chest CT examinations before surgery to assess the distance and adhesion between the sternum and the aorta and right ventricle, and take preventive measures based on the examination results. For example, establish Fig. 3 Postoperative anteroposterior (A) and lateral (B) chest X-rays indicate that the aorta is basically normal after Bentall procedure. Chest CTA (C) showed that the artificial vessel and coronary arteries were normal and unobstructed after Bentall procedure peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass firstly before sawing the sternum; routinely place surface defibrillation electrodes before surgery, and perform electrical defibrillation in time when ventricular fibrillation occurs during thoracotomy. Fortunately, in our group of patients, there were no serious complications such as hemorrhage and ventricular fibrillation during re-thoracotomy. Among them, 25 patients (61.0%) established peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass before re-thoracotomy. For patients with a large posterior sternal distance (\u226510 mm) or less severe adhesion, we have adopted the strategy of sawing the sternum first and then establishing cardiopulmonary bypass to reduce blood loss during re-thoracotomy. This view is consistent with previous literature report [9] .",

Further research found that there were 17 cases (54.8%) and 10 cases (100%) in the ARS group and NRS group with true aneurysm of the aortic root/ascending aorta and aortic dissection, respectively. Aortic valve disease combined with dilatation of the ascending aorta is a common clinical problem, because changes in pulsating blood flow, aortic wall disease and Laplace's law of mechanics increase the risk of aortic rupture [10, 11] . Aortic valve replacement alone can reduce the speed of aortic expansion, but it cannot reduce long-term adverse aortic events after surgery. In patients with preoperative ascending aorta expansion and untreated during the same period, the incidence of aortic adverse events within 10 years was 14.28%, mainly due to the increased risk of aortic dissection and aortic expansion and rupture [12] . At present, there is no gold standard for intervention in ascending aorta diameter expansion, but the overall trend is more positive. The intervention standard from 55 mm recommended by experts to 45 mm recommended by the guidelines indicates that longterm postoperative aortic events are receiving increasing attention [13, 14] . In our group, 20 patients (48.8%) underwent redo cardiac surgery due to dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta. Among them, 16 patients had preoperative aortic diameter > 55 mm, and the remaining 4 patients had aortic diameter > 50 mm.",

However, we believe that a more detailed evaluation before the previous operation and simultaneous proper treatment of the dilated ascending aorta should avoid reoperation of some similar patients. Studies [15, 16] reported that aortic disease secondary to aortic valve replacement, especially aortic dissection, has a mortality as high as 44%. The recurrent aortic Stanford type A dissection is mainly broken at the junction of the ascending aorta and the sinus duct. Therefore, Bentall procedure can completely eliminate the breach and reduce the risk of proximal rupture. In this group, 4 patients had ascending aortic dissection after previous aortic valve replacement, and the intimal tear was located at the sinus duct junction in 1 case and the ascending aorta in 3 cases. One case of Debakey II aortic dissection recurrent after aortic dissection surgery, and the intimal tear was in the ascending aorta. The occurrence of these aortic dissections may have a certain relationship with the previous operation. For such patients, before the previous operation, after fully assessing the condition, a more appropriate surgical plan can be selected to avoid the occurrence of reoperation.",

PVE and PVL are important reasons for reoperation after valve replacement, as well as one of the important factors of death during hospitalization. In our study, 10 patients (24.4%) underwent redo aortic root replacement due to PVE and PVL. The main etiologies for PVE and PVL to redo aortic root replacement are as follows: aortic root abscess (3 cases), severe calcification of the aortic sinus wall (2 cases), Beh\u00e7et disease (4 cases), and aortic sinus wall injury (1 case). Some of these causes are caused by human factors. We can avoid them by improving surgical skills and standardizing surgical operations. Other causes are the patient's own factors. Regular follow-up can be used to achieve early detection and early treatment. It is reported that in the long-term follow-up after Bentall procedure, the incidence of aortic root pseudoaneurysms was 8 to 15% [17] . In this study, 4 patients (9.8%) with aortic root pseudoaneurysm had Bentall procedure, of which 2 had coronary anastomotic tears, and 2 had valved catheter prosthesis and aortic root avulsion. In the previous operation, it is necessary to fully free the coronary artery opening to prepare button-shaped vascular sheets to ensure that the anastomotic stoma is tension-free to avoid the occurrence of coronary anastomotic stoma tears. In this group of 41 patients, the hospital mortality was 14.6%. Among them, Among them, the hospital mortality in ARS group was 12.9%, which was lower than the 20% hospital mortality in NRS group. Further research found that the causes of death in ARS group and NRS group were heart failure (3.2% v 20.0%) and septic shock (9.7% v 0%), but there was no statistical difference between the two groups (p = 0.581). Previously reported that the mortality of redo aortic root replacement may be related to the previous cardiac surgery method [5] [6] [7] , but our group of patients was grouped according to the previous cardiac surgery method and found that the mortality of redo aortic root replacement is not necessarily related to the previous cardiac surgery method (p > 0.05). We think this may be related to factors such as the severity of the patient's own disease and the level of the surgeon team. In the ARS group, the main causes of death were septic shock (9.7%) and heart failure (3.2%), while the main cause of death in the NRS group was heart failure (20%). However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups (p = 0.581).",

In recent years, with the application of negative pressure sealing drainage technology, the treatment effect of mediastinal infection after cardiac surgery has been significantly improved, and the hospital mortality and infection recurrence rate have decreased significantly, but the hospital mortality is still about 5%, and the infection recurrence rate has dropped to 10% or less [20, 21] . Among the 3 patients with septic shock, 2 had mediastinal infection and 1 had lung infection. Among the 2 patients with mediastinal infection, 1 had recurrence of aortic sinus dissection after a previous aortic dissection, which was difficult to stop bleeding, took a long time, had an asthma attack after the tracheal intubation was removed, and had secondary debridement due to mediastinal infection, bedside CRRT was performed due to renal failure, and eventually died of septic shock; another case with Behcet's disease suffered from paravalvular leakage and received surgical treatment. After the operation, he was given high-dose hormone shock therapy and developed mediastinal infection. Another patient with lung infection was admitted to hospital with acute left heart failure and was assisted by tracheal intubation ventilator. After the operation, the tracheal intubation was removed and the trachea was reintubated due to difficulty breathing, followed by tracheotomy, and finally died of septic shock. Heart failure is another early cause of death in redo aortic root surgery [3, 4] , so appropriate myocardial protection strategies and intraoperative coronary perfusion are particularly important. Among the 3 patients who died of heart failure in this group, 2 patients with aortic dissection involved the right coronary artery opening and had coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. It may be that the insufficient myocardial protection due to intraoperative coronary artery insufficiency, which caused heart failure and eventually lead to death. In redo aortic root replacement, the replantation of the coronary arteries is a key technical issue, especially when the valved tube has been used to replace the aortic root, the coronary anastomosis must be carefully dissected to implant the new graft. At the same time, the anastomosis between the transplanted valved tube and the coronary artery must be tension-free, and the coronary artery must be torsion-free to avoid bleeding or late rupture and pseudoaneurysm. The other one patient was PVE, who underwent emergency surgery due to failure of conservative treatment and eventually died of heart failure.",
