            "text": "The outbreak of the novel, highly contagious, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has presented a global public health emergency. Within a year of the first reported cases in the United States, more than 25 million Americans have been infected with the virus and over 400,000 deaths have been reported. 1 Although predominantly defined as a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, corona virus infectious disease-19 (COVID- 19) has since been shown to result in multi-organ damage resulting in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Importantly, cardiovascular (CV) complications that demonstrate a pathophysiology that is unique to COVID-19 are consistently reported. 2, 3 In this respect, inflammatory mediated thrombotic disease, cardiac and vascular injury are all highly prevalent in COVID-19 patients and associated with hospitalization and death. [3] [4] [5] [6] Moreover, even after COVID-19 recovery, a large proportion of individuals demonstrate cardiac dysfunction, myocardial inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness. 7, 8 As such, beyond the acute period of COVID-19 related illness, some individuals report persistent symptoms that are marked by shortness of breath and extreme fatigue. 9,10 These prolonged clinical symptoms have been termed 'long-COVID-19' syndrome and pose a growing heath concern with an undefined pathophysiology. 9 Superimposed on the cardiopulmonary (CP) consequences of COVID-19 is a marked reduction in physical activity (PA) levels that are secondary to 'work from home' and 'shelter in place' public health efforts to reduce the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. 11 It is well established that reduced PA levels are a known contributor to the development and progression of CV diseases. 12 In addition, leading a more sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of an exercise induced myocardial infarction. 13 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a larger proportion of the global population presented with a sedentary phenotype, a phenotype that may permanently worsen as we recover from the current global health crisis. 14 Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) portends a wealth of information related to health status and prognosis. In fact, the prognostic value of CRF is so robust it is now considered a vital sign; regardless of health status at the time of assessment (i.e., apparently healthy, at risk for chronic disease, or diagnosed with one or more chronic conditions), individuals with a higher CRF have an improved prognosis. 15 As such, improving CRF, through lifestyle, pharmacologic, or surgical interventions, is a clinical imperative. CP exercise testing (CPET) is the gold-standard approach to assessing CRF, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and is routinely employed in clinical practice and research for 1) diagnostic indications to further confirm suspected CP disease (CPD) or gauge disease severity if confirmed; 2) for prognostic risk assessment; 3) to ascertain the safety of taking part in exercise following a sedentary lifestyle and develop individually tailored exercise prescriptions; and 4) to delineate the pathophysiological contributors to exercise intolerance and exertional fatigue. 16 Therefore, due to the CP consequences of COVID-19, the recent further increase in sedentary behavior in the general population, and the unknown contributors of Long-COVID-19 related fatigue, there is an increased need for CPET in clinical practice and research. In fact, current clinical guidelines in the United Kingdom now call for a CPET in the clinical work up for long-COVID-19. 9 Due to the breath-by-breath ventilatory expired gas analysis involved with CPET, the procedure is considered an aerosol generating procedure. 17 Additionally, the increased exhalation pressure and volume associated with exercise may increase the span and number of pathogen-bearing droplets. 18 For these reasons, to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, additional safety precautions are necessary when performing CPET. We therefore propose a brief overview for clinical and research professionals performing CPETs during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 1) .",

The recommended pre-screening procedure is detailed in the algorithm shown in Fig. 2 . Rapid testing assays are not recommended due to the high prevalence of false-negative in asymptomatic individuals. 20 Patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19 can test positive for the infection up to 3 months after symptom onset. 21 These patients are no longer considered infectious and it is appropriate to deescalate their case following the guidance set forth by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 22 All patients that are outside the 3 month window of their first positive test should be retested. Patients who had a mild case of COVID-19 should be 10 days out from their first test and symptom onset, and free of all symptoms experienced during the initial phase of their infection. 22 Patients who were severely ill, and immunocompromised patients, should also be symptom free and at least 20 days out from the first positive test and symptom onset. 23 It should be acknowledged that even with a negative test, subjects should still be treated as if they are positive due to the increased risk of transmission during CPET, and all testing staff should adhere to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set forth by their institution, which may include the use of a N95 mask and face shield, gown and gloves.",

However, cardiopulmonary function in convalescent patients is largely unknown, particularly in severely infected patients experiencing long-COVID-19 syndrome. Recent evidence from both non-severe and hospitalized COVID-19 patients show that these individuals have a peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) below age-predicted levels three months after discharge or convalescence. 10, 26 Towards understanding the pathophysiology of long-COVID-19 syndrome, comprehensive assessments of CP function and the oxygen transport chain are warranted. In this respect, lasting pulmonary damage 27,28 could potentially alter oxygen diffusion from the lungs to the circulation, resulting in hypoxemia. Impairments in CV function that are evident in convalescent patients 8 stand to hamper oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic demand of active skeletal muscle. Finally, some recent evidence suggests that dynapenia is a substantial contributor to reduced CRF in 26, 29 thus implicating a peripheral limitation to exercise tolerance in this population. The long-term consequences of diminished skeletal muscle quality and function and the consequential effects on oxygen utilization warrant investigation. In this respect, CPET is a powerful tool to help uncover the physiological contributors to CRF and fatigue.",
