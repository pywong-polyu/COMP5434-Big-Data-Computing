In order to investigate the impact of two-way travel restrictions in the global spread of infectious diseases, this paper defines a risk indicator according to the relative infection density. Based on this risk indicator and an intervention time on two-way travel restrictions, we define an adaptive metapopulation network. Then a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) metapopulation model on this network is proposed. The mathematical analysis shows that the basic reproduction number is independent of human mobility. Furthermore, this essay compares the effects of one-way travel restrictions and two-way travel restrictions on the global spread of infectious diseases. It is shown that the adaptive metapopulation network under two-way travel restrictions can effectively suppress the global spread of infectious diseases. We also obtain a threshold of risk indicator to prevent the global spread of infectious diseases by simulations. The earlier the intervention time on two-way travel restriction is, the better to curb the global spread of the disease. Even if two-way travel restrictions are not implemented, controlling the mobility of infectious persons would help prevent the global spread of the disease. This work will throw lights on the prevention and control of the globally spreading of an emerging infectious disease.",

From May 2015 to June 2016, the Zika virus spread to 40 countries and territories within the Americas in one year [1] . Furthermore, with the rapid development of globalization, developed transportation makes long-distance travel more and more convenient. However, the mobility of infectious individuals facilitates the global spread of infectious diseases. As of August 9, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread over 215 countries and territories, infected more than 19 million people and caused more than The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Weiguo Xia . 720,000 deaths. The outbreak of any infectious diseases has a significant impact on humans, either physically, mentally, or economically. Modeling and controlling the global spread of infectious diseases has always been the focus of researches. One of the major models to study the global spread of infectious diseases is a metapopulation network model. For a metapopulation network, each node (subpopulations) represent a country, a city or a town, and individuals in each subpopulation are well-mixed. The mobility of individuals between two connected subpopulations forms the link of the network.",

            "text": "These two works are based on the same assumption that the higher the relative density of infectious individuals at the destination subpopulation is, the less likely the individuals will travel. In recent years, with the development of big data technology, more and more fine-grained data can be obtained. The metapopulation network model based on these data has achieved great success. Panigutti et al. studied recurrent mobility patterns on metapopulaion networks using census data and mobile phone data [9] . Pei et al. forecast the spread of influenza in the United States using a metapopulation model [10] . Chinazzi et al. used the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEAM) to forecast the effect of travel limitations on the national and international spread of COVID-19 [11] . When an emerging acute infectious disease occurs, in order to prevent its global spread, each subpopulation (maybe a country, a city, or a town) will assess the risk of disease invasion and timely prevent and control it. One way to prevent the global spread of infectious diseases is to restrict travel, which is a problem of broken links in metapopulation networks. There are two main types of travel restrictions: two-way travel restrictions and one-way travel restrictions. Two-way travel restrictions refer to cutting off the links between the connected subpopulations, with no individuals moving between them. One-way travel restrictions include two types. One is to prevent individuals in a subpopulation from moving into its neighbor subpopulations. The other is to prevent the move-in from individuals in its neighbor subpopulation. Travel restrictions between a subpopulation and its neighbor subpopulations may be on some neighbor subpopulations or on all neighbor subpopulations. City (or country) lockdown is a two-way travel restriction on all neighbor subpopulations. During COVID-19, the municipal government of Wuhan decided to lock down the city on January 23; nation-wide lockdown was implemented on March 10, in Italy; subsequently, Spain, the Czech Republic, France, Belgium announced the nation-wide lockdown.",

            "text": "Until now, the majority of research on metapopulation network models have been devoted to the effect of different network structures, safety-driven one-way travel restrictions, and transmission prediction. Little work has been done on two-way travel restrictions. This paper focuses on the problem of two-way travel restrictions on all neighbor subpopulations, and puts forward a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) metapopulation model to study the global transmission of an emerging infectious disease. Using the relative density of the infectious, we define a risk indicator \u03c1 (\u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1]) that divides all subpopulations into three categories: riskfree, low-risk, and high-risk. For a subpopulation, if there are no infectious persons, it is a risk-free subpopulation. If the number of infectious persons is larger than 0, and the relative density of infectious persons in the subpopulation is lower than \u03c1, then the subpopulation is a low-risk subpopulation. If the relative density of infectious persons in the subpopulation is no less than \u03c1, it is a high-risk subpopulation. Since the relative infection density of in a subpopulation varies over time, the risk level of the subpopulation varies over time. Let t \u03c1 (t \u03c1 \u2265 0) be the minimal time when a subpopulation goes from low risk to high risk, and T 0 (T 0 \u2265 0) be the intervention time on two-way travel restriction. We consider that T 0 for each subpopulation is the same and that it is independent of the risk level of subpopulations. So the relationship between T 0 and t \u03c1 is uncertain. That is, T 0 < t \u03c1 , T 0 > t \u03c1 and T 0 = t \u03c1 are all possible. Fig. 1 shows the case of T 0 > t \u03c1 . Based on the risk indicator \u03c1 and the intervention time on two-way travel restriction T 0 , we define an adaptive metapopulation network (see Fig. 2 ). An adaptive metapopulation network is a metapopulation network, whose links will be broken if one of the two connected subpopulations is high-risk after T 0 , and then will be reconnected when the high-risk subpopulation becomes low-risk after T 0 . Note that links broken and reconnected on metapopulation networks refer to the link weights, not the underlying network. The adaptive metapopulation network is equivalent to two-way travel restrictions on all neighbor subpopulations. Results show that adaptive metapopulation networks can effectively curb the global spread of infectious diseases. The schematic depiction of an adaptive metapopulation network. Blue circles represent susceptible individuals, red triangles represent infectious individuals, and a green pentagram represents a removed individual. The dashed lines mean that there is no mobility of individuals between the two connected subpopulation, which is equivalent to broken links due to two-way travel restriction.

Similar to Fig. 7 , for the same T 0 , final size and the number of cumulative infectious subpopulations of power-law networks are larger than those of poisson networks. This also indicates that the heterogeneity of the network structure promotes the global spread of infectious diseases.",

This paper defined a risk indicator \u03c1 according to the relative infection density and divided subpopulations into three types: risk-free, low-risk, and high-risk. Based on the risk indicator and intervention time for two-way travel restrictions T 0 , this essay defined an adaptive metapopulation network and proposed an SIR metapopulation model on this network to investigate the issue of two-way travel restrictions on all neighbor subpopulations. Then this paper obtained the equilibria, at which there are no infectious individuals; the basic reproduction number, which is independent of mobility rate; and the final size under special cases. Finally, this paper presented Monte Carlo simulation results on two kinds of metapopulation networks with different degree distributions but the same average degree. Comparing two-way travel restriction and two kinds of one-way travel restrictions, we find that controlling the movement of infectious individuals helps prevent the global spread of infectious diseases. The conclusion is obvious. However, the mobility of susceptible individuals also makes for the transmission of disease. Therefore, adaptive metapopulation networks under two-way travel restriction help prevent the global spread of diseases. Furthermore, we obtained that the threshold of risk indicator \u03c1 is 0.004. When \u03c1 \u2265 0.004, infectious diseases will spread globally. What is more, the earlier the intervention time for two-way travel restriction T 0 is, the better to prevent the disease from spreading globally. It is better to implement two-way travel restrictions during the first ten days since the onset of the disease. When T 0 \u2265 60, two-way travel restriction makes no sense. In addition, simulation results show that the heterogeneity of the network structure promotes the global spread of infectious diseases.",

Timely two-way travel restrictions (or city lockdown) help suppress the global spread of the epidemic. However, for lockdown subpopulation, controlling the spread of disease remains a major challenge. Adequate medical resources are needed to quarantine close contacts with the infectious, reduce the time that takes for infectious persons to be diagnosed, and explore effective treatments. Even if two-way travel restriction can not be implemented, the mobility of infectious individuals should be restricted. In order to prevent the invasion of infectious individuals, there are a series of control measures. Persons entering the subpopulation shall be quarantined. Individuals leaving the subpopulation need to provide a health certificate and register their origin and destination information. In addition, it is necessary to reduce the number of flights. Within an infectious subpopulation, control measures, including isolating the infectious, quarantining close contacts, keeping social distance, and so on, should be taken to mitigate infections. For an emerging infectious disease, there have been many studies on control measures within subpopulations [18] - [20] . In this article, we mainly focused on the prevention and control of the global spread of the epidemic, so we did not consider the control measures within a subpopulation.",
