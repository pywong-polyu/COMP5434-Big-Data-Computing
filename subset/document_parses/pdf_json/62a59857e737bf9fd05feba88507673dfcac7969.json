By 2050, this group will represent 13% [5] . The proportion of people suffering from dementia will increase from 1.59 million in 2020 to 2.35 million in 2050 [6] . Since people suffering from dementia have a high care dependency [7] , this growing proportion is expected to be accompanied by an increase in institutional care in the next years [2, [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

The relationship between physical outcomes, quality of life outcomes of residents, as well as organizational determinants-such as the quantity and quality of staff-has been repeatedly and widely documented in research studies [3, 7, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . These studies, however, mainly used quality measures such as pressure ulcers, falls, lengths of hospital stay, medication errors, patient or resident satisfaction, depression, anxiety, and quality of life [2, 9, 15, 20, 25, 26] . Everyday life and engagement in everyday activities are associated with habits of action and make it possible to orient and occupy oneself [27] . By maintaining social contactsboth inside and outside the facility-relationships can be cultivated and social exchanges remain possible [14, 27] . McCabe et al. [14] studied, among other things, the contribution of the relationship between staff and residents to the promotion of residents' quality of life. In their study, Mondaca et al. [28] address the limited impact that older and frail nursing home residents have on everyday activities. The role of staff is also highlighted, but not in terms of how they influence everyday activities and social contacts of the residents. Although residents over 80 years of age are over-represented in nursing homes [10] and this age group should receive more attention in research due to its rapid growth, no study could be identified that explicitly examined factors influencing everyday life routines and social contacts of residents over 80 years of age. Additionally, no study was found that simultaneously addressed the effect of staffing. In order to bridge this gap, we analyzed the question: To what extent do nursing staff levels (as an organizational or structural feature of facilities) influence those residents' maintenance of everyday life and social contacts?",

According to Donabedian, structural quality includes material resources (e.g., equipment, financial resources), human resources (e.g., number and qualification of staff), and organizational characteristics (e.g., organizational structure of staff, compensation methods) [32, 33] . Rothgang et al. [34] identified facility staffing-both qualitatively and quantitatively-as the most important structural aspect in long-term care. McCloskey et al. [17] see staffing as \"the most objective, reliable, and measurable form of data available [that] can be used as a starting point to understand the conditions within nursing homes\". Whether a facility is adequately staffed may affect (other) structure, process, and outcome determinants of quality of care [26] . The conceptual model of the present study therefore assumes that staffing levels are related to residents' outcomes, resulting from the assumption that a high staff-to-resident ratio and a high ratio of professional staff are necessary for caregivers to adequately perform their tasks [9, 21, 35, 36] .",

The associated demand for better quality of care can only be guaranteed with appropriate staffing levels and only if the required personnel can be recruited as well as trained adequately [22, 34] . Thus, the German government adopted a comprehensive package of measures on 3 June 2019. It includes strategies to recruit more personnel, to guarantee better working conditions and better pay, and to increase the attractiveness of the nursing profession [34, 38] . Nevertheless, one of the most urgent challenges facing German society in the 21st century is to ensure an adequate number of nursing staff in long-term care [34] .",

In addition, no requirements are defined for the other qualification levels. Konetzka et al. [15] concluded that taken together, most studies showed that more registered nurses \"in absolute sense and as a proportion of total hours\" contribute to better residential outcomes. Kim et al. [39] reported inconsistent findings concerning the impact of registered nurses (RN) on quality nursing home care. However, the authors highlighted that the current RN staffing standard should also be reviewed for effectiveness. While Greg et al. [40] , Castle et al. [41] , and Backhaus et al. [23] showed that a continuous relationship between staff-mix and quality of care does not necessarily exist, different longitudinal studies have shown positive relationships concerning staff-mix, skill-mix, pressure ulcers, and urinary tract infections [15, 21, 22] . Harrington et al. [22] argued that the strongest relationships exist between RN and residential outcomes. In their review, Griffiths et al. [25] concluded that higher levels of nursing assistants (NA) contribute to negative outcomes of hospital patients concerning falls, pressure ulcers, and satisfaction, while they provided strong evidence for a positive relationship between a skill-mix richer in RN and patient outcomes. Castle and Anderson [21] claimed that it is the sum of all caregivers that influences quality of care and quality of life for residents. Therefore, not only RN staff should be targeted [21] , although the authors did not provide any statements on how the qualification levels should be depicted. Furthermore, Rothgang et al. [34] criticized that it is not specified how the qualification levels of staff should be distributed below the required 50% of RN in German long-term care facilities.",

[8] identified that staff themselves have little to no time for engaging socially with residents and that staff cannot focus enough on residents' social needs in Canada, Germany, and Norway. Especially during evening shifts that often are understaffed, it seems impossible to enable residents to be socially active [8] . Lowndes et al. [8] highlight that residents suffering from dementia have less visitors and are less socially connected than people without dementia. Many of the needs of residents with dementia for social care, community involvement, company, and daytime activities are not met [8, 42] . Harmer and Orrell [43] blamed low staffing levels, as well as staff attitudes of prioritizing physical over social needs and routines within facilities that limit autonomy, for the lack of opportunities for residents with dementia to participate in activities they experience as meaningful. Based on their literature review, Lowndes et al. [8] called for studies that examine the physical environment and its impact on residents' (with and without dementia) participation in everyday life.",

According to Ryan and Deci's self-determination theory [44] , autonomy and choice, along with feelings of competence as well as social and emotional connectedness to others, play a significant role in residents' well-being and quality of life. This also holds true for residents suffering from dementia [45] . Vaismoradi et al. [30] showed that residents' perception that staff and family recognize their need for autonomy is associated with increased vitality, greater well-being, and lower mortality in nursing homes. Since most residents rate choice and control about everyday life as very important, but are unsatisfied with the amount of choice and control available, healthcare professionals should minimize the loss of control that nursing home residents often experience when moving to a long-term care facility [13] . In line with this, Abbott et al. [31] suggested that staff should have time to listen to the wishes of nursing home residents regarding the maintenance of their social contacts. Haugan et al. [2] claimed that nursing home staff nurses are \"the most important providers of social reinforcement\". Furthermore, in terms of, for example, the theory of selection, optimization, and compensation (SOC), staff have a role to play in enabling residents to socialize and manage everyday life by opening up new channels (e.g., writing emails) when others have closed down (e.g., hearing sufficiently on the phone) [31] . By additionally creating an interpersonal relationship [7] , staff can positively influence the environment in which social contacts can be maintained [14] . One nursing approach that aims to preserve self-determination, respects \"the individualized rhythms of daily life\" [13] , and thus focuses on the individual with his or her autonomy and social needs, is person-centered care [30, 42, 46] . However, this approach is rarely used.",

The dichotomous variable on dementia asked about the presence or absence of this cognitive impairment. Listlessness due to depressive mood was a variable used in the inQS-project and measured on a four-point scale, from 0 = never to 4 = daily. Listlessness was included as a control, since it can be assumed that listlessness due to depressive mood leads to less interest in independently maintaining everyday life and social contacts. Listlessness in a depressed mood is shown, for example, by the fact that a person has hardly any interest in the environment, hardly shows any initiative, and needs motivation from others to do something. This does not include that people with purely cognitive impairments, e.g., dementia, need impulses to start or continue an action. The same holds true for independent movement in the living area, which was rated on a four-point scale from 0 = independently to 3 = dependently. Without the ability to independently move around the living area, maintaining social contacts and everyday life becomes more difficult. A minimum of eight ",

Degrees of care are anchored in German law and assessed in five degrees, from 1 = slight impairment of independence to 5 = most severe impairment of independence with special requirements for nursing care. The dichotomous variable on dementia asked about the presence or absence of this cognitive impairment. Listlessness due to depressive mood was a variable used in the inQS-project and measured on a fourpoint scale, from 0 = never to 4 = daily. Listlessness was included as a control, since it can be assumed that listlessness due to depressive mood leads to less interest in independently maintaining everyday life and social contacts. Listlessness in a depressed mood is shown, for example, by the fact that a person has hardly any interest in the environment, hardly shows any initiative, and needs motivation from others to do something. This does not include that people with purely cognitive impairments, e.g., dementia, need impulses to start or continue an action. The same holds true for independent movement in the living area, which was rated on a four-point scale from 0 = independently to 3 = dependently. Without the ability to independently move around the living area, maintaining social contacts and everyday life becomes more difficult. A minimum of eight meters was defined as a reference value for normal walking distances within the living area.",

Nurse staffing levels comprise the ratio of nursing staff to residents, with each level of qualification (RN, NA, and ACS) being analyzed separately [23] . Since pure head count is of little value, in this study, we chose to calculate full-time equivalents per patient for each of the three levels of qualification.

Setting a level-1 variable to random slope allows the effects to vary across the facilities. Hence, the explanatory variable in the random slope model can have a different effect for each group. Finally, we conducted the analysis separately for residents with dementia and residents without dementia (models IV.a and IV.b).

Our results illustrate that individual abilities have a much greater influence on how well older people succeed in organizing their everyday lives independently and maintaining their social contacts even while living in a nursing home. In all the models calculated, the variables taken into account at the residential level were significant with regard to the sum score. In addition, the predictive power for the comparator model was about 60% greater than for the null model at level 1, and about 30% greater at level 2. Dementia (models II and IV), as well as degree of care (models IV.a and IV.b), accounted for the largest influence on level 1. Listlessness was the least important factor. Model IV best explained the relationship between residents' abilities and staffing characteristics (R 2 = 0.60). Further splitting the model into subgroups showed that the staff-to-resident ratio was more important for residents without dementia (R 2 = 0.61), and offering a segregated unit was more important for residents with dementia (R 2 = 0.63). In their qualitative study on the barriers to maintain social contacts in nursing homes, Abbott et al. [31] pointed out that it is not only the staff that plays a role. Personal interests, daily and long-term resources, health status, and the desire for certain activities or contacts are also decisive. In addition, according to the theory of socioemotional selectivity, the interest in social contacts changes over time in older people, with less search for new and more search for emotionally fulfilling contacts [31] . By controlling for listlessness due to depressive symptoms, as well as the ability to independently move in the living area, we were able to control for two variables potentially influencing our dependent variable on an individual level. The database of this study did not allow for an investigation of personal preferences and interests, which would certainly be beneficial to include in future studies.",

It is therefore strongly recommended to conduct similar studies longitudinally. In addition, Backhaus et al. [23] concluded that quality of care outcomes may differ concerning nursing sensitivity. At first glance, pressure ulcers, falls, and unintentional weight loss, for example, must clearly be more sensitive in terms of the influence of staff than the abilities of residents analyzed in this study. In the era of COVID-19, however, staff play an increasingly significant role for residents' everyday life and social contacts. Thus, examining the influence of staff has become even more important than before the pandemic. It should be emphasized that a comparison of studies conducted before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is relevant to disentangle the effects of the pandemic on the organization of everyday life and the maintenance of social contacts. While the indicator of maintaining everyday life and activities is also used in other countries (e.g., in the American reporting system \"Nursing Home Compare\", which delivers information on and results of quality audits of nursing homes on the internet for users to compare), the subject of social contacts is not used in this form as a quality indicator for nursing outcome quality in other countries. It is, however, taken up in resident surveys to record quality of life and well-being, especially concerning autonomy and social contacts [12] . It should be considered here that in pandemic times, an expansion of classic quality indicators in nursing homes might be appropriate.",

After moving into a nursing home, however, residents' activity levels often decrease. Although staff may not be the sole determining factor here, they can encourage residents to remain as active as possible. Through biographical work, staff can identify residents' everyday habits and favored social contacts. As Zirves and Pfaff [54] showed, the positive affect of residents can be positively influenced when residents participate and are involved in various activities. However, it is important that they get the chance to freely decide whether they want to participate or not, and thus control their everyday life and social contacts [8] .",

Nursing, taken as a whole, is the health profession that provides the most direct care [55] . Since effective nursing strategies are expected to improve the performance of healthcare organizations, the RN4CAST study used simulations to look at the relationship between hospital nurses and patients, as well as between the skill level of these nurses, their work environment (e.g., job satisfaction, burnout), and patient outcome [55] . Such an approach would also be advisable for care in nursing homes, since in view of the staff short-age in this area, it must also be considered how the working conditions affect the staff and, via this, the resident outcomes [36] . In the course of their study, Rothgang et al. [28] found that many tasks in nursing homes are not carried out, are not carried out completely, or are carried out under time pressure. They therefore developed an algorithm which, depending on the number of residents, indicates how many nursing staff a facility needs to be able to provide a professional level of care. This algorithm is intended to replace the staffing ratios valid in Germany with a needs-based staffing mix. Such personnel assessment procedures will probably be highly relevant in the future, not only in Germany. However, there is one important aspect they cannot measure: the actual competence of nursing staff as well as the continuity and coordination of competence in nursing home facilities. For this reason, it is indispensable to also focus on the development of competence measurement procedures [21, 23, 40] and of interventions to improve the working environment of nursing care staff (e.g., being involved in decision-making processes, promote skilled interdisciplinary communication, enhancing coping strategies, self-awareness, and emotional intelligence), as summarized by Barrientos-Trigo et al. [36] .",

Several implications can be derived for practice: First of all, a more detailed differentiation with a more detailed assignment of tasks is needed in order to define nursing staff qualification levels. Three levels of qualification (as used in the present study) as a measure are not sufficient. It thus would be necessary to adapt the existing qualification profiles in the facilities or their classification according to the risks for care. The existing staff capacities should also be multi-professionally oriented so that risks and resources of residents can be recognized and, if necessary, compensated for or redirected in the sense of the SOC. This should be accompanied by a more targeted development of staff competences with regard to the independent organization of everyday life and the maintenance of social contacts of the residents.",

Consequently, it is difficult to disentangle whether the number of caregivers assigned to each resident determines the residents' outcome, or whether the residents' outcome determines the number of caregivers assigned to the resident [40] . Furthermore, due to their age, the residents analyzed are all highly vulnerable. Thus, facilities in this study sample may be homogeneous in terms of resident structure but heterogeneous in terms of staffing. The cross-sectional design of our study prevents an analysis of cause-and-effect relations and is subject to the risk of endogeneity, a fact that various authors have already pointed out [23, 25, 40] . Longitudinal studies in this field of research are highly recommended to overcome potential bias.",

However, since we analyzed secondary and hard structural data, additional variables were not included. This study only examined the available resources of staff and not the overall context of the organization, which can, for example, reflect the individual competencies, expertise, and morale of the staff, the extent to which the institution is managed in a well-rounded manner, and, for example, uses the latest technologies for communication and participation in social life. Characteristics such as staff turnover, the proportion of agency staff, the distribution of working time among the residents, and the various activities that arise, were not considered either even though other studies clearly highlight the importance of these aspects [21, 39, 41] . As Aiken et al. [35] emphasize, staffing in hospitals should be considered as a dimension of the work environment, i.e., a broader organizational aspect, which could be a starting point for future research on the topic discussed here. Another limitation was that all facilities had participated in inQS voluntarily and were affiliated with the Caritas Association, a catholic welfare organization [3] .

Our results consequently contribute to a better understanding of everyday and social skills of the oldest population. Moreover, multilevel models are optimal for separating facility characteristics from individual resident characteristics. Finally, the dataset provided a unique sample with very good data quality.
