Also, patients with at least 5 days of fever and less than 4 of the principal criteria can be diagnosed with Kawasaki disease when coronary artery dilation is detected by echocardiography or angiography [3] . Diagnostic criteria have been notably revised in 2004 with the conceptual introduction of incomplete Kawasaki disease for children with unexplained fever during 5 days or more and presenting with 2 or 3 of the principal clinical features of Kawasaki disease and at least four of seven supplemental laboratory criteria [3] .",

We also reported 2 cases of chest pain (29%), 3 cases of shock syndrome (43%), 3 cases of dyspnoea (43%) and 3 cases of neurological disorders: visual hallucination, ideation slowing down or febrile meningeal syndrome (2 cases, 29%). In many cases, symptoms of Kawasaki disease were predominant in the clinical picture (Fig. 2) . Biological inflammatory syndrome was noted in all cases. C-reactive protein plasmatic levels in this subgroup were higher than in the rest of the study population: 248 [48-354] mg/L vs 135 mg/L, respectively (p = 0.04). Five patients (71%) were tested positive for lupus anticoagulant. Amongst those, one patient was secondarily tested negative, favouring the transitory status of positive lupus anticoagulant. None of these patients had history of systemic lupus erythematosus. There was one case (14%) of macrophages activation syndrome confirmed after bone marrow analysis. Echocardiography on admission found an altered LV contractility in all cases, with a reduced left ventricle ejection fraction in 6 cases (86%). Isolated reduction of longitudinal global strain was objectified in one case. Mitral regurgitation was present in all cases without annular dilatation. All patients were free from coronary involvement. Amongst the 7 patients diagnosed with incomplete Kawasaki disease associated with myocarditis, 5 had cardiac resonance imaging performed within 10 days. In all cases, cardiac resonance imaging was normal, without myocardial oedema. One patient, from this group, initially presented with a clinical picture of acute abdomen leading to laparoscopic appendectomy. Evolution was marked by persistent fever and severe inflammatory syndrome. The patient secondarily developed signs of cardiac failure requiring inotropic support, prolonged ventilation during 5 days. Cardiac function improved after infusion of low-flow immunoglobulin over 4 days.",

Verdoni et al. reported a 30-fold increase in the incidence of Kawasaki syndrome in Bergamo (Italy) [19] . A similar comparison in our cohort shows an increase in incidence of 15 times. However, the incidence of Kawasaki disease did not increase during the pandemic in our centre. The increase in incomplete forms of Kawasaki syndromes in our population [20] [21] [22] . As in the adult, it can be hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce an inappropriate immune response, causing an inflammatory reaction leading to vasculitis [11, 23, 24] . Another possibility is that inflammatory diseases like Kawasaki and myocarditis could directly result in an endothelial lesion provoked by a specific virus [1, 25, 26] . Finally, these types of inflammatory diseases could depend on the external viral pressure. In other terms, if the quantity of virus(es) circulating amongst the general population increases, children would tend to develop myocarditis and/or vasculitis, independently of the species of the virus. In this cohort, therapy against myocarditis with incomplete Kawasaki syndrome consisted of an aggressive antiinflammatory treatment, comprising large doses of immunoglobulins and aspirin. It has been effective in this cohort, with a total regression of myocardial impairment. For this new form, the rationale for this treatment is well described by Ronconi et al. [27] .",
