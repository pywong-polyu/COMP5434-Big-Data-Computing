At the same time, to effectively respond to the explosive growth of medical waste and its potential secondary pollution waste generated during the process of collection, storage, and transfer, on January 28, 2020, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China issued \"COVID-19 Infected Pneumonia Medical Waste Emergency Disposal Management and Technical Guide (Trial),\" which proposes to use hazardous waste incinerators, municipal solid waste incinerators, industrial furnaces, and other facilities as emergency treatment facilities for pneumonia medical waste to meet epidemic prevention needs. According to national statistics, until March 21, 2020, the national medical waste disposal level was 6066.8 t/d, which was an increase of emergency disposal level by 1164.0 t/d compared to January 20. The disposal level of Hubei Province and Wuhan City has also been greatly improved. The production of Hubei Province has reached 667.4 t/d, an increase of 487.4 t/d; the capacity of Wuhan City has reached 265.6 t/d (including municipal solid waste incinerator for general medical waste treatment capacity of 100 t/d), an increase of 215.6 t/d, essentially achieving \"Same-day destruction\" [1] .",

Diversion means that medical waste incinerators are preferentially used to treat medical waste during the COVID-19. Disinfection means that the medical waste sent to the municipal solid waste incineration plant must be strictly disinfected. Reinforced packaging means that the strengthened packaging and sealing according to the relevant provisions of the \"Technical Specifications for Centralized Disposal of Medical Waste (Trial)\" and then put it into a turnover box (barrel) and transport to a municipal solid waste incinerator to reduce the risk of infection. An improved feeding process means that a separate feed inlet for medical waste is set up, and hooks and net pockets are used to feed waste; video monitoring guides the refinement of the feeding. Medical waste does not require fermentation, but minimizes the residence time of the pit; in principle, the proportion of co-processing is controlled within 5%. Negative pressure means that the waste storage bin is in a \"micro-negative pressure\" environment, and the collected gas is directly introduced into the incinerator for disposal to ensure that no substances are released into the environment. Finally, the health protection and training of workers must be strengthened. Operators must wear protective clothing, goggles, gloves, masks, and other epidemic prevention equipment, have their temperature taken regularly, and report any abnormalities to the disease control department immediately. Specific transportation routes and temporary storage areas for medical wastes need to be designated in the plant area. Daily disinfection treatment is also required at regular intervals.

Incineration fly ash and slag need to be collected, stored, transported, and disposed of separately. The incineration fly ash shall be managed according to hazardous waste. If it enters the waste landfill for disposal, it should meet the requirements of \"Standard for Pollution Control on the Landfill Site of Municipal Solid Waste\" (GB16889); if it enters the cement kiln for disposal, it should meet the requirements of \"Standard for Pollution Control on Co-processing of Solid Wastes in Cement Kiln\" (GB30485). At the same time, in the process of incineration of medical waste, the discharge of pollutants in environmental media such as the atmosphere and water needs be studied to prevent disease transmission and environmental pollution.",
