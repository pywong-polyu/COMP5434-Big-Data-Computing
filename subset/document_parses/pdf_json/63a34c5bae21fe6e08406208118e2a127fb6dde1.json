The project was funded by the Erasmus+ program under Key Action 203 Strategic Partnership for Higher Education, and its aims are to foster the development of social, civic, and transcultural competences and to tackle discrimination, segregation, racism, bullying, and violence in healthcare by investigating the current situation and proposing a new approach for nurses. It represents a collaboration between four European universities. In this paper, we present the findings of a qualitative study to analyze the perspectives of key stakeholders and decision makers, as well as those of healthcare users from a diverse cultural background, on transcultural care in four European countries to facilitate the relevant points that will allow a better approach to the emerging problem. In addition, the originality of the article lies in the comparison between the groups studied together with the content of the paper.",

Over the last few decades, some countries of the European Union have all experienced meaningful demographic changes [4] . Once characterized by their homogeneous society, they have now become multicultural countries striving to adapt to the new state of affairs. The reasons behind this transformation are diverse and vary slightly from one nation to another. For instance, Spain, Turkey, and Portugal are geographically in close proximity to the African continent, one of the main sources of immigration to the EU, yet there are other more complex contributing factors for the recent rise in the number of migrants and refugees, including the steady rise of most EU countries' national gross domestic product (at least until recently), Spain, Portugal, and Belgium's colonial histories, and Turkey's shared border with Syria.",

These and other factors may contribute to widening the gap between the majority population and those from a migrant minority (MM) background, resulting in worse access to healthcare, housing, education, and work. In fact, results from previous research have shown that health disparities between minority and non-minority groups do exist. Cultural and social determinants to health, such as unequal access to care, poverty, racism, failings of intercultural communication, and ineffective interactions between the care provider and the patient, have been identified as some of the factors underlying these [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Recently, in 2018, the European Commission's Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in health (EXPH) proposed several actions to ensure equity in access to healthcare: (1) People should have access to proper health information and services information in their own language; (2) health services should meet the needs of all by being culturally sensitive and appropriate; (3) healthcare services should provide interpretation and translation facilities, teaching diversity in the health workforces and adaptation of diagnosis and treatment methods, to be culturally appropriate and acceptable, all of which are key aspects of cultural competency [13] . However, despite the identification of real problems and proposed best practices, the implementation of such care interventions remains patchy [14] . According to Teunissen et al. [14] , this can be explained by the fact that health services are not tailored to day-to-day practice, and users from minority groups are not being involved in the decision-making process. However, this knowledge-practice gap is under-researched and should be investigated further [15] [16] [17] .",

Others such as Phillmore [22] prefer to use the notion of diversity to include socioeconomic factors such as migratory status and unemployment and to stress the differences among cultural minorities themselves.

For the majority, the need for this adaptability was linked to the level of integration of the patient, especially to language proficiency. Two stakeholders went beyond cultural particularities and linked adaptability to the need for all patients to have an individualized care plan. In contrast, one stakeholder, while also valuing patient-centered care, perceived it as in tension with culture: for him, communitarian and/or religious norms clash with individualized care. This variety of views is in line with the findings of The Institute for Research in Superdiversity [22] , which, among the gaps in the research on adaptation of health services to diversity, finds a lack of \"detailed discussions of the ways in which potentially useful concepts such as patientcentering, quality of care or cultural safety play out in everyday health interactions\". All stakeholders identified systematic training of professionals in cultural diversity as key, but most of them insisted on the relationship of knowledge with attitude and personal experience with cultural diversity; some even made the first depend on the second to produce results.",

Results have shown that views of culture differ, especially on one crucial point: for stakeholders and MM users with long-established residence in the place of choice, culture is primarily what minorities have, and it has to do with family, community norms, religious beliefs, lifestyles, and habits. These components are perceived as in tension with healthcare norms and values, and they mediate in two key and related aspects of the relationship between MM users and healthcare providers: accessibility and communication. Those are precisely the two aspects that MM users identify as more important when talking about their experience: they are the main barriers they encounter to their integration in healthcare, and the arenas in which they feel misunderstanding and where conflicts arise. This leads us to conclude that integration of social cultural diversity in healthcare is a multifactor process that touches key aspects of healthcare for all populations, because it engages with discussions about patient-centered care, individualized care, active listening, proactive care, and universal access to care.",
