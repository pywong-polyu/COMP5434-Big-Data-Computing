Thus, we intentionally collected data in 48 hours (between 12 April 2020, 10:00 PM and 14 April 2020, 10:00 PM) when face masks use was not obligatory, but clearly recommended.

Interestingly, significantly more responders (P = .007) who reported an atopic predisposition wore face masks (65.5% and 57.7%, respectively). Having selfreported sensitive skin did not influence the frequency of face masks wearing (P = .06). 34.0% participants (significantly more males, P = .0012) used several types of face masks ( Table 1) . Out of all usages, cloth masks (46.2%) appeared to be the most popular ones, followed by surgical masks (39.2%), respirators (N95 and FFP (filtering facepiece)) (13.3%), half-face elastomeric respirators (0.8%) and full-face respirators (0.4%). Females significantly more frequently (P = .0001) used cloth masks; respirators, half-face elastomeric respirators and full-face respirators were used more commonly by males (P < .0001, P = .001 and P = .001, respectively) ( Table 1) . Among those using several types of masks, 52.7% declared cloth mask as the most frequently used, 36.8% responders declared surgical mask as a dominant type and the remaining 10.5% preferred respirators. Most frequently, face masks were worn, independent of the sex of responders, for less than 1 hour per day; however, almost 4% of users wore them for more than 5 hours per day (Table 1, Figure 1 ). Concerning all the masks used, single-use masks constituted 52.5%. It appeared that 23.9% of responders who used single-use staff wore it again. There was no difference in this attitude between males and females (Table 1) . 73.6% of participants declared mask decontamination (Table 1 ). This procedure was significantly more common among females (P = .004). Washing combined with ironing was the most common modality applied (63%), followed by the use of disinfectants (19.4%), ironing alone (4.8%) and putting into the oven (3.5%). Other procedures, such as washing alone, microwaving, boiling and scalding with boiling water, were practiced by a single responder. In this survey, we documented that people with self-reported atopic predisposition wore face masks more frequently. It seems to be obvious as atopic disorders are clearly linked to the involvement of respiratory tract and increased risk of infections. 6, 7 Such relationship could be bidirectional with atopy predisposing to viral infections and viral infection may trigger the atopic asthma. 8 In the previous viral pandemics, there was a clear crisis in the availability of professional face protection. 3 Therefore, cloth masks were used commonly. This is in agreement with our findings showing the popularity of cloth mask protection used by the general public. One can consider that despite of protection provided by face masks they may be the cause of some side effects, including breathing difficulties, slurred speech, warming/ sweating and itching. [9] [10] [11] This may influence the use of face masks when they are only recommended and not obligatory. Limited availability of professional face masks most probably was the reason that almost one-quarter of our responders used single-use masks several times. Moreover, three-quarters of the evaluated individuals wearing face masks declared mask decontamination. Nonetheless, our results showed that some practices among young people could be regarded as inappropriate. This can lead to decreased efficacy of face protection and eventual spread of viral infection. Therefore, we believe that our results might be of value in construction of general public education campaigns on the proper use of face masks, especially if the role of face mask wearing in controlling the spread of infection is clearly documented.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2258, "end": 2260, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2262, "text": "7", "ref_id":
