The aim of the study is to analyse psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this, a cross-sectional observational study with a sample of 4180 people over the age of 18 during quarantine was developed. Variables considered were sociodemographic variables, physical symptoms, health conditions, COVID-19 contact history and psychological adjustment. The data were collected through a self-developed questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Bivariate analyses were performed, including Chi-Squared test and Student's T-test. Predictive ability was calculated through logistic regression. Results obtained showed a high level of psychological distress (72.0%), with a higher percentage in women and people of lower middle age. Statistically significant differences were found in the variable working situation (\u03c7 2 = 63.139, p \u2264 0.001, V = 0.123) and living with children under the age of 16 (\u03c7 2 = 7.393, p = 0.007, V = 0.042). The predictive variables with the highest weight were sex (OR = 1.952, 95% IC = (1.667, 2.286)), presence of symptoms (OR = 1.130, 95% CI = (1.074, 1.190)), and having had close contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 (OR = 1.241, 95% CI = (1.026, 1.500)). These results could enrich prevention interventions in public health and, in particular, in mental health in similar pandemic situations. the public health emergency situation caused by COVID-19 and to prevent the containment of the virus and mitigating the health, social and economic impact, in Spain, the state of alarm was declared on 14 March 2020 [5] . Extraordinary temporary protection measures were put in place to ensure the safety of citizens. These measures involve the limitation of free movement of persons; the suspension of face-to-face educational activity; commercial activity except that relating to goods of first need; cultural, leisure and sporting activities; cult activities and civil and religious ceremonies, including funerals; and, in general, any activity involving crowds of people. Regarding the maintained activities, the need for people to keep at least one metre away from each other was emphasised [5] . Subsequently, on 29 March 2020 [6], measures were tightened to promote the control of the epidemic, limiting mobility to the maximum, except for tasks related to essential services that allow the country's minimal functioning.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1747, "end": 1750, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2327, "end": 2330, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "As Holmes et al. have reported, the coronavirus pandemic is causing a profound impact on the population with physical and psychological consequences [7] .

Data from studies conducted in previous epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), influenza A virus subtype H1N1, Ebola, or initiation of COVID-19 show that quarantine as a protective measure has psychological effects on the population [9-11]. Quarantine has been linked to the presence of high depressive symptomatology [11-13], anxiety [14,15], stress [16], post-traumatic stress [13,17-19], anger [14], or psychological distress [20] mainly. Results from studies regarding psychological stress due to quarantine as a preventive measure of pandemia, vary form 24.6% and 56.0% [20-24]. Regarding the individual preventive measures, previous studies have identified that implementing more preventive and social avoidance measures relates to a higher level of anxiety [25-27]. On the other hand, the risk factors associated with greater distress have been identified, such as having adequate supply (of food or goods of first need), quarantine [20], lower level of training [21], lower level of health perception [23], degree of risk control, and the perception of risk [20].
