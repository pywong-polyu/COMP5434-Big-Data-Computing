SARS-CoV-2 viruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are mostly spherical, given electron microscopic morphology, although some are polygonal. The virus is approximately 125 nm in diameter and is enveloped with spikes (glycoproteins) that are nearly 9 to 12 nm, creating the virus s coronal form. The virus morphology is compatible with others in the coronavirus family, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [1, 2] . The target cell receptor is the key to determining how the virus reaches the cell and which tissues are targeted. The spike glycoproteins engage the viral envelope with the targeted cell cytomembrane. Current research studies showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expected to be the COVID-19 cell receptor [1] .",

Most patients suffering from aggravated COVID-19 exhibit lymphopenia, and some of them develop central and peripheral nervous system disorders. Severe COVID-19 infection may also result in acute cardiac, renal, and hepatic damage. Rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, and shock were also reported in severe cases [6] . COVID-19 subjects who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and had a need for mechanical ventilation or a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi O2) of 60% were recognized as critically ill patients [7] .",

The study protocol was approved by the Unit of Biomedical Ethics Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia (Reference No. 65920). Two Google Form questionnaires were designed and written in the Arabic language, one for the COVID-19-recovered patients (COVID-19 group), and the other one for the healthy people (Control group). The questionnaires were distributed via social media (mainly Facebook and WhatsApp). Communication between the researchers and the participants was conducted by electronic mail when needed. The COVID-19 questionnaire comprised two categories of questions. The first category covers background information of the participant, such as age group, gender, nationality, blood group, and Rhesus factor (Rh). The second category of questions inquired about potential exposure of the participant to COVID-19 and focused on the symptoms that appeared and their duration, such as fever degree, oxygen saturation, medications taken, and whether the participant was treated at home or admitted to the hospital. The control questionnaire included questions similar to that of the first category of questions in the COVID-19 questionnaire, but not the second. All participants were allowed to terminate the survey at any time. All measures were taken to keep the confidentiality of the data. The survey was outlined following the pertinent guidelines and regulations of the National Committee of Bioethics, Saudi Arabia.",

            "text": "The results showed that most COVID-19 patients needed one to two weeks to recover from their symptoms (24.2% and 31.1%, respectively), while 16% of patients required more than a month to recover. Some patients recovered after 3 weeks (11.7%) or one month (7.5%). Small percentages of patients required a day (1%), two (1.6%), or three days (6.8%) to recover (Figure 3) . Figure 4 presents the different therapeutic regimens utilized for COVID-19 viral infection treatment and their distribution among patients with respect to their blood group type. Briefly, the prevailing treatment regimen in treating COVID-19 infection included an antipyretic, antibiotic, and vitamins. The percentages of patients that used the previous regimen, with blood groups O, A, B, and AB, were 22.5%, 20.9%, 20%, and 22.5%, respectively. The second treatment regimen was similar to the previously mentioned one with the addition of an anti-coagulant. The percentages of patients who used the second regimen were 15.7%, 16.3%, 11.7%, and 14.3%, having blood groups O, A, B, and AB, respectively. The third commonly used regimen contained dexamethasone in addition to the drugs used in the second regimen. The percentages of patients who used the last regimen were 11.3%, 15.5%, 8.3%, and 17.9%, with blood types O, A, B, and AB, respectively. Pearson chi-squared analysis revealed an insignificant difference among the distribution of different treatment regimens among the COVID-19 group according to the blood grouping (p = 0.6328). The results presented in Table 2 showed no correlation between ABO blood groups and the display of high body temperature, headache, shortness of breath, cough, bone ache, GI symptoms, need for hospitalization, as well as the results of the diagnostic smear analysis (PCR) in COVID-19 patients, according to Pearson chi-squared analysis. On the other hand, Pearson chi-squared test analysis showed the existence of significant differences among ABO blood groups regarding the distribution of oxygen saturation percentage, myalgia, and recovery time after COVID-19 infection (p < 0.01, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively).

Table 3 presents the findings of researchers from Spain, France, Turkey, China, and Sudan, who report that having type A blood is a high risk factor for COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, researchers from Spain, France, Canada, Turkey, China, Denmark, Sudan, and Iran reported that having type O blood represents a lower risk factor for COVID-19. Concomitantly with previous research, a meta-analysis study documents that blood type A is a positive risk factor, where blood type O is a negative risk factor. Studies done in Iraq and Iran show that AB blood is more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Other studies performed in Spain (SCPT, severe COVID-19 plasma transfusion), France, and the USA show that the ABO blood groups are not associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection.",

Similarly, researchers from both China and USA reported that having type A blood is a high risk factor for COVID-19 infection, whereas having type O represents lower risk [13] . Zietz and Tatonetti [33] also reported negative harmonious relation between the O blood group and exposure to COVID-19. They did not recognize any significant association between blood group and either the need for intubation or COVID-19 related mortality, possibly due to their low size sample. In another study, Zeng et al. [34] identified higher odds of COVID-19 exposure in subjects belonging to the A blood group. In their study, the authors reported that individuals bearing blood group O exhibited reduced susceptibility to severe COVID-19, however, they could not find out if having O blood group offered protection against the virus. In a large multi-institutional retrospective review, the authors concluded that there is no relation between blood type and risk of severity progression, need for intubation, or mortality [35] . These data contradicted the results of Zhao et al. [13] who evaluated the association between blood type and death incidence in the Wuhan experience. The possible interpretation for the divergence of the observations is the racial, regional, and possible genetic variations among individuals of the same blood type. Some unrecognized blood proteins might play an essential role for COVID-19 severity of infection besides ABO blood antigens.",

The COVID-19 viruses produced in individuals of groups A, B, AB, and O express A, B, A and B antigens, and none, respectively. People in groups A, B, AB, and O have anti-B, anti-A, none, and anti-A/anti-B/anti-A,B antibodies, respectively [43] . Anti-A, Anti-B, and Anti-A,B antibodies may decrease an individual's chance of infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, resulting in a lower susceptibility of type O individuals. Blockage may be complete or not. However, once the infection is established, individuals produce viruses of their own ABO types, and the Anti-A, Anti-B, and/or Anti-A,B antibodies they possess may no longer neutralize newly produced viruses. Blood type O individuals may have a lower risk of viral infection, but any type O SARS-CoV-2 viruses they produce may infect their own cells as well as individuals with any ABO phenotypes [44] . Anti-A, Anti-B, and/or Anti-A,B antibodies may inhibit the interaction between the viral spike glycoproteins and cellular ACE2 receptors. This may prevent the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells and neutralize the virus in a complement-dependant manner. It may also promote cytotoxic T cells. Acquisition of immunity against other viral antigens may follow [44] . In this study, the most common symptoms among COVID-19 patients were fever (63.2%), generalized weakness (51.2%), cough (51.2%), bone ache (48.3%), and myalgia (44.6%). These symptoms were in accordance with those reported in previous studies [1, [45] [46] [47] [48] . Respiratory symptoms have been demonstrated by most COVID-19 patients in previous studies [1, 46, 49] . In the present study, 41.6% of the patients suffered from shortness of breath, while runny nose and sneezing were demonstrated in 29.6% and 25.6% of patients, respectively. In other studies, digestive symptoms were not common [1, 46] , while in the present study gastrointestinal disorders were experienced by 47.7% of the patients, revealing increased likelihood of the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms. This result is consistent with what has been reported by Zhan et al. [50] , who found that 61.2% of patients had digestive tract-associated symptoms. Evidence supporting the fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its binding capacity to ACE2 of the GI tract has been previously reported [51, 52] . The prevalence of GIT symptoms over respiratory ones might be ascribed to reduced virulence with raised infectivity and changed organ susceptibility owing to virus mutations [53] . Less common symptoms were sweating (39.4%) and loss of smell and taste (32%). There were (20.8%) subjects who reported other symptoms (not mentioned) and 18 (2.5%) subjects stated that they were asymptomatic. Accordingly, cautionary measures should be applied for COVID-19 suspected subjects who had regular body temperatures and went to different outpatient clinics because of non-respiratory manifestations [53, 54] .",

Distribution of Different Treatment Regimens among the COVID-19 Group According to Blood GroupingFigure 4 presents the different therapeutic regimens utilized for COVID-19 viral infection treatment and their distribution among patients with respect to their blood group type. Briefly, the prevailing treatment regimen in treating COVID-19 infection included an antipyretic, antibiotic, and vitamins. The percentages of patients that used the previous regimen, with blood groups O, A, B, and AB, were 22.5%, 20.9%, 20%, and 22.5%, respectively. The second treatment regimen was similar to the previously mentioned one with the addition of an anti-coagulant. The percentages of patients who used the second regimen were 15.7%, 16.3%, 11.7%, and 14.3%, having blood groups O, A, B, and AB, respectively. The third commonly used regimen contained dexamethasone in addition to the drugs used in the second regimen. The percentages of patients who used the last regimen were 11.3%, 15.5%, 8.3%, and 17.9%, with blood types O, A, B, and AB, respectively. Pearson chi-squared analysis revealed an insignificant difference among the distribution of different treatment regimens among the COVID-19 group according to the blood grouping (p = 0.6328). 3.6.
