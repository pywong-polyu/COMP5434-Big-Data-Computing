As the US population ages, the number of older racial and ethnic minority individuals will increase. Including these individuals in research is an important step towards reducing health disparities. Methods We used data from HealthStreet, a University of Florida community engagement program which uses community health workers to assess the health of the community, to assess willingness to participate in different types of health research by race/ethnicity. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to assess willingness to participate among adults aged 50 and older, by race/ethnicity (n = 4694). Results Our sample was 42.0% non-Hispanic White, 52.8% non-Hispanic Black, and 5.2% Hispanic. Non-Hispanic White participants reported more past research participation than non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants (28.7% vs. 19.0% and 19.2%, respectively). Compared with non-Hispanic White participants, non-Hispanic Black participants were less willing to participate in most types of studies, while Hispanic participants were less willing to participate in studies that might be seen as invasive (required blood sample, genetic sample, or participants to take medicine, or use of medical equipment). Conclusions Our study provides investigators with a general profile of research preferences by race/ethnicity; compared with non-Hispanic White individuals, non-Hispanic Black individuals are less willing to participate in most studies, while Hispanic individuals are less willing to participate in studies that may be seen as invasive or demanding.

Since then, many more cases of unethical treatment of minority research participants have occurred [12] [13] [14] .

Among all adults, there are additional challenges of aging that may reduce likelihood to participate in research such as comorbid health conditions, age-related visual decline, or degenerative joint conditions that may impose mobility limitations and thus their ability to visit research sites [25, 26] . Polypharmacy, typically defined as the use of five or more medications, is common among older adults [27] and the pharmacologic drug interaction effects from polypharmacy may make them ineligible for some studies [28] . Particularly among older Black adults, polypharmacy is associated with worse self-rated health and depression [29] . In addition to the high economic inequalities [30] , comorbidities [31] , and depression [32, 33] , that disproportionally affect minorities, depression is also associated with economic hardship [34] , lower social trust in others [35] , and a decrease in willingness to participate in research [36] . In addition, low socioeconomic status is negatively associated with research participation [37] . Differences in participation among minorities also vary by age. Previous work has examined willingness to participate in health research among White and Black adults, aged 18 and older in the US and found no differences in willingness to participate in research by age among White adults [38] . However, among Black individuals, those who were aged 65 and older had a lower odds of reporting interest in participating research compared with their younger counterparts aged 18 to 24 [38] .

Unlike Ceballos and colleagues [16] who qualitatively examined willingness to participate in research among Latinos living in a border town, we quantitatively examined willingness to participate in research in an older community-dwelling multiracial population. Garza and colleagues examined When examining willingness to participate in different types of health research, some racial and ethnic differences emerged in preferences. Non-Hispanic Whites individuals reported the most willingness to participate in research. Hispanic and non-Hispanic White participants reported similar willingness to participate in studies that only asked questions about their health or if researchers wanted to see their medical records. These may be seen as not as inconveniencing or burdensome compared with their other types of studies we asked about. However, once we asked about more burdensome types of studies, Hispanic individuals reported a lower willingness to participate. Compared with non-Hispanic White adults, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanics adults reported lower willingness to participate in a research study if they had to give a blood sample, give a sample for genetic studies, or take medicine. This may be due to multiple barriers. In addition to lack of trust, language can be a large barrier to participation. For many Hispanic individuals, especially immigrant populations, the primary spoken language may not be English. This may impede an individual's ability to access health information in their primary language and may limit their understanding of study requirements, trust in the researchers, and ability to consent if study materials are not provided in their primary language [10, 11] . It also is important to note that the drop in willingness to participate in more demanding study types may be due to the wording of the questions. Many older individuals do want to participate in research because of altruism; however, the general wording of the questions may be too vague. For instance, if participants were asked if they were interested in participating in a drug study for Alzheimer's disease treatments, they may be more likely to participate, given that Alzheimer's currently does not have a cure and it is a disease that severely impacts quality of life. Our findings are consistent with previous research. One recent study examined racial and ethnic differences in willingness to be contacted about Alzheimer's disease research participation, A: p < 0.05 between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites; B: p < 0.05 between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks; C: p < 0.05 between non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks; *This question was added in 2015. Of those who did not respond, 99% were interviewed before the question was added by type of study, among adults aged 50 and older [51] . They found, compared with non-Hispanic White participants, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants were less likely to be willing to be contacted for studies that were more demanding (cognitive testing, brain imaging, blood draws, and investigational medicines) [51] . Additionally, it should be noted that the sample of our Hispanic population may not be reflective of the Hispanic population of the US [52] . In our sample, about 22.0% of Hispanics reported the US as their country of birth. Among those who were not born in the US, Cuba (31.0%), Colombia (19.4%), and Puerto Rico (14.2%) were the most common countries of birth. Additionally, while nationally the Hispanic population has the youngest median age, compared with other racial and ethnic groups, in our sample, non-Hispanic White and Hispanic adults tended to be older compared with their non-Hispanic Black counterparts. This suggests that our sample is comprised of a different Hispanic population compared with the US population, as a whole, where most Hispanic adults are of Mexican origin. Consistent with our previous work, which focused on brain donation among all HealthStreet participants [53] , we found that non-Hispanic White and Hispanic adults aged 50 and older reported being likely or somewhat likely to donate their brain for research, compared with their non-Hispanic Black counterparts who mostly reported being not at all likely to be willing to donate their brain. Lambe and colleagues [54] examined perceptions of brain donation among Black adults aged 55 and older; their participants expressed that the brain donation was too intrusive and demanding, that the resulting research would not benefit their communities, and some distrust of researchers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 212, "end": 216, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1879, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1880, "end": 1883, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2991, "end": 2995, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3265, "end": 3269, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3407, "end": 3411, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 4167, "end": 4171, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 4476, "end": 4480, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Additionally, the overall high willingness ranging from 56.3 to 95.6% reported based on the type of study may be because interviews are conducted by trained CHWs who are from the communities they serve; this may increase trust among community members.

Our study provides investigators with a general profile of different racial and ethnic groups with specific research types they may not be inclined to participate in, such that investigators can refine recruitment efforts particularly when they have participants from certain racial or ethnic groups. We found that, compared with non-Hispanic White individuals, non-Hispanic Black individuals are less willing to participate in most studies, while Hispanic individuals are less willing to participate in studies that may be seen as invasive or demanding (required blood sample, genetic sample, participants to take medicine, or use of medical equipment).
