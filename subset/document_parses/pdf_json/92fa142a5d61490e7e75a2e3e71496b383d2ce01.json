The profoundly powerful and quickly advancing circumstance with COVID-19 has made it hard to get precise, on-request latest data with respect to the virus. Especially, the frontline workers of the battle medical services experts, policymakers, clinical scientists, and so on will require expert specific methods to stay aware of this literature for getting scientific knowledge of the latest research findings. The risks are most certainly not trivial, as decisions made on fallacious, answers may endanger trust or general well being and security of the public. But, with thousands of research papers being dispensed on the topic, making it more difficult to keep track of the latest research. Taking these challenges into account we have proposed COBERT: a retriever-reader dual algorithmic system that answers the complex queries by searching a document of 59K corona virus-related literature made accessible through the Coronavirus Open Research Dataset Challenge . The retriever is composed of a TF-IDF vectorizer capturing the top 500 documents with optimal scores. The reader which is pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) on SQuAD 1.1 dev dataset built on top of the HuggingFace BERT transformers, refines the sentences from the filtered documents, which are then passed into ranker which compares the logits scores to produce a short answer, title of the paper and source article of extraction. The proposed DistilBERT version has outperformed previous pre-trained models obtaining an Exact Match(EM)/F1 score of 80.6/87.3 respectively.",

As of late, QA models have made huge advancements as far as both execution and throughput [10] [11] [12] . Such upgrades can be credited to the presentation of huge scope QA datasets and deep learning models, and the recent focus of the research towards the proficiency of such models. Lately, most of the QA models are extractors and re-rankers since their attention is on a generally small-sized dataset of text such as articles, sentences, or on the other hand entries, and so on [13, 14] . Whereas, our framework works straightforwardly on a huge corpus of literature. Our proposed model coordinates best practices from the information retrieval with BERT to create a framework focusing on an end-to-end closed domain question answering system and analysis on a standard benchmark showing improvement over the past work. Our model fine-tunes pre-trained versions of BERT with SQaUAD adequately accomplishing high scores in recognizing answers [15] The lucidity of this configuration is one significant element of its architecture. Additionally, our strategy is explicitly customized for BERT-based models to use this architecture in the enormous scope of pre-prepared language modeling. [16] [17] [18] Our proposed model exhibits that the pretrained model diminishes the requirement for some intensely designed taskspecific models. BERT is the first fine tuning based model that accomplishes state-of-the-art results on a huge suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, surpassing many task explicit models. Our proposed model holds the following components:",

Thus, the Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE) based QA system was developed to answer new medical questions using the existing answers to previously asked questions. A collection of 47K medical question answer-pairs was built and shared. This approach works well for both open-domain and specific-domain.

Although COVIDASK is not an open-domain QA model, it has been made with many techniques from open-domain QA models since it has to handle a large amount of text. COVIDASK mainly focuses on reducing the latency in putting a query and receiving an answer. Latency can be reduced by decreasing the number of documents retrieved. Alternatively, all appropriate answer phrases are pre-indexed into dense and sparse vectors. Then, Maximum Inner Product Search is performed between query vectors and the phrase vectors to reduce the number of times a model passes through a document to only one.",

Whereas, coming to the deep learning models their performance is limited when capturing the embedding representations of question-answer pairs which generalize the model with one neural network which captures one-side features. Therefore it's necessary for the model to capture complex all-side features of QA-pair.

Unlike directional models, which scans the text info successively (left-to-right or option-to-left), the MLM objective empowers the representation to utilize both the left and the correct setting, which permits to pre-train a deep Bidirectional Transformer. BERT advanced for several NLP problems like QA. It was introduced in 2019, generating language. That is why it does not require decoding. Figure 4 shows the original architecture of QA tasks using BERT, where the input sequence consists of two parts: the question asked and a special [SEP] token and then followed by the context [17, 24] . It learns the context of a solitary word from the two words, which encompass it from both directions using its capability of Bidirectional mechanism [28] . BERTBASE and BERTLARGE were the two distinct architectures introduced in the BERT model.

For the sake of simplicity, we have presented only a single instance of the answer to the query. This can be set to multiple answers also. We observed that the model outputs more accurate answers in the query containing frequent terms related to coronavirus. Apart from score evaluation, through the use of Metrics described in Sect. 5.5, multiple such queries were checked on by multiple users for a better evaluation by the author. And both the results were satisfying according to the feature generation capabilities of the COBERT system. In the screenshot, we can see the answers generation quality that COBERT is handling, this capability is likely to increase along with the content of literature given to our system. The model comparison based on EM and F1 score shown in Table 3 , Figs. 6, and 7. GPU version of BERT (with sklearn wrapper) is a version of the BERT model trained on SQuAD 1.1 runnable on GPU. It is available only with a sklearn wrapper achieving an EM score of 81.2% and 88.6%, whereas after fitting the pipeline on the CORD-19 corpus, the model achieves 79.3% EM and 86.4% F1-score. BERT for the QA model is CPU/GPU agnostic. The model was loaded in a machine with support for CUDA. It automatically sends the model to GPU for computations. This Here there is an increase in EM, and the F1 score is comparable. DistilBERT model trained on SQuAD 1.1 using Knowledge Distillation and Bert-largeuncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad as a teacher. This version of DistilBERT achieves 80.1% EM and 87.5% F1 while being much faster and lighter. Whereas, after fitting the pipeline on the CORD-19 corpus, the model achieves 81.6% EM and 87.3% F1-score. Here, we achieved EM highest among all the pre-trained models on SQuAD 1.1 dev and fitted model of CORD-19 as well, whereas achieved a comparable F1 score. Although both the DistilBERT's EM score improved on the fine-tuned data, due to large size input document size of the CORD-10 dataset as compared to SQuAD1.1 but still significant increase in score of 0.4 shows that Distil-BERT performs better on large input sequence size dataset. Whereas, it's not the case with the BERT uncased version which saw a decline in EM in GRU version but still improved in non-GPU version. Therefore, we can say that our Distil BERT for QA with Knowledge Distillation after considering all the above models performs better than BERT on data with large input sequence with 60 per cent faster performance in terms of speed and 40 percent smaller size than BERT-uncased whose reason is due to its triple loss combining language modeling.",
