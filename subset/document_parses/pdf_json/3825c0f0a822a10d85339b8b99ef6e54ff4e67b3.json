            "text": "Anticipating intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy is critical in supporting decision makers to impose (or relax) measures that mitigate COVID-19 transmission. Mechanistic approaches such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models have traditionally been used to achieve this objective. However, formulating such models is challenged by the necessity to formulate equations for plausible causal mechanisms between the intensity of COVID-19 transmission and external epidemic drivers such as temperature, and the stringency of nonpharmaceutical interventions. Here, we combined a neural network model (NN) with a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model (SEIR) in a hybrid model and attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of existing models used to forecast ICU occupancy. Between 1 st of October, 2020 -1 st of July, 2021, the hybrid model improved performances of the SEIR model at different geographical levels. At a national level, the hybrid model improved, prediction accuracy (i.e., mean absolute error) by 74%. At the cantonal and hospital levels, the reduction on the forecast's mean absolute error were 46% and 50%, respectively. Our findings illustrate those predictions from hybrid model can be used to anticipate occupancy in ICU, and support the decision-making for lifesaving actions such as the transfer of patients and dispatching of medical personnel and ventilators.",

Since then, COVID-19 has caused infections in millions of people [2] , with a substantial proportion of infections (e.g. 9-11% [3] ) requiring hospitalization in intensive care units (ICU). In multiple countries, demand of ICU beds exceeded bed availability [4] [5] [6] , leading to excess mortality of COVID-19 patients as well as backlogs of patients for other pathologies that require hospitalization in ICU [7] [8] [9] . Monitoring and anticipating ICU occupancy has become critical to support decision-makers to impose (or relax) non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help mitigate the transmission of COVID-19, and thereby reduce its impact on healthcare systems. Where S (Susceptible), E (Exposed), I (Infected), P (infected but not yet hospitalized), H (= H 1 + H 2 , Hospitalized), ICU, D (Death), R (Recovered), and C (Cumulative Infected) are the model variables; R 0 the basic reproduction number, c the vaccination rate, and k the reduction/increase in transmission rate after a non-pharmaceutical intervention is introduced/ relaxed. Parameter values and their meanings are reported in Table 1 . Daily vaccination rates were obtained from the public dashboard of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health [32] .",

A back-propagation algorithm (based on gradient descent) was used as a learning algorithm to modify the values of the weights and obtain the best matches possible between the true and estimated values of the residuals of the SEIR model in the training set. The mean absolute error (MAE) was used as fitting criteria on the validation set, and an early stopping mechanism was applied to stop the learning algorithm if the MAE did not achieve a decrease of 5 units within 100 epochs (i.e., number of iterations that the learning algorithm worked through the training set). The largest number of possible epochs was set to 4,000. We accounted for the stochastic nature of the optimization by repeating the simulation 10 times for each combination of hyperparameters. For each set of 10 simulations, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the MAE in the validation set. The combination of hyperparameters that generated the minimum mean MAE in the validation set was selected as optimal for the NN.",

In contrast, the SEIR model underestimated the ICU occupancy during phase 3 (14 th of April, 2021 -1 st of July, 2021). This could be explained by the fact that the model lacks important covariates such as temperature, which may have been responsible of an increase of cases during the winter and thus for an increased ICU occupancy. For the NN model, its worst performance was observed during phase 1, where abrupt oscillations occurred. These oscillations could be attributed to the short time series available for model training at that stage, thereby compromising model training and limiting predictive performance. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the prediction accuracy of the NN model improved during phase 2 (15 th of January, 2021 -14 th of April, 2021) and 3 (14 th of April, 2021 -1 st of July, 2021), when longer time series became available for model training.",

The second reason could be associated to the length of the time series. For example, the model had limited data for training during phase 1, while the amount of data tripled for phase 3.

In this study, we attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of a SEIR model by coupling it with a NN, generating a socalled hybrid model. Among all the possible ways to combine a MM with a ML model, we opted for a configuration called residual modelling. In particular, we used a SEIR model for predicting occupancy of ICU beds under future scenarios at different geographical levels (national, cantonal, and hospital) in Switzerland; we trained a NN to supplement these predictions using the information embedded in covariates (temperature, etc. . .). This modelling framework could be applied in other geographic regions for which a MM (e.g., of the SIR family), and spatially explicit covariates are available. Specifically, different extension of the SIR model [14] can be used, from simple examples (like the SEIR used in this study), to increasingly complex frameworks such as SIDARTHE [12] . As for the ML model, we used a feed-forward NN with a single hidden (see section 2.2.1.). However, alternative formulations could have been chosen. For example, Maher Ala'raj et al. [27] coupled an ARIMA model, a very popular ML model for time series forecasting with a SEIRD model; Watson et al.

For example, training of the NN is often computationally intensive and the selection of optimal hyperparameters is based on empirical rules such as try-and-error approaches [46] . In this study, the optimization of hyperparameters required a significant effort in terms of computational cost. Specifically, all simulations were run in parallel on ETH High Performance Computing facilities (Euler cluster) [55] , requiring, on average, 1 minute per simulation on one CPU, and thus 15 CPU minutes for each iteration running simultaneously on 15 CPU cores. We optimized three hyperparameters, namely the number of nodes in the hidden layer, learning rate, and dropout rate; however, other hyperparameters such as the type of activation function, the number of batches, the number of epochs, etc., could also have been subjected to optimization. Furthermore, other type of search algorithms such as the sequential model-based optimization (SMBO, also known as Bayesian optimization) [56] could have been explored. Another drawback of the residual modelling configuration is the inability to enforce real-world constraints (e.g., ICU beds \ufffd 0), since the residuals are modelled instead of based on the actual ICU occupancy. One possible alternative could be to combine the SEIR model and the NN in series. In this case, the NN estimates intermediate variables to be used in the SEIR model, although it would impose structural changes on the SEIR model based on the variables selected, which may be challenging to implement.",

[30] presented a method to distribute ICU patients based on travel time from the location of the patient to the hospital. In the future, our modelling framework can be updated as growing knowledge is gained on the covariates associated with the spread of COVID-19. For example, new covariates such as other virus variants and mobility patterns in different regions (e.g., people coming in and out of Switzerland) could be included to improve predictions.

During phase 1 (19 th of October, 2020 -15 th of January, 2021) the hybrid model (average MAE = 19 beds) outperformed both the NN (average MAE = 27 beds) and the SEIR model (average MAE = 78 beds). During phase 2 (15 th of January, 2021 -14 th of April, 2021), the hybrid model remained the most accurate model (average MAE = 16 beds), although the performance of the NN (average MAE = 21 beds) and the SEIR model (average MAE = 59 beds) improved in comparison with phase 1. During phase 3 (14 th of April, 2021 -1 st of July, 2021), the hybrid model (average MAE = 19 beds) was slightly outcompeted by the NN (average MAE = 13 beds); while the SEIR model was associated with the worse performances (average MAE = 125 beds). S1 Fig in Supporting Information (SI) showed predictions at 7-days ahead and its corresponding MAE. Predictions 3-days ahead (S2 Fig) were then downscaled from the cantonal-level to the hospital-level. Results for a medium-sized hospital, as well as the biggest hospital in the canton of Zurich are shown inFig 4.At the hospital-level, the hybrid model outperformed the SEIR model for both the medium-sized hospital (average MAE hybrid = 1.2 beds, average MAE SEIR = 2.2 beds) and largest hospital (average MAE hybrid = 3.1 beds, average MAE SEIR = 6.2 beds) in the canton of Zurich. In comparison, the NN model performed on average as good as the hybrid model for both hospitals. Similar to the national-level scenario, the highest average MAE for the SEIR model was observed during phase 3, during which the SEIR model was not capable of capturing the occupancy increase of ICU that occurred two months after the start of vaccination (15 th of January, 2021).",
