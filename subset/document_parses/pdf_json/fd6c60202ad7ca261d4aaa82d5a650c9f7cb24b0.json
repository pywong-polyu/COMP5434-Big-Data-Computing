            "text": "The exposome recognizes that individuals are exposed simultaneously to a multitude of different environmental factors and takes a holistic approach to the discovery of etiological factors for disease. However, challenges arise when trying to quantify the health effects of complex exposure mixtures. Analytical challenges include dealing with high dimensionality, studying the combined effects of these exposures and their interactions, integrating causal pathways, and integrating high-throughput omics layers. To tackle these challenges, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) held a data challenge event open to researchers from all over the world and from all expertises. Analysts had a chance to compete and apply state-of-the-art methods on a common partially simulated exposome dataset (based on real case data from the HELIX project) with multiple correlated exposure variables (P>100 exposure variables) arising from general and personal environments at different time points, biological molecular data (multi-omics: DNA methylation, gene expression, proteins, metabolomics) and multiple clinical phenotypes in 1301 mother-child pairs. Most of the methods presented included feature selection or feature reduction to deal with the high dimensionality of the exposome dataset. Several approaches explicitly searched for combined effects of exposures and/or their interactions using linear index models or response surface methods, including Bayesian methods. Other methods dealt with the multi-omics dataset in mediation analyses using multiple-step approaches. Here we discuss features of the statistical models used and provide the data and codes used, so that analysts have examples of implementation and can learn how to use these methods. Overall, the exposome data challenge presented a unique opportunity for researchers from different disciplines to create and share state-ofthe-art analytical methods, setting a new standard for open science in the exposome and environmental health field.",

This event gathered a widely diverse scientific audience of 307 participants, including environmental epidemiologists, biostatisticians and computational scientists, to discuss state-of-the-art statistical methods for studying exposome-health associations. First, participants were invited to submit an abstract describing their team, the challenge(s) and the method they would apply on a common partially simulated exposome dataset (based on real case data from the HELIX project). The planning committee selected a total of 25 abstracts out of 39 based on method clarity, novelty, relevance for the exposome field and challenges presented. Second, the selected participants were invited to apply their method on the dataset during a month leading to the event. Third, they presented at the event their method's statistical background, type of research question(s) it best addressed, and their results. At the end of the event the committee and the audience voted for the best presentations based on clarity, novelty and relevance. Finally, the participants made their code available on the github account (Gonz\u00e1lez, 2021) of the event.",

To illustrate the methods discussed as part of this data challenge, it was important to create a publicly available real case scenario dataset (based on the HELIX project database). This dataset consisted of multiple correlated variables (P>100 exposure variables) arising from general and personal environments at different time points of early life, biological molecular data (multi-omics: DNA methylation, gene expression, proteins, metabolomics) and multiple clinical phenotypes. The population was drawn from the multi-center HELIX project, where the cohorts of origin represented the main confounding structure in the dataset (Maitre et al., 2018; Vrijheid et al., 2014) ). The participants were offered an opportunity to test their statistical methods of choice addressing one or several key challenges: a) the high dimensionality of the data, b) combined effect of exposure or mixtures, c) the omics data integration and the d) causal structure in the exposome. Participants were encouraged to accommodate in their approaches some of the particularities of the data (e.g. multi-cohort, count responses, categorical and continuous exposure variables, exposures measured at two time points, etc). Visualization of the results was also a key point across all the challenges listed above.",

The HELIX study (Maitre et al., 2018; Vrijheid et al., 2014) represents a collaborative project across six established and ongoing longitudinal population-based birth cohort studies in six European countries (France, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom). From the 31 472 mother-child pairs included in the cohorts, a subcohort of 1301 mother-child pairs were followed up with measurements of biomarkers, omics signatures and health outcomes at 6-11 years of age. The data provided for the challenge came from this subsample, but it was partially simulated to respond to policies of data anonymization for privacy protection in the cohorts. In detail, for the set of health outcomes and exposures, we conducted the following process: for each participant, a total of 50 random variables (different for each subject) were converted into missing values and then imputed (in successive rounds of 10 variables at a time) with the method of chained equations. Thus, for each participant, some of the values in the provided dataset were real and some were simulated, in a way that precluded knowing what is real data and what is simulated. Omics data instead were kept intact but annotations of genes and metabolites were not provided. We provided an imputed dataset in which all missing values in the original data were imputed by the chained equations method. Exposure data were transformed (e.g. logarithmic, square root, tertiles) to achieve symmetric distributions with a homogenous range of values (Annex 1). The original raw data are available on request subject to ethical and legislative review.

Feature selection approaches used during the event can also be divided into different types of selections: 1) based on correlation with the outcome of interest, using Pearson's correlation as a screening approach; 2) based on regularisation (LASSO, Elastic-net regression) by shrinking the less relevant features' coefficients; 3) based on feature importance which reflects the impact of a given feature on the model predictions through permutation (Altmann et al., 2010) , random forest (Breiman, 2001) , or regression coefficients. Other statistical tests exist for features selection (ex: chi-squared test, ANOVA, etc..) but were not used during this challenge. Some analysts made an a priori selection, by choosing to focus only on a particular subset of exposures, e.g. lifestyle exposure, based on prior knowledge for causal models (25) or model abilities (continuous-only-exposures).",

WQSR builds a new index, which is a weighted average of the initial exposures (previously categorised into quantiles as a way to standardise the data and prevent the effect of influential observations). The new index is regressed against a health outcome, producing a single regression coefficient. The weights to build the index, which incorporate directionality constraints (e.g., all variables are expected to produce negative effects on the health outcome), are estimated simultaneously with the regression coefficients. This technique assumes additive effects of the different pollutants. Some presented extensions included models to produce strata-specific weights and regression coefficients, combining two indices (one for each directionality) in the same model, or using resampling to improve the properties of the method.",

A Bayesian paradigm was used, with priors that allow shrinking terms to zero in the absence of interaction. Prior information on the direction of the interaction (synergistic vs. antagonistic) was also incorporated. . This approach combines the dimension reduction and interpretability of linear index models (such as WQSR and BGIR) and flexible exposure-response modelling of response surface methods (such as BKMR and PIMGP). With BMIM, the original exposures are reduced to a set of indices, as in BGIR. The approach simultaneously estimates the index component weights (with variable selection) and a potentially complex, high-dimensional exposure-response relationship between the indices and health outcome. Thus, it allows non-linear effects of the indices and interactions between indices. This presentation won one of two exposome data challenge prizes.",

It established an overview of state-of-the-art methods currently used in the field and paved the way to interesting discussions and exchange of ideas. The first point of interest was the wide use of dimensionality reduction methods, especially feature selection, to deal with multivariate exposomic data (even without omics). Feature extraction methods were less used because they usually complicate the interpretation of the results if we are interested in the effect of a particular exposure on health. However, during the challenge, some interesting methods tried to analyse groups of correlated exposures as a way to reduce the dimensionality of the input while keeping the results interpretable.",

Among those methods, most of them were Bayesian methods that are able to approximate a wide class of functions while also giving credible intervals. The Bayesian paradigm is useful because it naturally penalizes complex models and it offers flexibility to incorporate a process of variable selection. It is worth noting that, even if models can capture complex high-dimensional surfaces, interpretation of such models is usually done using plots that show the effects of just one or two variables at a time. In fact, some studies suggest that structures based on four variables are at the limit of human ability to correctly process the information (Halford et al., 2005) . In this data challenge, a few studies detected two-way interactions in the data based on Bayesian methods (synergistic interactions, multiple index-based or additive regression tree-based) or machine learning models combined with XAI techniques such as SHAP (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) .",

The detection of a mixture effect is more powerful based on a single degree of freedom test. Detection of non-negligible weights provides evidence of important components. Methods have been developed to estimate quadratic associations with the weighted index where the significance of the quadratic term may be used as a goodness of fit for an assumption of linearity. Of course, the limitation of an index approach has been that interactions cannot be detected. Recently addressed, multiple index models allow for interactions between indices and provide a compromise between single or additive index models and high-dimensional exposure-response surface methods (McGee et al., 2021) .",

Black box models are able to capture more complex information from the data (e.g., complex interactions, non linear relationships etc.) than linear, regression-based models, and this can be key to accurately estimate the impact of the exposome on health. Black box methods used during the challenge included ensemble methods (such as random forests, xgboost), neural networks and support-vector machines. The method most often used was by far random forests. One can improve on the interpretability of black box models in several ways, here we will discuss two of them. The feature importance metric was the most popular technique during the challenge and is also the most used in the exposome field. It can be computed in several ways depending on the model: 1) impurity based feature importance (Breiman, 2001) for a model based on decision trees 2) permutation based feature importance (Altmann et al., 2010) and shapley values based feature importance (Harris et al., 2021) can be both applied on any model (model agnostic). Another approach is to use partial dependence plots (Zhao and Hastie, 2021 ) that allow visualizing partial associations between variables. A related example is the application of a combination of super-learner and g-estimation to assess the association between chemical pollutants and cognitive function (Oulhote et al., 2019) . Many of the machine learning methods used during the challenge were limited by the small sample size available (N=1301) and it is also worth mentioning that the data imputation could lead to spurious associations.",

This is a limitation of most existing multi-omic data integration approaches since they have not been implemented to deal with large matrices. Therefore, development of new integrative methods/tools must consider efficient handling of large data sets (Subramanian et al., 2020) . Most presentations studied the relationship between environmental exposures and health outcomes using omic data (single or multi-omics) as an intermediate layer in a mediation analysis fashion. Some other studies used Pearson correlation to study the relationships between omics and exposome data. Different combinations of statistical tools were proposed for omics data integration in analytical frameworks. These tools taken individually were not novel but their combination for integrating exposome, multi-omics and outcomes was strongly relevant and novel. We note that other methods previously used for exposome and omics data may also be of interest but were not presented during this event. These methods include dimension reduction derived from PCA such as partial least square (PLS) and its derivatives (sparse-PLS, group-PLS) (Chun and Kele\u015f, 2010; Jain et al., 2018; Lenters et al., 2015) , canonical-based methods or network analysis (Bessonneau et al., 2021) .",

Results from mediation analyses using cross-sectional omics should be interpreted with caution since the omics markers might be a consequence of the health outcome or of the exposure (one or the other, not both). In particular serum metabolome data, which mainly includes information on lipid metabolism, are closely related to phenotypic outcomes such as BMI. Therefore, they should be expected to reflect more outcome classification (e.g. obesity subtypes) than an exposure effect.",

This knowledge-driven approach can also be used to reduce the dimensionality in the omics dataset.

This method uses a Bayesian additive regression trees style model that performs exposure selection of main effects and two-way interactions, and incorporates the repeated exposure measurements available at two time points. The model performs hierarchical variable selection (interactions are only included if both main effects are included), performs shrinkage of regression coefficients, and performs dimension reductions by averaging over multiple time points when there is no evidence that the association varies over time.Peruzzi et al. (22)  presented the application of Multi-outcome Meshed Gaussian Processes on Projected Inputs (PIMGP). This method adapts Meshed Gaussian Processes, a method from the geostatistical literature which normally works with bidimensional inputs, for use in higher dimensional input spaces: after projecting the inputs onto a lower dimensional subspace (using, e.g. PCA), PIMGP use common GP kernels and lead to much faster performance relative to standard GPs or Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), especially with big dataframes (high N). The modeling framework was very flexible, allowing multiple outcome variables, missing covariates and covariates measured with error.McGee et al. (1) presented the application of Bayesian Multiple Index Models (BMIM) (McGee et al., 2021)",

Most of them can be classified as linear index models or response surface methods. Linear index models generate new variables (usually called indices) that are weighted averages of the original exposures, and regress those indices against the health outcome. Response surface methods fit a complex high-dimensional surface to the data, and are thus able to capture complex non-linearities and interactions.",
