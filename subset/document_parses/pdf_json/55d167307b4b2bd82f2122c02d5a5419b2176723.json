            "text": "The Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in November 2021 as a phylogenetically and antigenically-distinct variant of concern (VOC). With its greater intrinsic transmissibility and capacity for immunological escape, Omicron spread in an unprecedented way, causing the most intense epidemic surge since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, even among countries with high vaccine coverage. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The extent to which prior infection and/or vaccination may have modulated risk during the substantial Omicron wave requires better understanding. In this population-based analysis, we quantified protection conferred by prior heterologous infection against Omicron re-infection and hospitalization, stratified by timing and severity of prior infection. We further assessed the effectiveness of up to three doses of heterologous mRNA (ancestral Wuhan-like) vaccine against Omicron among previously SARS-CoV-2-infected versus non-infected individuals.",

In Qatar, prior infection was 56% effective against Omicron reinfection and 88% against hospitalization, comparable against re-infection at 3-8 (64%) and \u226515 months (60%) postinfection. 19 Preprint from the Czech Republic reported decline in infectioninduced protection against re-infection from 68% at 2-6 months to 13% >6 months later, whereas protection against hospitalization was 87% and wellmaintained. 20 Overall, strong and sustained protection from prior heterologous infection against severe Omicron outcomes, including the absence of Omicronassociated deaths among survivors of prior infection, appears to be a robust interpretation across the few available studies to date, including our own. 19, 20 A unique contribution of our study is the demonstration that prior asymptomatic infection was also protective, reducing the Omicron re-infection risk by about half during the first six months post-primary infection whereas, thereafter, unvaccinated, asymptomatically-infected individuals had no protective advantage over the infection-na\u00efve.

Mathematical modeling, however, suggests such misclassification is likely to have had minimal impact on our findings. 39 Although we could not control for the bias of differential virus exposure, 40 similar patterns when directly comparing protected groups (e.g. previously-infected, vaccinated vs. noninfected, vaccinated), are reassuring. Immuno-compromised people were prioritized for an early third dose in Quebec. 12 To limit under-estimation of threedose VE associated with their potentially sub-optimal immune responses 41,42 , we excluded specimens from people re-vaccinated at <90-day interval between second and third doses. Our results apply to those surviving their primary infection; with <1% of NAAT-confirmed cases dying, their exclusion will not have meaningfully influenced estimates. Our findings reflect heterologous infectionand/or vaccine-induced protection; homologous protection is anticipated to be higher. 43 As they were highly correlated, it was not possible to distinguish variation in protection based on VOC-specific vs. time since primary infection.",

Two vaccine doses were significantly less effective than three doses among both previously-infected (68% vs. 83%) and non-infected (42% vs. 73%) individuals, recognizing longer median follow-up time since second vs. third dose among both the previously-infected (158 vs. 27 days) and uninfected (173 vs. 37 days) (not shown).

Based on our findings, prior heterologous SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred protection against Omicron re-infection and hospitalization (44% and 81%, respectively) that was comparable to the effectiveness of two doses of heterologous mRNA vaccine among previously uninfected individuals (42% and 76%, respectively). Similar observations have been reported elsewhere during the pre-Omicron period although these were not fully consistent across studies. 17,22-27 Elsewhere during the Omicron period, two manuscripts from Qatar instead suggest higher protection conferred by prior infection vs. two-dose vaccination against symptomatic Omicron re-infection; 28,29 whereas, preprint from the Netherlands reports lower protection from prior infection (25%;95%CI:21-29) vs. two-dose vaccination (33%;95%CI:31-35). 30 Additional studies may be needed to clarify these comparisons, recognizing the challenge in standardizing based upon the time since last event (infection or vaccination). Immunogenicity studies conducted during the pre-Omicron period show a single BNT162b2 vaccine dose among previously-infected individuals elicited robust antibody and T cell responses, exceeding two-dose response in the infectionna\u00efve. 31-34 In epidemiological studies conducted pre-Omicron, one or two BNT162b2 doses in Israel reduced the pre-Omicron re-infection risk by ~80%",
