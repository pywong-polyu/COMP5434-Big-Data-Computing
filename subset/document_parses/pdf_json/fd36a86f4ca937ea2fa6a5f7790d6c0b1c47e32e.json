It has negatively impacted on the health and wellbeing of populations directly through infection, as well as through serious societal and economic consequences such as unemployment and underemployment [2] . Furthermore, there is evidence that vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected in terms of both, their health and the socioeconomic impact [2, 3] . Individuals with increased vulnerabilities to the disease include people with disabilities, the elderly, and people living in poverty [3] . Groups at greater risk of suffering from economic loss include those with underlying health conditions, older people, women, young persons, as well as migrant and unprotected (e.g., casual) workers [2] . Even before this pandemic, \"vulnerable workers\" were recognized as those in higher risk occupations or vulnerable because of their health or socioeconomic circumstances [4] . Therefore, someone with an underlying health condition would be more vulnerable to more serious health detriments from COVID-19, as well as being at greater risk of poverty as a result of this pandemic. Moreover, disadvantaged individuals may have lower educational attainment, have poorer health, and live at or below the poverty line [5] . Thus, such disadvantages can compound one another. It has been argued that this compounding effect increases the likelihood of such individuals becoming vulnerable workers (for example, they may be in more insecure work) [6] .",

For example, if they had a severe respiratory condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), they could be more susceptible to serious COVID-19 complications [7] . Such individuals, along with those suffering from many other health conditions and disabilities, could be more severely impacted by this pandemic in terms of their health and wellbeing. Furthermore, they might have to take greater preventive measures to avoid being infected (such as socially isolating themselves, especially as some workplaces may pose an increased COVID infection risk [8] ), and thus could suffer more in socioeconomic terms. Even before the pandemic, it was noted that those with disabilities and long-term health conditions were significantly disadvantaged in the workplace, sometimes facing discrimination and receiving lower rates of pay [9] . Disability is also associated with lower educational attainment, higher morbidity, lower employment rates, and poverty [10] . The disabled suffer further handicap in that they often need higher earnings to achieve the same standard of living as an able-bodied person [11, 12] , for example, due to their higher heating, care, and transportation costs. Therefore, if the COVID pandemic is affecting the socioeconomic wellbeing of populations globally, is it possible that those who were already disadvantaged, such as the disabled, would suffer even more than others (that is, populations not considered to be more vulnerable)?",

Occupational health is the health discipline that focuses on the interface between work and health, particularly concerning the effects of work on health and the health and fitness of individuals to work in specific jobs. Occupational health professionals include physicians and nurses, as well as others such as physiotherapists, ergonomists, and occupational hygienists [13] . Therefore, professionals working in this field will have intimate experience of the impact of work (or lack of work) on the health of workers, including those in disadvantaged groups, in circumstances such as this pandemic. This may be the case whether the OH professional is a clinician, academic, researcher, or works at policy level, as they are all interested in this interplay between work and health. The primary aim of OH is to protect and promote workers' health [14] . The International Commission for Occupational Health (ICOH) is the oldest global scientific association in this field and has over two thousand members in 93 countries [15] . We believe that the views of ICOH members would, hence, be particularly appropriate for evaluating the effects of this pandemic on vulnerable workers in the context of health and work (including unemployment and underemployment).",

A researcherdesigned online survey questionnaire was deployed using the Google form platform. The questionnaire was shared with OH professionals through the ICOH community [16] . The questionnaire (see Appendix A) consisted of open-ended and closed questions in English. It was divided into the following four sections: respondents' views on their government and employer responses to COVID-19, work-related access to personal protective equipment (PPE), the impact of COVID-19 on work and employment (especially in relation to vulnerable groups), and demographic data of respondents. This questionnaire was shared via email within the ICOH community through ICOH chairs and secretaries of all the ICOH scientific committees and all ICOH country secretaries. The inclusion criteria were that the respondents were members of ICOH. There were no exclusion criteria. However, in practice, the respondents were most likely to be those contacted directly by e-mail (that is, Chairs and Secretaries as listed above). Data was collected over a period of two weeks in May 2020. Given the short window of data collection, there was limited opportunity for other members to respond. Therefore, although the total ICOH membership is just over 2000, the denominator is likely to be smaller than this. Participation in the survey was voluntary and anonymous.",

Examples include improving control of the pandemic or opening up the economy with appropriate risk assessments and controls in place. Whereas such measures would likely improve the situation for most workers, these were not specifically targeted at the more disadvantaged populations. (ii) Specific action for a group, for example, returning migrants safely to their hometowns. (iii) Focused support, for example, improving the social and economic support for vulnerable groups, including unemployment benefits (for the unemployed) and other financial assistance, food delivery, and providing a social safety net. Retraining vulnerable workers to have transferable skills or IT skills was also suggested.

However, this description is likely to be apt for OH professionals in most sectors globally as they are involved in assessing, advising, and monitoring those working and aiming to return to work in the midst of this pandemic. More recent papers related to COVID-19 and work, mainly from an OH perspective, address subjects as diverse as the reporting of occupationally acquired COVID-19 in all sectors [22] and the safe return to work of those who had been \"shielding\" because of COVID-19 due to possible risk factors, and of those who had contracted COVID-19 [23] . Therefore, OH professionals are well placed to have informed and cogent opinions on which groups of workers might be or become more adversely affected by this pandemic. Therefore, although our data consists of subjective responses to our questions, we believe that the opinions of OH professionals are especially valuable in this context.

In contrast, those working in the informal sector were more likely to be considered to be a vulnerable group in Africa (86%) than in Europe (60%) or Asia (58%). This may reflect how those in this sector are organized. For example, it is possible that more workers are in this sector in Africa than in Europe. However, this may not fully explain the difference in perception of vulnerability, given that there are likely to be many in this sector in Asia and they were not rated there as being a more disadvantaged vulnerable a group as compared with migrants (73%) or those with disabilities (62%). Indeed, in Asia, migrants (73%) were the most likely to be considered further disadvantaged by COVID-19. This may reflect the nature of workforces on the Asian continent, as well as there being little or no structural support for this group of workers. Women (8%) and the unemployed (42%) were the two groups the least likely to be rated to be further disadvantaged in Asia. As noted in the global section of our analysis, women were generally not thought to be further disadvantaged, and this was reflected in the continental figures, i.e., Europe 29% and Africa 8%. As we commented above, this does not reflect concerns in the current literature that women are a particularly vulnerable group in these COVID times and may be a learning point for OH professionals.

            "text": "In response to Q23, we were particularly interested by those suggestions of fundamental reviews of inequalities and discrimination that lead to some populations being more disadvantaged and leading to their greater susceptibility to pandemics. This resonates well with other published papers that have examined this aspect of the pandemic. For example, we note that inequities in terms of race and ethnicity [33] and other societal inequalities [3] lead to worse health outcomes in this COVID pandemic. The multidimensional nature of disadvantage in this context, which includes poverty, poorer health and education, less secure work or unemployment, multifaceted discrimination, and lack of social support, leads to various vulnerable populations suffering much worse effects from the pandemic in terms of both their health and their ability to work [11] . In turn, economic loss can lead to poorer health (for example by not being able to afford adequate nutrition) and poorer health can lead to a decreased ability to work. These vicious cycles between work and ill health are especially acute in disadvantaged populations and made even be worsened by the health and socioeconomic impacts of this pandemic. We believe, therefore, that enlightened approaches to recovery from this pandemic should not merely aim for a \"return to normal\", but rather, seek to ameliorate the situation for disadvantaged populations in a lasting way. For example, a United Nations Development Programme (UNPD) report [34] on recovery from the COVID crisis noted that responses should be multidimensional, be viewed through an equity lens, and focus on people's long-term capabilities. The UNDP uses the capability approach [35] , which is an economic theory that places as its central focus the individual's capabilities (what an individual is able to be and do) and \"functionings\" (this is a term used in the capability approach and means \"what the individual is able to achieve in terms of her capabilities\"). This UNDP report also highlighted the plight of those in precarious employment in this pandemic, such that government responses must \"reach those weak links of the social and economic fabric as well as those who have already been left behind, supporting their basic capabilities and enabling subsistence\" [34] . It encourages policies enabling social protection in ways that that reduce existing inequalities and that empower individuals to achieve their development. In the capability literature, health is seen as a prerequisite to achieving one's other capabilities [36] and the ability to live a life that one values [37] , and therefore maintaining and protecting the health of vulnerable populations is especially important in the midst of a pandemic. One should also note the importance of addressing disadvantage in ways that respect the individuals concerned [26] . Indeed, it has been argued that this current pandemic has offered us the opportunity to learn to do this [38] .",

            "text": "This study has some strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, it was a crosssectional survey done at the height of the pandemic, therefore, it provided us with timesensitive information from a relevant period (May 2020) during its unfolding of the pandemic. It also captured data from different countries, which allowed us to make regional comparisons (by continent). However, we do not have a denominator, that is, the number of possible respondents who could have completed the survey. Nevertheless, authors of a survey in a comparable context argued that the lack of denominator did not impact on their outcome [39] and we agree with them. We do not believe that this affects our findings either. Another criticism that could be levelled at our survey is that we are reporting subjective opinions. We have argued above that OH professionals are uniquely placed at the interface of work and health. Their active involvement in this pandemic [17] , therefore, provides us with valuable insights from arguably the group most conversant with our survey questions. We also note that we had not made it explicit in Q21 whether we meant vulnerability to further health or socioeconomic deterioration. It is the latter deterioration that was the focus of our interest. It is possibly fortunate that our colleagues interpreted the question as we meant it, as we can infer by their responses in Q23, which all describe socioeconomic solutions or strategies. Nonetheless, if this survey were repeated in the future to assess whether OH professionals' views had changed in time, it would be preferable to specify \"socioeconomically disadvantage\" in Q21. A future study might also clarify Q22 further by having different parts to this question, for example, by asking respondents first whether they thought their governments were already taking relevant mitigating actions. Nonetheless, in our study, we were more interested in using Q22 as a preamble to the qualitative free-text replies to Q23, so we do not feel that the current wording of Q22 had a detrimental impact on our study findings. However, the methodology used, which was a bespoke questionnaire (as there is no validated questionnaire that would have elicited the information of interest) and the low numbers in our study, limit the generalizability of our findings.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our respondents most often identified workers with job insecurity (that is, those in precarious employment or in the informal sector) as the disadvantaged groups likely to suffer further detriment due to COVID-19. The majority felt that their governments could take some action to mitigate these effects. There were suggestions of short-term alleviation such as financial and social support. There were also calls for more fundamental reviews of the underlying inequalities that leave populations vulnerable to a crisis such as COVID-19. These approaches resonate with the recommendations of a UNPD report [34] . Occupational health professionals are well placed to promote the importance of equity in future strategies and policies in the changing world of work [40] . Indeed, in relation to vulnerable workers, it has been argued that OH professionals have a key role [4] and a moral duty [6] to encourage policies that improve social justice and reduce inequalities. We also hope that by highlighting the plight of workers in insecure work during this pandemic, this paper will encourage future research, maybe around the systemic inequalities that lead to this situation. Fairer societies will likely be more resilient to future global crises. *National lockdown *Other: Please comment Q6: What media platforms have you used to access information on COVID-19?

Subventions (but not enough controlled in practice, especially among private sectors). Introduce permanent infrastructure to deal with poverty and inequality.
