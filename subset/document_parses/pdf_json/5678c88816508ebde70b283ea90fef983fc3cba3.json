Stomach pains and diarrhoea may occur in some cases, and the loss of the senses of taste and smell is also reported. Some patients may develop pneumonia with severe breathing difficulties, cough and fever and may need to be admitted to intensive care treatment units. Examination of the lungs usually finds changes consistent with viral pneumonia.

As Covid-19 is a new disease, however, little is known about its impact on HRQOL. In Italy, a retrospective analysis of HRQOL using SF-36 and involving 673 cases one month after discharge from San Salvatore Hospital in Pesaro found that Covid-19 caused a substantial reduction in patients' physical and mental health conditions. That study indicates that physical and emotional roles, vitality and social functioning were highly affected dimensions [9] . A retrospective study in China indicates that Covid-19 has a substantial impact on the physical and psychological dimensions of HRQOL [10] . Another multicentre follow-up study from China indicates that Covid-19 has a substantial effect on HRQOL, with some impacts persisting more than three months after discharge [11] .",

We used the STROBE cross-sectional checklist when writing our report [17] . In addition, about onethird (29.1%) were treated with dexamethasone. Furthermore, nearly two-thirds (59.3%) received intranasal oxygen supplementation ( Table 1) . The overall mean HSU of the EQ-5D index score was 0.688 (SD: 0.285) ( Table 2 ). The overall mean HSU of the VAS score was 0.690 (SD: 0.129) ( Table 3 ). There was significant variation in the mean HSU score across age groups (p < 0.001). The mean EQ-5D index score among those older than 55 years was 0.567, while it was 0.783 among those younger than 25 years. In general, the mean EQ-5D index scores were significantly lower for respondents with comorbidity (0.574) than for those without comorbidity (0.777) (p < 0.001) ( Table 3 ). The EQ-5D index score was significantly lower among those with hypertension, chronic cardiac diseases, chronic pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus than among those who did not have those comorbidities. Those who received dexamethasone and supplemental intranasal oxygen had significantly lower EQ-5D index scores than those who did not receive them (p < 0.001), but there was no difference in the EQ-5D index score across gender and place of residence (urban vs. rural). The mean HSU for VAS score was 0.629 among those older than 55 years, whereas it was 0.732 among those younger than 25 years. Moreover, the mean VAS scores were significantly lower for respondents on intranasal oxygen (0.604) than their counterparts (0.749) (p < 0.001). Respondents who received dexamethasone treatment (p < 0.001),with hypertension (p < 0.002), chronic cardiac disease (p < 0.005), chronic pulmonary disease (p < 0.001), diabetic mellitus (p < 0.001) and asthma (p < 0.001) were associated with lower VAS score ( Table 3) .",

The patient's age, having asthma as comorbidity, and general health status during admission were significantly associated with low HSU values. On the other hand, those who were treated with dexamethasone had significantly higher HSU values (P-value < 0.05) ( Table 4 ). [20] and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (69.44) [22] . Moreover, the mean EQ-5D index score among Covid-19 patients on discharge was 0.688 (SD = 0.285).In general, these findings are in line with those of a study in Iran that reports an EQ-5D index score of 0.612 [13] and a Belgian study with an EQ-5D index score of 0.620 [18] , but our findings are substantially lower than those of studies from Norway (EQ-5D index score: 0.820) [19] , China (EQ-5D index score: 0.949) and Hong Kong (EQ-5D index score: 0.897) [20, 21] . Variations in the HRQOL evaluation method employed (i.e., health utility tariff, tools, scale, study participant sampling) may also, to some extent, contribute to the discrepancy. The studies in China, Iran, Argentina, Belgium and Norway employed the EQ-5D-5L instrument, while our study employed the EQ-5D-3L. Moreover, the variation in age distribution may be a driver of variation in HRQOL across countries, and the population in our study was relatively younger (mean age = 40) than in other places. In our study, respondents age 55 and above years old had a significantly lower HRQOL than younger people (0.567 vs 0.783). This is similar with finding from, Iran(0.554 vs 0.618) [13] , China (0.963 vs 0.889) [20] , and South Africa (0.655 vs 0.501) [22] . Moreover, in regression analysis, age was also significantly associated with health utility status. This finding is in line with a find from Argentina study [23] . According to the Argentian study, those older than 50 were 5.6 times more likely to have poor HRQOL than their counterparts. This finding can be explained by increased mental stress, comorbidity and debilitation in the physical condition of older people [24] . In contrast, those middle-aged males (26-35 years) patients were five times more at risk of having poor HRQOL in Saudi Arabia compared with older counterparts (55-65 years) [25] .",

In addition, this study used the Zimbabwe tariff due to the lack of an Ethiopian tariff, and this limitation could impact the estimation of the real Ethiopian HRQOL against the disease, as there are many differences between the two countries. Moreover, due to the study's cross-sectional design, we could not compare the HRQOL of patients before the Covid-19 infection.In conclusion, the Covid-19 disease substantially impaired the HRQOL of patients in Ethiopia. Elderly patients and Covid-19 patients with comorbidity had notably low HRQOLs. Therefore, close clinical followup and psychological treatment should be encouraged for these groups. Moreover, the health utility values from this study can be used to evaluate quality adjusted life years for future cost-effectiveness analyses of prevention and treatment interventions against Covid-19.EQ-5D-3L: Euro Qal-5 Dimension-3 Level; HRQOL: Health-related quality of life; HIV: Human immune virus; HUI: Health utility index; HSU: Health state utility; LOS: Length of stay; ICU: Intensive care unit; SD: Standard deviation; SF-36: Standard format-36; VAS: Visual analogue scale; WHO: World Health Organization.",
