This trial will be performed in the EDs at Denver Health Medical Center (Denver, CO), Johns Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore, MD), and the University of Mississippi Medical Center (Jackson, MS), sites representing approximately 225,000 annual adult visits, and designed using the PRECIS-2 framework for pragmatic trials. When complete, we will have enrolled a minimum of 125,000 randomized patient visits and have performed 13,965 HCV tests. In Denver, the Screening Trial will serve as a conduit for a distinct randomized comparative effectiveness trial to evaluate linkage-to-HCV care strategies. All sites will further contribute to embedded observational studies to assess cost effectiveness, disparities, and social determinants of health in screening, linkage-to-care, and treatment for HCV.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends HCV screening for all adults aged 18 years or older at least once in a lifetime and routine periodic screening for individuals with ongoing risk. Despite these recommendations, in many healthcare settings, screening for HCV is driven by risk [9, 10] . However, individuals commonly do not know they are at risk, clinicians may be too busy to perform risk assessments, or patients may be unwilling or unable to provide risk information [11] . Thus, support for the performance of non-risk-based (nontargeted) screening has grown, similar to what was seen with HIV screening [12] [13] [14] .",

This article describes the rationale and design of the Screening Trial and is reported in accordance with the SPIRIT Statement for clinical trials [20, 21] . The primary hypothesis of the Screening Trial is that nontargeted HCV screening is significantly associated with increased identification of new HCV diagnoses when compared to targeted HCV screening.

This increase in number of visits randomized reflects a 2.6-fold increase over the number originally estimated to be randomized (i.e., 50,000). Moreover, test acceptance (i.e., actual: 26% for nontargeted and 34% for targeted vs original: 60%) and RNA+ prevalence were significantly lower than originally estimated (i.e., actual: 42% vs original: 65%). Thus, we performed a series of additional simulations using methods described below to estimate the power to test the primary study hypothesis (Tables S1 and S2). Using both weighted and inverse probability weighted estimates to account for individual site contributions to total tests offered, tests accepted, and tests completed by study arm, while also using a two-way data table (Table S3) to model potential combinations of Ab+ prevalences by study arm using known aggregate Ab+ prevalence (and assuming RNA+ prevalence would not differ by study arm), we performed a series of additional simulations to estimate the power to test the primary study hypothesis.",

Institutional review board approval was originally granted on December 17, 2017. Patients who present to the ED during trial performance will receive standard-of-care medical evaluation and treatment, may be asked questions about their risk for HCV, and may be offered, as voluntary and routine practice, rapid HCV testing using an opt-out consent mechanism. Consent for HCV testing will be integrated into routine emergency medical care as is currently standard. The medical care for those patients who do not receive HCV testing will not vary from those who do, except that among those who are tested the medical care team will know the patient's HCV antibody test result and may alter the medical evaluation based on this additional information. Because HCV testing is a standard of care and because this trial will be evaluating two processes for performing HCV screening in this clinical setting (i.e., nontargeted vs. targeted screening), this potential change in care is consistent with current medical practice.

Given the pragmatic nature of the study, however, it will be critical to provide sufficient education and oversight, while allowing processes to function, and possibly evolve during the course of enrollment, on their own. Striking this balance is critical to ensuring the results and inferences of the trial reflect actual practice to the extent possible. Enrollment monitoring will be critical to the performance of this trial to ensure optimal ongoing oversight while allowing both forms of screening to occur as they would in actual practice.",

Furthermore, secular trends related to the diagnosis and treatment of HCV may influence numbers of patients identified with active HCV. Since planning and initiating enrollment in this trial, treatment of HCV has become more commonplace, less cost prohibitive, and more accessible. Finally, this trial began prior to the COVID-19 pandemic but has continued through the various waves, which may influence patient volumes and ED care.",

Informed by medical literature, past experiences with HIV screening in EDs, and pilot data, we made the following assumptions: (a) nontargeted screening, 100% test offer, 60% test acceptance, 70% test completion, 5% Ab+ prevalence, and 65% RNA+ prevalence among those who test HCV Ab+ and (b) targeted screening, 33% test offer, 60% test acceptance, 70% test completion, 10% Ab+ prevalence, and 65% RNA+ prevalence among those who test HCV Ab+. The original sample size estimate was performed using series of 1000 simulated trials and a hypothesized effect of a 25% increase in the number of new HCV diagnoses (i.e., risk ratio [RR] = 1.25), resulting in a minimum of 50,000 visits across all sites to achieve a power >80% (\u03b1 = 0.05). This was estimated to result in 13,965 completed HCV tests and 611 confirmed newly diagnosed patients",
