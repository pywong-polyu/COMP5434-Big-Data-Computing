Additionally, because orthopedic research plays a vital role in physician education, changes to the characteristics and content of published literature can have lasting impacts on future teaching and learning.

This effect of COVID-19 on the clinical practice of orthopedics has been widely documented, from redeployment efforts to postponement of elective surgeries, changes to personal protective equipment (PPE) in trauma cases, and more. However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on peer-reviewed articles published in the orthopedic surgery literature. With the pandemic representing a core topic of daily life and medical discourse amongst colleagues in 2020, it's hypothesized that COVID-19 also had a significant impact on the characteristics, content, and time to publication of the orthopedic surgery literature.",

However, the median time to publication of 24.5 days for all articles is faster than the median time to publication of 129 days reported for orthopedic journals prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001).2,3 The month of April 2020 had the greatest number of articles published (56), with progressively lower numbers of publications J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in every month thereafter (Figure 2). The peak of number of publications in April occurred one month after the first global peak in COVID-19 cases in March 2020. The average length for all manuscripts was 2,317 words long, and the average number of references was 19. Analysis of the themes of each COVID-19 publication demonstrated that nearly all COVID-19 related articles in the orthopedic literature (98%, n=195) discussed changes in healthcare delivery. Sixty-seven percent (n=134) of all COVID-19 related articles fell under the theme of \"global response to the pandemic,\" meaning they discussed the varying approaches taken by different countries in response to COVID-19. Fifty two percent (n=103) examined changes to orthopedic trauma practice. Twenty seven percent (n=53) covered changes to orthopedic teaching and mentoring during the pandemic, meaning they discussed residency and fellowship suspensions and implementation of videoconferencing software. For the first thirty articles published, a dominant theme was firsthand accounts of the orthopedic experience during COVID-19, with 70% (n=21) of these articles being classified as commentaries/editorials and 27% (n=8) original research articles. In the next thirty articles published, only 40% (n=12) were commentaries/editorials and 47% (n=14) original research articles (p<0.05). Additionally, of the first 100 articles published, 60% examined the global response to the pandemic, compared to 75% of the next 99 articles (p<0.05). Similarly, in the first 100 articles published, 49% (n=49) originated exclusively from the United States, whereas only 25% (n=25) of the next ninety-nine articles had US-only institutions (p<0.001).",

            "text": "the COVID-19 pandemic, orthopedic surgeons demonstrated innovation by creating novel personal protective equipment, adaptability when elective surgeries were of orthopedic journals included in this study published articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating an intentional focus amongst orthopedic surgery journals on sharing pertinent knowledge and valuable experience relating to COVID-19.Furthermore, the fact that the 14 journals represented 26 different countries of origin highlights the global emphasis of the pandemic and its highly disruptive impact on the normal practice of orthopedic surgeons. Particularly, 36 publications (18%) had more than one country of origin, which reinforces the idea that regardless of the institution or country, many orthopedic surgeons shared similar experiences in terms of difficulties and newfound, required flexibility in operating during the pandemic.Because orthopedics is typically not directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, it follows logically that the majority (60%) of orthopedic publications discussed COVID-19's impact as relating to the practice and experience of general orthopedic surgery. Additionally, the finding that orthopedic trauma (19%) had the most publications compared to any other subspecialty is consistent with the fact that trauma cases remain unavoidable and inherently emergent, even during a global pandemic. As such, this finding suggests that trauma orthopedic surgeons were more likely than other subspecialty surgeons to quickly seek out pertinent clinical data and changes to guidelines for trauma practice during the pandemic. Interestingly, the relatively equal proportion of original research articles (47%, n=92) vs. editorials or commentaries (46%, n=90) seems to further imply a relatively equal demand by orthopedic surgeons for both clinical data and anecdotal perspective pertaining to the pandemic.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Orthopedic surgery journals and their editorial teams also deserve immense praise during this time for their integral role in expediting review and publishing timelines from a median time of 129 days to 24.5 days during the pandemic. 7 This added efficiency allowed for not only the quickest dissemination of pertinent knowledge relating to COVID-19 and orthopedics, but also the unified and continued advancement of the overall field of orthopedic surgery in a time of limited in-person collaboration. At the same time, the downward trending number of orthopedic publications relating to COVID-19 per successive month in 2020 (Figure 2) demonstrates a decreased research focus on the pandemic as the year progressed, potentially due to a combination of reader, researcher, and writer fatigue and a diminishing quantity of new clinical insights relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.Nearly all COVID-19 orthopedic papers examined healthcare delivery (98%, n=195 articles) while 67% of the orthopedic articles additionally discussed global responses to the pandemic. This illustrates an almost universal and global dialogue by orthopedic researchers on the pandemic's impact on patient outcome and patient satisfaction as well as continued discourse on the best mechanism for delivering orthopedic care after the pandemic, including adoption of virtual technology and improved PPE.4,8 There was an early predomination of commentaries and editorials in the first 30 articles (70%, n=21), but the proportion of original research articles increased in the next 30 publications (47%, n=14, p<0.05). Specifically, articles published earlier in the pandemic focused on quickly sharing firsthand perspectives on life as an orthopedic surgeon during the pandemic in regions of the world affected earlier and more severely, so that orthopedic surgeons in later and less affected areas around the world could better prepare themselves for the coming demands. of all COVID-19 papers discussed changes to teaching and mentoring, stressing the orthopedic community's close attention to maintaining the rigorous education of orthopedic surgeons and learning from the experiences of the pandemic to improve future teaching and learning. The COVID-19 pandemic stimulated creative and novel solutions for maintaining rigorous orthopedic surgery training, including virtual journal clubs, video-based learning, and simulated virtual reality cases.8,9,10,11 A number of orthopedic articles further discussed the added value of a hybrid virtual and in-person approach to residency and fellowship education after the pandemic, while surveys of orthopedic surgeons demonstrated a consistently positive opinion on specifically continuing virtual seminars with audience interaction and online case presentations.11,12,13 Some articles also emphasized the utility of videoconferencing in bolstering information dissemination and networking, which allowed for increased exposure to thought leaders around the world and easier multi-institution research.10,14 For example, the increasingly international research focus and collaboration (49% US-only institutions in first 100 articles vs. 25% in next 99 articles) hints at the potential for a future with sustained, increased interconnectivity, a novel way of leveling and raising the overall playing field of orthopedics. On the other hand, a handful of new practices were poorly received by residents, including online tests, virtual patient consultations, and non-standardized interview processes for residency recruitment, indicating any continued implementation of these measures should be approached with caution.12,15  In a post-COVID-19 world, it remains to be seen how the nature of a hybrid integration will develop with regards to teaching and learning.",
