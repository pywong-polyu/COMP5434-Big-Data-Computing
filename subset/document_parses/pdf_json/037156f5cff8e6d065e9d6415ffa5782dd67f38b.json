We compared macrophyte beds along the Guaragua\u00e7u River (South Brazil) over four years, using taxonomic and functional dimensions. Biodiversity descriptors were higher in the driest periods compared to the rainiest, although this difference seems to be decreasing over the studied years. Moreover, the spatial organization of biodiversity and community structure slightly changed over time. Such spatial community stability was highlighted by the dominance of the highly invasive tanner grass. In beds dominated by the invasive species, the biodiversity was reduced. As aquatic macrophytes represent an important group in water bodies, the long-term loss of seasonal differences in community structuring is of concern, mainly regarding its potential to impact other groups and ecosystem functioning. By analysing data from standardized monitoring, we were able to identify a poorly discussed facet of biotic homogenisation-the seasonal homogenisation. We also discussed the impact of massive development of invasive species and its consequences for biodiversity in a Neotropical river of outmost importance for biological conservation.",

It is well established for aquatic macrophytes that spatial and temporal changes in species composition are explained by a combination of processes, including seasonal changes, dispersion, hydrological variation and environmental filtering (Lacoul and Freedman 2006; Bornette and Puijalon 2011; Fritz et al. 2017; Ceschin et al. 2017) . At larger scales, dispersion and landscape (including hydrology) are common drivers of the diversity of aquatic plants (Rolon et al. 2010) . Within an ecosystem without barriers for dispersal, environmental filtering of species is the predominant factor. Characteristics such as nutrient concentrations (Lacoul and Freedman 2006) and salinity are important drives of macrophyte communities ) and, in this sense, precipitation is expected to be a key factor shaping macrophyte communities (Pav\u00e3o et al. 2017) , given it can directly control nutrient load, physicochemical characteristics, and also affect species' dispersion particularly in environments with seasonal differences in rainfall and with geographic features that highlight effects of rain in hydrology.",

Among the consequences of anthropogenic impacts is the promotion of invasive species. Negative impacts associated with invasive species are well described (Simberloff et al. 2013) , particularly in aquatic systems . In this respect, the dominance of invasive macrophyte species is probably the most emblematic anthropogenic impact on aquatic macrophyte communities at ecosystem scale Bolpagni et al. 2020) . To illustrate the importance of this impact, the Brazilian hyacinth Pontederia crassipes Mart. is considered one of the world's worst invasive species (Lowe et al. 2000) . Interestingly, in some Brazilian aquatic environments in which P. crassipes is native, one of the most successful invasive species is the African tropical tanner grass Urochloa arrecta (Hack. ex T. Durand & Schinz) Morrone & Zuloaga (see Amorim et al. 2015) . This species was introduced in many countries as a robust and resilient pasture grass, a former common practice in coastal areas of South Brazil (Ara\u00fajo et al. 2021) . In Brazil, the sad history of Urochloa species invasion is also associated to accidental introduction given its use as mattress for slaves in slave ships (Sato et al. 2021) . The high growth rate, wide physiological tolerance and rapid evolutionary responses of this species result in a very aggressive invader in aquatic macrophyte communities (Michelan et al. 2010; Bora et al. 2020) . It is well documented that U. arrecta dominates aquatic macrophyte beds and replaces native plant species (Amorim et al. 2015) . Nonetheless, this response may depend on the richness and biomass of the native species (Michelan et al. 2013 ). Therefore, one can expect that different facets of biodiversity will be distinctly affected by the occurrence and dominance of U. arrecta in macrophyte beds.",

Indeed, it has been recognized that functional diversity might help to understand the relationship between the biota and ecosystem functioning, as well as the effects of disturbances on the ecosystem's stability and resiliency (Petchey and Gaston 2006; Cadotte et al. 2011; Flynn et al. 2011) . Similarly, functional diversity may also be a better proxy for the effects of anthropogenic drivers on the phenomenon of biotic homogenisation (or 'biotic homogenization', see Olden et al. 2018) . Management actions that could serve to maintain or even increase diversity over time and space are better defined if the functional role of species in ecosystems is taken into consideration (Song et al. 2014) . In this sense, it is important to highlight the need for long-term monitoring programs in order to capture the major temporal and spatial patterns occurring in the different components of biodiversity (Hussner 2014) ; particularly given that nuisance control of macrophytes is extremely difficult (Hussner et al. 2017) . Beyond that, long-term monitoring can help to detect effects of environmental changes, and can provide evidences of biotic homogenisation as a result of species invasions (Strayer et al. 2006 ).",

We hypothesized that the main drivers of macrophyte diversity are: i) seasonal pattern of precipitation driving the temporal variation, and ii) the presence and dominance of the invasive tropical tanner grass and, the changes in environmental conditions along the river, leading to spatial variation. Yet, regarding the spatial variation, we expected lower values of taxonomic and functional diversity associated to increased U. arrecta dominance, and in sites near the mouth of the river, given that salinity is a limiting factor for aquatic plant colonization (Haller et al. 1974 ).",

Also, there is conspicuous longitudinal variation, with distinct microhabitats along the course of the river (Lana et al. 2001) . It is colonized by aquatic macrophytes along its entire length. The river has a linear total extent of about 60 km and is the largest river of the coastal basin of Paran\u00e1 State, South Brazil. It is located in one of the best preserved reminiscent of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000) , known as Lagamar. Lagamar is the set of estuaries in South-Southeast Brazil (mainly Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo States) with extremely high importance for conservation, considered as a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site (<https:// whc. unesco. org/ en/ list/ 893/>). Its headwaters include multiple streams located in the Serra da Prata/Serra do Mar range at an elevation of 766 m above sea level, inside the Saint-Hilaire/Hugo Lange National Park. The region has a tropical and super-humid climate. The average accumulated rainfall is 2300 mm year \u22121 . The rainfall is distributed throughout the year, but there are marked differences between summer and winter: the rainiest season occurs in summer, with an accumulation of about 800 mm year \u22121 , and the driest season occurs in winter, with an accumulation of about 280 mm year \u22121 (Vanhoni and Mendon\u00e7a 2008) . Given the geographic layout of Guaragua\u00e7u river (formed by mountain streams and flowing in the coastal plain), water flow and material leaching is severely affected by extreme rainfall events that occur mainly during the rainiest season in the mountain chains that harbours the headwater streams (Pinto et al. 2012) . The mean temperature is between 17 and 21 \u00b0C (Vitule et al. 2006) .",

Averages of each trait from all samplings were then used to calculate functional diversity (see 'Data analysis'). We selected the most different modules possible in each macrophyte bed (the largest, the smallest and one common-sized intermediate) in an attempt to represent most trait variation of a species within a macrophyte bed. However, due to clonal and vegetative reproduction, it is very likely that modules of a same bed are from a same clonal individual. We consulted specialized bibliographies (APG 2009; Pott and Pott 2000; Moura-Junior et al. 2015) to determine the life form (emergent, rooted floating, free floating, rooted submerged, free submerged, amphibious, epiphyte) for each species. Functional traits abovementioned are commonly used in studies of aquatic macrophytes (e.g. Fu et al. 2014 ) and provide important information on biological responses to environmental variation, since they might affect critical stages of colonization and establishment, as well as the adaptive value of species (Violle et al. 2007; Cavalli et al. 2014) .",

In TBI, a dissimilarity index is calculated for the same sites between two moments or times, and through permutations the sites which had an extraordinary level of dissimilarity in relation to the others are identified. The analysis can also provide the components loss (B) and gain (C) of the dissimilarity index, and they can be differentiated through a permuted paired t test. Therefore, the analysis can inform us if there were more losses or gains in abundance-per-species and/ or species occurrences between the distinct times or dates. The second approach was the betadisper function (Anderson et al. 2006) , intended to inform about the whole dissimilarity (using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index) of the river compared between each sampling. In summary, the betadisper approach calculates the dispersion around the centroid of a given group (i.e. variance) using a dissimilarity matrix, and then compares the dispersion among groups. In our case, the betadisper approach informed us if there was any sampling period with higher or lower taxonomic variation among the sites sampled in the river. Also, compositional changes were evaluated through Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA; Anderson 2001) . The TBI and betadisper approaches were also performed using the community-level weighted means of trait values (CWM), in order to analyse temporal changes in traits. For that, the Euclidean distances were applied to standardized CWM values. The CWM is the average value of a trait in the community, considering the relative abundances of each species. Therefore, CWM represents the dominant value of a given trait in the community.",

Instead, dissimilarity between subsequent seasons seems to be decreasing over the fouryears of standardized monitoring, both for taxonomic and functional facet of the macrophyte metacommunity. Even so, one seasonal pattern was observed: the spatial differences in community composition were high after winter.

            "text": "The occurrence of seasonal variation in macrophyte community was expected based on the above-mentioned seasonality in rainfall. In summer, the resulting community may probably be shaped by a higher dispersion of individuals and changes in establishment, due the higher rainfall and temperature, and the increased amounts of nutrients in the water. The higher dispersion and nutrient input in the water would be especially important for floating species (Trindade et al. 2018; Hussner et al. 2021) . The patterns in traits highlighted by the use of TBI approach on CWM matrix data corroborate our hypotheses. The increase in leaf width in summer might be a result of nutrient stimulus to growth, as larger leaves allow the capture of more sunlight and, therefore, increased biomass production (Chambers et al. 2008) ; or a response to enhanced water flow (Franklin et al. 2008) . The increase in foliar area usually seen in summer is consistent with this idea, although the pattern of increases and decreases was not as consistent as that for leaf width. The level of herbivory on leaves did not change with time, suggesting that other interactions and factors are probably more important in the temporal dynamics of these communities, such as physical and chemical conditions of water (e.g. Lindholm et al. 2020) or underwater herbivory (e.g., Bakker et al. 2016) . The increased stem width associated, in general, with winter is a difficult trait to associate to possible seasonal changes, because it is a species-specific response (Puijalon and Bornette 2004) and can be associated to other factors, such as water flow (Boci\u0105g et al. 2009 ) and nutrients (Lamberti-Raverot and Puijalon 2012), in opposite directions; but it may also mean a trade-off of less investment in leaves and more investment in storage after the relatively harsher conditions of winter (see also Cornelissen and Makoto 2014) . Even though our empirical data allow us to speculate, only detailed environmental data and experiments would determine exactly which factors are influencing seasonal differentiation in traits (Jiang et al. 2008; Stefanidis and Papastergiadou 2019) .",

In our experience, the TBI approach applied to the CWM matrix was promising and showed interesting patterns discussed above and below. The seasonal effects described above are also corroborated by considering together the trend of increase in number of shared species and reduction in the variance (i.e., distances to centroid) among sites in summer, and the increase in the gain component (C) of TBI in transitions from winter to summer. This high similarity associated to summer is expected considering the homogenising effects when the ecosystem has disturbances (see Thomaz et al. 2007) , which in our case are those associated to increased rainfall.",

Taking into consideration the interplay between spatial and temporal dynamics, we suggest that, after winter, the local factors spatially structuring the river probably increase in importance. The rationale for that is the reduction in homogenisation and nutrient supply in the water, promoting differentiation between the communities as the environmental conditions become more dissimilar (Thomaz et al 2007) . An interesting issue to be studied in the future is how long does it take for these seasonal variations to occur. One might hypothesize that the changes from winter to summer are faster than changes from summer to winter because the populations may respond quicker to increased temperature, nutrients and light (see also Lindholm et al. 2020) .",

This temporal reduction, despite the absence of any clear evidence of changes in general trend of rainfall during the studied period ( Fig. S15 in Appendix), might indicate a trend toward biotic homogenisation. Biotic homogenisation was firstly introduced as a continuous temporal trend of decreasing biodiversity due to many 'loser' and few 'winner' species (McKinney and Lockwood 1999) . As research evidence accumulated, different facets of biotic homogenisation phenomenon were reported (Olden et al. 2018; Padial et al. 2020) . Here, we present another interesting facet: the temporal decrease in seasonal variation, i.e., the seasonal homogenisation. We suggest that this is a concerning facet of biotic homogenisation, given that other organisms that depend on seasonal variation of macrophytes may also be affected, decreasing the biodiversity at long term. Moreover, we also found that spatial differences among the classes of U. arrecta dominance (discussed in details below) also depend on seasonality. If macrophyte community organization and biodiversity became more similar between seasons, so a higher constancy in the effects of the invasive U. arrecta may also be expected.",

            "text": "In addition to the well-known impact of the gradient in environmental conditions along the river on the structure of the communities, our results clearly demonstrated that distribution of species and biodiversity indexes respond to the dominance of an invasive species. Indeed, the effect of U. arrecta on aquatic macrophytes in Guaragua\u00e7u River showed clear spatial and temporal components. The spatial effects include the, until now, absence of this invasive species in the 'Caixetal' (upper river) and Mangrove (down river) ecosystems. In the particular case of the 'Caixetal', we do not know whether physiological tolerances, the lack of opportunities (dispersion of enough propagules upward the river) and/or the more preserved terrestrial vegetation prevent its establishment in this area (Evangelista et al. 2017; Teixeira et al. 2016 ; but see Pott et al. 2011 reporting U. arrecta invasion in presence of Tabebuia insignis (Miq.) Sandw.). This component of spatial structure makes it more complicated to disentangle which are the main factors promoting the higher dissimilarities among the sites without U. arrecta: if it is its absence or other factors (e.g., physical and chemical conditions) that we did not measure. Even so, a previous study comparing neighbouring macrophyte beds have also demonstrated that U. arrecta decreased biodiversity and promoted compositional changes at different spatial scales (Sato et al. 2021 ). The analyses on our monitoring data reinforce this conclusion and add that U. arrecta effects extend to the entire river length. This is of particular concern given that a previous study has demonstrated that this invasive species can show rapid adaptive responses to cope with increased salinity (Bora et al. 2020) , so the overwhelming effect of the invasive species can extend toward the mangrove, central areas for conservation in the Lagamar region (Ara\u00fajo et al. 2021) . After nuisance growth, management and control efforts are complex and in most cases, not effective (Hussner et al. 2017) .",

            "text": "It is interesting to note that the temporal dimension of the effects of U. arrecta on the system is the variation of the distances to centroid in a direction opposite to that seen in the sites where U. arrecta is absent. In winter, the sites categorized as 'dominant' are more similar to each other than in summer. This opposite direction of increase and decrease between sites where U. arrecta is dominant and where it is absent, probably explains why the significant differences in distance to centroids among these categories occurred in winter and not summer. This indicates that more than affecting spatial community structuring (Sato et al. 2021) the invasive tanner grass can also change the temporal dynamics of macrophyte communities. We hypothesized two main factors, acting in conjunction, for the enhanced similarity among sites where U. arrecta dominates in winter. The first is the supposedly more frequent removal of beds of U. arrecta because of higher water flows due to rainfall in summer, releasing space for the establishment of other plants. In this scenario, the main limiting resource macrophytes are competing for would be space. The second is the known and widely reported high tolerance and rapid evolution of U. arrecta to a wide range of environmental conditions (Bora et al. 2020 ). This high tolerance, together with its high growth rate (Amorim et al. 2015; Michelan et al. 2010; Thomaz et al. 2009 Thomaz et al. , 2012 , make this species one of the most potentially invasive plant species known (Michelan et al. 2010) . Indeed, traits related to nutrient absorption in invasive species, for instance, are commonly associated to invasiveness (Hussner et al. 2021) . In winter, the total nutrient load in the river is lower due to the reduced water flow (Mizerkowski et al. 2012) . Under this likely limiting condition in winter, the invasive U. arrecta could have an advantage over the other aquatic macrophytes, in addition to shaping the beds' local environmental features that could reduce the chances of establishment of other species. One example of seasonal change is the progression of its biomass towards the pelagic zone, resulting from its growth above its own biomass, leaving no space in the littoral zone for other emergent plants (Bao et al. 2015) . The presence of free-floating species on beds where U. arrecta is dominant corroborates this rationale. Yet, the decomposition of U. arrecta biomass and the diminished circulation of water between its stems, could favour an accumulation of nutrients in the adjacent water, allowing the free-floating plants to prosper after ending up trapped by the extensive U. arrecta macrophyte beds (e.g., Dainez-Filho et al. 2019) . Furthermore, the dominance of the established U. arrecta can hamper the recolonization of other species (Michelan et al. 2018) , promoting a positive feedback.",

Even so, it is important to mention that the main homogenising effect of U. arrecta was probably observed in the first years after its establishment in the river (see e.g. Vitule et al. 2007 ). Since the first sampling period, the extensive U. arrecta beds were already established over all river (A.A.P. personal observation; see also Ara\u00fajo et al. 2021) . It is important to highlight though that expansions towards other river stretches such as the mangrove is possible, since this species demonstrates rapid evolutionary responses to salinity (Bora et al. 2020) . We here reinforced the threat to biodiversity promoted by U. arrecta and the seasonal component of this threat. The continuing monitoring is central to reveal how metacommunities will evolve in Guaragua\u00e7u River ecosystem (see also Hussner 2014) .",

A temporal pattern in biodiversity was found, in which more species are shared among the sampled sites in summer than in winter. As a consequence, the traits of the communities also tended to vary more in winter than summer. We suggest the rainfall accumulated over the seasons is the main driver of changes in environmental conditions, which will shape locally the communities over time. We hypothesize that in winter, the communities are under more limiting conditions, and local specific characteristics become more important, favouring higher differentiation among the communities. This alternation or fluctuation in aquatic environments is a key factor driving the food web in these environments (e.g. Contente et al. 2011b) , and changes in the patterns can impact the whole ecosystem (Maltchik et al. 2007 ). Thus, by understanding the temporal dynamics of the Guaragua\u00e7u River communities and the dominance of U. arrecta, impacts of future scenarios, such as severe events (e.g., droughts) or changes in the distribution of rainfall during the year, can be estimated. In particular, it will be important to assess how individuals will respond to the interaction of different environmental cues, such as a result of climate change (e.g., Fukushima et al. 2021 ). Finally, we showed the negative effects of the invasive U. arrecta are also influenced by the season, and its effects are more evident in winter, although observed in all periods. Studying the consequences for the invasive U. arrecta is necessary to explain community and ecosystem modification related to other biological groups and process important to humans and future generations.",
