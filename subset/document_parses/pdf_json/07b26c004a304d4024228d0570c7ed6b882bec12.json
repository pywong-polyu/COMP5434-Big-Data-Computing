Diet and physical activity patterns are strongly linked to chronic health conditions such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity [1, 2] . This assertion is relevant throughout the world, as rates of obesity and non-communicable diseases continue to increase and threaten public health [3] . In the United States, the rate of adult obesity (BMI \u2265 30) has reached 42.4% [4] . Louisiana, with an adult obesity rate of 35.9%, is one of 12 U.S. states with a rate greater than 35% [5] . Louisiana also ranks 46th among the states in sedentary behavior, with an adult physical inactivity rate of 31%, and with less than 20% meeting the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans [6] . Compared to other U.S. states, Louisiana ranks higher in death rates due to heart disease, stroke and diabetes [7] . The Small Changes, Healthy Habits (SCHH) community-based nutrition education program was developed to help adults throughout Louisiana, establish healthier food and physical activity behaviors as part of their daily routine. Over the long-term, these behaviors could promote maintenance of healthier body weight and reduced risk of chronic diseases.",

Currently, most Americans are overweight [5] and appear to be more interested in managing their weight by developing lasting, healthier eating habits than by engaging in on-and-off intensive dieting [10] . Yet, many lifestylebased weight loss interventions have demonstrated only short-term effectiveness [11] , with much of the lost weight regained within the first year [12] . A systematic review of weight management strategies and outcomes suggested that it could be more productive for interventions to focus on development of healthy habits in addition to relevant lifestyle change [13] . This research was echoed by a study in which obese individuals described the need for balance with everyday life as important for weight loss and management [14] .",

As an automatic behavior, a habit is less prone to motivational lapse, which is important for long-term behavior maintenance. A medium to strong habit-behavior correlation has been calculated for both healthy eating and physical activity habits, suggesting that habit formation could increase resistance to unhealthy lapses and help sustain these target behaviors beyond a given intervention [16] . Habit formation principles have been applied to behavior change practices with positive outcomes [17, 18] . Furthermore, the integration of these principles was found to be acceptable to participants and helpful at modifying and automating behaviors [11] .",

The agents managed recruitment locally, advertising through newspapers and newsletters, with flyers placed in libraries, hospitals, and government agencies, with Facebook posts, and e-mail blasts. There was no charge to enroll in the SCHH pilot program. However, potential participants were asked (though not required) to commit to attending all four sessions of the program and to participate in the evaluation process.

The program development team included nutrition, education, and evaluation specialists, and community nutrition practitioners from the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center. This curriculum was designed to be delivered in four sessions, over a four-week period. Each session was to last 90 to 120 min. The day of week and time of day was determined independently by each community nutrition agent; it varied among the 10 program sites.

This was used to assess participant's consumption of key foods and beverages, home food preparation behaviors, food selection and use of nutrition facts labels, and physical activity and sedentary behaviors. The pre-program survey also contained demographic items. Many survey items were adopted from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; some were original items intended to assess unique aspects of the SCHH program. A 10-item habit assessment tool was adapted from the Self-Reported Habit Index (SRHI) [25] and the Self-Reported Behavioral Automaticity Index (SRBAI) [26] . This was developed to measure the strength of each participant's self-selected healthy eating or physical activity goal in terms of the degree of automaticity. Using a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are you in your ability to . . . Determine which foods are the healthier options when selecting foods from restaurants, food stands, fast food outlets, vending machines, etc.? Determine which item is the healthier option when choosing between similar food items at the grocery store?",

Procedure and design: The SCHH pilot program was conducted from September to November 2019. The program participant evaluation utilized a pre-post survey design to collect data (self-reported) to capture short-term changes made by participants.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic hindered follow-up data collection and value, as access to participants as well as participant routines were significantly altered.

Over the four-week program period, there was no real change among participants in consumption of foods or beverages from any of the targeted categories. However, there was noticeable progress in the sedentary behavior measure. Participants reported a decrease of approximately 1 h/day (61 min) of sitting time. The mean time spent sitting significantly decreased (p < 0.01) from 338 min to 277 min per day. The pre to post mean differences in physical activity measured as 0.2 days/week and as 11.1 minuets/day were not significant (Table 3) . All 47 participants responded to the items that asked if they were watching or reducing their salt or fat consumption or the types of fats they were consuming. Although 40 of these participants experienced no change in how they deal with salt or fat in their diets, seven of these participants made favorable improvements, indicating that they now pay closer attention to dietary salt or fats. As a group, this improvement was significant for fat (p = 0.03) and for salt (p = 0.01). A similar analysis was also applied to the items on confidence in food preparation skills and food selection skills. No discernible improvements were made by these participants in knife skills or selecting appropriate cooking methods. However, there were significant favorable improvements in confidence to prepare healthy meals at home, with 16 participants improving (p = 0.04); to determine healthier prepared food options, with 19 participants improving (p = 0.01); to determine healthier options between similar foods, with 23 participants improving (p < 0.01); and to distinguish \"everyday\" from \"occasional\" foods, with 21 participants improving (p = 0.01) ( Table 4 ).

There was a complementary favorable improvement among 15 participants who reported increased frequency of home meal preparation (Table 5 ). There was also positive improvement in the use of nutrition facts labels. For food product purchases in general, 15 participants reported favorable improvements (Table 5) . Pre-program, four participants reported that they \"Rarely\" or \"Never\" read Nutrition Facts labels; by post-program, all four had shifted to reading labels \"Sometimes\" or \"Most of the time\".

Understanding the label enables people to make informed food choices, especially in reference to sodium, fat, fiber, whole grain, and added sugars. SCHH participants improved their use of food labels, and their confidence to determine healthier food options. Yet, they did not change consumption patterns. Participant data hinted at the intended change in consumption of fruits, dark green vegetables, drinking water and regular soda, which might require longer than one-month to establish. It is also possible that the food consumption tool could not detect change in this group size. An alternative survey item will be used going forward. Participant intake of sugar-sweetened beverages did not change at all, suggesting that additional emphasis on non-sugar-sweetened beverage alternatives be added to the curriculum. A recent study examining strategies for promotion of healthy eating found that sugary beverages were among the most difficult \"foods\" to control, and that gradual (small) dietary changes were among the strategies found to be most effective [36] .",

A sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers, whereas physical activity of any kind or duration helps diminish risk to these diseases, improves longevity, and promotes a healthier life [38, 39] . Over the SCHH program period, participants significantly reduced, by 61 min/day, the time they spent sitting. As part of the SCHH program, participants were asked to create a small physical activity goal. These physical activity goals might have contributed to this reduction in sedentary behavior. Time spent being physically active did not significantly increase; yet, the additional 11 min/day is beneficial, and should not be discounted.",
