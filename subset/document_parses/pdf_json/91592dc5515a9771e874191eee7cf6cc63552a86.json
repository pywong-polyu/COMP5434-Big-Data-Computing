            "text": "The multidisciplinary surveillance program Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic InfectIONS (VIZIONS) project was conducted to explore the zoonotic potential of viruses across different rural sites in Vietnam [4] . Studies focussed on small-scale farmers who house several different animal species within a small area with minimum biosecurity and may also eat wild animals or be involved in commercial wildlife farming, processing, or selling. Such activities increase the likelihood of pathogen transfer between wildlife, humans, and domestic animals. Another component of VIZIONS was hospital-based surveillance. Metagenomic sequencing was used to identify viruses in samples collected from 2012 to For the study, 2100 faecal samples collected from human and non-humans in Vietnam between year 2012 and 2016 were subjected to a viral diagnostic algorithm and put through a next generation sequencing (NGS) process [4, 10] . Of these, 1258 samples were obtained from human subjects: 707 samples were collected from patients admitted to hospital with diarrhoea and 551 samples were obtained from a high-risk cohort in Dong Thap province (farm households, animal health workers, abattoir workers, poultry slaughterers, rat traders). In parallel, 842 samples were obtained from a variety of non-human animals in Dong Thap including: rats which were farmed or traded in the live markets (n = 315) and 93% were from rat species Rattus argentiventer (commonly known as ricefield rat and is a species of rat found throughout Southeast Asia); bats whose faeces were collected from roosting sites for trading (n = 179); domestic pigs (n = 270) and farmed wild boar (n = 15). A smaller number of samples were collected from domestic dogs (n = 45), cats (n = 13), monkeys (n = 3) and goats (n = 2). Information on host species, sampling date, location and other attributes is available for all samples [11] .",

The combinations of substitution models, clock models, and population size models were evaluated by stepping-stone methods: a SRD06 nucleotide substitution with uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clocks and a constant-population coalescent process prior. Priors of substitution rate were chosen according to published evolution rates from related genera in the family Picornaviridae [8] , using the mean rate of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 sub/site/year with SD = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 .

However, the sequences sampled from bats (mainly Scotophilus kuhlii from bat roosts in three regions in Dong Thap) separate into three adjacent clusters (Parechovirus|Bat-C1 to Parechovirus|Bat-C3) with a TMRCA of 294 years ago (95% HPD 102 to 536 years), with VP1 nucleotide identities of (71-74% (C1/C2), 59-65% (C1/C3), and 60-65% (C1/C3), suggesting that they are members of three different types of a novel species (Figure 6A,B) . The closest relation to these Vietnamese bat sequences is QAPp32 (lMK348056) (48-59%, 60-62% and 57-58% aa identity in the polyprotein, P1 and 3D regions, respectively), which was recently sampled from a bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) in China and belongs to Parechovirus D [23] . In addition, we found one novel sequence (Parechovirus|VZ-Rat, 22057\u00d767-9) from a rat (Rattus argentiventer) which groups with Sebokele-virus-1, a member of the species Parechovirus C, and isolated from wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in Africa [24] , with which it shared 62% nucleotide identity ( Figure 6A ). The partial polyprotein of the rat virus (length = 3670 nt, with complete P1 and partial P2 coding regions) shared 78% aa identity to Sebokele-virus-1, and 75% identity in the P1 region ( Figure 6C,D) .",

In our study, picornaviruses were found in 67% of bat samples, with 57% of these representing multiple picornavirus species detection from the same sample.

We also found that there was a clear distinction between human viruses and non-human animal viruses. No animal picornaviruses were detected in our human samples, including those picornaviruses known to infect humans via zoonotic transmission (including equine rhinitis A virus, equine rhinitis B virus, foot and mouth disease virus, and members of the species Cardiovirus A, Cardiovirus B, Enterovirus E, Enterovirus H and Parechovirus B) [7] . Similarly, although human enteroviruses can be detected in a range of animals, including bat, rat, pig, chicken and non-human primate [43] [44] [45] [46] we did not detect any human picornaviruses [7] in animals, even when they had close human contacts.
