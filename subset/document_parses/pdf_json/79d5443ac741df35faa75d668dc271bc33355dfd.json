These symptoms lead to an increased burden of care and increased costs for governments, communities, families and individuals, and a loss in productivity for economies [3] .",

This plan highlighted that the current gap between the care needed by PwD and the care provided to them is wide [1] . As dementia progresses, impairments of cognitive function are commonly accompanied and occasionally preceded by deterioration in emotional control, social behaviour, or motivation [2] , which add extra challenge and burden to dementia care. Around the 1990s, there was a movement in the field of dementia care, suggesting that PwD should be cared for in a person-centred manner. The \"person-centred\" perspective on dementia care was introduced in the care practice by Kitwood [4] , where \"the personality, past experiences, health, and other aspects of the person with dementia also influence how the person will behave in addition to neurological impairments.\" Hence, neurological impairment is important but is not the only component to be considered when caring for PwD. Each person with dementia is different, PwD do not lose their individuality, and therefore, as far as possible, PwD should be treated in an individualised way, taking into account their personality, life experiences and preferences. Therefore, personalisation is the core of Person-Centred Care.",

The Compassionate Design Toolkit by LAUGH is the first and only toolkit so far to guide designers in creating personalised designs for PwD, which is focused on the senses and life history of PwD [18] . However, personalised designs have long been regarded as expensive and have low social impact. Thankfully, with the development of technology, personalised designs are becoming more prevalent, as exemplified by smart speakers, recommendation systems, fitness trackers and other products and services that can adapt to individual's preferences, behaviours and experiences effortlessly [19] . These products and services point out a direction for the development of personalised designs for PwD to be more comprehensive, low-cost and hence, having a higher socioeconomic impact.",

Then the users are advised to frame the behaviours of the person as a way for expressing their unmet needs (\"needs and behaviours\"). This could be done through interviews with caregivers or careful observation of the person. To understand what the unmet needs could be, the users could combine the insights gathered about the current state of the person (\"capability insights\", \"interaction insights\", and \"data insights\") and take into account the past of the person (\"life history\") to form a comprehensive view of this person. In this way, all the factors suggested by the NDB model will be covered, which helps the users to identify the possible unmet needs. After the unmet needs are identified, the users can then refer to the interventions (\"non-pharmacological interventions\") for inspiration; and use all the insights presented in the canvas to design for the person. The summary of non-pharmacological interventions is intended to help the users to be aware of what interventions are out there in the medical field and thus dig into each intervention if needed (instead of performing a literature review from scratch). The users do not have to stick to one type of intervention; rather, they are encouraged to think about the theories behind the proposed interventions and how these theories could be applied when designing personalised dementia care.",

Second, the layout was adapted from A3 to A4 since most of the offices in the nursing home can only print A4 papers. Third, the capabilities mentioned in the capability card set were added to the canvas to help the care team reflect on the remaining capabilities of each resident. Moreover, some short answer questions were changed into a checklist since the care team has limited time, and they are more familiar with a structured way of working. Lastly, the language changed from English to Dutch since this canvas was deployed in the Netherlands, where all caregiver participants are native Dutch speakers.",

The designs developed by the students in the Advanced Concept Design course were selected and added on the Know-me website as the first batch of examples to be showcased to help designers who would like to use the toolkit in the future. Next, the capability card set could adopt a layered design since some designers prefer an overview of all the capabilities while other designers would like detailed information about these capabilities. A capability card set with multiple layers could help the designers to retrieve detailed information when needed while maintaining an overview. Lastly, advice will be given to designers on how to use the toolkit with the care team.

Feature-by-feature comparison of the \"Know-me\" toolkit with similar state-of-the-art toolkits on design for dementia care. Table 3 , the main strengths of the \"Know-me\" toolkit are the explicit involvement of healthcare professionals as co-designers in the design process, the added component in Data-enabled Design, the usage of layered design in some of the tools that can interact with users in the digital format. The tools that adopted the layered design are the co-design guide and data exploration guide. Some students indicated that the capability card set would be easier to use if it had a layered design. The weaknesses of the \"Know-me\" toolkit are that: it is less visible on search engines (i.e., Google), and not all components of the toolkit can be printed easily. These weaknesses are also the areas for improvement of the \"Know-me\" toolkit in the future, which also coincide with the feedback by the students. We think the tension between \"layered design\" and \"printer-friendliness\" could be solved by developing two versions of the Know-me toolkit: one version is interactive with layered design; the other version is printer-friendly. The users can choose which version they prefer during the design process.",

Not being able to interact with PwD directly during the COVID-19 pandemic was another limitation of this evaluation study. This caused some tools in the toolkit to be used less than others (e.g., co-design guide) due to a lack of direct contact with PwD; however, it is ethical to prioritise the health of PwD during the pandemic.
