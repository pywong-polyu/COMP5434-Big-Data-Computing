The pandemic has disproportionately affected women, who account for 56% of the almost 20 million jobs lost from February to May 2020 (Ewing-Nelson, 2020) . Compared to men, women reported higher rates of pandemic-related, negative changes in sleep, productivity, mood, worries about health, and frustrations with not being able to do what they usually enjoy doing (Palsson et al., 2020) . Women under age 50 reported more overall emotional impact from COVID-19 than their male counterparts. Studies have also demonstrated that women were more likely to increase alcohol consumption during the early stages of the pandemic, due to their disproportionate psychological stress (Neill et al., 2020; Rodriguez, Litt, & Stewart, 2020) .",

Moreover, recovery from SUDs is most successful with abundant recovery capital, or resources that facilitate and sustain recovery including social support, employment, health care, and an overall sense of meaning and purpose in life (Hennessy, 2017; A.B. Laudet, Becker, & White, 2009; A.B. Laudet & White, 2008) .

Meeting this demand will require research that offers empirical, in-depth understanding of how the pandemic has shaped the experience of SUD recovery, particularly in vulnerable subgroups such as women. Yet, to date, this research is scarce. In one Dutch study, 15 men and women in SUD treatment or recovery completed a single interview in March-May 2020 (DeJong, Verhagen, Pols, Verbrugge, & Baldacchino, 2020) . Participants overwhelmingly reported negative feelings such as guilt, gloom, fear, panic, restlessness, and stress as well as reduced feelings of connectedness to health care and support groups.

Participants then rated their level of agreement with statements adapted from Timpka and colleagues' study on intentions to perform nonpharmaceutical preventative behaviors during influenza outbreaks (Timpka et al., 2014) . Based on protection motivation theory and the health belief model, these measures assessed perceived susceptibility and severity of infection, trust in information, and self-efficacy to perform protective behaviors (e.g. hand-washing, staying home, and avoiding close social contact or public transport; see Fig. 2 for full list of items). Participants responded on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\") and study staff invited participants to provide qualitative comments elaborating on their response. In the final interview, participants repeated the ASSIST items, and those who reported any use of substances, not including tobacco, were determined to have relapsed. Participants received $20 for completion of the baseline survey, $15 for the one-month and two-month follow-up and $20 for the three-month follow-up. Study staff transcribed all responses into REDCap\u00a9 simultaneously or audio-recorded the interviews and transcribed them immediately after the interview.

For domains of overall life and sobriety, we also performed evaluation coding, assigning values to indicate if responses revealed negative change (\u2212 1), neutral/ no change (0), or positive change (1) from the previous month (Salda\u00f1a, 2015) . Independent raters double-coded data from one-third of the participants completing all three months and resolved discrepancies through group consensus. We then conducted line-by-line inductive coding, and through periodic debriefing and investigator triangulation, constructed and applied a hierarchical, thematic codebook throughout the dataset. We synthesized data in each domain using Dedoose matrices and coding outputs that allowed examination of thematic data by domain, month, and participant characteristics.

As in the general population (Holingue et al., 2020; Jean-Baptiste, Herring, Beeson, Dos Santos, & Banta, 2020) , participants shared a common experience of isolation from social networks and some also experienced devastating lack of income or limited access to health care. In the second month, women began regaining access to recovery capital as the local government scaled back restrictions. By the final month, the perception of societal reopening brought women relief and renewed hope in their ability to regain the recovery capital that had been lost or threatened. Throughout the study, those who relapsed or were tempted to use again described COVID-19related stressors as significant threats to their sobriety, though most participants were ultimately able to remain sober. For women recovering from SUDs in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, accessing necessary recovery capital often involved placing themselves at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Throughout the three months of this study, women generally felt like they knew how to protect themselves from COVID-19 and worries about contracting the virus centered less on the threat of direct physical consequences and more on the threat that a positive diagnosis would result in further restriction from recovery capital. Societal adaptations helped women to maintain some sources of recovery capital, notably, the swift transition of SUD treatment and support to virtual platforms. Yet women expressed the most hope about their lives when they had more opportunities to engage in the outside world, like serving in frontline jobs or reuniting with friends and family. Societal reopening toward the end of the study corresponded with lower worry about infection and lower self-efficacy for preventative behaviors. However, one month after the final interviews, Kansas City reported a record number of new infections and a 60% increase in COVID-19 deaths, leaving individuals seeking external recovery capital at an even greater risk of infection.",

Experts believe that in general, communities and states are well-positioned to optimize SUD recovery by building recovery-oriented systems of care (ROSC), or systems of macro-level, coordinated services that promote access to recovery capital. As communities and states come together to manage COVID-19, coordinating efforts to maintain strong ROSC should be on the agenda. Strategies that ensure access to and easy navigation of social services, housing, employment, and health care in a rapidly changing world must take into account the unique needs of people with SUDs. Such strategies may include virtual platforms that link recovery communities with ROSC, as well as peer navigator programs, which have a strong evidence base for health promotion in this population (Li, Weeks, Borgatti, Clair, & Dickson-Gomez, 2012; Scott, Grella, Nicholson, & Dennis, 2018) . Peers may also be vital conduits of information, given the mixed levels of trust in information coming from government sources among women in our study. COVID-19 prevention messaging tailored to people in recovery should also reaffirm their need for access to recovery capital, but with enhanced safety. Given the higher risk for severe disease as well as increased likelihood for exposure given their congregate living situations and employment in frontline jobs, governments should also prioritize people struggling with SUDs in COVID-19 vaccine distribution.",

As social stresses related to COVID-19 continue to disrupt lives, women recovering from SUDs will continue to seek the resources they need to maintain sobriety.
