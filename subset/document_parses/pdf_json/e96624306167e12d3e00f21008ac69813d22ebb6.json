However, contamination incidents from unauthorized GM rice varieties have been encountered. To date, no GM rice crop has been authorized for consumption and/or commercialization in Korea. Therefore, to enhance safety management of unauthorized genetically modified organisms (GMOs), accurate and reliable detection methods are needed to identify GMOs in crops or products. In this study, we developed rapid detection methods for GM rice events (Bt63, KMD1, Kefeng6, Kefeng8, and LLRice62) using ultra-fast PCR system. Ultra-fast PCR is a state-ofthe-art technology and decreases PCR run-times dramatically. However, the ultra-fast PCR is not widely used in GMO analysis. Thus, we designed a detection method for five events of GM rice and confirmed them by performing specificity, sensitivity, and applicability assays. All results demonstrate that the ultra-fast PCR system is a specific, sensitive, and reliable method to identify and monitor GM rice events. Additionally, it can be utilized as a rapid and simple method for GMO analysis in crops or processed products. This study can be used as a reference for future research on new analysis methods of unauthorized GMOs.",

Also, the inspection takes a very short time, comparatively, it is 18% of the conventional PCR inspection time and 23% of the real-time PCR. There is an advantage in that the test results can be confirmed in a short time due to short duration between cycles and high thermal conductivity of the device. In addition, it is possible to apply the test not only in a laboratory but also in the field, as a portable type small analyzer is able to be supported. In conclusion, we developed a rapid and sensitive PCR method for five non-approved GM rice events, Bt63, KMD1, Kefeng6, Kefeng8, and LLRice62, which are under strict safety management. The ultra-fast PCR system has an economic advantage by using half the reaction reagent compared to the current PCR SD standard deviation method, and the reaction time is also very short, by about one fourth to one fifth of the existing methods, and the analysis equipment is portable so that analysis can be done in the field. Therefore, these advantages are expanding the scope of application. ",
