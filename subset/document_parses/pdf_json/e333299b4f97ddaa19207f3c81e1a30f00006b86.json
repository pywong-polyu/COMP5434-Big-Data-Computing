With restriction being gradually lifted, the surgical services have to face the pending burden of elective cases alongside the pandemic. The true impact of the pandemic and the COVID-19 on perioperative outcomes is still being discovered. This demands a COVID-specific consenting process in addition to the routine surgical consent, to ensure that the patients are able to make informed decisions. The first ever COVID-specific checklist for surgical consent 'COVID times-surgical consent checklist' is introduced. This checklist enables the surgeon to ensure that a discussion detailing the impact of COVID-19 on surgical services is made. It also acts as a documentation of the discussions carried out during the consenting process.",

While the virus continues to spread, the surgical diseases continue to occur. Initially many countries opted to postpone elective noncancer cases, to conserve healthcare workers and hospital resources, and to prepare the infrastructure to face the pandemic. However, as lockdown restrictions are being released, the healthcare set up is faced with the pent-up burden of postponed surgical procedures among continuing surges in COVID-19 cases. An essential aspect of restarting the surgical services is the consenting process. The 'COVID times-surgical consent checklist' that is introduced here enables the surgeon to have detailed discussions with the patient, covering all aspects of surgical care during the pandemic.",
