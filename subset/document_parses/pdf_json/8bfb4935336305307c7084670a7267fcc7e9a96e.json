The detection of seropositive newborns prior to the availability of viral testing in CT indicates that DBS surveillance may be a useful tool for COVID-19 surveillance where viral testing is limited. Most, but not all, mothers who screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period delivered a newborn with detectable anti-SAR-CoV-2 IgG antibody, a finding that may reflect the lag time in development of detectable antibodies after infection. 9 This study has limitations. Most mothers were screened for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of hospitalization for delivery, but we were unable to determine the true date of maternal infection. Because we did not have access to the date of infection or serum antibody testing results for all mothers, we were not able to determine whether mothers who screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR but delivered a seronegative newborn had poor antibody responses themselves, had a remote infection with antibody responded that waned prior to delivery, or whether there was inefficient transplacental transfer of antibody in these cases.

As dried blood spots are routinely collected from newborns, no additional sample collection is required, and specimens can be stored for later assessment. Using DBS as a surveillance tool may therefore be particularly advantageous in resource-poor settings, where innovative tools of field epidemiology will be required in order to control the spread of the virus. .

Overall 182/3048 (5.9%) DBS tested were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. None were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM. Of the 182 infants with positive antibody results, 134 had mothers who underwent testing for COVID-19 by viral PCR prior to delivery, of which 65 (49%) had a positive test and 69 (51%) had a negative PCR test. None of the pre-2019 cord blood samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by this assay. We examined the inter-relationship between daily newborn IgG antibody positive rates to maternal and statewide COVID-19 infection rates. The daily proportion of IgG positive DBS specimens were found to be predicted strongly by both maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection rate (p<0.001) and statewide COVID-19 daily positive test counts per 100,000 people (p=0.010). Further investigations using cross-correlation analysis demonstrated that daily newborn IgG antibody positive rate strongly correlated with maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection rate at zero lag time (r=0.47), and statewide COVID-19 positive test counts at a lag-time of 15-days (r=0.45). We examined maternal demographics and clinical factors that may be associated with the likelihood of a SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ infant. Of the 92 mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR during the universal screening period, 90 had complete demographic and clinical data, and 58 (64%) delivered infants that were antibody positive.
