The isolated Four Corners region of the southwestern United States was hit particularly hard with COVID-19 and the tertiary care resources are located at a substantial geographic distance. This distance resulted in many requests for air medical transport using both rotor-wing helicopters (RW) and fixedwing (FW) aircraft.",

It is possible that the 2 affected individuals had more exposure to infected patients than other personnel, which would make the overall risk less.

Although we should strive to avoid any infection that has the potential to cause morbidity and mortality and could be transmitted to other patients, colleagues, or family members, the incidence in this study is less than most of us working in this profession anticipated. This is reflected by the fact that some air medical programs in our region completely refused to transport any patients with suspected COVID-19 infection and others limited transport to patients who were intubated; thus, creating a closed ventilation circuit.",

The risk to EMS providers is not well known either. A recent study in King County, Washington, showed that only 0.4% of 700 providers involved in 274 encounters with patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection tested positive. 7 However, it is difficult to make a comparison as each provider likely had a single brief exposure rather than multiple very extended contacts.",

This is likely helpful based on limited data.2 Using a ventilator and tight-fitting unvented mask to deliver NIPPV, such that most or all expired air is directed through a HEPA filter, also makes good clinical sense and was the norm for agencies in our study as well. Of course, all patients not being ventilated were wearing procedure masks. It is not clear whether intubating patients before transport or avoiding certain types of oxygen therapy that may potentially generate more aerosols would offer additional protection.In this retrospective case series, air medical transport of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 using routine PPE including an N-95 mask resulted in a low rate of symptomatic infection among air medical personnel, despite many patients not being intubated and being managed with potential aerosol generating techniques. Until further prospective research can be completed this has implications for any health care settings that involve care of COVID-19 patients, especially in similarly confined spaces.
