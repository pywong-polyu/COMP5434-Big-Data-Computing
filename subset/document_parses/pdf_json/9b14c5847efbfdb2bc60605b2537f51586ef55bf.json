However, the range was large; region 1 had a 83% decrease in LTs performed per week while region 10 only had a 5.3% decrease. The average decrease in LTs performed per week by UNOS region was 41.8% (Figure 2A) . LT waitlist mortality also exhibited high variation around the country. Region 1 saw a 850% increase in LT waitlist mortality (from 0.05 to 0.5%) from week 10 to 15 while some UNOS regions in the Midwest (6, 7, 8, and 10) had no decrease in mortality over the same period.

Our results revealed that the decline in LTs performed in the United States was corelated with an increase in LT waitlist mortality in many UNOS regions, especially those with high-volume LT centers such as 3, 5, 7, and 10 who normally shoulder the LT clinical demand.

Regions with high initial COVID-19 rates in 2020 were forced reduce LT activity, including listing new patients, which unfortunately occurred in many highvolume centers with serious waitlist mortality consequences. Variations in social distancing practices, travel bans in and out of regions, and the availability of COVID-19 testing also likely contributed to the discrepancies in LT waitlist mortality seen between different UNOS regions (2, 20) .

At the time of this writing, <20% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and incidence rates are again rising in 28 out of 50 states (10), forcing some states such as Michigan to begin restricting elective surgeries. Additionally, there are over 16,000 COVID-19 variant cases in the U.S. as well (10) . These recent trends indicate that we have not overcome the pandemic, and must learn from the initial COVID-19 surge to better protect our liver transplant waitlist population. Specifically, there needs to be a standardization among transplant centers in reporting COVID-19 cases, ICU availability, and waitlist inactivations to maintain equity in access to LT across the United States. Second, we have seen that brief pauses in liver transplant activity lead to rapid increases in waitlist mortality, so operating room, ICU, and clinical resources need to be pre-allocated for the uninterrupted practice of liver transplantation through future pandemic surges. Finally, our results showed a rapid decrease in number of deceased donors during the initial pandemic surge, partly due to travel bans between states. In the event that future travel bans are implemented, transplant centers need to ensure that these restrictions do not interfere with the procurement of organs in acuity circles.",
