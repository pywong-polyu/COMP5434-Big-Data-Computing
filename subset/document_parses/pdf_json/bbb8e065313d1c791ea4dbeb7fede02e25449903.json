In particular, partiallyobservable stochastic processes specifically account for incomplete knowledge of a system that arises from having only incomplete knowledge about a situation. A common form of partial observation is one whereby the state of the system, or each component of the system, can be observed with only a certain degree of certainty. An example is the case of biological invasions, whereby an invasive species or individual of the species can be detected with only a certain probability upon each survey (e.g., see [8] ). Another application is in medical testing, where a test can provide a false negative, so that the infection can then only be detected with a certain probability for an infected individual upon administering the test (e.g., see [9, 10] ). Further applications of partially-observable stochastic processes include (but are not limited to) recognizing patterns [11] , analyzing digital signals [12] , and understanding biological processes [13, 14] .",

More precisely, we utilize a special class of stochastic processes, the partially-observable pure birth process, to model the dynamics of the COVID-19 population in Australia. In the present epidemiological context of modeling the COVID-19 outbreak, the main source of uncertainty comes from the stochastic dynamics of the system as well as the structure of sampling in which each infected individual can be tested with only a certain degree of certainty. Our model particularly suits situations where the number of infected citizens is minimal compared to the total at-risk population, which is the case for the majority of regional and national jurisdictions. This is a critical phase of disease spread, and requires policy measures that effectively control growth. The effectiveness of these policies, in turn, depends heavily on the quality of the models used and the precision of the estimates that they generate. The following two features of our model establish its benefits relative to other epidemiology models:",

A PO-PBP possesses two major parameters comprising the growth rate \u03bb t and the observation probability p t (cf. S1 Appendix). We construct the likelihood function of partial observations according to S1 Eq in S1 Appendix in conjunction with S1 Corollary in S1 Appendix, and truncate the involved infinite sums by utilizing S2 Eq in S1 Appendix and S1 Proposition in S1 Appendix. Then, the logarithm of the likelihood function is maximized over the range of parameters to find their maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). Finally, S2 Proposition in S1 Appendix is applied to predict the future values of partial observations. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the accuracy of predictions generated by the estimated models, the dataset for each nested real time step is partitioned into two mutually exclusive segments consisting of the training data to estimate the parameters and forecast future values, and the test data to evaluate the accuracy of predictions.

Although it is still less than one (indicating that the population is stable and not exploding), but such an increase as a consequence of people's interactions during the Easter break as well as releasing a few restrictions on 2 May 2020 should be taken into account by policy makers for easing out the COVID-19 restrictions. Furthermore, by considering the identifiability of estimations as well as Remark 7, it is observed that the locus allows for MLE(\u03b1 3 ) to range within [0.940, 1.020]. Hence, there is a chance that the parameter MLE(\u03b1 3 ) could be greater than one, implying that the population starts growing again. If this takes place, the population size will quickly resume exponential growth (cf. Fig 3) . Furthermore, analogous to Fig 5, the robustness of estimates is confirmed.

Furthermore, the Australian Government successfully controlled the COVID-19 population, reducing the number of cases to near zero, with subsequent outbreaks a consequence of people returning to the country. This trend is also consistent with our model's prediction, which suggested a trajectory of fewer unobserved (and observed) cases as we approach the endpoint. Tables 1, 2 and 3 , alter after each per-identified structural break point. These results confirm our choice of break points, and also motivate us to suggest an algorithmic way to detect the break points. In that case, the whole time frame can be partitioned into \u03c4 mutually exclusive time intervals (t k\u22121 , t k ) for k = 1, . . ., \u03c4, and the following dynamics for the growth rate parameter \u03bb t and the observation probability p t can be constructed:",

A natural question to ask is whether comparable accuracy can be obtained in this work by directly fitting a pure birth process to the data-segments that lie between break points. We have made this calculation and conducted the comparison with our PO-PBP model and found that although the PBP performs reasonably well, it is not as accurate as our PO-PBP.
