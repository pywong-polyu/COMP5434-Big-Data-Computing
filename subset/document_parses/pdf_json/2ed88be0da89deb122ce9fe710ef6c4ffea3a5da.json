Methods: Cross-sectional, observational survey and audit of medical doctors at a tertiary health service in Queensland. The Research Capacity and Culture (RCC) validated survey was used to measure self-reported research capacity/culture at organisation, team and individual levels, and presence of barriers and facilitators to research. An audit of publications and ethically approved research projects was used to determine research activity. Results: Approximately, 10% of medical doctors completed the survey (n= 124). Overall, median scores on the RCC were 5 out of 10 for organisational level, 5.5 for specialty level, and 6 for individual level capacity and culture; however, specialty-level scores varied significantly between specialty groups (range 3.1-7.8). Over 80% of participants reported lack of time and other work roles taking priority as barriers to research. One project was commenced per year for every 12.5 doctors employed in the health service, and one article was published for every 7.5. There was a positive association between a team's number of publications and projects and their self-reported research capacity and culture on the RCC. This association was stronger for publications. Conclusion: Health service research capacity building interventions may need a tailored approach for different specialty teams to accommodate for varying baselines of capacity and activity. When evaluating these initiatives, a combination of research activity and subjective self-report measures may be complementary.",

            "text": "Clinicians play a key role in shaping research agendas, generating research questions, and conducting research that enhances rapid translation of findings. 1 Studies have found that health services whose clinicians conduct more research tend to have lower mortality rates, greater organizational efficiency, better staff retention and higher patient and staff satisfaction. [2] [3] [4] Additionally, a key recommendation to improve the estimated 85% avoidable waste in health research is the increased involvement of health service-embedded clinicians in driving research agendas. 1, 5 In Australia, building research capacity of clinicians embedded within healthcare services has been identified as a key priority for health research, 6 and most recently as one of the 12 priorities for the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. 7 However, with increasing pressure on public health systems to meet activity targets and provide services to a growing and aging population, finding the time, money and resources to conduct research is challenging. Medical doctors are the second-largest health profession in Australia, 8 and have an important role in many types of health research from bench to bedside. However, only 7% of the medical workforce report active involvement in research, and it has been argued this is decreasing. 9 A key facilitator of building research capacity is an indepth understanding of context-specific barriers and facilitators, research culture, and the levels of and drivers for current research activity. In health services in particular, arguments have been made that traditional research output measures, such as publications, may need to be replaced or supplemented by process measures. 10 However, there have been very few studies comparing different forms of measurement in this context.",

There is currently little understanding of the relationship between validated measures of research culture and capacity, and traditional research activity and output measures.",

Each item is scored on a scale 1-10, with 10 being the highest possible level of skill or success, as well as an \"unsure\" option. The RCC also asks respondents to select applicable barriers and motivators to participate in research from a list of 18 of each, and prompts them to add additional barriers/motivators if desired. Lastly, the tool includes a standard set of demographic questions. Small modifications were made to the tool to better fit the target population, and additional demographic questions were included (eg participant's facility within GCH). For this study, participants were asked to reflect on their Medical College specialty (eg cardiology, general surgery) when answering questions about their \"Team\". This clarification was made as participants could have also interpreted \"team\" to mean their multispeciality or multidisciplinary team. The tool was administered via a secure online platform (Survey Monkey \u00ae ).",

[12] [13] [14] [15] A 2017 study using the RCC with Allied Health professionals in the same health service returned scores consistently 1-3 points higher for the organisation level, with an overall median of 7. 19 Reasons for this are unclear, as it is unlikely the organisation's research culture has changed so significantly in that time. The Allied Health clinicians also scored their team-level success slightly higher, with a median of 6, and their individual capability lower, with a median of 5. 19 Notably, both studies also found a high level of \"unsure\" responses, especially at the organization level, implying that the health service could improve communication and promotion of institutional research supports and initiatives. 19 Consistent with the Allied Health study, differences were identified between specialty groups at the team level, with mean scores varying from 3.1 to 7.8. Other research has also shown that different teams within the same health service may have different barriers, motivations and levels of research capacity and current activity. 11, 13, 19, 24, 25 Literature on research capacity building in health settings has found that team-based approaches are likely to be most effective, as they allow strategies to be tailored to specific needs. 11, [24] [25] [26] Tools like the RCC are a useful way for health services to capture their teams' current research engagement and needs.",

Over a third of projects involved collaborations with other professions like Allied Health and nursing, reflecting the importance of the multidisciplinary team in modern models of care. 27 Due to differences in how studies measure and report research activity, 28 it is difficult to compare research activity with other health services. 29, 30 Available international literature on research outputs from medical clinicians usually focuses on specific specialties, often further limited to registrars and academic doctors, rather than a whole of health service measurements. 16, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] However, one self-report survey found that for every 12.8 Australian physiotherapists employed in tertiary facilities, one article was published per year, compared to 7.5 doctors in this study. 36 We identified an association between a specialty group's research activity and their self-reported, subjective research culture and capacity. Publications demonstrated a stronger association than projects, likely because the two highest scoring groups on the RCC (1 and 5) had relatively few projects. Further investigation showed that one of these groups had a high proportion of multiphase, multisite and complex projects. This indicates that the number of projects may be a poorer indicator than the number of publications, as a simple project like a retrospective chart audit is counted equivalently to a multisite, multiphase interventional trial. The same can also be true of publications; however, complex projects will likely result in multiple publications, which helps offset this effect.",
