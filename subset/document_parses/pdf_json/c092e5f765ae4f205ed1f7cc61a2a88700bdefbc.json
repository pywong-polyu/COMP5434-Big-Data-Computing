Two probands declined cascade screening due to fear over genetic discrimination. Nine total relatives engaged with the FH Foundation. Mean age was 43 years and 44% were women. Seven of those relatives (from 6 families; 55% screening rate) consented to be screened for FH with lipid measurement and genetic testing. The two additional relatives -men ages 39 and 49 -agreed to lipid measurements but not genetic testing, each noting he would like to think more about genetic testing.",

Of note, 90% of FH probands had family members screened for FH.

            "text": "Because of several unique characteristics of the US healthcare setting (e.g., nearly 1000 different healthcare payers with varying coverage policies), cascade screening efforts within the US have lacked a centralized approach as established in the Netherlands. Prior research protocols for cascade screening in the US have not utilized aspects of the Dutch approach. The MyCode Genomic Screening and counseling (GSC) Program at Geisinger has reported the return of genetic testing results to 125 individuals found to have FH pathogenic variants [3] . Although these individuals were invited to have their blood relatives screened, only 4% of families were screened. The West Virginia University Coronary Artery Risk Detection In Appalachian Communities (CAR-DIAC) Project screened lipids in 5th-grade students throughout rural Appalachian West Virginia ( n = 637) [16] . These children were then seen in pediatric lipid clinics and relatives recruited for screening, but only 5% of families were screened. Overall, several factors have likely affected the reach of cascade screening among US FH families: lack of centralized coordination, little direct contact with probands and relatives outside of usual healthcare settings, a system that relies on family members to travel to an appointment to be evaluated in a healthcare setting, and possibly inconsistent use of genetic testing. To maximize detection, multiple complementary approaches to FH diagnosis may be beneficial in the US, including centralized cascade screening as explored in this study as well as child-parent cascade screening as has been advocated by others [17] .",

In the Netherlands -where genetic discrimination laws are stricter than US -fewer people (10%) declined genetic testing due to fear of social consequences (such as testing having a negative impact on employment and insurance) [ 10 , 11 ] . While the U.S. Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008 bars the use of genetic information in making decisions related to health insurance or employment, there are no provisions baring discrimination in obtaining life or longterm care insurance [19] . As noted by others, GINA has failed to alleviate anxieties about medical genetic testing, despite the fact that as of 2019, only 48 unique court cases were resolved involving GINA [19] . Efforts are underway to remove the exceptions from GINA, and in the state of Florida, life insurance companies are prohibited from using genetic information in underwriting unless the information is accompanied by a diagnosis of a medical condition [20] . Nonetheless, until this issue is further addressed in the US, this may remain a barrier to widespread acceptance of genetic testing in FH.",

Our timeframe was short and our sample size was small. On average, we recruited only 1.5 relatives per proband who had family willing to be screened, which may be below a previously published threshold for cost-effectiveness [21] . Before broad implementation, the Dutch cascade screening model requires further adaptation to account for differences between the Dutch and US health-care systems, especially regarding barriers experienced by US FH patients such as insurance gaps with a job change or loss and suspicion related to genetic testing. Other issues that must be considered are screening and diagnosis of underrepresented populations (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities and rural populations) and the diverse healthcare system of the US.",
