Hypertension is of particular interest because it is common in adults and there are concerns related to the use of reninangiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in patients with hypertension infected with COVID-19. Levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein that facilitates entry of coronavirus into cells, may increase in patients using RAS inhibitors. Thus, chronic use of RAS inhibition could potentially lead to a more severe and fatal form of COVID-19. In this review, we provide a critical review to the following questions: (1) Does hypertension influence immunity or ACE2 expression favoring viral infections? (2) Are the risks of complications in hypertension mediated by its treatment? (3) Is aging a major factor associated with worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension? Recent Findings Despite the potential involvement of immune responses in the pathogenesis of hypertension, there is no evidence supporting that hypothesis that hypertension or RAS inhibitors contributes to unfavorable outcomes in viral infections. Future investigations adopting a strict protocol for confirming hypertension status as well as assessing associated comorbidities that may influence outcomes are necessary. From the therapeutic perspective, recombinant ACE2 may serve as a potential therapy, but relevant studies in humans are lacking. Definitive evidence regarding the use of RAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 is needed; 5 randomized trials examining this issue are currently underway.

Once activated, the immune system seems to play a significant role in the end-organ damage associated with hypertension [12, 13] . Overall, the contribution of the immune system, particularly T-lymphocytes, to hypertension is widely accepted, but the mechanistic processes preceding activation of immune cells are poorly understood [14] . One of the possible mechanisms is related to the increase of sympathetic activation in a complex scenario because sympathoexcitation may induce both suppression or excitatory effects of the Tlymphocytes [14] . Specifically, evidence suggests that increased sympathetic outflow may directly attenuate the ability of naive T-lymphocytes to become fully activated while also exacerbating the inflammatory effects of activated Tlymphocytes [14] . However, the clinical relevance of these findings is still unclear.

Recent publications reviewed the role of reninangiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in COVID-19 infection [.21\u2022, 22\u2022,23] ACE2, an enzyme with a physiological role in RAS activity, plays a crucial role in COVID-19 infection. A recent report postulated that the use of RAS inhibitors, one of the most prescribed classes in hypertension, may alter ACE2 expression and influence the virulence of COVID-19 infection in China [24] . However, there is no definitive evidence indicating harmful effects of RAS inhibitors. Despite RAS inhibitors being recommended as one of the first-line hypertension treatments [8] , the use of these drugs in China is quite low, and it was estimated that RAS inhibitors were used in 25-30% of treated patients [25] . This flat rate may have implications for the study power of previous reports. Animal and pre-clinical studies evaluating ACE2 levels of expression in different tissues with the use of RAS inhibitors have demonstrated conflicting data [ 21\u2022, 22\u2022,23] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) do not inhibit ACE2 (ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes), making the harmful effect of this class unlikely [22\u2022 ]. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals [26, 27] , but these findings do not seem to translate into clinical observations, including in the setting of COVID-19.

In this scenario, future investigations addressing the impact of hypertension on prognosis may have significant value when adopting a strict protocol to confirm the hypertension status, medications under chronic use, and associated comorbidities including overweight/obesity (reported by some investigations as a predictor of poor outcomes in COVID-19) [28, 37] and chronic kidney and pulmonary disease.

From the treatment perspective, it is important to determine the role of hypertension treatments such as ACEi/ARBs on the susceptibility to viral infections. Particular attention should be devoted to the role of ACE2 overexpression in these patients. In this sense, recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of ACE2, angiotensin 1-7 analogs, and G-coupled protein receptor of angiotensin- [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] (Mas receptor) agonists enhance ACE2 action and may serve as potential target therapies, but relevant studies in humans are lacking [23] .
