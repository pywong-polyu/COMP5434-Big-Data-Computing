A cross-sectional anonymous online survey was conducted in all regions of Brazil using a snowball sampling strategy among yoga practitioners. A total of 860 participants (87% female, aged: 19-82 years) completed the survey. Sociodemographic data, lifestyle factors, yoga practice during the pandemic, and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) scores were collected between July 9 and July 15, 2021. Overall, 9.5%, 9.3%, and 5.6% of participants exhibited some traits (mild to severe) of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Hatha yoga (48%) was the most commonly practiced yoga style. In the adjusted analysis, a higher yoga experience (> 5 years) was associated with better anxiety (odds ratio; bootstrap 95% confidence interval: 2.42; 1.32, 4.49) and stress status (1.80; 1.06, 3.00) than beginners (< 1 year). Practitioners who reported higher time and days of yoga practice during the study period were more likely to show normal levels of depression (odds ratio: 2.56-6.49; p < 0.05), anxiety (odds ratio: 3.68-8.84; p < 0.05), and stress (odds ratio: 2.15-5.21; p < 0.05). Moreover, the maintenance of practice frequency during the pandemic was associated with higher odds of normal levels of depression (2.27; 1.39-3.79), anxiety (1.97; 1.25-3.10), and stress (1.97; 1.32-2.96). In conclusion, our findings indicated that a higher level of yoga practice was associated with better mental health levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

[6] [7] [8] [9] During the pandemic, the increase in the prevalence of mental disorders was accompanied by other public health problems, such as obesity and physical inactivity, which in turn were also factors associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. 10, 11 Given the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle and mental health, non-pharmacological strategies, and activities that follow social distancing guidelines (such as internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy and physical activities) are crucial to counteract the challenges to public health. 12, 13 Yoga originated in ancient India as a comprehensive mind-body practice and has gained popularity worldwide as a holistic approach to physical and mental wellbeing. 14, 15 Although yoga encompasses several styles, a growing body of evidence has shown that practices such as postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation (dhyana) have several therapeutic effects. 16 The public interest in yoga is increasing as it can be easily performed and as it is adaptable, which could be a strategy during the pandemic to cope with stress and help maintain mental health. 17 Systematic reviews indicated that yoga can be considered a viable and safe ancillary treatment option for individuals with high levels of anxiety and depression. [18] [19] [20] However, most studies have been conducted under clinic conditions and little empirical data are currently available about the level of yoga practice and its possible associations with mental health during the pandemic. Therefore, the current study aimed to describe yoga practice and to verify the association of this practice with depression, anxiety, and stress levels among Brazilian practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For this, we enrolled yoga studios and teachers from Brazilian capitals and municipalities with a population of more than 100,000. An anonymous questionnaire was disseminated on an online platform using a snowball sampling strategy, and the practitioners who received the link were encouraged to pass it to other known practitioners. Data were collected between July 9 and July 15, 2021, and the official number of registered cases and deaths by COVID-19 during this study period in Brazil was 242,019 and 7,254, respectively. 21 The survey link was directed to a page that included a brief text detailing the research protocol, and the participants who eventually advanced in the questionnaire gave their consent and agreed to participate in the study. The inclusion criteria for participating in the study were age 18 years and being a yoga practitioner with at least six months of experience. Conflicting answers and/or missing information in the survey were excluded. The local Research Ethics Committee approved this study (protocol number: 4.035.382), and all procedures adopted in the research complied with the National Health Council resolution (number 466/12).",

Questions 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 17, and 21 formed the depression subscale. Questions 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 19 , and 20 formed the anxiety subscale, and questions 1, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14 , and 18 formed the stress subscale. For the final score, the scores from each subscale were added and multiplied by two to correspond to the original scale score (DASS-42). The cutoff scores for depression were 0-9, 10-13, 14-20, 21-27, and 28, corresponding to normal, mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe, respectively. The cutoff scores for normal, mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe anxiety were 0-7, 8-9, 10-14, 15-19, and 20, respectively. The cutoff scores for normal, mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe stress were 0-14, 15-18, 19-25, 26-33, and 34, respectively. 27 In our study, the internal consistency was considered good (overall \u00bc 0.86; if item dropped: depression \u00bc 0.80, anxiety \u00bc 0.81, and stress \u00bc 0.79) according to the Cronbach's alpha coefficient.",

The characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1 . The median age of the participants was 43 (35-54) years, ranging from 19 to 82 years. Most of the participants were female (87%), living in the southeast Brazil region (36%), had higher education (90%), lived with three or more residents in the household (47%), had BMI < 25 kg/m 2 (68%), reported no chronic diseases (76%), were employed (82%), regularly performed another physical activity (63%), and were not diagnosed with COVID-19 (82%) during the study period. Table 2 shows information regarding the characteristics of yoga practices of study participants. Hatha yoga (48%), Vinyasa yoga (10%), and Integral yoga (6%) were the most commonly practiced styles. Most participants had > 5 years of experience (45%), reported a mean time of 60 min per practice session (46%), 1-2 days of yoga practice (38%) in the last week, and maintained the same frequency of practice during the pandemic (70%).

The low prevalence of severe cases observed in the current study must be interpreted with caution as individuals vulnerable to mental health issues may not participate in research studies voluntarily (self-selection bias). Another aspect is the stage of the pandemic in each region of the country. In this sense, we conducted a small observational study in the first few months of the pandemic in the southeast region of Brazil (May 19 and 26, 2020). 38 The study indicated higher rates of severe levels of depression (8%), anxiety (12.2%), and stress (12.2%) based on DASS-21 scores among yoga practitioners. During this period, we observed that a higher experience ( 2 years) and frequency of practice ( 5 days/week) were associated with lower odds of severe stress symptoms. 38 In our study, yoga experience was associated with normal anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, yoga practitioners who reported a higher level of practice (average of time practice and weekly frequency) and maintained the same frequency of practice were more likely to report normal levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during the pandemic (Table 3 ). Our findings are consistent with those of previous cross-sectional studies that demonstrated that yoga practice was associated with lower anxiety levels 39 and higher mental wellbeing among Indians 40 during COVID-19.",

            "text": "Our study is cross-sectional in nature, and therefore, it is not possible to determine causality. However, intervention studies during the COVID-19 pandemic support the positive evidence of yoga practice on mental health improvements. 20, 41, 42 For example, Wadhen and Cartwright 20 investigated the impact of a 6-week online yoga class on the stress and wellbeing perception of people working from home during COVID-19 in London (June-July 2020). Compared with the control group, the yoga intervention group had significantly improved perceived stress, mental well-being, and depression (based on DASS-21) scores. 20 Among the mechanisms that explain the therapeutic effects of yoga on mental health, we can highlight the positive modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, decreasing systemic cortisol concentration, 43, 44 and increasing the gamma-aminobutyric acid (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) level in the brain. 45 On the one hand, psychological stress and depression disorders are associated with a pro-inflammatory state. 46 On the other hand, yoga practices could reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines. 47 These effects reinforce the benefits of daily yoga practice during stressful events, such as in a pandemic; however, future research is required to evaluate the effects of yoga on mental health in COVID-19 survivors. 48 This study is subject to certain limitations. Firstly, anonymous, online surveys are restricted to participants with internet access, tend to have a biased selection, and may not represent the entire population of interest. Secondly, the diagnosis of any mental disorder before the pandemic and the evolution was not considered. Thirdly, the absence of a control group may be another potential limitation of the study. Therefore, the data used in our study were obtained during a specific period in the pandemic, and the results cannot be extrapolated to non-yoga practitioners.",
