Neuropathic pain arising from peripheral nerve injury is typically associated with positive sensory signs such as dynamic mechanical allodynia or pinprick hyperalgesia, features thought to reflect the sensitization of central pain pathways [2] . In rodent models of peripheral nerve injury which feature somatosensory profiles similar to those seen in nerve injury patients, abnormal impulses arising from peripheral nociceptors lead to enhanced pain-responsiveness of spinal cord dorsal-horn neurons [3] . This initiates an amplification of synaptic transmission in nociceptive pathways termed 'nociceptive long-term potentiation' (LTP), which is a pain-related variant of a ubiquitous mechanism of synaptic memory [4] . Experimental nociceptive LTP has been successfully established in humans by modelling the injury-related discharge through focal high-frequency electrical stimulation which facilitates long-lasting hypersensitivity specifically for mechanical stimuli [5, 6] .",

The primary objective for the mechanistic open label study was to establish whether LFS was associated in reduction of enhanced pain-responsiveness in a clinical population, as measured by change in measured sensory features of clinically enhanced pain responsiveness. We hypothesised that within the RCT a significant difference (p = < 0.05) in terms pain reduction, would be observed between groups in favour of the active treatment. Whilst for the open label mechanistic study a significant reduction (p = < 0.05) in mechanical pain sensitivity and dynamic mechanical allodynia would be observed following low-frequency stimulation.",

LTD requires delivery of \u2265 1200 pulses, requiring 10 min of treatment [5, 10] . To avoid unblinding due to felt or observed differences related to current density or LTD effect within training, the amplitude and stimulation time was limited (< 5ma and < 5 min) for both the active and sham devices. An independent physiotherapist with experience of stimulation began training by determining the point of stimulation and beginning stimulation for all patients but had no further patient contact-this was safeguard accurate nerve identification for stimulation and to maintain blinding of trial nurses.",

Then, a circular intervention array of 10 punctate electrodes (each 250 \u00b5m diameter), designed to preferentially activate small diameter epidermal nerve fibres (5) , was placed over the epicentre of the pain. This electrode delivers electrical pulses using a constant current stimulator (Digitimer DS7A, UK). Baseline QST was then performed on areas directly adjacent the intervention array-electrode to obtain a comprehensive somatosensory profile, using the standardised German Research Network quantitative sensory testing (DFNS) protocol [20] . As part of this protocol, mechanical pain sensitivity (MPS) was assessed as the mean of the pain ratings in response to a geometric series of 8-512 mN calibrated pinpricks at factor 2 progression, and dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA) as pain to gentle stroking touch (cotton wisp, QT-tip, soft brush); these MPS/DMA series were scheduled at the end of the QST procedure and were spaced by approximately 5 min between each. Then, electrical detection threshold was determined with single 2 ms duration electrical pulses of increasing strength through the array electrode using method of limits (felt/ not felt). The subsequent LFS intervention consisted of a train of 2000 electrical, 2 ms duration, stimuli delivered through the array electrode at 1 Hz. Stimulation strength was initially 10 \u00d7 EDT but, due to poor tolerability was reduced to 5 \u00d7 EDT for the final 6 study patients. Directly after LFS stimulation, the hyperalgesic area was measured again and then MPS and DMA were determined as before.",

For all outcomes statistical tests were two-sided, with p-values of p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Compared to normative data, the QST profiles indicated significant gain-in-function for mechanical pain sensitivity (p = < 0.001), mechanical and pressure pain thresholds (p = < 0.001), as well as dynamic mechanical allodynia (p = < 0.001), but not thermal hyperalgesia. This mechanonociceptive gain contrasted to a significant loss of function in tactile and temperature detection thresholds (p = < 0.001). Taken together these results emphasize that the mechanistic study successfully enrolled the targeted mechanical (not thermal) hyperalgesia pain phenotype of patients within these studies. This patient subgroup is most likely to harbour a central sensitization aspect, for which punctate hyperalgesia and dynamic mechanical allodynia are hallmark signs [1, 34, 35] , associated with increased ongoing pain [36] .",

J Transl Med (2021) 19:458 several lines of evidence suggest that this outcome may reflect both sub-optimal stimulation intensity and frequency. In the mechanistic study, LTD was successfully induced by painful LFS stimulation at 5 \u00d7 EDT, whereas in the RCT patients determined stimulus strength ad libitum. Post-hoc telephone interviews illustrated that only patients who experienced the stimulation in the active arm as painful, but none of the other patients found the treatment beneficial. Painfulness of an electrical stimulus is a function of the stimulus strength [38] , and evidence from volunteer studies indicates that a just noticeably painful stimulus strength of 2-10 \u00d7 detection threshold is effective while weaker or stronger stimuli are either less effective or completely ineffective [5, 19] . It is likely, therefore, that for maximal effect, clinically the LFS intensity should be mildly painful and that adherence to initial instructions was not consistently followed by the RCT participants. Furthermore, post-hoc telephone interviews indicated that most patients used the stimulator at a set daytime regardless of their actual pain experiences. This would suggest that patients viewed treatment as something that acted over a 24-h period (like a drug).",

Patient education in relation to treatment mechanisms, required stimulation strength and timing of treatment may therefore optimize clinical benefit by individually tailoring the stimulation but require further evaluation. It is, however, also possible that reduction in stimulusevoked pain in some patients does not fully translate into reduction of their spontaneous pain. Although we were recently able to show in a genotype-phenotype association study that more punctate hyperalgesia predicted stronger ongoing pain the correlation still remained low [36] . A disconnect between spontaneous and stimulus evoked neuropathic pain has been illustrated elsewhere [39, 40] . Topical lidocaine has been shown to reduce DMA for up to 3 months in patients with neuropathic pain after knee surgery, without global pain reduction [39] ; and mechanical allodynia has been demonstrated in the absence of spontaneous pain [40] . Any partial disconnect between reductions in stimulus-evoked and spontaneous pains may reflect the multiplicity of mechanisms and the heterogeneous nature of neuropathic pain and treatments even within stratified sensory subgroups [39] . We demonstrated in both studies reduction in enhanced pain sensitivity following low-frequency nerve stimulation. This therefore appears to be a consistent effect associated with low frequency nerve stimulation. A decrease in marked skin sensitivity represents an important change in pain presentation and may still be considered/ desired as a meaningful effect for patients in the absence of spontaneous pain reduction.",

Due to the context of outcome evaluation in both studies contextual outcomes will have been of greater influence in the clinical trial. This is of relevance when we consider changes in pain evaluation was not significant in the clinical trial whilst significant change was seen for non-contextual QST outcomes in the mechanistic study. It is difficult for studies to measure relevant contextual factors and whilst the exploratory measures within the clinical trial in part attempted to do this, we were unable to find any association between exploratory measures and pain outcomes.",

The RCT included successful recruitment and retention of a very specific group of patients with neuropathic pain, verified by QST, in consenting patients, which also validates the clinical recruitment criteria used. Patient selection could have been further strengthened by the inclusion of neuropathic pain specific screening questionnaires. The development and use of a true sham intervention with some perceivable but in-efficient stimulation parameters is a further strength-the lack of credible sham intervention has previously been noted as a limitation in neuromodulation trials [41, 42] . The study achieved a high level of patient adherence resulting in high data quality reducing uncertainty, and active and comparator groups were well balanced.",

Spontaneous post-test pain has a strong subjective component whilst other QST measures provide more objective assessments of pain processing. Given the subjective nature of this measure and the lengthy testing protocol (4 h) within the mechanistic study, we considered this measure would be too confounded to provide useful data. Ways of overcoming this should be considered in future study designs. Reduction in spontaneous pain intensity was not observed in the RCT and therefore LFS may not reduce spontaneous pain. We also recognise that suboptimal stimulation in the RCT may have influenced outcomes. The RCT protocol allowed patients to continue treatment without further advice or corrections after initial training. Posthoc interviews have highlighted that this approach might have diminished the intervention's effectiveness. Furthermore, within the RCT patients stimulated just outside the area of pain whilst in the mechanistic study stimulation was performed within the area of pain. Stimulation outside the area of the parent axon would have required deeper depth of penetration to drive axonal transmission along the nerve to the area of pain. Evaluation of stimulator use was limited as devices were not equipped with a system to monitor compliance or settings. Additionally, stimulation parameters were not recorded as part of the study. In normal practice, suboptimal stimulation may be improved with education relating to stimulation electrode positioning and coverage, but due to blinding this was not possible in the RCT.",

For example, we included patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN, n = 3 sham), radiotherapy induced nerve pain (n = 2, active) and medication induced nerve pain (n = 1, sham). PHN is typically associated with multisegmented dorsal horn atrophy which in turn limits the ability to correctly target a singular peripheral nerve with stimulation. Whilst radiotherapy and medication induced nerve pain is rarely confined to the distribution of one nerve. The three patients included with the later indications all experienced hand pain and only reported pain in the radial or ulnar nerve territory following said treatments; of note none of these patients had participated in the mechanistic study.",

Results from our mechanistic study provide novel evidence for effective induction of long-term depression in a clinical population, an important requisite step to advance research and therapy in this area. Evidence from the RCT for the primary outcome of pain reduction failed to reach significance. Taken together results demonstrate the potential of low frequency stimulation and the need for further application enhancement, which will help inform future study design, and approaches to treatment. Low frequency stimulation is well tolerated, comparing favorably with drug treatments for the same patient group [44] . ",
