With the exception of Mali, there is no statistical evidence that GDP per capita levels rose relative to what they would have been in the absence of the IMF-supported devaluation. Three countries record statistically significant GDP per capita levels below the counterfactual following the devaluation, though these countries experienced a deterioration of their national institutional environment or were affected by external factors that offset any potential gains from the devaluation.",

With the exception of a 50%-devaluation in 1994, the CFA franc rigidly maintained its fixed rate to the French franc up to 2001 and the euro thereafter. Maintaining a stable fixed exchange rate for this length of time has benefits. This stability reduces exchange rate risk premiums and restrains inflationary pressures. There are potential costs as well. In addition to imposing limits on monetary sovereignty, a fixed exchange rate can become misaligned, leading to reduced competitiveness in international markets and economic hardship.",

A series of adverse price shocks to many of the countries' main commodity exports, combined with a persistent appreciation of the French franc relative to other currencies over this time period, led to a deterioration of the terms of trade for many CFA franc zone countries (Boughton 2012) . By the early 1990s, it became clear to the member nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and France that a devaluation was necessary to address the currency's overvaluation. On January 12th, 1994, governments from the CFA franc zone accepted a 50%-nominal devaluation against the French franc. At the same time, lending and technical support from the IMF, France, and other donors were committed to contain the negative effects of the devaluation. This IMF-supported realignment was designed to restore competitiveness in export markets for countries in the CFA-franc zone and bolster their economic growth prospects (Cl\u00e9ment 1995) .",

(2021) is employed. The augmented synthetic control method follows the basic premise of the synthetic control method (SCM), by constructing a counterfactual \"synthetic CFA-zone country\" using a weighted linear combination of similar countries that did not experience an IMF-supported devaluation in 1994. Any difference between the actual income per capita and the income per capita of the synthetic country can be attributed to the effect of the IMF-supported devaluation. The ASCM augments the SCM by using a different matching technique which addresses bias in the SCM estimate when the pre-treatment match is not excellent, which is the case for many of the CFA-zone countries used in this analysis.",

First, the effect can be measured for each country independently, allowing for potential heterogeneous effects across the sample. Wide disparities across countries in the economic impacts of the devaluation would raise questions regarding the benefits of another devaluation, and possibly challenge policy coordination within the monetary union. Second, this 1994-devaluation was unanticipated, removing any concerns of anticipation bias influencing the results. Third, the devaluation occurred on a specific day, removing any challenges in setting a policy date from which to start the treatment.

In the early 1990s, after years of a stable fixed rate, it became increasingly apparent that the CFA franc was overvalued. The terms of trade deteriorated by 50 percent through the late 1980s, driven by a combination of dropping commodity prices on traditional export goods and an appreciation of the French franc (Cl\u00e9ment et al. 1996) . Fearing the inflationary effects of a currency realignment, the currency block resisted the idea and focused initially on internal adjustments to realign the terms of trade. Restraining wage growth and tight fiscal policy became increasingly painful, however, and by the early 1990s devaluation was beginning to look like a more viable policy option.",

In the early 1990s, the IMF began working with political leaders in France and the nations in the CFA-franc zone to solidify the political will to realign the currency. 4 The IMF also began to draw up plans for structural reform supported by IMF loans, debt forgiveness, and external loans designed to come into effect soon after the devaluation. These reforms focused on shoring up governments' budgetary positions through broadening the tax base and reigning in spending, but also reorienting government spending to more productivity enhancing activities (Cl\u00e9ment 1995; Boughton 2012) . In addition, the IMF provided technical support for each country in 1 https:// www. imf. org/ exter nal/ pubs/ ft/ fabric/ backg rnd. htm. 2 WAEMU was founded in 1994, build on the foundation of the West African Monetary Union, founded in 1973.

Guinea-Bissau joined the monetary union in 1997. 3 Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. 4 For a summary of the efforts of the IMF to orchestrate this devaluation see Boughton (2012, pp. 677-737) . the CFA-franc zone to coordinate the funds and policies set up to lessen the adverse effects of the devaluation, as well as provide support to enact structural reforms to maintain competitiveness (Cl\u00e9ment 1995) . By September of 1994, the IMF had borrowing arrangement set up for all of the CFA-zone countries, disbursing $508 million by the end of 1994. Eventually, they coordinated over $7 billion in debt forgiveness, committed $1.9 billion in their own lending, and coordinated an additional $4 billion in external support (Cl\u00e9ment 1995) .",

            "text": "Theory suggests devaluations can support economic growth by improving competitiveness abroad. Devaluations increase foreign demand for domestically produced goods as well as make foreign-produced goods relatively more expensive, thus boosting domestic net exports. On the other hand, devaluations could be damaging through the inflationary pressure they introduce, distorting relative prices, and lowering real wages. The effect can be particularly destabilizing when government debt is denominated in a foreign currency, potentially leading to a sovereign debt crisis, all of which could hinder economic growth. 5 Empirical evidence on the effectiveness of devaluations as a path to economic growth are mixed, particularly in developing countries. Because devaluations are often a policy tool used to combat balance of payment crises and speculative attacks, much of the empirical literature on the effect of devaluations focus on currency crises. Not surprisingly, these studies find that output falls immediately after a devaluation (Hutchison and Noy 2002; Basistha and Teimouri 2015) . Many of these studies, however, find that a devaluation eventually contributes to economic growth (Bussi\u00e8re et al. 2012) . Yiheyis (2006) confirms that these outcomes hold in general for countries in Africa. In an aggregate study of twenty African countries they find that nominal devaluations have a contemporaneous negative effect on output, but a positive effect a year after the devaluation.",

Ultimately the authors conclude that \"the CFA countries have largely met in 1994 the objectives of the programs they had developed in the aftermath of the devaluation of the CFA franc...\" (Cl\u00e9ment et al. 1996, p. 27) . Van den Boogaerde and Tsangarides (2005) report on the aftermath of the IMF-supported devaluation ten years later. They also highlight the success of the program in the first four years after the devaluation in causing positive growth rates, controlling inflation, and improving competitiveness. Azam (2004) confirms the positive growth in the CFA franc zone post-devaluation, but they highlight the fact that the IMF-supported devaluation had not necessarily led to alleviation in poverty in these countries. The sustained growth across all CFA countries began to diverge after 1997, due in large part to social and political unrest. Ultimately, early studies deem the program a success based on the growth in GDP per capita observed in most CFA franc countries shortly after the IMF-supported devaluation. Subsequent studies, however, shed doubt on the effectiveness of the IMF-supported devaluation. Constant (2012) finds that in the first ten years following the devaluation, the real effective exchange rate did not significantly affect growth rates in these countries. Kinda and Mlachila (2011) also point out that the growth performance in the WAEMU was disappointing relative to other Sub-Saharan African countries.",

First, aggregate studies treat all devaluation episodes the same. Aggregating the effects of a devaluation occurring within the context of an immediate crisis or speculative attack with those that are simply planned corrections not undertaken in times of crisis could miss important heterogeneity in responses. Additionally, institutional structures differ across countries and devaluation episodes, leading to heterogeneity in responses lost to aggregation. Second, most studies that allow for heterogeneity, and all of the studies specific to the IMF-supported devaluation, lack a counterfactual. The general improvement in growth of GDP per capita observed in the CFA-franc zone countries came at a time of general growth for many developing nations, including other Sub-Saharan African countries (IMF 2008), thus the challenge becomes to differentiate the growth effect of the IMF-supported devaluation from what it would have been otherwise.",

            "text": "To analyze the impact of an event or policy, researchers typically choose between using qualitative comparative case studies and quantitative comparative statistical inference methods such as difference-in-difference analysis or randomized control trials. As pointed out in Abadie et al. (2010) , qualitative comparative case studies and the difference-in-difference method can be problematic because the selection of the comparison units tend to be based on subjective measures. Randomized control trials, which are often used in microeconomic research, attempt to overcome the subjective nature of finding a comparison unit by creating one through the experimental design. This approach, however, is less useful when studying macroeconomic policies or events (such as a currency devaluation) because they are very rarely randomly assigned. Moreover, a crucial assumption for the difference-in-difference method is that outcomes for the unit affected by the policy or event (treated unit) and the comparison unit not affected by the policy or event (control unit) follow parallel paths in the absence of the policy or event (the treatment). Violation of this assumption, quite likely when the treated unit is a country, leads to biases in the estimates. The synthetic control method (SCM) developed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) offers a bridge between qualitative and quantitative methodologies, by providing a systematic way to choose comparison units in comparative case studies (Abadie et al. 2015) . More details on the SCM methodology and the more recent ASCM are provided in the next section. While the SCM has been used in a number of policy evaluation studies, few address macroeconomic policies in Sub-Saharan Africa (Billmeier and Nannicini 2013; Campos et al. 2019 ). Newiak and Willems (2017) use the SCM to study the impact of IMF programs on inflation, economic growth, and investment in Sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis of structural reforms on economic performance presented in Marrazzo and Terzi (2017) includes five African countries, while Billmeier and Nannicini's (2013) broad analysis of economic liberalization includes sixteen African countries.",

The identification assumption of the synthetic control method is that if the synthetic control unit provides a good approximation of the outcome for the treated unit in the pre-treatment period, then any subsequent difference between the treated and control units after the treatment can be attributed to the effect of the intervention (policy) on the outcome (Abadie, forthcoming) . The goal of this study is to create a synthetic country that reproduces the trajectory of the income per capita in each of the CFA-zone countries pre-1994. The difference in the trajectories of income per capita between the synthetic control and real country post-1994 capture the causal impact of the IMF-supported devaluation.",

First, the devaluation of the CFA franc was imposed on the fourteen countries in the CFA franc zone, each with unique economic structures. While difference-in-difference analysis and propensityscore matching provide an estimate of the average treatment effect, the SCM, when applied to several treated units, allows for the estimation of individual treatment effects for each country, thus highlighting heterogeneity which one would not be able to identify with the two aforementioned methodologies. Second, many policy evaluation methods, including the SCM, cannot be effectively used if the policy change is anticipated. The policy event in our study, however, was not anticipated by market participants. In order to prevent a potentially damaging market reaction in anticipation of a devaluation, the IMF and participating countries were careful to keep the timing of the devaluation a secret. The January announcement was a surprise to market participants, thus mitigating any concerns of the analysis capturing such anticipation effects. Third, SCM can be challenging to implement for the analysis of macroeconomic policies which typically occur over an extended period of time (such as economic liberalization episodes studied in Billmeier and Nannicini (2013) ) because it is difficult to identify when the treatment starts and ends. This is not a concern for the devaluation, as it was announced and enacted on a specific day.",

(2021) have recently proposed a solution called the Augmented Synthetic Control Method (ASCM), for those cases where a good pre-intervention match between the treated unit and its synthetic unit is not achievable. ASCM \"uses an outcome model to the objective function to estimate the bias caused by the poor pre-intervention match, and then uses this to de-bias the estimate\" (Ben-Michael et al. 2021, p. 1 .) The authors use a ridge-regularized linear regression model that allows for negative weights. 8 These negative weights allow for extrapolation outside the support of the data, and thus help limit the interpolation bias observed with the original SCM. 9 To estimate the impact of the 1994 IMF-supported CFA franc devaluation on the WAEMU and CEMAC countries with the ASCM, annual country-level data from 1980-2003 are used. Out of the fourteen countries that comprise the CFA franc zone, Equatorial Guinea is excluded for lack of data and Guinea-Bissau is also excluded because it did not adopt the CFA franc until 1997. The donor pool used to construct the synthetic controls for each CFA franc country includes twenty-one developing countries. 10 Countries in the donor pool have to be non-treated, which in our case means they did not experience a large devaluation during the pre-treatment period.",

Given the Gabonese economy's dependence on oil production, the aforementioned decline in GDP per capita is likely to be attributed to the decline in the price of oil between 1997 and 1999 which bottomed below $20 ($17.58 a barrel) in November 1998. This large drop in oil prices certainly contributed to the drop in GDP per capita observed over these years and obscures the effect of the IMF-supported devaluation beyond 1997. Pre-1997, the effect of the IMF-supported devaluation did not significantly alter GDP per capita relative to the synthetic control. A rebound in oil prices by 2003 helped boost economic growth.",

Laos accounts for a substantial non-zero weight in most countries (eight out of twelve). This is partially due to the fact that its income levels over the pre-treatment period are closer to those of the CFA-zone countries than most other countries included in the donor pool. As a robustness test, the analysis is run excluding Laos from the pool of donor countries. These new results are consistent with our baseline results: for most countries, the IMF-supported devaluation in 1994 did not cause substantial changes in the trends of per capita income relative to the synthetic control. 13 As an additional robustness check, covariates are added to the ASCM specification to attempt to improve the pre-treatment match. In the SCM literature, covariates are exclusively used to find pre-treatment matches. The ASCM allows for covariates Table 1 Country weights in the synthetic controls to be added to the lags of the independent variable if they improve the pre-treatment match (Ben-Michael, Feller and Rothstein, 2021) . In choosing the potential covariates, variables that have been found to predict GDP per capita growth in the development literature are used (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003; Abadie et al. 2015; Burnside and Dollar 2000; Acemoglu 2010; Acemoglu et al. 2005) . To match across similar economic stuctures the agricultural share of GDP, industrial share of GDP, government share of GDP, and investment share of GDP are included. The Freedom House Indexis used to match on institutional quality. A dummy variable that accounts for involvement in an IMF sponsored program in the pre-treatment period is also included. 14 Every member of the CFA zone and half of the donor poll countries were involved in at least one IMF sponsored program in the pre-treatment period (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) .

Devarajan (1997) estimates the real exchange rate misalignment for most of the CFA franc zone countries pre-and post-devaluation. The author finds that every country in the CFA franc zone, with the exception of Chad, was overvalued in 1993, though there is substantial variation in the magnitude of the overvaluation across countries. In the year following the IMF-supported devaluation, every country became less overvalued or undervalued in real terms. The changes in the real exchange rate, however, are not uniform. Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Togo, and Gabon (the countries that were overvalued the most in 1993) remained overvalued, limiting the effect the IMF-supported devaluation could have on GDP. Overall, however, the IMF-supported devaluation was effective in reducing real exchange rates, meeting Reinhart's first criteria. The second criteria, on the other hand, is unlikely to be met. The CFA-franc zone countries exports consist primarily of commodities (Boughton 1991; Anderson Masters 2009 ). The demand for commodity exports is rather price inelastic (Reinhart 1995; Niemi 2004; Panagariya and Schiff 1990) . Consequently, the real devaluation could only have a limited impact on export volumes, and Reinhart's second criteria for devaluation led growth is not met.",

Other than Gabon with its large oil reserves, the ratio of exports to GDP is low for all countries in the sample.

Using the Freedom Index as a proxy for institutional quality, presented in Fig. 5 ), Benin and Mali are the only two countries that were characterized as \"free\" in the Freedom House categorization of 1994 (and this only after a significant improvement immediately before 1994). The existence of weak institutions at the time of the devaluation certainly could have created headwinds against a successful IMFsupported devaluation. As discussed in Section 2, the IMF-issued loans to support the CFA countries at the same time of the devaluation contingent on structural reform. 15 Even if the devaluation itself could not generate growth due to the factors discussed above, the IMF hoped that its lending and contingent structural reforms could have generated growth. 16 Though every country received IMF loans following the devaluation, only Benin, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Mali, and Senegal maintained their involvement in IMF programs through the duration of the post-treatment period (until at least 2005) . This is an indicator that these were the only countries consistently meeting the conditions set with each loan. The remainder of the countries all had disruptions 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 1980 1985 1990 1995 The ASCM model cannot distinguish between the effects of the devaluation independent from the effects of the IMF support of the devaluation. The model does, however, demonstrate that the IMF-supported devaluation did not produce the growth effects anticipated when compared to the synthetic control, with the exception of Mali. 16 The effectiveness of IMF programs in generating growth is certainly still a question yet to be settled in the literature (Dreher 2009). in IMF lending over some period of time following the IMF-supported devaluation (IMF, MONA). Cl\u00e9ment et al. (1996) reported that within two years of the IMFsupported devaluation, structrual reform were slow and unevenly applied. Kinda and Mlachila (2011) highlight Mali and Burkina Faso as countries in the CFA franc zone that were most successful in implementing structural reforms. Using the Freedom House Index (Fig. 5) again as a proxy for institutional quality, only Senegal shows consistent improvement over the period after the IMF-supported devaluation. Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, and Togo experience improvements in their index score at least once in the first three years after the IMF-supported devaluation, but there is no consistency in these countries' economic response to the devaluation relative to the synthetic control. Had countries completed the structural changes, it is possible these would have led to higher growth, but as the majority did not, the IMF-supported part of the devaluation was generally not effective in generating higher growth.",

According to Devarajan's (1997) estimates, Mali was significantly overvalued in 1993 (39% overvalued) and the IMF-supported devaluation helped bring the country closer to long run equilibrium (9% overvalued). According to Reinhart's first criteria, this could account for some of the observed positive effect, but the real exchange rate adjustment does not stand out relative to other countries in the CFA-franc zone. Like other CFA-franc zone countries, Mali's trade structure is dependent on commodity exports, limiting the devaluation's effects on export volume. In addition, Mali's share of trade to GDP is similar to the other CFA-franc countries and the increase in its share of trade to GDP from the pre-devaluation time period to the post-devaluation time period (5.61% to 8.44%) is less than or comparable to the changes observed in other CFAfranc zone countries. Differences in inflation do not differentiate Mail either, as the inflationary effects of the IMF-supported devaluation are similar relative to other countries in the sample (on par with Niger, and Senegal, but higher than Burkina Faso).",

The improved cotton prices certainly played an important role in what is observed in Mali, but cotton was also an important export for Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, and Chad. Each experienced similar or more favorable movements in the real exchange rate relative to Mali, but did not demonstrate as large a boost in GDP per capita.",

As stated above, Mali had a relatively strong institutional structure at the time of the IMFsupported devaluation. The institutional improvements (according to the Freedom Index) in the run-up to 1994 certainly could have contributed to higher economic growth, though Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Central African Republic also had measurable improvements in the pre-1994 period without significant growth effects post-1994. Mali also continued to make structural improvements over the post-1994 period. They implemented the IMF programs, registered improvements in the Freedom Index, and were documented as progressing on structural changes (Kinda and Mlachila 2011) . In any one of these measures of improvement, however, Mali is not the only country to show progress. Benin and Burkina Faso show similar improvement in institution and IMF sponsored programs, yet neither experienced significant growth over their synthetic control. 19 Ultimately, no single factor accounts for the significant result in Mali. It is likely explained by a confluence of a series of positive factors associated with the IMFsupported devaluation that in culmination led to growth stronger than would have been otherwise.",

Our results suggest that the IMF-supported devaluation had neither significant negative effects nor significant positive effects for the majority of the countries relative to the synthetic controls. In the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, potential benefits from the IMF-supported devaluation were offset by deterioration in the national institutional environment. In Gabon, dependency on crude oil coupled with a large drop in the price of oil offset potential benefits of the IMF-supported devaluation. In most countries, this non-result is likely driven by the small export to GDP ratio and weak institutional frameworks that did not improve as much as hoped over the post-devaluation period. There is evidence that following the IMF-supported devaluation, Mali experienced higher GDP per capita levels than its synthetic control. Though no one factor can explain the better performance in Mali relative to the other countries, a combination of other growth-promoting factors, notably the existing political and institutional environment, continued support from the IMF, meeting IMF lending criteria, and stronger commodity prices for cotton, contributed to the relative success of the IMF-supported devaluation in this country.",
