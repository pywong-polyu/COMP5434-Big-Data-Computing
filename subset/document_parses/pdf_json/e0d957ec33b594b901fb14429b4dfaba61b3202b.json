            "text": "Background: Chest X-ray radiography (CXR) has been widely considered as an accessible, feasible, and convenient method to evaluate suspected patients' lung involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the escalating number of suspected cases, traditional diagnosis via CXR fails to deliver results within a short period of time. Therefore, it is crucial to employ artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance CXRs for obtaining quick and accurate diagnoses. Previous studies have reported the feasibility of utilizing deep learning methods to screen for COVID-19 using CXR and CT results. However, these models only use a single deep learning network for chest radiograph detection; the accuracy of this approach required further improvement. Methods: In this study, we propose a three-step hybrid ensemble model, including a feature extractor, a feature selector, and a classifier. First, a pre-trained AlexNet with an improved structure extracts the original image features. Then, the ReliefF algorithm is adopted to sort the extracted features, and a trial-and-error approach is used to select the n most important features to reduce the feature dimension. Finally, an SVM classifier provides classification results based on the n selected features. Results: Compared to five existing models (InceptionV3: 97.916 \u00b1 0.408%; SqueezeNet: 97.189 \u00b1 0.526%; VGG19: 96.520 \u00b1 1.220%; ResNet50: 97.476 \u00b1 0.513%; ResNet101: 98.241 \u00b1 0.209%), the proposed model demonstrated the best performance in terms of overall accuracy rate (98.642 \u00b1 0.398%). Additionally, compared to the existing models, the proposed model demonstrates a considerable improvement in classification time efficiency (SqueezeNet: 6.602 \u00b1 0.001s; InceptionV3: 12.376 \u00b1 0.002s; ResNet50: 10.952 \u00b1 0.001s; ResNet101: 18.040 \u00b1 0.002s; VGG19: 16.632 \u00b1 0.002s; proposed model: 5.917 \u00b1 0.001s).",

It is extremely important to screen and isolate all patients with suspected COVID-19 at their first point of contact to break the chain of transmission. Chest imaging plays an essential role in the early diagnosis of patients with suspected COVID-19 chest infections because the chest X-ray radiology (CXR) can evaluate their lung abnormality and is readily available in community physician offices, urgent care clinics and hospital emergency departments [1] . In the case of COVID-19, radiological appearance obtained in CXRs is related to RT-PCR examination and patient outcome [2] . Vancheri et al. confirmed the effectiveness of employing CXR as a first-line imaging modality in the diagnostic workflow of patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. Their results substantiated that chest radiography showed lung abnormalities in 75% of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from 63.3 to 83.9%, at 0-2 days and >9 days from the onset of symptoms [3] .",

Varela-Santos et al. proposed an initial experiment using image texture feature descriptors, as well as feed-forward and convolutional neural networks on several created databases with COVID-19 images. Their work verified the effectiveness of the supervised learning model in the AI-assisted differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and other lung diseases [4] . Ozturk et al. proposed a model with classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classification (normal versus and 87.02% for multi-class classification tasks (normal versus viral pneumonia versus COVID- 19) , which still needs improvement [5] . Zhang Yudong et al. introduced stochastic pooling to replace average pooling and max pooling with the traditional deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model, which achieved an accuracy of 93.64% \u00b1 1.42% in distinguishing COVID-19 cases from normal subjects [6] . Matteo et al. proposed a light convolutional neural network (CNN) design, based on the SqueezeNet, for efficient discrimination of COVID-19 CT images with respect to other community-acquired pneumonia and/or healthy CT images. Their architecture allows an accuracy of 85.03%, with fewer parameters and higher efficiency compared to that of the classical SqueezeNet [7] . Yan et al. designed an AI system to diagnose COVID-19 using multi-scale convolutional neural networks (MSCNNs), which can assess CT scan results [8] . Benbrahim et al. adopted a deep learning method using the Inceptionv3 model and the ResNet-50 model, and successfully realized classification of COVID-19 in chest X-ray images (the accuracies of those models were 99.01% and 98.03%, respectively) [9] ",

            "text": "Pseudo-code of the ReliefF algorithm [25] . (CNN) model to classify COVID-19 infection from normal and other pneumonia cases using chest X-ray images [15] . The proposed architecture is based on a residual neural network and is constructed using two parallel levels with different kernel sizes to capture local and global features of the inputs. Motamed et al. adopted a confrontation network (RANDGAN), which can detect images of unknown categories (COVID-19) and labeled categories (normal and viral pneumonia) from known networks without labeling and training data, but the effect is limited (the area under the ROC curve can only reach 0.77) [16] . However, these models use a single deep learning network whose processing efficacy and accuracy remain to be further improved. According to Soumya Ranjan Nayak et al.'s comprehensive study [17] , the further development of effective deep CNN models for a more accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is still in urgent need because the maximum accuracy value of single CNNs did not exceed 98.33% for binary classification (COVID-19 versus normal). Single neural network models usually need expanding structures to further improve the accuracy of the model, which complicates the model and prolongs training time. Researchers have proposed several hybrid structures to improve the accuracy and efficacy of machine learning models. \u00d6 zkaya et al. used convolutional networks and an SVM on the classification task, but did not perform feature selection, and only distinguished normal chest radiographs from COVID-19 chest radiographs, which has limited application scenarios [18] . Yu Xiang et al. combined three components including feature extraction, graph-based feature reconstruction, and classification to complete the binary classification task of COVID-19 and normal CXRs [19] . Their model achieved the best accuracy of 0.9872. However, these models use a single deep learning network, whose processing efficacy and accuracy remain to be further improved.",

Compared to five existing comparison models (InceptionV3: 97.916 \u00b1 0.408%; SqueezeNet: 97.189 \u00b1 0.526%; VGG19: 96.520 \u00b1 1.220%; ResNet50: 97.476 \u00b1 0.513%; ResNet101: 98.241 \u00b1 0.209%), the proposed model has the best performance in the overall accuracy rate (98.642 \u00b1 0.398%) (for details about statistical significance tests, see Supplement 4) , which demonstrates that the model proposed in this article is practical and effective, and can provide high-precision COVID-19 CXR detection. In addition, as shown in Table 6 , compared to the existing models, the model proposed in this study has a great improvement in efficiency (taking only 5.917 \u00b1 0.001s (n = 40) to classify the test set) because the proposed model has a simpler neural network structure. While ensuring accuracy, our model can significantly shortentraining time. Meanwhile, it can be seen from Fig. 10 (PR curves) and 12 (ROC curves) that our model shows satisfactory performance with an overall improvement in AUC values (shown in Table 7 ; other ROC curves for calculating AUC values 2 and 3 in the table are shown in Supplement 6). In general, the ensemble model proposed in this study can accomplish the task of COVID-19 detection with improved efficiency and accuracy than existing models.",

On the assumption that the data sets used are the same, our proposed model (improved AlexNet + ReliefF + SVM) has the highest accuracy value, which demonstrates the excellence of this approach. According to the experimental results, it can be found that the feature extraction component has the greatest impact on the accuracy of the model. As shown in the Supplement 1, when the InceptionV3, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet were used as feature extractors, the accuracy values were 97.744 \u00b1 0.531%, 97.533 \u00b1 0.718% and 98.642 \u00b1 0.398%, respectively. Replacing the other two components (feature selector and classifier) had a relatively small impact on the performance of the model (see Supplements 2 and 3). Therefore, it becomes crucial to find a suitable network for feature extraction in performing this classification Meanwhile, as shown in Table 8 , there are differences in the time needed for different networks to extract features. In addition to accuracy, the AlexNet we used as feature extractor has the least model running time (5.917 \u00b1 0.001s), which demonstrates the efficiency of our proposed model (AlexNet + ReliefF + SVM) as presented in the previous section.",

In addition, the transfer learning method adopted in this work can remarkably reduce the time required for deep learning network training and the size of training sets. Despite having only 1222 images as the training set for network training, this work still achieves satisfactory classification results; (3) Compared with a model without feature selection (AlexNet + SVM), the proposed hybrid model (AlexNet + ReliefF + SVM) is more accurate and less time-consuming. The reason is that model performance is not necessarily proportional to the number of input features because the data redundancy affects the speed and accuracy of the algorithm and increases the difficulty of learning tasks; (4) The components in the hybrid model structure presented in this paper can also be replaced according to the characteristics of the data, which can maintain a good classification effectiveness.",
