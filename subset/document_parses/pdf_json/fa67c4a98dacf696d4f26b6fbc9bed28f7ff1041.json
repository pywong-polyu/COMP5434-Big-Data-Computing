During development, it separates into the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk, outlets of the definitive left and right ventricle respectively. Defects in OFT formation produce conotruncal malformations characterized by incomplete or absent septation of the aorta and pulmonary trunk, resulting in low oxygen supply due to provision of mixed blood to the circulation. OFT malformations account for almost 30% of all congenital heart defects in humans (15) .

During heart tube elongation and heart looping, the single OFT vessel is remodeled to undergo septation. Septation results in formation of the ascending aorta (Ao) from the left ventricle and the pulmonary trunk (Pa) arising from the right ventricle and ensures delivery of oxygenated blood to the body but deoxygenated blood to the lungs. To clarify the impact of LRP2 deficiency on OFT formation, we studied mice homozygous for a targeted Lrp2 gene disruption (Lrp2 -/-) generated by us previously (2) . LRP2 mutant embryos were compared to their respective wild-type or heterozygous littermates, as no defects were observed in Lrp2 +/animals. The latter two genotypes are jointly referred to as controls herein. Loss of LRP2 activity in Lrp2 -/mice lead to defects in OFT formation characterized by incomplete or absent septation of the Ao and Pa, a defect referred to as a common arterial trunk (CAT; persistent truncus arteriosus). CAT formation was evident at embryonic (E) day 15.5 and 18.5 when control embryos showed properly separated Ao and Pa (Fig. 1A) , while Lrp2 -/embryos exhibited a single vessel exiting the heart from the right ventricle (Fig. 1A, asterisks) Fig. S1 ), or showed normal OFT development with nicely separated Ao and Pa (16 out of 33; Fig. S1 ). This observation suggested genetic modifiers to impact LRP2 function in heart morphogenesis.",

By contrast, in Lrp2 -/embryos, the localization of E-cadherin-positive cells in the DPW was shifted to more posterior regions in the DPW (Fig. 8C , compare localization of the stippled lines). This shifted cell identity was also confirmed by a shift in localization of cardiac troponin I, a marker for mature cardiomyocytes (Fig. 8C) . Cardiac troponin I was exclusively expressed in cells of the OFT myocardium in controls. In Lrp2 -/-OFT tissue, also cells in the TZ stained positive for cardiac troponin I. Furthermore, laminin, a marker for the basal lamina showed an altered localization in Lrp2 -/embryos. While in the control DPW and Tz, laminin showed a punctuated pattern in the apical cell region, this punctuated pattern was lost in the Lrp2 -/-DPW and Tz (Fig. 8C, arrowheads) . In addition, in control embryos, the basal lamina formed a continuous pattern in the OFT region but not in the Tz, whereas in Lrp2 -/hearts, this continuous pattern of the basal lamina reached inside the Tz (Fig. 8C) . Collectively, these findings argue for a reduction in numbers and for premature differentiation of Lrp2 -/-SHF progenitor cells as they transit from the DWP via the Tz into OFT myocardium.

SHH is necessary for arterial pole formation as loss of SHH signaling in Shh -/mice or in chick embryos treated with the SHH antagonist cyclopamine results in CAT formation (49, 50) . In addition to CAT formation, Lrp2 -/embryos show ventricular septal as well as aortic arch defects as reported by others. Such malformations also occur in Shh -/mice and in animals defective in the ciliary signaling compartment (14, 50, 55) . While it is conceivable that ventricular septal defects in Lrp2 mutants documented before (16) may also be caused by SHH signaling defects, our study focused on the consequences of impaired SHH signaling in the anterior SHF region for CAT formation. Using the Gli1-CreER T2 reporter line, we show an overall reduction in the number of SHH-responsive Islet1 positive progenitor cells in the Lrp2 -/distal OFT tissue (Fig. 7A, C) . Also, while these cells were mainly restricted to the DPW and the Tz in controls (Fig. 8A) , they showed a more dispersed localization in the OFT tissue in mutants, overlapping with MF20 positive cardiac cells in Tz and OFT myocardium.",

Dependent on the biological context, LRP2 acts as pathway activator (by facilitating cell surface binding of the morphogen) (10) or as pathway inhibitor (by directing SHH to lysosomal degradation) (11) . Data presented herein argue that LRP2 acts as agonist to promote responsiveness of SHF progenitor cells to SHH signals during OFT formation. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study documenting a crucial role for SHH in activating progenitor gene expression and in inhibiting premature differentiation, thereby maintaining the progenitor cell population in the SHF (58) . We also show that LRP2 ensures the correct migration pattern of SHH-responsive SHF progenitors during OFT elongation. These results are in line with findings that SHH-responsive progenitors from the anterior SHF migrate into the pulmonary vessel (51) . Finally, a recent study on Gata4-regulated SHH signaling in cardiac progenitor cells documented the importance of SHH signals for SHF cell migration in mice (59) . In this study, the migratory defect of Gata4 haploinsufficient SHF progenitor cells was rescued by over-activation of the Hedgehog pathway using the constitutively activated In conclusion, we document a crucial role for LRP2 in maintenance of a pool of SHHdependent progenitors in the SHF and in ensuring their differentiative fate as they migrate into the OFT tissue. Our findings have identified a novel component of the SHH signaling machinery essential for heart development and uncovered the molecular cause of conotruncal malformations in humans and mouse models lacking this receptor.",

In addition, LRP2 expression was detected in the epithelium lining the distal outflow tract (OFT) (Fig. 3A, E10.5). Upon closer inspection of the distal OFT (Fig. 3B, coronal view), LRP2 localized mainly to the superior and inferior regions of the OFT. LRP2 immunoreactivity was enriched in the OFT wall overlying the aortic (AoIC) and pulmonary intercalated cushions (PuIC). To better visualize LRP2 expression in the DPW, we used higher magnification of a sagittal view of E10.5 control hearts (Fig. 3B, sagittal). This plane of section demonstrated that LRP2 is abundantly expressed in the DPW while levels are reduced in the transition zone (Tz) and completely absent from the OFT myocardium. At E12.5, when the OFT in controls was already septated, robust LRP2 expression persisted in the DPW and in myocardial cells in the most distal regions of the Ao and Pa, while only minor expression levels were visible in atria and ventricles (Fig. 3A; E12.5; arrowheads). Based on these data, we concluded that LRP2 mainly localizes to the SHF with highest expression levels in the SHF progenitor zone of the DPW.",

In the OFT, Islet1 protein and transcript were especially reduced in the superior and inferior intercalated cushions (Fig. 5A and B, arrowheads). Reduced levels of Islet1 in the intercalated cushions may explain the defect in endocardial cushion formation seen in the aortic valve of Lrp2 -/embryos (Fig. 2). To investigate in more detail which cells within the SHF express LRP2 we investigated the localization of LRP2 with respect to SHF marker Islet1 and cardiac mesoderm marker NK2 transcription factor related, locus 5 (Nkx2-5), a myocardial transcription factor regulated by Islet1 and required for SHF development. LRP2 was expressed in the DPW (Fig. 5C, arrow) and in the myocardium lining the intercalated cushions in the OFT (Fig. 5C, arrowheads; and Fig. 3B), partially overlapping in these regions with Nkx2-5 and Islet1 in controls. In Lrp2 -/mutants, Nkx2-5 protein in the distal OFT was less restricted to the superior and inferior regions (Fig. 5C, stippled lines in control embryos)but showed a more widespread localization throughout the distal OFT. Islet1 demonstrated decreased levels in the pharyngeal mesoderm (Fig. 5Aand C, asterisks) as well as in the superior and inferior intercalated cushions(Fig. 5A arrowheads; Fig. 5Carrows). We also tested expression of two additional SHF markers, namely neurovascular guiding factor Sema3c, important to correctly navigate CNCCs towards the OFT (23), as well as T-box transcription factor (Tbx)(Fig. S2). Despite an overall unchanged expression pattern of Sema3c, slightly reduced levels in the intercalated cushions of the OFT were seen on coronal sections of Lrp2 -/embryos compared with controls(Fig. S2A, arrowheads). By contrast, expression levels of Tbx1(Fig. S2B)were comparable between genotype groups suggesting mis-patterning of a specific population of SHF progenitors rather than complete absence of SHF progenitors in LRP2 mutant mice.LRP2 promotes SHH signaling during outflow tract formationSo far, our data documented a decrease in Islet1 positive SHF progenitor cells and a shifted localization of Nkx2-5 positive cells in LRP2 mutant embryos, arguing for a role of this receptor in promoting cardiac progenitor maintenance during OFT septation. Several signaling pathways have been implicated in the formation, proliferation, and differentiation of multipotent cardiac progenitor cells in the SHF",

This defect was especially evident in the inferior OFT region where SHH signaling was almost absent in LRP2-deficient embryos (Fig. 6, asterisks). To test if reduced SHH signaling in Lrp2 -/embryos wasconnected to the SHF defects characterized by reduced Islet1 expression, we crossed the LRP2-deficient line with the Gli1-CreER T2 reporter strain. In this strain, expression of a tamoxifen-inducible Cre transgene under control of the Gli1 promoter enables labeling of SHH-responsive cells by Cre-induced expression of YFP. To induce YFP expression, pregnant mice were injected with tamoxifen at E7.5 and embryos were analyzed at E10.5.Immunodetection of YFP demonstrated SHH-responsive cells accumulating in the inferior OFT region in control embryos(Fig. 7A). In Lrp2 -/embryos, YFP-positive cells were reduced about 50% in numbers and failed to accumulate in the inferior OFT region(Fig. 7A, arrowheads; Fig. 7B). Next, we performed co-immunostaining for YFP and Islet1 to test if SHF progenitor cells were responsive to SHH signals. In line with this assumption, YFP positive cells in the inferior OFT of control embryos co-immunostained with Islet1. Lrp2 -/embryos showed a significant reduction in Islet1immunoreactvity in the pharyngeal mesoderm(Fig. 7A, asterisk) as well as in the superior and inferior OFT(Fig. 7A,arrowheads). Quantification of cardiac progenitor cells double positive for Islet1 and YFP substantiated a significant reduction of SHH-responsive Islet1 positive progenitor cells in the distal OFT of LRP2-deficient embryos(Fig. 7C).",

Quantification of YFP and MF20 double positive cells corroborated this finding and demonstrated a significant increase in YFP-MF20 double positive cells in the OFT myocardium in Lrp2 -/embryos (Fig. 8B). Jointly, the reduction of YFP/Islet1 double positive cells in the distal OFT and the increased amount of YFP/MF20 double positive cells in the OFT myocardium in Lrp2 -/embryos argued for a role of LRP2 in facilitating the response of SHF progenitor cells in the DPW to SHH. Such a response is required to control migratory movement and differentiation along their path to the OFT myocardium. Reduced responsiveness to SHH in the LRP2-deficient DPW was not due to impaired formation of primary cilia as documented by staining for the ciliary marker Arl13b in Islet1 positive progenitor cells in both genotype groups(Fig. S4).",

Previous studies demonstrated an atypical apicobasal polarization of SHF progenitor cells and their basal filopodia in the DPW, and their increasing epithelial characteristics in the Tz before differentiation in the OFT myocardium (29,34-36). Therefore, we focused on immunohistological detection of proteins having a role in apical polarity in Lrp2 -/-DPW and Tz compared with controls. Immunodetection of the apical tight junction marker aPKC-z (37) demonstrated robust expression at the apical cell membrane in the control DPW (Fig. 8C). No changes in signal intensity or localization in aPKC-z were detected in the Lrp2 -/-DPW, arguing against an overall effect of LRP2 deficiency on polarization of cells in the DPW. However, the situation was different for the adherens junction marker E-cadherin. Although localization of E-cadherin to the apical cell membrane was comparable between the two genotype groups, the distribution of E-cadherin-positive cells was clearly shifted in the mutants. As shown in Fig. 8C, in controls, E-cadherin was expressed in the anterior DPW and increased in expression in the Tz, consistent with an increasing epithelial cohesion before cells differentiate into myocardium in the OFT.",

Our findings now identify LRP2 as an essential component of the SHH signaling machinery during OFT formation and implicate defects in SHH signaling in the DPW in CAT formation in receptor mutant mice. In addition to its role in arterial pole formation, SHH has also been reported to regulate posterior heart formation. One class of phenotypes are atrial and atrioventricular septal defects identified in patients and mice genetically deficient for hedgehog signaling components (51-54). These defects arise due to the importance of SHH signaling in specifying a subset of atrial progenitor cells in the posterior SHF.

FIGURE LEGENDS Loss of LRP2 causes formation of a common arterial trunk (A) Whole mounts (left) and coronal sections (right) of Lrp2 -/and control mouse hearts at embryonic (E) day 18.5 and 15.5. In control embryos, separation of the outflow tract into aorta (Ao) and pulmonary trunk (Pa) is evident in both embryonic stages. In Lrp2 -/embryos, aorta and pulmonary trunk fail to separate resulting in a common arterial trunk (CAT, indicated by asterisks). This CAT phenotype showed full penetrance and was seen in 23 out of 23 Lrp2 -/embryos analyzed. (B) Coronal sections of control and Lrp2 -/hearts at E13.5 and E12.5. In control embryos, aorta (Ao) and pulmonary trunk (Pa) are present. Arrows indicate two distinct swellings forming the endocardial cushions in the aortic valve in control hearts. In Lrp2 -/hearts, a common outflow vessel (indicated by asterisks) above the right ventricle is formed. Instead of two endocardial swellings only one cell cluster in endocardial cushion formation (arrow) is apparent.
