Design: A prospective longitudinal single site cohort study Setting: Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia Participants: 151 parents of children aged 1.5-17 years (M = 9.8 years, 58.3% male) with a CHC (colorectal disorder, cleft palate and neurofibromatosis type 1) completed the survey.",

Melbourne, Victoria's capital city, has a population of approximately 5 million people (1) . Its children have experienced major upheaval to their daily activities including remote learning, closure of playgrounds, playcentres, cultural and recreation centres (i.e., museums, zoos, cinema, etc), cancellation of organized sports and activities (i.e., music lessons, dancing), and restrictions on socializing with extended family and friends. For their families, and the community in general, stay-athome orders were in place. At the highest level of restriction, which lasted over 3 months, families were only able to leave their home for one hour a day for exercise, and one family member could leave the house once a day to shop for essentials such as groceries and medication. Travel was restricted to a 5km radius from home and no visitors were allowed in the home, resulting in no face-to-face interactions with extended family, such as grandparents, babysitters or friends (2). Unemployment rates escalated, causing acute financial stress for many.",

Of note, in keeping with prior research regarding social isolation of children with CHC, moderate levels of loneliness were identified in a small subset of children pre-pandemic, but this increased significantly in frequency and severity during the pandemic, likely due to a combination of missing interactions with extended family and friends.",

In our sample, parents highlighted that social isolation was stressful for the majority of children during the COVID-19 restrictions. Of note, loneliness, irritability, worry and anxiousness increased significantly with COVID-19 restrictions, similar to findings after natural disasters (8) . This is consistent with research showing a deterioration in mental health of children with respiratory disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic (7) .",

Most parents identified positive aspects of stay-at-home orders, including increased quality time with family, less running around, and people looking out for each other.
