As of June 28, 2020, over 9,580,000 patients have been infected, including about 163,000 confirmed cases in France. However, limited data are available regarding pregnant women with COVID-19 infection and their newborns (1) . Notably, evidence of in utero vertical transmission is difficult to assess and remains controversial (2) . Prior reports include one infant with elevated IgM at birth, suggesting antenatal infection (3) , and one infant with a positive real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and negative antibody reaction (4) . These sparse findings may be related to limitations associated with the sensitivity of diagnostic tests, the delay between testing and the onset of symptoms (5) (6) (7) , and/or unexpected clinical and immunological reactions to this novel viral infection (6) .",

Alprostadil perfusion at 0.02 mcg/kg/min was initiated, and the baby was prepared for transfer to surgery.

On April 6th, Baby-boy T was transferred to surgery, and underwent an arterial switch operation. Evolution was good and the infant returned for follow-up on April 10th. Nasopharyngeal analysis was repeated and the results were negative for both the mother and the baby, who was discharged on April 12th. The infant had an outpatient follow-up visit on April 22nd at 3 weeks of age. Infant nasopharyngeal analysis was negative, as was a second serology evaluation for both the mother and infant, 32 days after the first maternal symptoms. Physical examination was normal for the infant's age. Weight was 3,180 g, up 440 g from birth. The infant showed no signs of pulmonary or digestive disorder, and neurodevelopment was as expected at this postnatal age. Finally, baby-boy T had a last outpatient follow-up visit on May 20th at 7 weeks of age. Physical examination was strictly normal, RT-PCR control was negative and no antibodies were detected by the assays used in our laboratory. The second mother had COVID-19 infection with positive RT-PCR results on March 17th. She exhibited fever and profound asthenia for 10 days. On April 27th, she underwent an uncomplicated labor and vaginal delivery, and was considered cleared of COVID-19 as it was 6 weeks after the onset of infection. Baby-girl D was born at a gestational age of 39 weeks ( Table 1) . Fetal examinations had revealed antenatal cardiac disproportion, but serial echocardiography up to ductus closure excluded an aortic coarctation.",

Indeed, based on asymptomatic Babyboy T, we instituted a policy of systematic COVID-19 testing for all newborns whose mothers had an history of COVID-19 infection. Thus, although the mother was considered cleared at 6 weeks after the onset of infection, which was confirmed by negative nasopharyngeal and stool SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests after delivery, we tested stool and pharynx swab samples from asymptomatic baby-girl D. The baby was initially fed with expressed milk from her mother, and was then directly breastfed following the above-described procedure. RT-PCR testing of the breast milk yielded negative results for SARS-CoV-2. However, testing of the baby's stool yielded positive results on day 1. Testing of pharynx swabs yielded negative results on day 3. IgG was detected in the mother and newborn, and IgM in the mother only (Biosynex Covid-19 BSS). On June 10th, baby-girl D had an outpatient follow-up visit, 45 days from birth, and 12 weeks from maternal symptoms and positive PCR. Physical examination was normal for the infant's age with no sign of pulmonary or digestive disorder, and she demonstrated appropriate neurodevelopment. She was completely breastfed.

Despite the first newborn was asymptomatic and the screening performed as part of routine systematic testing, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through early nasopharyngeal sampling and the persistent detection of virus in stool strongly suggest possible vertical maternofetal infection. The physician and nurse in charge of the infant were screened negative and had negative antibody detection 9 and 12 weeks after delivery respectively. There was no other newborn in the NICU with infection or suspected infection at that time, and the infant had no contact with any other possible source of contamination. Finally, although Baby-boy T's infection was confirmed by positive results in nasopharyngeal sampling and stool analysis, antibodies were not detected at 3 and 7 weeks from PCR positive results by the assays used in our laboratory. This is consistent with Alzamora's report of a newborn infant with positive RT-PCR results at 16 h after birth, and negative antibody reaction (4). It has been previously reported that a significant percentage of patients with positive RT-PCR results exhibit negative results on IgM antibody tests, possibly due to host factors that influence the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (12) .",

Again, the physician and nurse in charge of the infant were screened and not infected, and we had no other newborn in our NICU with infection or suspected infection at that time. Additionally, the early detection of virus in stool samples from both babies excludes horizontal contamination from other unknown source (12) . Indeed, in a review about the possibility of fecal transmission, Tian et al. (13) reported that positive fecal results occur at least 2-5 days after positive sputum PCR. Tang et al. (14) described an asymptomatic child who exhibited viral positivity in stool at 17 days after virus exposure. Therefore, one may conclude that the case of Baby-boy T was highly suspected to involve vertical maternofetal infection, and that Baby-girl D was infected via possible vertical antepartum maternofetal transmission. Baby-girl D had positive IgG detection, probably through passive antenatal transfer. Of note, both mothers were not excreting the virus at the time of delivery. However, despite very unlikely a contamination can never totally be excluded.",

Baby-boy T presented with a moderate fever starting 18 h after birth and lasting 72 h; however, he received prostaglandins treatment for his cardiopathy at that time and this treatment was the most probable cause of fever (15) . The risk of contamination through stools cannot be excluded, and the viral RNA may be present in stools for longer than in nasopharyngeal excretion (13, 16) . Notably, Baby-girl D was negative in her pharynx tests. Thus, one should be aware of this risk and all infants-regardless of symptoms, and whether they are born from mothers with infection or suspected infectionshould be tested in both pharynx and stool, and considered at risk for contamination. Isolation and all precautionary measures for infected neonates should be maintained until two negative tests performed 24 h apart (4, 17).",

Two additional mothers had symptomatic infections, documented by positive RT-PCR, but did not have positive antibody detection 30 and 32 days from symptoms and positive PCR respectively. These findings raise questions regarding the immunogenicity of this virus and/or the reliability of the assays in neonates, as well as in pregnant women since, like the first baby, these mothers did not present any detectable antibody reaction. In a study of 173 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, Zhao et al. (18) reported seroconversion rates of 82.7% for IgM and 64.7% for IgG. Likewise, Jin et al. (19) examined a population of 43 patients with confirmed infections and 33 patients with suspected infections, and reported sensitivity rates of 48.1% for IgM and 88.9% for IgG. These studies did not include pregnant women or newborn infants, who may have reduced immunologic reactions to the virus. In addition, antibody kinetics during COVID-19 is still matter of debate (12) and assays performance remains questionable (18, 19) . Guo used an ELISA-based assay to analyze 208 plasma samples collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases, and found that the median time of IgM detection was 5 days (interquartile range: 3-6 days), with no more detection 21 days after the onset of symptoms (12) .",

Of the 452 consecutive COVID-19-infected patients at Tongji hospital over 1 month, 286 were diagnosed as having severe infection. Severe cases tended to exhibit lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes count, and lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. At birth, our presently reported infants did not exhibit altered blood count cells, and did not show severe symptomatology. The observed absence of humoral immunologic responses to viral infection in these cases raise questions regarding the reliability of the tests, and the possibility of variable immunogenicity of this new virus (12, 18, 19) . Moreover, it seems likely that pauci-symptomatic COVID-19infected individuals display lower viral loads than severe cases, and may thus generate lower levels and different patterns of antibodies (21) .",
