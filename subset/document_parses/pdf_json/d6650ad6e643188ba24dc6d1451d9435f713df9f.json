Most reflective journals are utilized in the clinical arena, but application in the didactic course is still an effective learning strategy. For this class, the reflective journal used both the cognitive and affective domains of learning. The cognitive domain allowed the student to recall, think, and understand specific topics/concepts during the course. The affective domain permitted expression of feelings and attitudes toward a particular topic/concept(Miller, 2017).The reflective journal also had benefit for the instructor. Chng (2018) utilized a reflective component for a computer class. An important aspect for students was to understand the use of reflection.",
