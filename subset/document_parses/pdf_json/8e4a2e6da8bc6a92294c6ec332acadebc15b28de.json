Their activity is strongly regulated by killer-cell immuno-globulin-like receptors (KIRs) expressed on the NK cell surface. The present study's focus was to investigate the impact of KIRs and their HLA Class I ligands on SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The recent availability of safe and effective vaccines represents a major breakthrough but it may take months or even years in some countries before the effects of the pandemic can be efficiently mitigated.

However, the clinical course may also be constellated by neurological and gastrointestinal manifestations, heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, hypercoagulability, septic shock and multi-organ failure (MOF). Elderly male patients with comorbidities are those at the highest risk of a severe prognosis [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Moreover, alarming news continues to mount on both young and elderly patients-commonly referred to as \"long haulers\"-who have recovered from the disease but continue to have symptoms. Several hypotheses have been put forward to offer a plausible explanation for long-term lingering COVID-19 symptoms but none have managed to solve the problem. It is suspected that the immune systems of such patients may continue to overreact or perhaps trigger lasting changes in immune response mechanisms long after the infection has passed and patients have stopped shedding the virus.",

The clinical features of infected individuals do not soley depend upon viral load [12] . As previously observed in the SARS and MERS epidemics, the coordinated activities of host innate and adaptive immunity are critical to effective control of infection, viral clearance and evolution of the disease [13] [14] [15] [16] .

            "text": "Like in other respiratory RNA viral infections, human airway epithelial cells are among the first targets to encounter SAR-CoV-2. These cells represent a first line of defense and have a major role in triggering inflammatory response through specific receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [17] . Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, TLR8, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) are PRRs expressed by immune and non-immune cells that are critical to recognition of viruses by the innate immune system, especially RNA viruses such as those of the coronaviridae family [16] . Sensing through PRRs leads to the transcription of genes involved in the inflammatory response, with the production of type I interferons (IFNs), particularly IFN-a/b, being an essential step in antiviral response [18] . Type I IFNs are produced by many immune and nonimmune cells [16, 19, 20] and elicit intrinsic antiviral responses [21] . In particular, they are essential to prime innate and adaptive lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells [22] . Natural Killer cells are fundamental components of the innate and adaptative immune systems [23] and have an important role in the response to viral infections in both humans and animal models [24] [25] [26] . Despite their beneficial antiviral activity, NK cells have been implicated as mediators of immunopathology in infectious diseases, such as those caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [27] , influenza A virus [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , hepatitis B virus [33] and hepatitis C virus [34] .",

NK cells in the lung represent a highly differentiated population with a CD57+NKG2A\u2212 phenotype and high KIR expression [36] .

Additionally, it has been shown that the KIR3DL1 inhibitory receptor and also the KIR3DS1 activating receptor can interact with HLA-B molecules expressing the Bw4 epitope. The binding strength of these KIR/HLA ligands is determined by the presence of an amino acid residue at position 80 of the Bw4 molecule (Bw4Ile80 are stronger ligands for their specific receptors, KIR3DS1 and KIR3DL1, than Bw4Thr80) [44] . However, variations in KIR-ligand interactions and binding affinities may further complicate this scenario. A typical example is that some alleles of KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 also interact with specific HLA antigens of the C2 group [45] . Sardinia with its relatively high level of genetic homogeneity is among the Italian regions with the lowest rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality. Thousands of years of isolation are responsible for the unique genetic characteristics of the Sardinian population which, in the case of COVID-19, may possibly represent an advantage.

In fact, five patients of Group S had KIR gene profiles characterized by the presence of KIR2DL2 and the absence of KIR2DS2. Although such KIR gene profiles (KIR2DL2 +/KIR2DS2-) are rare, they have previously been described in other Caucasian as well as North American populations [51] . A possible explanation for these rare haplotypes could be KIR2DS2 deletion from the original cluster, or alternatively, the variant KIR gene profile might stem back to an ancestral haplotype existing before the duplicative event responsable for the two paralogues [57] . The presence of this variant KIR gene profile (KIR2DL2+/KIR2DS2-) in the group of severely ill SARS-CoV-2 patients leads to the hypothesis that the presence of KIR2DL2 and the absence of KIR2DS2 determine a lower efficiency of NK cell-mediated defense against viral infection which consequently increases the risk of serious clinical manifestations.",

Alongside factors that contribute to disease severity such as the environment, lifestyle and preexisting conditions, there is a growing intensity of research into the role of the immune system. Indeed, in order to guarantee safe and appropriate care to patients affected by COVID-19, it will be important to identify markers that are able to predict how severe the disease will be and how it will progress.",

Surface receptors of NK cells are capable of recognizing virally infected cells as well as stressed cells, pathogens and tumors. Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors are prominent mediators of NK cell function and the transition of NK cells from a quiescent state to activation largely relies on interactions between KIRs and their HLA-C Class I ligands. The impact of these interactions on immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has yet to be unveiled.",

The group of severely ill patients resulted to have a significantly higher frequency of the KIR A/A haplotype which contains KIR genes that mainly code for receptors with an inhibitory function and a single activating but often non-functional KIR2DS4 receptor (Table 3) . Indeed, around 60% of these patients carried the 22bp deletion variant of the KIR2DS4 gene which is not expressed on the NK cell surface. The frameshift mutation caused by this deletion in exon 5 translates into a truncated KIR2DS4 protein that loses the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the full-length KIR2DS4 protein and can therefore only be secreted in a soluble form [52, 65] .",

On the one hand, effective and early action of NK cells is beneficial and contributes to viral clearance and, on the other, a lower efficiency of NK cells limits response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is furthermore complicated by the immune evasion strategies exploited by the virus. All this results in excessive and prolonged stimulation of the immune system with the progressive accumulation of infected epithelial cells, inflammatory monocyte-macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs which, in turn, leads to the production of chemokines and cytokines and further recruitment of immune cells, including NK cells, to the lungs. Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) is predominantly produced by lymphoid cells including T cells, NK cells and other innate lymphoid cells. Considering that NK cells are among the main producers of IFN-\u03b3, they are possibly among the leading culprits behind the cytokine storm led by IFN-\u03b3 that triggers inflammation-mediated acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis and subsequent morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 [69, 70] .",

In the era of COVID-19, this challenge becomes particularly important and will require the accelerated and collaborative efforts of researchers worldwide This is the first report to investigate the role of KIR genes and combinations of KIR genes and their HLA ligands in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our findings were obtained on a small and rather genetically homogeneous population in Italy and would certainly benefit from studies on larger sample sizes and/or populations with distinct genetic background and ancestry. However, the frequencies of KIR genes, KIR haplotypes and KIR-HLA ligand combinations of the Sardinian population are comparable to those observed in Northern American and other Caucasian populations [71] , suggesting that our data may be valuable in determining the risks of COVID-19 in other populations. In the Sardinian population, the presence of the KIR2DS2 gene in combination with HLA-C alleles of the C1 group seems to represent a reliable marker for the prediction of NK cell function, disease course and outcome. Combined to other clinical and immunogenetic markers, it can be used by the physician to identify patients at high risk of developing the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19. High-risk patients could then benefit from early therapeutical intervention against SARS-CoV-2 with drugs such as remdesivir, hyperimmune plasma and/or monoclonal antibodies which are currently mainly restricted to the overt phases of the infection i.e. when the patient's respiratory and other body functions are already compromised.",

However, none of these combinations achieved statistical significance, including the combination represented by KIR2DL2-3/HLA C1 [40.2% vs 34.3%, OR = 1.3 (95% CI 1.0-1.7) P = 0.09].",
