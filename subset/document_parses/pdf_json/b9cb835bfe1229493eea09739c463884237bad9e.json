So, aiming at the problems of low efficiency, long running time, missing image detail information, and poor image fusion, the image fusion algorithm at pixel level based on edge detection is proposed. e improved ROEWA (Ratio of Exponentially Weighted Averages) operator is used to detect the edge of the image. e variable precision fitting algorithm and edge curvature change are used to extract the feature line of the image edge and edge angle point of the feature to improve the stability of image fusion. According to the information and characteristics of the high-frequency region and low-frequency region, different image fusion rules are set. To cope with the high-frequency area, the local energy weighted fusion approach based on edge information is utilized. e low-frequency region is processed by merging the region energy with the weighting factor, and the fusion results of the high findings demonstrate that the image fusion technique presented in this work increases the resolution by 1.23 and 1.01, respectively, when compared to the two standard approaches. When compared to the two standard approaches, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the lack of image information. e sharpness and information entropy of the fused image are higher than the experimental comparison method, and the running time is shorter and has better robustness.",

Firstly, based on the hypothesis that the difference of each band before and after fusion is consistent with the observed spatial difference, the constraint term of spatial structure edge adaptation was proposed; then, based on the assumption that the relative relationship between the bands before and after fusion was invariant, the constraint term of the consistency of spectral band proportion was proposed; finally, the new constraint term was introduced into the variational model. e gradient descent method was used to solve the energy minimization problem, and the fusion result was obtained. e time-consuming process of image fusion was shorter, but the effect of image fusion was worse, the image definition was lower, and the image information loss was more. Gu et al. proposed a pixel-level image fusion algorithm based on block directional wavelet transform [14, 15] . e input image was evenly divided into several subblocks, and the directional wavelet of each image was determined by training; the sparse coefficients were obtained by the sparse transform of the image using the directional wavelet of the block, and the fusion coefficients were inversely transformed to obtain the fused image. e algorithm had a better image fusion effect, higher image clarity, and less information loss, but the running time was longer and the efficiency was lower. Zhao et al. proposed an image fusion algorithm of sparse representation at pixel level based on genetic algorithm optimization [16] . e fusion rules of sparse coefficients were determined by weighting coefficients, and the optimal weighting coefficients were solved by a genetic algorithm to realize the fusion of panchromatic and multispectral images at the pixel level. e image fusion effect of the algorithm was good, but the computation was large and the process was very complicated.",
