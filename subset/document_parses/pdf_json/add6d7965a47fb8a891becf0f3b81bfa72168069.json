[3] As a result, a state of health emergency was declared at the international level, and each country implemented measures to contain the virus and mitigate the health, economic, and social impact. In Argentina, the government decreed a preventive and mandatory social isolation (ASPO, for its acronym in Spanish), which officially took effect on March 20, 2020. The decree imposed restrictions such as the free movement of persons, the closure of external and internal borders, the stoppage of services and work and economic activities considered non-essential, and the suspension of cultural, religious, sports, and recreational meetings and events. [4] Studies on the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome showed psychological consequences in survivors, such as stress and distress, and the presence of anxiety and feelings of anger in the general confined population.

[6] [7] [8] [9] Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has been related to psychological distress, with data showing ranges from 24.6% to 56% [10] ; among other factors, the frequent exposure to social networks or news about the pandemic are presented as predictors of these negative effects. [9, 11] In people with previously diagnosed psychiatric disorders, the effects of COVID-19 isolation are unclear. For example, a higher level of distress is reported as compared to that experienced by healthy people due to the lack or alteration of stress coping strategies, especially towards the pandemic, or less access to medical care, [8] and, in addition, an increase in consumption of substances such as alcohol, but with no increase in affective experiences or in the symptomatology of such disorders. [12] Having pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, can become a risk factor for psychological distress due to the perception of increased risk of mortality, difficulty accessing medical services, and increased sensitivity to external stressors such as mandatory isolation. [13] [14] [15] In Argentina, some studies associated with the mental health status of the population due to COVID-19 started early. An example is a study conducted during the first week of the ASPO [16] with the aim of measuring affective reactions in Argentine adults. High rates of depressive and anxious emotional reaction were observed even with very low infectious rates of COVID-19 in the country and an early adaptive reaction. The youngest group (18-25 years) showed the highest prevalence of symptoms, while the group of women presented more symptoms of depression and anxiety. Also, after the first month of ASPO, an exploration of psychological effects was carried out and the following were detected as more relevant: fear of personal and/or close family contagion, severe distress, sadness and feeling down and with depressive mood, as well as an increase in the consumption of alcoholic drinks. Being a woman, young, and unemployed appears as a factor of greater psychological vulnerability. [17, 18] A study comparing 3 periods of lockdown detected a sustained and significant increase in the number of people at risk of suffering from a mental disorder, which was higher in women and young people who lived the region with the highest population density, Greater Buenos Aires. [19, 20] On an emotional level, 56.3% expressed feeling more anxiety and 33.5% expressed greater difficulty sleeping than before the pandemic. [20] In contrast, the research by Eidman et al, [5] conducted in 20 Argentine provinces, reports 66.7% of participants with languishing mental health, with a higher proportion in men and married people.",

Thus, although being a woman and a young person appear recurrently as predictors of distress or psychological distress, [7, 9, 10, 11] the heterogeneity of the studies allows to understand that factors of vulnerability include being male, being over 60 years old, having a high level of education, being unemployed, or being a student, as well as living with many people in confined spaces or having a non-cohabiting relationship. [8, [15] [16] [17] [18] 21] These differences detected in the research on psychological distress associated with COVID-19 suggest the need for studies aimed at consolidating empirical evidence during epidemics. [22, 23] Therefore, the objective of the study was to analyze the psychological distress in an Argentine population sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying the potential predictive role of sociodemographic variables and factors related to the general health of the participants.",

Health-related variables: dichotomous answer questions were included to assess the presence of chronic diseases, medication intake of some kind, need for health care in a health center, clinic, or hospital in the past 14 days, quarantine for presenting symptoms, as well as testing for COVID-19. To assess selfperceived health in the 14 days prior to the participation in the study, an item with 5 response options (lousy, bad, mediocre, good, and very good) was used. Contact history in the past 14 days: 3 questions with categorical answers (no, yes, or does not know) were included to assess the presence of close or casual contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. The presence of contact with any person or material suspicious of being infected with COVID-19 was also assessed. Psychological distress: the General Health Questionnaire [26] was used to assess the presence of psychological distress. This selfadministered questionnaire consists of 12 items for which the participant must indicate how they have felt regarding their health in recent weeks. It is answered using a Likert-type scale of 4 answer options (1-4), which are transformed into a dichotomous score (0-0-1-1) for correction, so that the total score on the scale ranges from 0 to 12 points. The Cronbach alpha obtained for this study was 0.88.",

Likewise, its association with sociodemographic variables and health conditions in the general population has been identified. Local studies [16] [17] [18] [19] conducted during the first weeks of lockdown identified psychological distress in the Argentine population, with rates above 70%, higher than those reported prior to the COVID-19 health emergency. [29] It is noteworthy that these rates occurred despite a low number of confirmed cases and deaths, which could be due to an emotional reaction to the sudden and forced interruption of normal daily life. [16, 30, 31] The literature does not only point to the direct effect of the pandemic on mental health, but also to its indirect effect caused by the measures taken to contain the virus. The efficacy of lockdown as a containment and safety measure in previous epidemics has been studied. [32] [33] [34] However, Rubin and Wessely [30] point out that the potential benefits of a quarantine can be mitigated by the impact on the mental health of the population, regardless of whether or not the evolution of a disease can be controlled. This impact is most significant when isolation measures are official and imposed, and this includes anxiety and fear of stigmatization of those who have gone through the disease. However, evidence suggests that people under lockdown are more likely to develop various psychological symptoms such as insomnia, emotional fatigue, fears, and depression. [13, 14, 32] In addition, these symptoms are intensified in developing countries, with a high number of self-employed, independent workers, or low-wage workers. [32] In the case of this study, conducted between May and August 2020, it was identified that 60.9% of the participants had psychological distress. Thus, when considering that various studies on the impact of lockdown by epidemics place the prevalence of distress between 20% and 57%, [8, 10] it is observed that, in the present study sample, there was greater psychological vulnerability, being the results consistent with what was reported in different national [5, [17] [18] [19] and international studies. [6, 7, 11, 12, 15, 23] In addition, the reported percentage shows that levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic remained above prevalence rates for symptoms and use of mental health services in Argentina. [16] Likewise, the evidence reported by researchers from the Observatory of Comparative Social Psychology of the University of Buenos Aires [19] shows a sustained and significant increase in the number of people at risk of suffering from a mental disorder over 3 time periods of the pandemic (7-11 days; 50-55 days; and 115-124 days), being higher in the region with the highest population density, possibly due to the implementation of more strict measures. All these results would be related to the permanent uncertainty about the completion of the ASPO and to the sustained expectations about the return to face-to-face work and educational activities, as well as about the reopening of leisure activities and gatherings.",

            "text": "In relation to the assessed sociodemographic variables, statistically significant relationships with sex, age, and marital status were detected. Regarding the first 2 variables, a greater presence of psychological distress was observed in women and in the younger age group, which is consistent with the reports of national [16] [17] [18] [19] and international studies. [6, 7, 12, 15] In the case of sex, being a woman is considered a personal/individual risk factor for psychological distress, and mood disorders in general, [8, 9, 16, 18] which could have been magnified during the ASPO. It can be assumed that the increase in symptomatology among women is associated, in a high percentage of cases, with the reduction or total loss of family income that may lead to the consequent alteration of the family economy, as well as with the transfer of education to the heart of the home, the lack of equitable division of domestic responsibilities, and the increase in situations of domestic violence. [7, 20, 31] The inverse relationship between levels of psychological distress and the age of the participants could be understood in different ways. Some studies suggest that the increase in psychiatric symptoms or more negative emotional reactions in the younger group may be due to the fact that this group has less flexible coping styles in the face of adverse situations, [5, 9, 23] or to the limitation of social life and physical, work, and educational activities, with a more negative perception of the cost-benefit ratio of lockdown measures. [16, 31] On the other hand, it should be considered that this study, like others, has been carried out through online questionnaires, which could have biased the group of older adults participating, [8, 11] not being properly reflected the reality of those who have remained isolated from their support networks and did not have access to information and communication technologies during the studied period of time. At the same time, it is considered that young people could have presented more indicators of psychological distress due to information overload through virtual social networks and difficulties in differentiating fake and truthful information in relation to COVID-19. [15, 23] Regarding marital status, it was detected that single people presented mental morbidity, which could be due to the difficulties in balancing work and daily life as the new situation brought about, as well as to the limitation of social life and the perception of loneliness and lack of support networks in case of contracting the disease. This can be understood in the light of other studies [7, 8, 10, 17, 18] which showed that having children and living with a partner or family member operate as factors of well-being or perception of less discomfort, while living alone or having a non-cohabiting partner would become factors of psychological distress. The differences with the study by Eidman et al [5] could be due both to the difference in the methodological approach and in the conceptualization of psychological variables.",
