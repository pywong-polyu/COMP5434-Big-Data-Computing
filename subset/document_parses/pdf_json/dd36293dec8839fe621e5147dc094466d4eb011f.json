Two binary words are pn-equivalent if their maximal numbers of 1s in any factor of length n are equal for all n \u2208 N. Burcsi et al. [5] showed that this relation is indeed an equivalence relation and moreover that each class contains exactly one uniquely determined representative -called a prefix normal word. A word w is said to be prefix normal if the prefix of w of any length has at least the number of 1s as any of w's factors of the same length. For instance, the word 110101 is prefix normal but 101101 is not, witnessed by the fact that 11 is a factor but not a prefix. Both words are pn-equivalent. In addition to being representatives of the pne-classes, prefix normal words are also of interest since they are connected to Lyndon words, in the sense that every prefix normal word is a pre-necklace [14] . Furthermore, as shown in [14] , the indexed jumbled pattern matching problem (see e.g. [2, 4, 18] ) is connected to prefix normal forms: if the prefix normal forms are given, the indexed jumbled pattern matching problem can be solved in linear time O(n) of the word length n. The best known algorithm for this problem has a run-time of O(n 1.864 ) (see [7] ). Consequently there is also an interest in prefix normal forms from an algorithmic point of view. An algorithm for the computation of all prefix normal words of length n in run-time O(n) per word is given in [8] . Balister and Gerke [1] showed that the number of prefix normal words of length n is 2 n\u2212\u0398(log 2 (n)) and the class of a given prefix normal word contains at most 2 n\u2212O( \u221a n log(n)) elements. A closed formula for the number of prefix normal words is still unknown. In \"OEIS\" [15] the number of prefix normal words of length n (A194850), a list of binary prefix normal words (A238109), and the maximum size of a class of binary words of length n having the same prefix normal form (A238110), can be found.

In this work we investigate two conspicuities mentioned in [3, 14] : palindromes and extension-critical words. Generalising the result of [3] we prove that prefix normal palindromes (pnPal) play a special role since they are not pn-equivalent to any other word. Since not all palindromes are prefix normal, as witnessed by 101101, determining the number of pnPals is an (unsolved) subproblem. We show that solving this sub-problem brings us closer to determining the index, i.e. number of equivalence classes w.r.t. a given word length, of the pnequivalence relation. Moreover we give a characterisation based on the maximumones function for pnPals. The notion of extension-critical words is based on an iterative approach: compute the prefix normal words of length n + 1 based on the prefix normal words of length n. A prefix normal word w is called extensioncritical if w1 is not prefix normal. For instance, the word 101 is prefix normal but 1011 is not and thus 101 is called extension-critical. This means that all nonextension-critical words contribute to the class of prefix normal words of the next word-length. We investigate the set of extension-critical words by introducing an equivalence relation collapse, grouping all extensional-critical words that are pnequivalent w.r.t. length n + 1. Finally we prove that (prefix normal) palindromes and the collapsing relation (extensional-critical words) are related. In contrast to [14] we work with suffix-normal words (least representatives) instead of prefixnormal words.

By Corollary 2 the lexicographically smallest LR w among the collapsing leads to the LR of [1w] . Thus if w is a LR not collapsing with any lexicographically smaller word then 1w is LR.Before we present the theorem characterizing exactly the collapsing words for a given word w, we show a symmetry-property of the LRs which are not extendable to LRs, i.e. a property of words which collapse.The following theorem extends this result for determining the collapsing words w for a given word w.Theorem 2 allows us to construct the equivalence classes w.r.t. the least representatives of the previous length but more tests than necessary have to be performed: Consider, for instance w = 11101100111011111 which is a smallest LR of length 17 not collapsing with any lexicographically smaller LR. For w we have f w = 1 \u00b7 2 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 4 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 6 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 8 \u00b7 8 \u00b7 8 \u00b7 9 \u00b7 10 \u00b7 10 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 12 \u00b7 13 where the dots just act as separators between letters. Thus we know for any w collapsing with w, that f w (1) = 1 and f w (17) = 13. The constraints f w (2) \u2208 {f w (2), f w (2) + 1} and f w (2) \u2264 f w (2) implies f w (2) \u2208 {1, 2}. First the check that f w (10) = 4 is impossible excludes f w (2) = 1. Since no collapsing word can have a factor of length 2 with only one 1, a band in which the possible values range can be defined by the unique greatest collapsing word w . It is not surprising that this word is connected with the prefix normal form. The following two lemmata define the band in which the possible collapsing words f w are.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 174, "text": "[1w]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Corollary 2."}]}
