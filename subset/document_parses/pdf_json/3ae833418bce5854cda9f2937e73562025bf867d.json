            "text": "Antibody serosurveillance is an essential tool for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic, offering a more comprehensive picture of who has been infected than swab testing of symptomatic individuals alone. In recent months, several countries have done largescale seroprevalence surveys, including the USA, 1,2 China, 3 Brazil, 4 England, 5 and Spain. 6 These studies have confirmed that the world is still in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of the populations surveyed testing negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies.",

            "text": "The surveys carried out so far have two major limitations. The first is the use of sampling strategies prone to selection bias, including non-random, unrepresentative sampling, 3,4 postal sampling with substantial dropout, 2,6 or convenience sampling. 1 This is problematic for an infection that disproportionately affects some ethnic groups and deprived communities who are less likely to participate in research. 5, 7 The second is the use of antibody tests with inadequate performance characteristics. Most large surveys have sought to avoid costly laboratory testing by using point-of-care lateral flow assays. 2,4-6 These tests are often poorly validated on a handful of samples, 2 can be subject to interbatch variation, and even when thoroughly assessed have inferior sensitivity to laboratory assays (<90%). 8 This adds uncertainty and necessitates substantial adjustment of raw data to account for false-negative results. 9 In The Lancet, Shuchi Anand and colleagues describe an inventive, practical, and scalable strategy for conducting SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys, which overcomes these limitations. 10 By testing the remainder plasma of 28 503 randomly selected patients receiving dialysis in the USA, they were able to test an unbiased sample of an important patient group across the entire country.",

There was a remarkable variation in seroprevalence by state in the sampled participants, with early pandemic hotspots such as New York (33\u00b76%, 95% CI 31\u00b77-35\u00b76), Louisiana (17\u00b76%, 10\u00b78-28\u00b77), and Illinois (17\u00b75%, 15\u00b72-20\u00b72) recording substantially higher seroprevalence than their respective neighbouring states of Pennsylvania (6\u00b74%, 4\u00b77-8\u00b78), Arkansas (1\u00b79%, 1\u00b70-3\u00b75), and Missouri (1\u00b79%, 0\u00b79-3\u00b78).",

Given antibodies take days rather than weeks to appear, this might underestimate the true proportion of patients diagnosed by swab testing.

Despite adjustments for age, sex, region, and race and ethnicity, the dialysis population's risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be representative of the general population: attending a health-care facility three times a week would seem like a good way to encounter SARS-CoV-2, as has been shown elsewhere. 11 However, concerns over sample applicability are bidirectional: patients with end-stage kidney disease and associated comorbidities might be less likely to mount a detectable antibody response. 12 They are also more likely to die from COVID-19, 13 increasing the chance of unexposed, seronegative survivors being overrepresented in the sample. Although general population estimates from dialysis sampling are imperfect, they at least remain consistent across the country and from one survey to the next, permitting longitudinal surveillance.",
