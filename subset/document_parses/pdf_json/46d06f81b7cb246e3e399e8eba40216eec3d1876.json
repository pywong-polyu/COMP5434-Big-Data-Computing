            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19, an infection capable of causing severe disease and death but which can also be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic. We investigated whether ABO blood group or secretor status was associated with COVID-19 severity. We investigated secretor status because expression of ABO glycans on secreted proteins and non-erythroid cells are controlled by a fucosyltransferase (FUT2), and inactivating FUT2 mutations result in a non-secretor phenotype which protects against some viral infections. Data combined from healthcare records and our own laboratory tests (n = 275) of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction positive patients confirmed higher than expected numbers of blood group A individuals compared to O (RR = 1.24, CI 95% [1.05, 1.47], p = 0.0111). There was also a significant association between group A and COVID-19-related cardiovascular complications (RR = 2.56, CI 95% [1.43, 4.55], p = 0.0011) which is independent of gender.",

Human blood group antigens are among the first polymorphic structures encountered by viruses and bacteria upon airborne contact with respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinogenital mucosal surfaces [2] . The carbohydrate antigens of the ABO and Lewis blood group systems are found on mucosal surfaces where their presence is controlled by a fucosyltransferase (FUT2) [3, 4] . In the presence of active FUT2 A, B, H, and Le b antigens can be expressed on mucosal surfaces. Individuals with this phenotype are known as secretors [5, 6] . In individuals lacking active FUT2, known as non-secretors, only the Le a antigen can be expressed [5] . There are several well studied interactions between host cells and both bacteria (Helicobacter pylori, Vibrio cholera) and viruses (noroviruses, rotaviruses) which are known to depend on the presence of these antigens [7, 8] . In particular, it is clearly established that common strains of norovirus and rotavirus fail to infect non-secretors [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Currently, more than 112 million people have been infected worldwide, and, of those, more than 2.5 million have died as a result of the disease. It was apparent from the earliest studies that disease severity in individual patients varied considerably, ranging from asymptomatic infection to fatal illness [14] . Zhao et al provided the first evidence of an association between blood group polymorphisms and with disease severity [15] . In a study of over 2000 infected patients from Wuhan, China, it was noted that group A phenotype was found more frequently than expected in patients with COVID-19, whereas group O occurred less commonly than expected in the general population, suggesting that group A individuals are at greater risk from COVID-19 than those of group O. This observation led us to undertake a study of the association of blood group polymorphisms (ABO and secretor status) with COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients in Bristol, UK.",

            "text": "Studies carried out in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients in China were the first to link blood group A with greater susceptibility to COVID-19 compared to blood group O [15] . Since then, multiple other studies carried out in other countries have supported an association between ABO type and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to infection and/or outcomes [24] [25] [26] [27] . The reasons for the association of severe COVID-19 with blood type A are unknown, but it has been suggested that this could be caused by O group patients having anti-A type antibodies [28] , that A type glycans could function as co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2 [29] or due to the known effects of blood groups on thrombosis risk due to von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels [30] . However, recently, the conclusion that ABO group influences COVID-19 severity has been questioned [31, 32] .",

VWF forms high molecular multimers with increasing levels of multimerization leading to increased VWF adhesion to collagen and VWF induced platelet aggregation [36] . Plasma levels of VWF multimers are regulated by proteolytic cleavage by ADAMTS13 [37] with N-glycosylation of VWF, particularly at position 1574 near the site of cleavage by ADAMTS13, providing some protection against proteolysis [38] . It follows that more extensive glycosylation of VWF found in group A secretors but lacking in group O secretors would also result in higher circulating levels of high molecular weight VWF multimers in Group A. In addition, it has been observed that ABO genotype is a major determinant of ABO expression on platelets with homozygous A giving the highest expression [39] ; ABO expression on platelets determines how they adhere to VWF captured by exposed collagen in the endothelium [40] , with non-group O platelets adhering more strongly than group O. This leads to increased and more stable thrombus production in non-group O individuals. Therefore, group A and homozygous Se individuals have higher plasma levels of VWF, less proteolytic cleavage of high molecular weight multimeric VWF, and group A platelets adhere more strongly to VWF. The cumulative effect would predispose homozygous Se Group A patients to cardiac problems and thrombosis during infections with SARS-CoV-2. The mechanism whereby infection with SARS-CoV-2 influences this predisposition is currently unknown, but COVID-19 has been reported to be associated with inducing a hypercoagulable state [41] . It is known that VWF protein levels associated with pulmonary vascular endothelial cells are linked to ABO determinants [42] . We speculate that binding of SARS-CoV-2 virus to its receptor ACE2 in the lungs may activate TA B L E 5 Retrospective analysis of patients admitted to North Bristol NHS Trust (UK) and enrolled onto the DISCOVER study, that were genotyped for ABO blood group and secretor status.

They also indicate that determination of the genotype and secretor status of group A individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a useful diagnostic aid to the stratification of risk of severity in hospitalized patients. More extensive studies are needed to further explore the stratification of patients by blood group and/or VWF glycosylation and thereby facilitate identification of the most at risk and to understand the complex disease mechanism that induces the hypercoagulative state.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported by the National Institute for Health Research Blood and Transplant Research Unit (NIHR BTRU) in Red Cell Products (IS-BTU-1214-10032) and the Department of Health (England) (National Health Service Blood and Transplant research and development grant -WP15-04 and WP15-05).

Blood group O is used as the baseline for comparison. In epithelial tissues and secretions, ABO expression is heavily dependent on the inheritance of the Secretor Se/FUT2 gene which can also be protective against viral infection. Due to mutations in other fucosyltransferase genes, individuals can also be Le a\u2212b\u2212 and rarelyLe a+b+ so secretor status cannot always be determined by red cell typing alone. We therefore conducted DNA analysis on this cohort to further determine ABO and secretor status and subsequently compared all symptom and laboratory values to ABO and secretor genotype.",
