            "text": "Novel topological methods are introduced to protein research. The aim is to identify hot-spot sites where a bifurcation can alter the local topology of the protein backbone. Since the shape of a protein is intimately related to its biological function, a substitution that causes a bifurcation should have an enhanced capacity to change the protein's function. The methodology applies to any protein but it is developed with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a timely example. First, topological criteria are introduced to identify and classify potential bifurcation hot-spot sites along the protein backbone. Then, the expected outcome of asubstitution, if it occurs, is estimated for a general class of hot-spots, using a comparative analysis of the surrounding backbone segments. The analysis combines the statistics of structurally commensurate amino acid fragments in the Protein Data Bank with general stereochemical considerations. It is observed that the notorious D614G substitution of the spike protein is a good example of a bifurcation hot-spot. A number of topologically similar examples are then analyzed in detail, some of them are even better candidates for a bifurcation hot-spot than D614G. The local topology of the more recently observed N501Y substitution is also inspected, and it is found that this site is proximal to a different kind of local topology changing bifurcation.",

Topology based methods are among the most versatile tools available to predict, model and analyze a wide range of Physics related phenomena, from fundamental interactions to condensed matter and dynamical systems [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, despite the apparently rich and intriguing topology of many biomolecules, thus far topological methods have been sparsely applied to biophysical problems. Among the notable exemptions are the analysis of enzyme action on DNA and the challenge to understand the biological role of knots in folded proteins [5] ; here we do not consider topology as it is defined in structural biology, where the concept relates to orientation of regular secondary structures in a protein backbone.",

            "text": "Here a novel topological methodology, apparently with no previous physical or biological applications, is introduced and developed for biophysical purposes. The methodology builds on the concept of a bifurcation [4, 6] that can change the local topology of a protein backbone. The mathematical framework was originally introduced and analyzed by Arnol'd [7] [8] [9] . He investigated continuously differentiable space curves, and the present article adapts his results to the case of a discrete piecewise linear chain such as the protein C\u03b1 backbone. Bifurcation theory describes how a small change in an input parameter can cause a large scale change in the system [4, 6] , bifurcations are a common cause for qualitative changes in a physical system. Accordingly it is proposed here that in the case of a protein backbone, amino acid sites that are proximal to a local topology changing bifurcation are good candidates for a hot-spot where a small alteration e.g. by substitution can have a large biological effect.",

Before the fusion with a host cell takes place the spike protein is in the prefusion conformation, and the present study focuses solely on the protein in this conformation. The monomer structure of the prefusion conformation is as follows: Starting from the N-terminal, first there is a short signal peptide. This is followed by two larger subunit, S1 and S2. The subunit S1 can recognize the host cell and bind to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The subunit S2 can bind to the membrane of the host cell, to mediate the fusion between the virus and the host cell. The Fig 1A identifies the major functional domains in these subunits in a monomeric spike protein [20, 21] : The S1 subunit consists of residues between the sites 14-685. It starts with a N-terminal domain (NTD) with residues 14-305 [27] . The NTD is followed by the receptor binding domain (RBD, residues 319-541) [28] . The junction segment between the S1 and S2 subunits includes several cleavage sites [29] . The S2 subunit that comprises the rest of the protein, contains the fusion peptide (FP, residues 788-806) followed by two heptapeptide repeat sequences (HR1, residues 912-984) and (HR2, residues 1163-1213), the transmembrane domain (TM, residues 1213-1237) and the cytoplasm domain tail (CT, residues 1237-1273) [30] .",

It is a major target in both vaccine research and therapeutic research that combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But the spike protein evolves and mutates continuously which makes it a demanding target for the development of antiviral inhibitors. Among the prominent examples of a mutation in the spike protein, which is analyzed here as an example of a bifurcation, is the D!G substitution that occurred at its site 614, near the junction between the subunits S1 and S2. Apparently this mutation converted SARS-CoV-2 into a more transmissible form, and the D614G mutated virus now dominates in the global COVID-19 pandemic [31] .

First, a general class of local topologies with a bifurcation hot-spot is identified. It consists of backbone segments that surround a site that is proximal to a flattening point: The D614G substitution occurred at such a hotspot, thus the details of the methodology are worked out with the site 614 of the spike protein as an example. All similar bifurcation hot-spot sites of the spike protein, with a site proximal to a flattening point, are tabulated in the currently available PDB structures. Additional examples are analyzed, including the identification of the likely amino acid substitution that may take place at such a hot-spot. Finally, the site of the N501Y substitution is identified as a different kind of hot-spot, and analyzed as an additional example of a bifurcation.",

The base of the i th tangent vector t i that is located at the position r i of the i th C\u03b1 atom coincides with the centre of a two-sphere with the vector t i pointing towards its north pole. Now, translate the sphere from the location of the i th C\u03b1 atom to the location of the (i + 1) th C\u03b1 atom, without any rotation of the sphere with respect to the i th Frenet frames. Identify the direction of t i+1 , i.e. the direction towards the C\u03b1 atom at site r i+2 from the site r i+1 , on the surface of the sphere in terms of the ensuing spherical coordinates (\u03ba i , \u03c4 i ).

In a crystallographic protein structure where the C\u03b1 positions are experimentally determined, an inflection point is detectable as a very small value of the bond angle \u03ba i at the proximal C\u03b1 vertex. Similarly, the presence of a simple flattening point can be deduced from a very small torsion angle value at the proximal vertex, accompanied by a sign change in \u03c4 between two neighboring vertices; if the sign of \u03c4 does not change the proximal vertex has the character of a bi-flattening point. Accordingly, when searching for C\u03b1 atoms where essential shape changes such as inflection point or bi-flattening perestroikas can take place, the natural points to start are the neighborhoods of vertices where either \u03ba i \ufffd 0 or \u03c4 i \ufffd 0.

Moreover, the spike protein site 614 of the notorious D!G substitution is a good example of a site that is proximal to a flattening point. This motivates to select the flattening points of the spike protein as a starting point for presenting the general methodology. However, the methodology is quite independent of this choice, it is applicable to any kind of local topology changing bifurcation and to any protein backbone. As an example, it is shown that the recently observed N501Y substitution in the spike protein can provide an example of an inflection point bifurcation. First, the sites along the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein C\u03b1 backbone that are proximal to a flattening point are classified. Their local neighborhoods are then inspected by comparisons with Fig 3, to investigate the potential bifurcations. The Table 1 lists all those SARS-CoV-2 spike protein C\u03b1-sites that are proximal to a flattening point in the PDB structures 6VXX (closed state) and 6VYB (open state). Here a torsion angle value is determined to be proximal to a flattening point when |\u03c4 i | < 0.2; other (small) values could also be considered. This value is chosen since in terms of distance, it is less than the radius of a carbon atom: With 3.2 \u00c5 the diagonal length of a peptide plane, a distance of 0.2 radians in angle between two points corresponds to a distance slightly above 0.6 \u00c5 in length. The histogram in Fig 4 shows the two states involves changes in local topology that affect in particular the NTD and RBD domains, and the HR1-HR2 junction.",

In [41] the fragments that appear in high resolution PDB structures have been organized into disjoint clusters. To assign a cluster to a fragment, there must be at least one other fragment in the same cluster within a prescribed RMS cut-off distance; in [41] the cut-off is 0.2 \u00c5. Two clusters are then disjoint, when the RMSD between any fragment in the first cluster and any fragment in the second cluster exceeds this RMS cut-off distance. It was found that around 38% of protein loops in the high resolution PDB structures can be decomposed into fragments that belong to twelve disjoint clusters, labeled I-XII in [41] . When fragments from an additional set of 30 disjoint clusters are included, the coverage increases to \ufffd 52% [41] .",

If the size of this statistically most probable amino acid is smaller than the size of the present amino acid at the i th site, a substitution is considered to be sterically possible without a wider rearrangement of the backbone conformation so that a bifurcation is likely to take place in its vicinity. But if the size is larger, a substitution likely requires a wider extended rearrangement of the spike protein conformation. This can be energetically costly and entail a relocation of the bifurcation site. Thus, one can expect that a smaller residue should in most cases be more likely to be better tolerated than a larger residue. In fact a larger residue may or may not be tolerated at all, depending on the structural context. Therefore, as a reasonable approximation smaller residues are here considered to be the most probable substitutions.

The best matching preceding (P) cluster is also shown, it is the cluster #XII of [41] . From Table 1 the RMSD (18) between the spike protein segment and the cluster has the value \u0394 min \ufffd 0.76\u00c5. This is clearly larger than the 0.2 \u00c5 cut-off used in [41] . Nevertheless, the cluster is included in the analysis since the resolution at which the spike protein PDB structures (6VXX, 6VYB and 6XS6) have been measured is also clearly smaller than the resolution of the structures used in [41] . This justifies that despite the relatively large value of \u0394 min the present analysis proceeds with cluster #XII, keeping in mind that the \u0394 min is not very small.",

Thus, as in the case of 614, the site 59 is prone to an inflection point bifurcation such as those described in Fig 3. The RMSD values (18) are all quite small, indeed clearly smaller than in the case of 614D, so that the three clusters that are identified in the Fig 6 are a very good match. The statistical analysis of all three clusters show that G has a very high probability at the site 59; both S and D have some propensity albeit much smaller than G while the probability of the existing amino acid F is very small. Thus the site 59 is a very good candidate for a F!G substitution.",

Thus both spike protein segments are well represented by the ensuing clusters. But in the case of Fig 10c) the value is much larger, \u0394 min = 0.7 so that this segment is not well represented by the cluster. According to all three histograms in Fig 10 the likelihood of the observed N!Y substitution at site 501 should be lower than substitutions N!A or N!D by the similarly hydrophobic A and D. Furthermore, since Y has a much larger size than N, a priori the N!Y substitution requires an extensive conformational rearrangement which can be energetically costly.

The fragments in the subset A all pass very close the inflection point \u03ba = 0, in a manner which is very similar to the 499-501 segment in Fig 10. The fragments in the subset B all cross the \u03c4 = 0 line in a manner that is topologically similar to the A-B-C segments in Fig 3a) and 3b) (except for orientation). A comparison of the two subsets A and B in the Fig 12b) reveals that there is a transition akin the peptide plane flip observed in [43] . For this, define the normal vector of the peptide plane between the C\u03b1(i \u2212 i) and C\u03b1(i), as the cross product between the vector t i and the vector that points from C\u03b1(i \u2212 i) to the O(i) atom of the corresponding peptide plane. Similarly, define the normal vector of the peptide plane between C\u03b1(i) and C\u03b1(i + 1). Then, evaluate the angle between these two normal vectors. The result is shown in the histogram of Fig 12b) : For all entries in the subset A of Fig  12a) the angle has a value which is very close to \u2212\u03c0/2 while for all entries in the subset B the angle has a value that is very close to + \u03c0/2.

The interrelation between the direction of the C\u03b2 side chain and the deformation of the C\u03b1 backbone has been determined using the methods described in [43, 44] . The deformation of the C\u03b1 backbone is local, it engages only the sites 499-503, as shown in Fig 14; beyond these sites the C\u03b1 backbone coincides with the original spike protein backbone and there are no steric conflicts in the deformed backbone. Furthermore, as seen in Fig 11 there is no steric hinder, by the other amino acid side chains, that would prevent the Y side chain from rotating between the two positions: The Fig 14 shows the deformed backbone, after the Y side chain has been rotated away from the \"pocket\" so that it points directly to the solvent. 501N .

The two additional crossings, in comparison to Fig 11, are needed for the 180 degree rotation of the C\u03b2 at site 501, so that it points to the opposite direction. Notably, the trajectory in this hypothetical example passes twice very close to the inflection point \u03ba = 0. Alternative hypothetical trajectories can be considered.

Any other protein could be used equally but the choice of the spike protein is timely, reflecting the current pandemic situation. This choice also brings some downside, as the available structural data on the spike protein has been measured with relatively low resolution and is also partially lacking, at the time of writing: The Protein Data Bank structures that are used in the present study have been determined using Cryo-EM with a resolution no better than around 2.8-3.5 \u00c5. The low resolution causes also some uncertainty in the proper identification of sites that are proximal to a flattening point. At the same time the statistical analysis that is used here for the identification of the pertinent PDB clusters is also preliminary, as it is based on a somewhat limited set of structural clusters that are measured with ultra high resolution. Therefore, a further development and refinement of the underlying statistical methodology is desired. Finally, the present article concerns only the local topology of a protein backbone. A more complete analysis should combine topological investigations with energetic studies. But that brings a practical limitation, as the presently available all-atom molecular force fields are still not very accurate and demand substantial computational resources. Here Chimera has been employed, simply because it is a method that can provide crude energetic estimates in the case complex proteins such as the spike protein, without undue need for computer resources.",

            "text": "These Figures depict the three characteristic examples of a protein loop topology, when the loop interpolates between two righthanded \u03b1-helices; similar considerations apply when the interpolation is between any two generic points. For clarity: Whenever a Figure similar to those in Fig 3 is drawn in the sequel, the two neighboring vertices i.e. values (\u03ba i , \u03c4 i ) and (\u03ba i+1 , \u03c4 i+1 ) are always to be connected by a virtual segment that is a straight line on the disk. Even though in reality those values of (\u03ba, \u03c4) that are on the straight line may not correspond to any actual atomic position along the piecewise linear C\u03b1 backbone. At the level of local topology, this has no effect. In all Fig 3, for convenience the initial points (A) and the final points (E) are fixed and located near the \u03b1-helical region where the torsion angle has a positive value close to \u03c4 \ufffd 1 but this can be changed with no effect. At the points (B) and (C) the torsion angles are always negative in the Fig 3. At the point (D) the torsion angle is positive. In the Fig 3a) the chain proceeds from point (A) to point (B) by crossing the line of flattening points \u03c4 = 0. It then continues to point (C). From there it proceeds and crosses the line of flattening points a second time, to arrive at point (D) where the torsion angle returns to a positive value. The chain then continues and ends at point (E). In this case the local topology is fully analogous to that of a regular curve. In particular, the two flattening points along the chain can be removed by a bi-flattening perestroika that lifts both points (B) and (C) above the line \u03c4 = 0 to positive \u03c4 i values, without the chain crossing the inflection point \u03ba = 0 at the center of the disk. In the Fig 3b) the chain proceeds to the point (B), again by crossing the line of flattening points \u03c4 = 0. From there it proceeds to point (C) that is located near the \u03b2-stranded region. The chain then crosses the line of \u03b2-flattening points \u03c4 = \u00b1\u03c0 as it proceeds to point (D) where the torsion angle is positive. The chain finally ends at point (E) in the \u03b1-helical region. In this case there is only one flattening point along the chain, since the second time the torsion angle changes its sign at a \u03b2-flattening point. The chain encircles the inflection point once in the counterclockwise direction. Neither the flattening point nor the \u03b2-flattening point can be removed without encountering an inflection point perestroika along the chain.",

            "text": "the torsion angle changes its sign between points (A) and (B) and between points (C) and (D). Now the sign change occurs at \u03b2-flattening points. The general rules of local topology for the sign change at a \u03b2-flattening point are like those at a flattening point. In particular, a pair of \u03b2-flattening points can either be created or removed in a bifurcation called \u03b2-flattening perestroika that is akin a bi-flattening perestroika. In the Fig 3c) a \u03b2-flattening perestroika occurs if the vertices (B) and (C) are both moved upwards across \u03c4 = \u00b1\u03c0 line without the chain crossing the inflection point \u03ba = 0 at the center of the disk. The folding index is a local topological invariant. For example, in Fig 3b) its value does not change unless the chain is deformed so that either the flattening point between (A) and (B) or the \u03b2-flattening point between (C) and (D) becomes removed by an inflection point perestroika, that either converts the \u03b2-flattening point into a flattening point by a deformation that takes the chain inFig 3b)into the chain inFig 3a)or converts the flattening point into a \u03b2-flattening point by a deformation that takes the chain inFig 3b)into the chain inFig 3c). In both cases the final folding index vanishes.The three examples inFig 3 summarizeall essential aspects of local topology that are encountered in the case of a discrete chain. In particular, the line of flattening points and the line of \u03b2-flattening points have a very similar character in terms of local topology. They can be interchanged by an inflection point perestroika that also changes the folding index.",
