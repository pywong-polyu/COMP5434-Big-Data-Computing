With regards to healing architectures, several studies have reported data analysis and case studies to improve users' health (patients, and medical and administrative staffs), but there are not enough regarding volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Regarding chemical pollution of indoor air, the Scientific Community has highlighted that there are several factors that affect the IAQ, in particular the design and management, and energetic efficiency, of inpatient wards. Several stakeholders, from the designers to the managers, are responsible for the indoor air in healing environments. Supported by analysis of the State of the Art and the main factors that influence the heterogeneous scenario of inpatient wards, the paper presents three check-lists, designed for supporting the stakeholders during the design phase, or for the daily procedures and maintenance activities, for pre-assessment of factors that affect chemical pollution, and for the definition of strategies to be applied. In fact, in such environments IAQ assumes a particular meaning and importance, both for the vulnerability of the patients and for the long time spent by the sanitary staff. The multidisciplinary approach emphasizes the continuous need for interdisciplinary knowledge and skills aimed at finding solutions able to protect users' health status (including patients, workers and visitors), especially in the field of the indoor air issue.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "healthcare facilities are complex constructions, due to their dimensions, the high technologies for their functioning, the relevant presence of daily users, and their 24/7 operability [9] . Therefore, during the design process of hospital settings and their management, it is necessary to guarantee healthy spaces, starting with (a) the support of managers, medical and non-medical staff, maintainers and service providers, and (b) the design of hospital planners in relation to the layouts, the material selection, the rooms' dimension, the engineering plants, etc., which can highly affect the performances of the facility and its processes [10, 11] . In fact, as Joseph and Rashid sustained, the Scientific Community has shown that healthcare design may directly affect safety in hospitals, and it probably indirectly influences safety by triggering adverse events that cause harm to users (both patients and staff) [12] . Moreover, it may also affect the safety in \"Architectures for Health\" to counteract risk factors and harmful events. Moreover, referring to Reiling et al., cognitive psychologists have stated that environment has a significant impact on safety and human performances [13] .
