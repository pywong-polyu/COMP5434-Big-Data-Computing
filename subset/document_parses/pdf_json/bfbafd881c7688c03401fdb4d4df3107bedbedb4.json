This pandemic has required communities to promptly adhere to new recommendations put forth by the federal government and leading public health agencies to mitigate population health morbidity and mortality. The changing COVID-19 guidelines have resulted in concerns expressed by the American public, including unique concerns expressed by African Americans that are likely rooted in institutional distrust stemming from persistent legacies of inequities. 1, 2 Earlier reports, in fact, suggested skepticism surrounding African Americans' perceptions of susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. Several articles were published to shift misguided public perceptions, including a seminal article featuring Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, Executive Director of the American Public Health Association, and one of the nation's most influential physician leaders. Notably, Dr. Benjamin expressed: ''We [African Americans] get a lot of misinformation circulating through our communities. We fundamentally don't trust some of the [non-black] institutions because they do not serve us well. We need to make sure our trusted institutions, clinicians of color, churches, community organizations, are better educated.'' 3 Indeed, increasing the delivery of health information and messages by trusted and respected stakeholders is critically important.",

[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The high rates of service sector jobs (grocery clerks, bus drivers, building custodians), reliance on public transportation, 8 and crowded housing conditions in some African American communities substantially contribute to the increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 among this population. 9, 10 Less access to care, delays in seeking care because of transportation and financial barriers, and greater levels of comorbidities (such as diabetes and hypertension) increase the likelihood of poor outcomes for African Americans who do get infected. 3, 4, 6 African American leaders, social justice/grassroots organizations, and other influential stakeholders have led the national call for increased research, screening, testing, and race/ethnicity data to understand, document, and address COVID-19 inequities among African American communities. 4, 5, 9, [11] [12] [13] In light of the novelty of COVID-19, the most effective prevention strategies to date include hand washing, wearing face coverings, social distancing, and adhering to stay-at-home orders. 14 However, racial/ethnic minority populations are more likely to live in densely populated areas due to residential housing segregation fundamentally rooted in institutional racism. 6, 15, 16 Thus, practicing social distancing may be particularly challenging for certain segments of the U.S. population. 14 In Birmingham, Alabama, the population of which is *70.5% African American, the Housing Authority of the Birmingham District (HABD) 17 leadership and other local community leaders have expressed the following: (1) concerns for the health and well-being of public housing residents during the pandemic; and (2) the need for targeted education and messaging delivered by trusted leaders. To increase dialogue around COVID-19 with the African American community, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) School of Public Health partnered with HABD to convene a virtual town hall on April 4, 2020. This virtual town hall was the first in a series sponsored by UAB's School of Public Health to raise public awareness of the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities.",

We invited panelists/stakeholders who self-identified as African American and have strong community relationships and knowledge of the issues faced by residents living in housing communities. Notably, the pastors who participated in the town hall have church sites in proximity to the housing communities managed by HABD. To advertise the town hall, electronic flyers were circulated through various sources, including UAB websites (including those for the Schools of Public Health and Medicine, Institute for Human Rights, and Center for Clinical and Translational Science), social media (including platforms maintained by HABD, New Rising Star Church (NRS), and Tabernacle Baptist Church), local media, national list servs, and word of mouth. We used Zoom to broadcast the town hall via Facebook Live, and convened a practice meeting with moderators and panelists 24 h before the event to address any potential connectivity and/or technological issues. The 90-min town hall was recorded and made available via YouTube for individuals who were unable to attend and for ongoing education and dialogue. 18 To date, this town hall has generated 48.6K views. The first half of the conversation focused on health, whereas the second half focused on the role of faith and community in the COVID-19 response. The town hall was moderated by two public health experts who self-identify as African American. Moderators and panelists utilized the Zoom Chat Box to communicate questions, suggestions, and challenges throughout the town hall.",

During the discussion, Pastor Beavers presented a compelling description of his personal experience with safely conducting a funeral for a loved one during the pandemic by leveraging technology. Pastor Beavers and his team prerecorded his grandfather's celebration of life service in segments. Singers, musicians, those who gave life reflections, and clergy arrived at different times to record their designated parts of the service, and the NRS video team combined the footage into one video. On the day of the homegoing, the service was livestreamed to the world. In addition, the NRS team placed LED video screens outside the church so people could drive in and watch the service. Through the gift of technology, Pastor Beavers and his family were able to honor his grandfather's legacy. In addition, Mrs. Dontrelle Young-Foster and Mrs. Sherea Harris-Turner stressed the importance of residents utilizing multiple methods of communication (e.g., text alerts, websites, social media, office phone lines, and drop boxes) to access up-to-date information about COVID-19 and other essential resources. See Table 1 for a summary of virtual town hall questions and responses.",

UAB's Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center also provided HABD with COVID-19 prevention and testing information. 23 Reliable information from trusted sources In light of the influx of information and the inherent difficulty in identifying reliable sources of information, it is important to engage trusted sources to disseminate accurate information to communities.
