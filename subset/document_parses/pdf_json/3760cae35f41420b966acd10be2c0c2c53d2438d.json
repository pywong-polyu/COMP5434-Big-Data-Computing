            "text": "A structural protein of SARS-CoV-2, nucleocapsid (N) protein is abundantly expressed during viral replication. The N protein is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 on the serine/arginine (SR) rich motif located in disordered regions. Although phosphorylation by GSK-3\u03b2 constitutes a critical event for viral replication, the molecular mechanism underlying N phosphorylation is not well understood. In this study, we found the putative alpha-helix L/FxxxL/AxxRL motif known as the GSK-3 interacting domain (GID), commonly found in many endogenous GSK-3\u03b2 binding proteins, such as Axins, FRATs, WWOX and GSKIP. Indeed, N interacts with GSK-3\u03b2 similarly to Axin, and Leu to Glu substitution of the GID abolished the interaction, with loss of N phosphorylation. Unlike with endogenous GID proteins, the N interaction neither disturbs endogenous GSK-3 activity nor regulates subsequent canonical Wnt activity and the Snail-EMT program. Notably, N abundance in SARS-CoV-2 is incomparably high compared to other coronaviruses, such as 229E, OC43 and HKU1. Compared to other coronaviruses, N harbors a CDK1 primed phosphorylation site and Gly-rich linker for enhanced phosphorylation by GSK-3\u03b2. Furthermore, we found that the S202R mutant found in Delta and R203K/G204R mutant found in the Omicron variant allows increased abundance and hyper-phosphorylation of N. Our observations suggest that the emergence of GID and mutations for increased phosphorylation in N may have contributed to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and evolution of variants, respectively. Further study, especially in a BSL3-equipped facility, is required to elucidate the 3 functional importance of GID and N phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 and variants.",

            "text": "GSK-3 is an endogenously abundant kinase which plays a key role in many signaling pathways, including Wnt signaling. In the Wnt pathway, GSK-3 is recruited to a multiprotein complex with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and scaffolding protein Axin (11, 12) . Axin directly binds to GSK-3, resulting in inhibition of the kinase activity and 5 regulation of canonical Wnt activity (13) . Crystallography of GSK-3 and Axin peptide reveals that hydrophobic helical ridges formed by Axin residues of Phe388, Leu392, Leu396 in GID pack into the helical groove of the 285-299 loop in GSK-3 (14) . This interacting domain is also found in other GSK-3 interacting proteins, such as FRATs, GSK-3 interacting protein (GSKIP), and WWOX (15, 16) . The GID in many proteins provides diverse functions for GSK-3 and its substrate. For example, multi-protein complex of APC and GSK-3 enhances \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation and Axin-GSK3 binding provides nuclear export of GSK-3 stabilizing, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducer Snail in cancer (14, 17) . The typical amino acids in helical GID consist of L/FxxxL/AxxRL (Fig. 1A) . In this study, we found GID located next to the SR-rich domain of N protein in SARS-CoV-2 (hereafter N), critical for N protein phosphorylation, suggesting that interaction between N and GSK-3 plays a critical role in viral replication and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Compared to N protein in other nonpathogenic coronaviruses, N protein of SARS-CoV-2 also harbors a CDK1 phosphorylation site and a flexible linker between GID and the SR-rich region, allowing enhanced phosphorylation of N. Further, we found that N mutations in Delta and Omicron variants provide enhanced phosphorylation and increased abundance of N. 6 ",

            "text": "Phosphorylation of many endogenous and viral proteins by GSK-3 is dependent on GSK-3 binding of protein-protein interaction (14, 18) . In turn, GSK-3 interacting domain (GID) embedded in GSK-3 substrate provides efficient self-phosphorylation. Because N of coronavirus is phosphorylated by GSK-3 (6,7), we examined whether GID provides N-GSK-3 interaction and efficient phosphorylation, finding a L/FxxxLxxRL motif in the unstructured disordered region of ancestral Wuhan Hu-1 N protein (Fig.   1A ). The amino acid sequence of GID is highly conserved in many GSK-3 interacting proteins, such as AXINs, GSKIP and WWOX. Because the hydrophobic residues in GID play a critical role in GSK-3 interaction (14, 19, 20) , we generated Lue to Glu substitution mutants (L223/227E) from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 N protein. We next transfected them with HA-tagged GSK-3\u03b2 (hereafter GSK-3) and N expression vectors in 293 cells and performed immunoprecipitation assay to examine interaction between N and GSK-3. Indeed, N protein interacts with GSK-3 and point mutant of hydrophobic residues in N-GID, largely abolishing the interaction with GSK-3, although protein abundance of N and mutants was comparable (Fig. 1B) . To further determine the role of N-GSK-3 interaction, we next examined the phosphorylation status of N and mutants by means of mobility shift on a Phos-tag gel. Interestingly, mutation of hydrophobic residue(s) largely decreased phosphorylation of N (i.e., increased mobility shifts in phos-tag gel) without affecting its stability (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, GID mutation in Axin2 scaffolding protein largely abolished Axin2 phosphorylation along 7 with protein abundance (Fig. S1A) (21) . To further determine the phosphorylation status of N and its mutants, we treated it with lambda protein phosphatase (\u03bb PPase) and subjected it to phos-tag gel. The \u03bb PPase treatment increased mobility shift of N and point mutant of L223 or L227, while the L223/227 mutation was unaffected (Fig.   1D ). Interestingly, mobility shift of N-L223/227E mutant was not affected by \u03bb PPase treatment, suggesting that GID provides the main N phosphorylation. In a repeated experiment, we noted that N was hardly de-phosphorylated by \u03bb PPase, while those mutants were dephosphorylated under the same experimental condition, suggesting N oligomerization by phosphorylation. To simply examine this possibility, we generated an N-EGFP fusion construct and co-transfected it with either Flag-tagged N or L223/227E mutant in 293 cells. Immunoprecipitation assay revealed that Flag-N interacts with N-EGFP, while N and L223/227E mutant interaction decreased (Fig. 1E ).",

Consistently, Y216 and V267/E268 in GSK-3 were critical for Axin2 binding (Fig.   S2B ), and N shared those binding sites in GSK-3 ( Fig. 2A) , indicating that N utilizes a GSK-3 binding mode similar to that of Axin. Previously, we reported that antihelminthic niclosamide interacts with GSK-3 and inhibits Axin-GSK3 binding, resulting in attenuation of Wnt signaling and EMT in APC-mutated colorectal cancer (19) . 8 Niclosamide also inhibits viral replication of SARS-CoV-1 (23) although the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of niclosamide on SARS-CoV is unclear. Given the similar binding modes of N and Axin to GSK-3, we next performed immunoprecipitation assay with increasing doses of niclosamide. Indeed, niclosamide inhibited Axin2 or N binding to GSK-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) . While N-GSK-3 interaction was maintained at 2 \u03bcM concentration of niclosamide, Axin2 binding to GSK-3 was largely abolished at the same concentration. These results suggest that N harbors stronger binding affinity to GSK-3 than does Axin2, and explain the modest therapeutic potential of niclosamide in SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (24) . In turn, these results suggest the possibility that N and Axin2 compete in GSK-3 binding. To test this, we next utilized split GFP systems (25) . For the split GFP assay, superfolder GFP1-10 (amino acids 1-214) and GFP11 (amino acid 214-230) fragments were fused to GSK-3 and N, respectively. Co-transfection of GSK3-GFP1-10 and N-GFP11 gave rise to green fluorescence via direct interaction between GSK-3 and N, and fluorescence was largely decreased by the overexpression of Axin2, indicating that N and Axin compete in similar binding regions of GSK-3 (Fig. 2C ).",

To understand the role of GID in the evolution of coronavirus, we next analyzed GID and SR-rich phosphorylation motif among various coronaviruses (Fig. 4A ). Intriguingly, we found several differences in N-GID of sarbecovirus lineage SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other coronaviruses (27) . First, sarbecovirus lineage N harbors a typical GID, similar to endogenous GSK-3 binding proteins, as mentioned earlier. Second, N of sarbecovirus contained a CDK1 phosphorylation site (S206) with a conserved pSPxK/R motif that may serve to primed phosphorylation of GSK-3 (28) . Third, N of sarbecovirus has a Gly-rich flexible linker between GID and SR-rich phosphorylation domain. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that CDK1 serves to primed phosphorylation of GSK-3 and that Gly-rich linker facilitates phosphorylation of N. To test this hypothesis, we generated N expression vectors with substitution either of CDK1 phosphorylation site (S206A) or 10 GNGG linker to DEIA (N-DEIA), corresponding to sequences in HKU1 coronavirus.",

To further determine the role of GSK-3 and GID, we next generated N-229E expression vectors having a CDK1primed phosphorylation site, Gly-rich linker, and GID corresponding to those of sequences in N of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing N of 229E to those mutants, we found that introduction of primed phosphorylation and Gly-rich linker significantly increased phosphorylation as well protein abundance (about 2-fold) of N-229E (Fig. 5B) .

            "text": "GSK-3 is highly expressed endogenously in mammals and is an exceptional kinase inactivated by exogenous signaling, such as by insulin and Wnt (11, 12) . Priming phosphorylation by other many kinases allows strong (500-to 1,000 fold) preference of GSK-3 substrates which have multiple and serial phosphorylation sites by GSK-3, including EMT-inducer Snail and \u03b2-catenin (30, 31) . The importance of GSK-3 has been extensively confirmed in human diseases, including Alzheimer's, metabolic diseases, and cancer (11, 12) . Notably, many viruses or bacterial genes directly interact with and utilize endogenous GSK-3 for entry, replication and latency (32) . observations that GSK-3 phosphorylates N and its phosphorylation is critically important for viral RNA binding (6, 34, 35) , we wondered about the role of GSK-3mediated phosphorylation of N during SARS-CoV-2 evolution because the GSK-3 comprises a key kinase involving many endogenous biological events (11, 12) . We found the GID amino acid sequence in N of Sarbecovirus lineage consists of L/FxxxL/AxxRL. Axin binds to GSK-3 via GID, the binding being critically important for phosphorylation and protein abundance of Axin (21) . However, mutation of hydrophobic residues in N-GID, which plays critical role in GSK-3 binding, largely abolished the interaction with GSK-3 without affecting N protein abundance. Our observations suggest that N, unlike GSK-3 scaffolding proteins, is highly phosphorylated by GSK-3 followed by rapid dissociation. Since the phosphorylation of N is critically important for self-oligomerization, multivalent RNA-protein complex formation, and subsequent liquid-liquid separation with RNA condensates formation (35, 36) , our observations suggest that GSK-3 is mainly involved in viral RNA processing within the replication transcription complex (RTC). The phosphorylation status of N protein in SARS-CoV-2 virion and existence of endogenous protein phosphatase are interesting issues raised by this study.",

Given our observations, we further examined the N mutation in those variants focusing on the region between SR-rich motif and GID (https://cov-lineages.org/constellations). Interestingly, we found many mutations in the variants of SARS-CoV-2, in the proximal N-terminus of the CDK1 phosphorylation site (Fig. 5C). Notably, there was no mutation among the SARS-CoV-2 variants in GID, suggesting the evolutionary fitness of GSK-3 binding in the sarbecovirus lineage. To validate the role of these mutations in the variants, we chose several mutations of N including Variants of Concern (VOC, Delta and Omicron) and generated N expression vectors having those mutations. We then overexpressed those vectors in 293 cells and examined the protein abundance and phosphorylation status of N. Interestingly, protein abundance of N in those variants was increased by the substitution of single or double amino acid(s), especially in Delta and Omicron (Fig. 5D), suggesting that N of SARS-CoV-2 is evolving to increase phosphorylation and protein abundance. The N-S202R mutant found in Lota (Variant Being Monitored, VOM) and R203K/G204R found in Omicron showed even more phosphorylation compared to ancestral N, while N found in Delta revealed a similar mobility shift, indicating that the mutational evolution provides more efficient and increased phosphorylation along with abundant N protein. Taken together, we observed that the 12 nucleocapsid N of SARS-CoV-2 harbors hyper-phosphorylation machinery including GID, priming phosphorylation, and Gly-rich flexible linker. The evolutionary role and biological impact of N in the COVID-19 pandemic needs further elucidation, especially in BSL-3 equipped facilities.",

            "text": "For example, latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) interacts with GSK-3 via GID embedded in LANA. As with Axin, the LANA-GSK-3 interaction is essential to phosphorylation of LANA and inactivation of GSK-3 (18). Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) oncoprotein in Helicobacter pylori directly binds to GSK-3 and depletes its endogenous kinase activity, resulting in potentiation of the Snail-mediated EMT program in gastric cancer (33). Unlike LANA and CagA, N of SARS-CoV-2 does not affect endogenous GSK-3 activity and the Wnt/EMT pathway, tightly binding to GSK-3 via GID. SARS-CoV-2 is classified as beta-coronaviruses genus and Sarbecovirus lineage (lineage B). The multifunctional nucleocapsid protein of the coronavirus family not only constitutes a key structural protein of virion but also plays a critical role in RNA binding, packaging, and other replication process (3). Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, the N protein as well as antibodies against N appear earlier than antibodies to Spike (1,4), 14 suggesting that N protein abundance and subsequent post-translation modification play an important role in early stage of human infection.
