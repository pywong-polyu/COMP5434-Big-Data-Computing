            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed the life and security of most of the world countries, and especially of the Western countries, without similar experiences in the recent past. In a first phase, the response of health systems and governments was disorganized, but then incisive, also driven by the fear of a new and dramatic phenomenon. In the second phase, several governments, including Italy, accepted the doctrine of \"coexistence with the virus\" by putting into practice a series of containment measures aimed at limiting the dramatic sanitary consequences while not jeopardizing the economic and social stability of the country. Here, we present a new mathematical approach to modeling the COVID-19 dynamics that accounts for typical evolution parameters (i.e., virus variants, vaccinations, containment measurements). Reproducing the COVID-19 epidemic spread is an extremely challenging task due to the low reliability of the available data, the lack of recurrent patterns, and the considerable amount and variability of the involved parameters. However, the adoption of fairly uniform criteria among the Italian regions enabled to test and optimize the model in various conditions leading to robust and interesting results. Although the regional variability is quite large and difficult to predict, we have retrospectively obtained reliable indications on which measures were the most appropriate to limit the transmissibility coefficients within detectable ranges for all the regions. To complicate matters further, the rapid spread of the English variant has upset contexts where the propagation of contagion was close to equilibrium conditions, decreeing success or failure of a certain measure. Finally, we assessed the effectiveness of the zone assignment criteria, highlighting how the reactivity of the measures plays a fundamental role in limiting the spread of the infection and thus the total number of deaths, the most important factor in assessing the success of epidemic management.",

A crucial point for tracing and forecasting COVID-19 pandemic is related to the available epidemiological data [6, 7] . In particular, we can summarize the problems related to COVID-19 data analysis into three main categories: (i) inaccuracy of epidemic data measurements (e.g., the number of infections or of healed individuals), mostly linked to the presence of asymptomatic infections [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ; (ii) lack of reproducible data extracted under similar conditions [6] ; (iii) a poor understanding of parameters' effects. Some parameters are intrinsically hard to quantify as inputs (e.g., confinement measures or variants diffusion), but at least there are clear indications they have a significant effect in the epidemic dynamics; whereas the effect of other parameters is uncertain (e.g., the seasonal effect or the effect of the interruption of specific activities), or more elusive even to be defined (e.g., social habits) [13] .",

            "text": "In this context, developing models capable of replicating past epidemiological trendsor even more ambitiously able to predict future trendsis extremely challenging. Among simpler models for studying the dynamics of an infective epidemic, the Kermack-McKendirck one [14] provided the basis for a variety of widespread deterministic compartmental models, known as SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) models, consisting of a set of ordinary differential equations where control parameters are time-independent. Several models for tracing and forecasting COVID-19 epidemic are based on SIR-type models [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] or to their extension at different level of complexity in the number of considered variables [6, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . In our previous work [6] , we applied an extension of the SIR compartmental model that explicitly considers asymptomatic infectives, while disregarding the effect of containment measures. Wang et al. [25] extended the standard SIR model by incorporating time-varying isolation measures (e.g., government-level macro isolation and community-level micro inspection measures), while it does not consider the existence of asymptomatic subjects and of a period of incubation of the virus. Giordano et al. [26] proposed another extension of SIR-type model that discriminates between diagnosed (asymptomatic detected) and non-diagnosed (asymptomatic undetected) individual and on the severity of their symptoms (SOI), but disregards for a possible latency between exposure to the virus and onset of infectiousness. Other authors (Hao et al., 2020 [28] and Bhaduri et al. [27] ) proposed a Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed (SEIR) compartments model that can be more suitable to include the presence of a long incubation period [29] and to explicitly consider also the exposed compartment. However, the deterministic nature of SIR-type model leads to a series of limits, including an intrinsic rigidity of the simulated time dynamics, which become of great importance when we want to include the effects of variability over time of the conditions in which the epidemic occurs, such as the effect of any containment measures adopted by the governments during the pandemic. In this context, Flaxman et al., 2020 [30] implemented a Bayesian semi-mechanistic models that links the infection cycle to the observed deaths, aiming to evaluate the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on different European countries. A further attempt to explicitly correlate confinement measures with contagion outcomes was attempted in Santamaria et al. [31] and applied in European and Italian contexts. Notwithstanding the success of these approaches [30, 31] , they fail in not considering other important factors such as the effect of vaccination or the effect of the virus variant, affecting the resulting estimated data especially for longer-term modelling.",

The latter was modeled through a parameter that we assumed to be chosen among 7 different values representing the macro-category of imposed confinement level, temporally set according to the ordinances of the Italian Ministry of Health [32] . In the adopted model and under appropriate assumptions, these values can be interpreted as estimates of the ideal basic reproduction number associated with each level of confinement. Thus, the purpose of this work is to understand the effect of the different confinement measures implemented in various Italian regions since the beginning of the pandemic, by extracting indicative values of this parameter, in order to have quantitative estimates of the effects of the adopted measures and to assess which strategies were more effective for the management of the epidemic trend. For evaluating our model, the Italian situation during the so called second wave is a significant test case since a strategic plan with scenarios differentiated on a regional basis was put in place, with confinement levels and attribution criteria quite uniform across the Italian regions.",

The algorithm also manages to correctly ignore a small group of outlier's data around day 150, probably related to compensation of past inaccurate data. The corresponding table shows the F C values relating to the various containment situations. We have seen how these values can be interpreted as R 0 if variant diffusion and decreasing of susceptible individuals is ignored. In the third column, we report 1.4\u22c5F C to consider the greater transmissibility of the English variant. In the first wave and in the first part of the second wave, it is more significant to consider R 0 = F C , while in the last few weeks the other column that is more significant, i.e., R 0 = 1.4\u22c5F C , as the upper bound to be reduced considering the number of reduced susceptible individuals. The obtained results show values around 2 for the free situation, which fall well below the unit for the lockdown (considering in particular the absence of the English variant). The summer part is also characterized by a descending trend of the epidemic, which instead restarts with dramatic intensity, even if lower than the initial one, from the beginning of September (corresponding to the phase we marked as light). The yellow area proved to be unable to limit the epidemic even excluding the spread of the English variant, while the success of the orange level depends on the spread of the variant and on the ratio of susceptible population. The red zone, on the other hand, is always effective, and for this region it appears even more effective than the lockdown of the first wave.",

The zones' temporal sequence imposed by the \"region coloring\" mechanisms adopted in Italy were guided by the need to maintain the basic reproduction around unity and to avoid the saturation of hospital availability. This strategy strongly operates only when the spread of the virus is already high and is not able to significantly decrease the prevalence of the virus but only to contain it. At the beginning of the second wave, the number of new Italian daily infections largely exceeded 30,000 cases, with a probable underestimation due to the presence of asymptomatic individuals. Even considering the delay time between a containment action and its effect, it is clear that this is the result of a containment action implemented with considerable delay. Using our model, we tried to simulate, for the Lazio region example, the epidemic evolution starting from the second wave, assuming an initial anticipated containment action corresponding to the addition of two weeks of red zone, instead of light zone (Fig. 6) . By comparing the effectiveness of the alternative and real closure calendar, we found that a timelier containment action, although limited to only two weeks, strongly affects the epidemic evolution trend. In terms of infectionsintegral of the curvewe obtained: 35,000 instead of 56,000 infections for the second wave of Lazio (Fig. 6) . Thus, a more reactive containment strategy has a much higher cost-benefit return than a delayed strategy.",

            "text": "In this study, we proposed an integro-differential model able to reproduce the wave-like dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy since the beginning (February 24, 2021) up to April 16, 2021. Vaccination, virus variants, different confined strategies were included therein and the optimal model parameters were computed for each Italian region separately. Despite the regional variability, the poor accuracy of the starting data, the lack of repeating patterns, our model accurately reproduced the actual trend of the epidemic evolution (Figs. 2-3) as well as the different effectiveness of the containment measures adopted on a regional scale (Figs. 4-5) . Moreover, we found that the ideal reproduction number R 0 , strictly related to F C , estimated by our model increases when relaxing the containment measures . In particular, we observed how the free and light phases significantly differ from each other, demonstrating that even not too aggressive measures in the light zone have an important improvement effect (Fig. 4A) . However, even the light zone showed a clear expansive effect and is therefore not suitable for the containment of the epidemic, regardless of the presence of the English variant (Fig. 4) . Similarly, the lockdown phase presented a clear trend of epidemic contraction, even assuming the greater transmissibility of the English variant, however, not present in the actual lockdown period (Fig. 4B) . The summer period showed values mostly lower than 1 considering the absence of the English variant, as actually happened (Fig. 4A) . Although the results relative to summer are quite clear, we are not able from our analysis to give a causal correlation of the results in this phase which has several inextricably linked features (high temperatures, more effective sun exposure, change of social habits with more outdoor life, etc.) as well as a particular uniqueness given by coming after the long period of lockdown that has profoundly marked common social attitudes. As for the colored areas of the second phase, yellow is characterized by F C around 1 in the absence of a variant (Fig. 4A) , while it quite clearly exceeds the unity value considering the variant (Fig. 4B ). In fact, as can be seen from Figs. 4-5, the ability of the yellow zone to contain the epidemic depends on the region in question, so it represents a rather risky mode of containment, although socially more manageable in the medium to long term. The effect of orange was significantly better and values around 1 were achieved only with the spread of the English variant (Fig. 4B) . However, the only area capable of stopping the growth of the epidemic is the red area, even if the beneficial effects are lower than those of the March lockdown (Fig. 4) . Even in full diffusion of the English variant, the red zone guarantees in most cases coefficients below unity (Fig. 5) . Thus, the English variant plays a fundamental role in determining the effectiveness of the zones, and the consequent need to adopt more stringent zones. At the same time, the reduction on the number of susceptible individuals is also crucial, thus making even the first stage of vaccinations essential to cooperate with the confinement measure for obtaining a stable evolution. In fact, from equation (11), we can notice that the increase in the number of recovered cases and the vaccinated individuals leads to a reduction in the number of the susceptible individuals and, as a consequence from equation (9), a reduction in the reproduction number R(t). For instance, starting with F S = 1 and considering a yellow zone (F C = 0.93 in Lazio) in the presence of the English variant (F V = 1.4), we obtain R = 1.3. Then, considering a 25% reduction of the susceptible individuals (F S = 0.75) due to the vaccinated and recovered individuals, R becomes again less than one (R = 0.98). It means that a limited number of vaccinated people (less than 25%, since we are considering that 25% is the total of vaccinated and recovered individuals) is potentially capable of inverting the effectiveness of a confinement level. Instead, if we consider less severe conditions, e.g., a light zone (F C = 1.41 in Lazio) always in the presence of the English variant (F V = 1.4), the F S value required to stop the epidemy must be halved (F S = 0.496 to obtain the same R = 0.98), meaning doubling the number of vaccinated or healed people. Conversely, if we consider the free condition zone (F C = 2.37 in Lazio and F V = 1.4), the F S value required to stop the epidemy must be very low (F S = 0.29 to obtain the same R = 0.98), meaning about 70% of vaccinated and recovered. In fact, with a value of F S = 0.75, considering a light or free zone, we would have obtained R = 1.4 or R = 2.5. It means that, although vaccinations are expected to lead to a successfully handling of the epidemic, relaxing the confinements before reaching herd immunity must be considered with care and timely interventions, in order to ensure that the balance of the discussed factors teams up to produce Comparison between the starting data and the simulated data of the temporal trends of the daily infections (normalized) for Emilia-Romagna.

[6] proposed an extension of the SIR model that explicitly considers asymptomatic infectives, and optimized the model parameters through a best-fitting approach that locally minimizes the sum of square error between the observed and estimated infectives. However, the lack of containment measures does not allow to adequately follow the realistic behaviours of data. Wang et al. [25] extended the standard SIR model by incorporating time-varying isolation measures (e.g., government-level macro isolation and community-level micro inspection measures). This model is valuable for its attempt to put together different ingredients of the epidemic evolution, but is applied only to the period of the so-called first wave of the virus and has some weaknesses: it does not consider the existence of asymptomatic subjects and of a period of incubation of the virus; it includes the transmission rate modifier due to the different confinement measures as externally imposed data and is therefore difficult to use in more complex contexts with unpredictable confinement effects (e.g., the period of the second pandemic wave). The results for R(t) of the first Italian wave are however compatible with those found in our analysis. Giordano et al. [26] proposed a SIR-type model that has been applied to the first Italian wave and the authors outlined possible scenarios of countermeasure implementation, predicting that restrictive social-distancing measures were needed to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to stop the epidemic. However, the interpretation of reduced transmission rates due to confinement measurements is not straightforward to extract, especially considering a second wave complex scenario. In addition, the model does not account for a possible latency between exposure to the virus and onset of infectiousness. Hao et al., 2020 [28] proposed a Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed (SEIR) model which, besides the incubation period, accounts for the infectiousness of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals in the population, and explicitly models population movement and time varying ascertainment rates. The model is only applied to the Wuhan (first) wave where the confinement measures can be easily identified. Bhaduri et al. [27] proposed another extension of standard SEIR model accounting for asymptomatic infectives, containment measures but also for the possible effect of misclassifications due to imperfect testing (false negative rate -infected people who are tested but reported as negative). The model has been applied to the Indian epidemic behaviour up to the 2020 summer. For both the above-mentioned SEIR-type models [27, 28] , the estimation of model parameters is based on Markov chain-Monte Carlo methods. For these models, due to the different context of application, a direct comparison with our results is not possible.",

[30] proposed a Bayesian semi-mechanistic model that relies on observed deaths data and calculates backwards to infer the true number of infections, as well as the time-varying reproduction number R(t). The primary objective of the model is to assess the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on different European countries. The results refer to 11 European countries and show a transmission reduction capacity achieved by lockdown around 80%. This value is very similar to the mean reduction factor across the Italian regions as obtained in the study presented here (F C is reduced from about 3 considering free condition to about 0.6 in lockdown). In this work, the authors showed that evaluating the effectiveness of the containment measurements is more challenging when considering specific interventions (e.g., public events' limitations or school closure) than when considering global intervention (e.g., lockdown). This confirms the reasonableness of our approach, which considers the confinements measures grouped in the colored zones. A real quantitative comparison of the results of this model with those of our model is not possible for confinements different from the lockdown. However, we observed that the colored zones implemented in Italy led to a significant reduction in transmissibility, with the red zone effectiveness similar to the lockdown one. This is consistent with what we found in Ref. [30] where the authors showed that the single intervention has a very modest reductive capacity on transmission (e.g., 20% for school lockdown). Santamaria et al. [31] proposed a model based on a mobility indicator obtained from anonymized travel data, with the aim of correlating different containment measuresextracted from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker OxCGRT (Hale et al. [54] ) -with mobility data. However, it has been shown that the effects of containment on mobility cannot be directly translated into effects on the transmissibility factor, as they ignore the effect of distancing rules (making movements less dangerous).",

In particular, in the European context, the strategy of \"coexistence with the virus\" has led to the implementation of confinement measures with the declared aim of achieving the best compromise between the restriction of personal freedoms and economic and health consequences. Yet, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the different measures is difficult due to the large number of involved parameters, the limited reliability of the measured data, and the scarce amount of data repeated under similar conditions.
