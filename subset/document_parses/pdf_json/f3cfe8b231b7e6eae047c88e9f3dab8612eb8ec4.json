The test positivity rate is defined as the proportion positive cases per 100 persons tested. Test per confirmed case is defined as the number of tests performed per positive case. Tests per million population are also calculated. Further, recovery rate, case fatality rate, active rate and percent distribution of active cases of Covid-19 in different phases are also computed. The hotspot zones of confirmed positive cases in the districts are identified using the GIS software.

The total number of active cases as on 17 th May was reported as 55868. Tamil Nadu followed by Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest number of individuals tested for COVID-19 with Maharashtra having the highest number of positive cases followed by Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. It is clear that, in India, about 1824 individuals were tested per million populations varying from 377 individuals in Bihar to 6725 in Delhi.
