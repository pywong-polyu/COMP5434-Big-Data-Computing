            "text": "Purpose Depression is a common mental illness worldwide and has become an important public health problem. The current clinical diagnosis of depression mainly relies on the doctor's experience and subjective diagnosis, which results in the low diagnostic efficiency and insufficient objectivity of diagnostic results. Therefore, establishing a physiological and psychological model for computer-aided diagnosis is an urgent task. In order to solve the above problems, this article uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify depression based on electrocardiogram (ECG). Methods Our method uses the raw ECG signal as the input of one-dimensional CNN, and uses the automatic feature processing layer of CNN to learn and distinguish signal features without additional feature extraction and feature selection steps. In order to obtain the optimal model, ECG segments of different durations (3 s, 4 s, 5 s and 6 s) and CNNs with different layers were used for comparison. In order to obtain modeling data, the resting ECG of 37 depression patients and 37 healthy controls were collected. In the proposed network, larger convolution kernels are used to better focus on overall changes. In addition, this article focuses on the inter-patient data classification standard, where the training and test sets come from different patient data. Results Through comprehensive comparison, the 5 s ECG segment and 5-layer CNN are recommended in related applications. The proposed approach achieves high classification performance with accuracy of 93.96%, sensitivity of 89.43%, specificity of 98.49%, positive productivity of 98.34%. Conclusion The experimental results indicate that the end-to-end deep learning approach can identify depression from ECG signals, and possess high diagnostic performance. It also shows that ECG is a potential biomarker in the diagnosis of depression.",

            "text": "With the development of society and the rapid economic growth, people's various pressures are gradually increasing. Mental disorders occur frequently and people are gradually eroded by psychological sub-health. As a typical mental illness, depression has become an important public health problem. According to the report from the World Health Organization in 2021, about 280 million people worldwide are suffering depression, and depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide [1] . However, its complex pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The diagnosis of depression mainly relies on the comprehensive evaluation of psychiatrists and lacks specific physiological indicators. In addition, there is a serious shortage of psychiatrists. On average, there is less than one mental health worker for every 100,000 people in the world, and the ratio is far below 1 per 100,000 people in low-and middle-income countries [2] . The outbreak of the COVID-19 has further aggravated the psychological pressure of the public. One-third of the participants exhibited anxiety, and nearly one-fifth of the participants had depression symptoms and sleep problems [3] . The current clinical diagnosis efficiency and medical resource problems of depression have become increasingly prominent, which makes many depression patients miss the opportunity for timely treatment. It not only increases the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment, but also causes serious impact on patients' physical and mental health. Therefore, establishing a physiological and psychological model for computer-aided diagnosis is an urgent and meaningful work, which will help to explore the physiological and pathological variations of patients with depression, and can also provide objective data support for depression screening.",

            "text": "However, most previous studies [10] [11] [12] [13] have used conventional machine learning methods combined with HRV to identify depression. Although these methods achieve favourable classification performance, they have many drawbacks. For example, the HRV sequence is usually represented by the variation in RR intervals in the ECG signal [14] . However, R points obtained by different QRS wave detection algorithms are also different, which will affect the classification results of subsequent classifiers. Moreover, machine learning relies heavily on feature extraction and feature selection. This process is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but also computationally expensive. Different from conventional machine learning, the method based on deep learning can self-learn features from input signals without manual feature extraction and feature selection. Many papers have shown that the deep learning architecture performs excellently in classifying ECG signals for heart diseases. Hannun et al. [15] developed a deep neural network (DNN) that uses a single-lead ECG to classify 12 rhythm categories with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. Attia et al. [16] found that the application of AI using CNN to the standard 12-lead ECG enabled the detection of left ventricular dysfunction with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93. Moreover, the development of deep learning based solutions has also been increasingly applied to classify physiological signals [17, 18] .",

Firstly, the ECG signals of all subjects are preprocessed and divided into ECG segment with fixedlength (for example, 5 s) to expand the number of samples and real-time detection. Then the ECG segment is input to CNN, and the recognition result is obtained. In the proposed network, larger convolution kernels are used to better focus on overall changes and the max-pooling operation is applied to all the pooling layers. In addition, this article focuses on the inter-patient data classification standard that is more in line with the actual clinical environment, where the training and test sets come from different patient data. In order to compare the recognition effects of ECG segments with different lengths, the ECG segments of 3 s, 4 s, 5 s and 6 s were adopted. Accuracy, positive productivity, sensitivity, and specificity are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The experimental results indicate that the end-to-end deep learning approach can identify depression from ECG signals, and possess high diagnostic performance with an accuracy of 93.96%. If confirmed in the clinical environment, the identification method can be embedded in ECG monitors and smartphones, thereby simplifying and facilitating the early diagnosis of depression. As far as we know, few studies directly use ECG signals to classify patients with depression. This will be a worthwhile and interesting attempt.",

Since the dimensionality of the ECG signal is different from that of the image, this study introduces a one-dimensional CNN. CNN consists of three basic layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers and fully connected layer with active functions. Table 2 shows the architecture of the CNN model in this paper. This network contains 2 convolution layers, 2 maxpooling layers and 1 fully-connected layer. The activation function of the convolutional layer is the rectified linear units (RELU). After each convolution layer, a max-pooling is applied to the obtained feature maps. The Softmax function of the fully-connected layer outputs normal or depression. In the training stage, the cross-entropy function is applied as the loss function, and Adam is used as the optimizer. When training the model, the learning rate was set to 0.01 and 100 epochs were used.",

The candidates in the training and test sets were randomly changed, and 10 independent experiments were performed. Take the average of 10 test results as the evaluation results. In order to achieve the purpose of clinical real-time detection, a duration of less than 10 s is considered. In this research, 3 s, 4 s, 5 s, 6 s ECG segments were used for experiments comparison. Taking the duration of 5 s as an example, 4000 ECG segments in the training set and 1060 ECG segments in the test set were obtained by non-overlapping cutting of ECG signals.

As the length of the ECG segment increases, the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive productivity are gradually improving, while the classification performance corresponding to the 6 s ECG segment decreases slightly.

Under comprehensive consideration, a 5 s ECG segment and a 5-layer CNN were suggested in related applications. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach achieves high classification performance with accuracy of 93.96%, sensitivity of 89.43%, specificity of 98.49%, positive productivity of 98.34%. In short, the method developed in this research can quickly and accurately distinguish patients with depression.
