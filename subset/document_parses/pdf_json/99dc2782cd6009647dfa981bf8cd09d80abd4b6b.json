However, these providers may have lower thresholds for prescribing certain drugs. This is a particular concern for antibiotics, given the increasing burden of antimicrobial resistance. Public preferences for consultations with online providers are unknown, hence the impact of increased availability of online consultations on antibiotic use and population health is unclear. Objective To conduct a discrete choice experiment survey to understand UK public preferences for seeking online consultations, and the factors that influence these preferences, in the context of having symptoms for which antibiotics may be appropriate. Methods In a survey conducted between July and August 2018, general population respondents completed 16 questions in which they chose a primary care consultation via either their local medical centre or an online provider. Consultations were described in terms of five attributes, including cost and similarity to traditional 'face-to-face' appointments. Choices were modelled using regression analysis. Results Respondents (n = 734) placed a high value on having a consultation via their local medical centre rather than an online provider, and a low value on consultations by phone or video. However, respondents characterised as 'busy young professionals' showed a lower strength of preference for traditional consultations, with a higher concern for convenience.",

Typically, patients attend a face-to-face consultation at a local medical centre in which a physician (commonly a General Practitioner-GP) listens to their concerns, reviews their symptoms, assesses any clinical signs and suggests a management strategy. If required, the physician may issue a prescription for medicine that the patient can collect from a pharmacy. In the UK, consultations with a GP in the National Health Service (NHS) are free. Prescriptions in England are usually charged at \u00a39.15/item, although some patient groups (e.g. children, the elderly, those with specific health conditions such as cancer) are exempt from charges, and all prescriptions are free in the rest of the UK (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) [1] .",

Public expectations regarding consultations for prescription medicines have also evolved, prompted in part by these technological advances. Such consultations are now available in a range of formats in a patient's local medical centre. The traditional face-to-face consultation is still widely offered, but consultations are also now possible in some medical centres via video call, voice call, instant messaging service or by submitting an electronic form. To support these developments, NHS England has launched the GP Online Consultation Systems Fund and developed an implementation toolkit for online consultations in primary care [2, 3] . In addition, the NHS long-term plan now includes a commitment that every patient will have the right to be offered digital-first",

We identified 11 potentially relevant attributes (Appendix 1).

At the same time, there has been an increase in the availability of consultations with private providers, including online pharmacies. These providers can dispense medications following a paid-for, virtual consultation with a GP, and may also offer patients more flexible consultation times and a wider selection of GPs. However, these providers operate on a for-profit basis outside the NHS, so there is some concern that they may have lower thresholds for prescribing some drugs, for example, due to less rigorous safety checks or not requiring detailed medical histories [5] [6] [7] .",

Respondents then completed the 16 choice questions and undertook a second ranking exercise to enable us to ascertain whether their rankings changed during survey completion.

In particular, one group who could be characterised as 'busy young professionals' showed a lower strength of preference for traditional consultations and a higher strength of preference for convenience, prioritising a quick consultation outcome. This finding is potentially important. One interpretation is that these individuals may be more willing to accept alternative consultation formats (e.g., video, phone) via their local medical centre. However, for the same reasons, these individuals might also be willing to seek a consultation with an online provider. If such providers adopt a more permissive approach to antimicrobial stewardship than the NHS, as has been suggested [5] [6] [7] , this may lead to increased antimicrobial resistance, negatively impacting on population health. Indeed, evidence is emerging that children with acute respiratory infections are more likely to receive antibiotics via online consultations [38] . The impact of this prescribing behaviour could be exacerbated by the fact that the general public have a relatively poor understanding of the symptoms that indicate a need for antibiotic treatment [39, 40] . The characteristics of survey respondents differed by previous experience of online providers; those with experience were younger and less likely to be of white ethnicity. This could have implications for equity of access. Although the provision of primary care consultations in a wider variety of formats (as per recent commitments by NHS England) [4] could improve access for some patient subgroups, if this leads to a reduction in the availability of face-to-face consultations, this could have negative consequences for other patients [41] . Such variations in access to care can have notable health consequences; a Scottish study found that patients with worse access to care had more long-term illness, more multimorbidity and more chronic health problems [42] .",

            "text": "There has been a vast increase in the use of online services in all aspects of life since the start of the twenty-first century, and primary care is no exception; consultations with physicians are now available in a variety of formats, including video calls. However, there is rising concern that private providers such as online pharmacies-whose existence has been enabled by these technological advances-may have lower thresholds for prescribing certain drugs, which could impact on population health. This is a particular consideration for antibiotic prescriptions. If patients increasingly seek consultations with private providers regarding antibiotic treatment, and these providers adopt a more permissive approach to antimicrobial stewardship than national healthcare systems, this could have a negative impact on antimicrobial resistance. This study suggests that in the pre-coronavirus UK, there was limited appetite amongst the general public to seek antibiotic treatment from such providers, and a strong preference for face-to-face appointments. However, this population-level finding masks considerable preference heterogeneity, and specific population subgroups might be more open to using private online services. There is therefore a non-negligible risk that these services could increase the burden of antimicrobial resistance, impacting on population health. Given this, it will be important to monitor prescriptions from online providers going forward, and any interventions aiming to discourage the public from seeking antibiotic treatment via these providers could be targeted at those who are more inclined to accept these alternative types of consultation.",
