Methods: Cross-sectional online survey of UK palliative care services (April to July 2020) (CovPall). Ethical approval was received from King's College London Research Ethics committee (LRS-19/20-18541). The primary outcome was change in busyness (five-point ordinal scale). Ordinal logistic regression investigated factors associated with the primary outcome. Results: Of 277 responses, 71 (26%) reported being a lot more busy, 62 (22%) slightly more, 53 (19%) about the same, 50 (18%) slightly less, and 28 (10%) much less busy. Increased business was associated with homecare services (odds ratio [OR] 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-3.25), nursing care at home (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.70-6.19), publicly managed services (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.11-4.34), Covid-19 cases (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01), and staff shortages (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.64-4.48). Conclusion: Services providing community care, and publicly managed services, may have been better able to respond to escalating needs during Covid-19. This has potential implications for both service delivery and funding models.",

[1] [2] [3] In parallel, there were changes in patient and family priorities, with people who might otherwise have been admitted to a hospice choosing to be cared for at home due to fear of infection and visiting restrictions. 4, 5 In response, many hospice and palliative care services rapidly innovated, reconfiguring services, increasing community outreach, and adopting new technology for communication with patients, families, and professionals. 6 During the first months of the pandemic, some hospice and palliative care services reported being more busy, while others reported being less busy than before. 7 We know little about which services experienced increased activity levels, and which experienced reduced activity levels. Understanding whether services that reported becoming more (or less) busy share certain characteristics could help identify strategies and/ or structures to maximize the contribution of hospice and palliative care services to the wider health and social care system, particularly during current and future pandemics. The aim was to identify factors associated with palliative care and hospice services being busier during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

This is in keeping with findings from a survey of General Practitioners and District Nurses, which found that primary care teams provided both higher volume and higher complexity of community palliative care during the pandemic. 4 Services that were publicly managed had greater odds of being busier compared to services that were charitably managed. In the United Kingdom, only 30% of hospice funding overall is from public/government sources, with 70% from charitable sources. 9,10 It is not clear why there should be a difference in busyness according to funding type.

We relied on information collected from clinical service leads, which may have introduced bias. Further research should explore the views of other frontline end-of-life care workers.
