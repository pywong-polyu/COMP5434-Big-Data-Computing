Most medical schools have suspended regular classes for students, moving them from classrooms to the internet. Overnight, virtual-learning, video-conferencing, social media contacts, and broadly understood telemedicine have become substitutes for traditional medical education [1] . In fear of spreading the virus, rotations in wards and outpatient clinics were also stopped, limiting the possibility for students and young doctors to gain knowledge and broaden competencies through direct contact with real patients. Such decisions are primarily dictated by the fear that frequent rotations of students and residents will cause them to become potential infection vectors [2] . In many places, however, both students and residents joined the fight against pandemics, acquiring new competencies that may prove extremely useful in the future.",

The necessity of virtual education poses new challenges not only for students but also and perhaps above all, for teachers [4] . Some of them, especially those belonging to the older generation and teaching clinical competence in the GP practice, have significant difficulties in conducting distance learning. An important challenge is also the need to reconcile the organisation of reliable and credible exams with the need to maintain social distance. The immediate stoppage of traditional medical education in many places was accompanied by the sudden appearance of new solutions in this area. Their nature, scope, and consequences are currently completely unknown and are the subject of ongoing research [5] .",

There have been several steps in the approach used by the guidelines for family medicine: first, a patient examination by family doctors was disapproved. Family doctors used phone interviews to assess their patients and advised them to stay at home [18] . In severe cases, patients were referred to the hospital. Some weeks later, the second step recommended that family doctors examine patients without any testing available. At this stage, family doctors learned about the main features of COVID-19 through direct observation. In the third stage, blood tests and X-rays were used to assess the severity of the patients' conditions to decide better which patients need a referral to the hospital. Most recently, point-of-care testing with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has been used. These rapidly changing tasks assigned to GPs at different stages of the fight against a pandemic challenge the quality of their care.",

The COVID-19 pandemic transformed healthcare systems worldwide, with telemedicine, or virtual healthcare, being one of the key revolutions [19] . Providers with an existing telehealth infrastructure experienced slow implementation of new technologies in the past. During the recent pandemic, rapid adoption of telemedicine by both patients and providers occurred. Obstacles like reimbursement issues, lack of comfort with telemedicine technologies of patients and doctors, and a perceived need for telemedicine limited to remote rural areas have been turned around in the face of the need for social distancing and quarantine as a way to stop the pandemic. Options for telemedicine are diverse and may include written, audio or video communication between the patient and the family physician. Written communication may consist of sharing documents or even photos in a secured transferring system. Traditional telephone consultations were used by family doctors long before the COVID-19 pandemic, but modern 'remote' medicine is conducted through a secure video meeting along with the use of advanced remote technology for physical examination and vital signs monitoring. Digital remote examination tools, such as the digital stethoscope and otoscope, have been incorporated into clinical practice and maybe complementary for video telemedicine solutions [20] .",

Public health and social measures must be tailored to local structures, conditions, and epidemiology. Another potential threat is the underserviced patients with problems not related to COVID-19. While most attention was given to potential COVID-19 patients, other patients requiring care were at risk of being left behind, seriously questioning the equity and safety of care.
