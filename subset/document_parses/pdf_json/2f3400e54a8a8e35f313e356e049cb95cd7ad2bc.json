It may initiate the evolutionary episode of the financial research, where volatility forecasting is a crucial topic in finance. For forecasting volatility, GARCH model is a prevailing model, however, further improvement of the GARCH model is still challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate how Fintech can play a part in volatility forecasting by employing a metaheuristic procedure called Genetic Programming. On the basis, we are able to develop a new volatility forecasting model, which can beat GARCH family models (including GARCH, IGARCH and TGARCH models) in a significant way. Since genetic programming is an evolutionary algorithm based on the principles of natural selection, this innovative work will be a breakthrough point in the financial area. The innovation of this paper demonstrates how GP technology can be applied in the financial field, attempting to explore the volatility forecasting area from the combination of new technology and finance, known as fintech. More importantly, when the formula of volatility forecasting is unknown as we introduce a new factor, namely, the liquidity factor, we unveil that how GP method can be helpful in determining the specific volatility forecasting model format. We thereby exhibit the liquidity effects on volatility forecasting filed from the fintech perspective.",

It integrates advanced technology into financial area, provoking the evolutionary episode of the financial industry and research (Buchak et al. 2018 [1] ; Chen et al. 2019 [2] ). Fintech has been playing particularly important roles in two areas of financial innovations: derivative trading and high frequency trading, which demand sophistical mathematical models, computing-intensive algorithms and big data handling techniques in order to capture trading signal in microseconds. In the option markets, volatility is the dominant driving factor for option price moves. In high frequency trading, volatility forecasting is essential to manage portfolio risk. Therefore, volatility forecasting would be a key issue in the financial field and [3] ). GARCH models are prevalent in forecasting volatilities of financial markets (see Andersen et al. 2005 [4] ; Tian and Hamori [5] ) and oil market volatility has been intensively examined and forecasted by adopting GARCH models (see Wei et al. 2010 [6] ; Efimova and Serletis 2014 [7] ; Wang and Liu 2016 [8] ; Xing and Wang 2019 [9] ). However, existing GARCH type models are unable to capture either market micro structures, such as liquidity information or the high frequency trading signals because the volatility estimation precision from GARCH models depends on the accuracy of mean estimation models, which are in low frequency basis. Incorporating liquidity into GARCH models is necessary in order to estimate volatility more accurately, especially from high frequency trading.",

Furthermore, our work is related heavily to existing literature where GP has been adopted in various financial areas. For example, Pimenta et al.

After the model was generated by our algorithm, we compare our model with GARCH models regarding the forecasting ability. The empirical results show that the in-sample performance of our model is more accurate than traditional GARCH models for both full-sample and most subsample predictions. Additionally, our model's out-of-sample volatility prediction is also more precise compared with traditional GARCH models for both full-sample and subsample tests. The accurate volatility prediction of our GARCH can be envisioned as a considerable improvement of the existing GARCH models and our results demonstrate that multivariable GARCH model can still deliver accurate volatility predictions.",

The term \"artificial intelligence\" shall be a pivotal ingredient in the fintech concept, which refers when a machine mimics cognitive functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\" (Russell and Norvig 2009 [24] ). However, the prevailing recognition of fintech focuses on the application of technology into the financial service industry, such as online banking and mobile payment (Mackenzie 2015 [25] ). This paper gives a further annotation, suggesting that fintech also involves how AI, such as genetic programming, can be integrated with financial modelling and this paper itself is a magnificent demonstration of finance with AI, which is a radical innovation in finance. This integration can provide deep insights of financial data analysis since all models are generated and evaluated purely based on financial data. Furthermore, our algorithm is also capable of dealing with big data as well as other forecasting problems, such as return forecasting. Consequently, this paper can serve as an impetus of developing other fintechs in hedge fund management including derivatives trading algorithms and high-frequency trading.",

As a consequence, we also use our model to forecast the oil return volatility compared with the traditional GARCH model and GARCH family models (see Fig 1 for oil daily returns). We will use the univariate GARCH-class models, including GARCH, IGARCH and the GARCH model with asymmetric effects, namely, GJR-GARCH, as benchmark models for oil volatility predictions in our paper. The liquidity effect would be measured by the bid-ask spread (BAS), which has been demonstrated to be positively correlated with price volatility in financial markets (see Bollerslev and Melvin 1994 [30] ; Haugom et al. 2014 [31] ). We have not included the weekend effect in this paper, which is popular in the stock markets. Studies on the weekend and daily effect in oil futures market are scant since it has been documented that the weekend effect may not be obvious in oil futures market (Yu and Shin 2011 [32] ). It might be that oil futures contract has time-to-maturity, which may have a stronger effect than the weekend effect (Geman and Kharoubi, 2008 [33] ).",

GP is an evolutionary computation (EC) technique inspired by biological process Banzhaf et al. 1998 [41] ; Hirsh et al. 2000 [42] ; Poli et al. 2008 [43] ). Since the form of volatility forecasting model with liquidity effects is uncertain, it would be beneficial to adopt GP method. One big advantage of adopting GP is that it can allow one to be agnostic about the general form of the model. In GP, a population of computer programs is evolved based on the principles of natural selection originated from Darwin's theory of evolution. After certain number of generations, GP can transform populations of programs into new and better programs. As stated in Poli et al. (2008) [43] , GP has been very successful at evolving novel and unexpected ways of solving problems.",

The genetic operations include two formats, namely, crossover and mutation. The crossover operation recombines two subitems from picked functions to produce new functions. The mutation operation will modify the subitems from picked functions before recombine them together to produce new functions. Then, based on crossover and mutation operations, the GP system will automatically reevaluate the newly-generated functions according to the function fitness. The probability of performing crossover and mutation operations will be pre-determined in the system. This main perquisites are the principles of evolution and the system will be discontinued after some pre-determined conditions are complied such as pre-determined threshold for function fitness.

This paper proposes the improved GARCH model, which integrates the liquidity factor. Our new GARCH model, named LGARCH, takes the bid-ask spread term into the volatility forecasting, shedding insights on the understanding of the GARCH model as well as the impact of liquidity on the volatility forecasting process. Since how to integrate liquidity into the volatility forecasting model is open to discussion, we use GP method to identify the specific model format for the LGARCH model. This result also indicates that the liquidity factor plays a vital role in oil volatility forecasting since it appears in the final model format. In this vein, fintech facilitates our understanding of oil volatility forecasting as a new factor has been introduced.",

Our sample period has 16 years oil daily data, which covered before and after financial crisis periods. Moreover, our paper has two robustness measures for both in-sample and out-of-sample periods, demonstrating the generality and validity of our results. Furthermore, our LGARCH model can also yield a couple of policy implications. Firstly, compared with traditional GARCH models, our oil volatility forecasting model can provide more reliable volatility of crude oil market. The reliable volatility prediction can help oil importing economies to determine countries' oil reserve levels in order to alleviate the negative impact on the economy. More importantly, market volatility might reflect the fragility of financial markets and economy (Celik and Ergin, 2014 [57] ). Therefore, reliable forecasts of oil prices' volatility may play crucial roles for macroeconomic policy makers in setting monetary policies to stabilize the economy. Since our results have shown better volatility prediction of the crude oil market, energy economists, energy policy makers, and financial analysts may include market liquidity effect into the volatility forecasting models and utilize market liquidity as an indicator for future volatility changes.",

The GP system in volatility forecasting can be further applied into other financial markets, such as stock market and foreign exchange market. More importantly, since GP is good at providing novel and unexpected insights, it can also be applied to other financial forecasting problems, such as return forecasting, price forecasting and correlation forecasting.

Moreover, the improvement rate is around 20% on average for the subsample test against the simplified realized variance. However, in the year 2005, the simplified realized variance is quite stationary (seeFig 2), our model thereby may not be able to outperform the TGARCH model since the liquidity effects on volatility might be trivial. In all other cases, our model exhibits the superior characteristics in the in-sample model fitting analysis. Additionally,Table 4presents the in-sample fitting MSE against the realized variance for all four models during the data period 2001-2010. For the autoregressive fitting, the results of our model are dominating since our model overwhelmingly surpasses all other three models with nearly 75% improvement rate for the full sample fitting test against the realized variance. Concerning the average improvement rate of subsample tests, it is around 70% against the realized variance. This result illustrates that liquidity plays a significant role in the autoregressive model fitting for the realized variance.",

On the basis, SVM estimates a linear regression model in the output space, which corresponds to a nonlinear regression in the low-dimensional input space. Theoretically, SVM could approximate any nonlinear mapping relations between input space and output space.Nevertheless, since SVM has different key kernels, for instance, linear kernel, polynomial kernel, and Gaussian kernel, the choice of kernels may become tricky. For example, if the residuals of regression model are Gaussian, the results that SVM delivers may not be solid enough, since this kernel is based on Probability Distribution Function, residuals generated by SVM may not follow Gaussian distribution.
