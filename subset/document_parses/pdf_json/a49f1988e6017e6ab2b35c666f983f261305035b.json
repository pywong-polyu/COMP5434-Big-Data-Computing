HRQOL has not been adequately studied in the growing pediatric and young adult heart failure population. This study described HRQOL in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with heart failure and examined primary disease, sex, race, and other correlates of HRQOL in this sample. Participants in this cross-sectional, single-center study included adolescent and young adults with heart failure and a parent/guardian. Patients and their parent/proxies completed the PedsQL, a well-established measure of HRQOL in pediatric chronic illness populations. HRQOL is impaired in AYAs with heart failure resulting from dilated, hypertrophic, or other cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, or post-transplant with rejection/complications. Patients identifying as white endorsed poorer total HRQOL than non-white patients (p = 0.002). Subscale analysis revealed significant correlations between female sex (p = 0.01) and white race (p = 0.01) with poorer self-reported physical functioning. Family income was unrelated to HRQOL. Functional status was strongly associated with total (p = 0.0003) and physical HRQOL (p < 0.0001). Sociodemographic and disease-specific risk and resilience factors specific to HRQOL in AYAs with heart failure include primary cardiac disease, race, sex, and functional status. Building upon extensive work in adult heart failure, utilization, and study of HRQOL as a clinical and research trial outcome is necessary in pediatric heart failure. Developing targeted interventions for those at greatest risk of impaired HRQOL is an important next step.",

Resulting from various etiologies, such as primary cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease (CHD), and acquired heart disease, it is estimated that approximately 14,000 children are hospitalized with heart failure annually in the USA [3] . Hospital-based mortality for children with heart failure is estimated at 7%, which is more than double the in-hospital mortality of adults with heart failure [4] . Advanced cardiac therapies, including ventricular assist devices (VAD) and heart transplantation, are often used in the treatment of pediatric heart failure with improving outcomes observed in recent years [5, 6] . With all chronic diseases and advanced therapies, attention to patient healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL) is critically important.",

While some have described HRQOL in pediatric heart failure [8, 9] , most pediatric cardiology literature has focused on HRQOL in CHD [10] [11] [12] and heart transplant [13] populations. Given a growing population of pediatric and young adult patients with heart failure [1, 14] , as well as the recognized importance of patient-reported outcomes in pediatric cardiology, this study aimed to describe self-and proxy-reported HRQOL in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with heart failure. Group comparisons based on primary cardiac diagnosis leading to heart failure were conducted, as this has not previously been examined. Patient sociodemographic and disease characteristics, including sex, race, and functional status, were also examined as correlates of HRQOL. Consistent with previous research [8] , it was hypothesized that worse functional status would be associated with poorer HRQOL.",

In AYAs with heart failure resulting from anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, total HRQOL and physical functioning were in the normative range per self-and proxy report, with significantly higher proxy-reported HRQOL observed in this group when compared to all other diagnostic groups. In fact, the anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy group was the only diagnostic group in the current study with normative scores across all self-and proxy-reported scales, including total, physical, and psychosocial HRQOL. While all study patients were recruited from the same multidisciplinary heart failure service, there are a few possible explanations for this group difference. First, the Children's Oncology Group guidelines recommend regular cardiac screening for those with exposure to anthracyclines [20] , which is likely to result in earlier identification and treatment of heart failure symptoms. Thus, this group likely represents patients with less severe heart failure or those with less impact of heart failure on HRQOL due to earlier comprehensive heart failure management. This differs from the CHD population, for example, as many cardiologists have expressed concern that patients with CHD are referred too late for heart failure therapies [2] .",

It is possible that resilience derived from overcoming or surviving the pediatric cancer experience serves as a protective factor in terms of maintaining HRQOL despite future long-term sequalae of cancer treatment, such as heart failure. On the contrary, other cardiomyopathies, CHD, and post-heart transplant status are viewed as chronic, life-long conditions, without periods akin to being in \"remission\" or \"cancer-free.\" Engagement in psychosocial care and supports throughout the cancer journey has also been shown to be associated with greater post-traumatic growth [23] , among other positive outcomes.

Patients identifying as female-reported poorer physical functioning than males. This sex-based risk in HRQOL is consistent with research in adult failure [19] . In adult heart failure clinical trials, women were found to have more symptoms and signs of heart failure, received suboptimal medical treatment and device therapies, and reported worse HRQOL when compared to male counterparts [29] . Our data provide some evidence for the extension of this gender disparity in HRQOL to pediatric heart failure and underscore a critical need for additional study in this area. Among the study sample, patients identifying as non-white (25% of the sample) reported significantly better HRQOL across total, physical, and psychosocial subscales. In a large adult heart failure sample, HRQOL was rated more positively by Hispanic patients than by non-Hispanic white patients [30] . Others have documented ethnic differences in HRQOL in adult heart failure, with HRQOL being lowest in Malay and Chinese patients, moderate in black and Indian patients, and highest in white, Japanese, and Korean patients. Disease self-efficacy was noted to be highest in white and black patients [31] . Current study findings must be replicated before major takeaways can be made, but it is possible that some racial and cultural experiences of underrepresented minority groups, such as \"rising\" above hardships and inequities [32] , extended family and community supports [33] , and greater spirituality [33] provide some buffering against the negative impact of pediatric heart failure on HRQOL.",

Patients with family-reported income in the middle to upper class range ($75,000 or greater) endorsed higher mean psychosocial HRQOL score than those with family income less than $75,000, but this did not reach statistical significance. While it is encouraging that no strong associations were detected between HRQOL and family income in this single-center experience, findings highlight the value of screening for social determinants of health and the significance of integrated support services for patients and families in pediatric heart failure care, including social work, financial/transportation coordinators, and education/school liaisons. Parental educational level was also examined as a potential correlate of HRQOL, but only maternal education was found to be significant. Patientreported psychosocial functioning was lower in those with a mother with a college degree compared to those with a mother without a college degree. It is likely that another covariate not captured by the current study, such as parental anxiety or illness expectations, may better explain this association. Much like our null findings between parental education, total HRQOL, and physical functioning, maternal education was unrelated to HRQOL in the recent Pediatric Heart Network study of young children with single-ventricle CHD [36] .",

            "text": "Findings should be interpreted with consideration of study limitations. First, this was a single-center study with patients recruited from a single heart failure clinic/inpatient service. Thus, it is possible that some eligible patients at the study center were not approached for participation. Despite our single-center sample, recruitment efforts were very successful, surpassing sample size power estimates and capturing a diverse representation of participants. Second, for analyses purposes, race as a correlate was defined as white vs nonwhite. As shown in Table 1 , participants identified across diverse racial groups. The sample size did not allow for further analysis based on race, but we acknowledge the distinct and unique experiences that occur across racial and ethnic groups. Additionally, non-English-speaking participants were not included, further limiting our study of important racial and ethnic factors. The cross-sectional study design also limited detection of causal patterns. Further, although by design the inclusion criteria was broad to capture the heterogeneity of pediatric heart failure, we recognize the differing presentations, disease courses, therapies, and impairments among the study sample. This is a heterogeneous sample representing patients at difference phases in heart failure course. Lastly, although much of the data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, some study data were collected beyond March 2020. It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic, much like other non-health-related stressors that may occur in an AYA's life, impacted HRQOL reporting. For example, among an international sample of young people and caregivers with heart disease, general stress was found to be very high during the initial months of the first wave of the pandemic [37] .",

            "text": "Results of the current study elucidate important future directions for research and practice. First, similar to adult heart failure, HRQOL assessments should become a standard component of pediatric heart failure clinical care and research trial endpoints. ACTION (Advanced Cardiac Therapies Improving Outcomes Network) has demonstrated the feasibility of collecting patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including HRQOL, in pediatric and young adult patients pre-VAD implant and throughout the VAD course. Continued study of the utility of PROs to inform clinical practice and predict outcomes is needed [38, 39] . This can be accomplished through multi-center learning network collaborations and registries, such as those hosted by ACTION and Pedimacs. Further, multi-center studies would allow for larger, racially, and ethnically diverse samples, increasing our understanding of these important factors. As this study demonstrates, discrepancies in patient and proxy/parent report exist, thus, we must continue to engage AYAs themselves in research to better understand their healthcare needs and outcomes [39, 40] . With advanced statistics, such as machine learning, we may be able to better understand risk and resilience factors, including sex and race, smaller samples of pediatric heart failure patients with regards to HRQOL, physical, and psychosocial outcomes. Importantly, results point to the potential benefits of resiliency-focused interventions in pediatric-advanced heart disease. Such interventions have been trialed in other pediatric chronic illness conditions, such as cancer, with demonstrated success. Lastly, another opportunity for bolstering HRQOL includes the enhancement of physical activity in pediatric and young adult patients with heart failure. Associations between physical activity and HRQOL have been shown in Fontan [41] populations. As larger datasets are cumulated to inform science and practice in pediatric and young adult heart failure, efforts to provide targeted interventions to those at greatest risk of impaired HRQOL will be necessary.",
