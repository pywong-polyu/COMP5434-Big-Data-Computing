Objective: To determine the impact of mandatory social isolation measures on the subjective well-being of Latin American and Caribbean dentists during the community quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Material and Methods: A Cross-sectional study in a sample of 1195 dentists from 21 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The main outcome was Subjective Well-Being, evaluated through the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). In addition, sociodemographic characteristics, variables related to the community quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic and health variables were considered. A descriptive, bivariate and multivariate (multiple linear regression) analysis was performed to observe the behavior of the variables. Results: A multiple linear regression analysis was performed, where all the variables included within dimensions, were distributed in a single model, observing an R2% of 9.000 (p<0.001), where the R2% change was significant (p<0.001) and a constant of 44.190; likewise, within this model, the variable follow-up of preventive measures against COVID-19 reported an unstandardized regression coefficient (b) of 2. 316 (95%CI:1.133-3.499; p<0.001), the self-perceived level of concern against COVID-19 obtained a (b) of -5.470 (95%CI:-7.509--3.430; p<0.001), the biological sex variable manifested a (b) of -5.417 (95%CI: -1.157-1.910; p<0.001); finally, the level of economic income during compulsory social isolation presented a (b)=5.354 (CI95%:3.461-7.247; p<0.001).",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic imposed challenges for health systems and communities in general, through the drastic and mandatory interruption of the population's traditional lifestyles, a situation that implied restrictions in mobilization, social interaction and economic activities, resulting in a massive quarantine; consequently, these measures had an alarming impact on the mental well-being of individuals due to the psychological and emotional implications linked to social isolation, which triggered the development of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Likewise, it is important to consider the existence of factors that have a favorable impact on people's well-being such as sleep quality, eating behavior and physical activity (6) . However, the establishment of policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 such as social distancing and home confinement are opposed to optimal personal well-being and limit individual rights, which would generate stressors that would contribute to generalized emotional distress, the aggravation of pre-existing diseases and the possible emergence of sleep disorders and/or a decrease in the immune response (7) (8) (9) . In terms of containment strategies to contain the spread of the disease, compulsory social isolation was adopted by most governments, even though many of these countries were characterized by low or medium incomes and lacked adequate access to basic services, which are essential to comply with the restrictive provisions related to quarantine confinement (1) . Likewise, long periods of quarantine, facing economic losses, having a job and the perception of scarce information on the situation from the health authority are closely related to the individual wellbeing perceived in this context (10) . In addition to this, the strengthening of remote work stands out as a factor modifying the habits of students and workers; a situation that influenced the loss of job or academic opportunities, salary reduction and student desertion (11) . Similarly, health personnel have been significantly affected in the full exercise of their professional activities due to COVID-19; in the case of dentists, who are also included in this problem, routine dental procedures have been interrupted, limiting it only to emergency and urgent treatments; a situation that denotes the high vulnerability of this occupational group, both because of the danger of contagion and because of financial instability caused by staff cuts and lower demand for care; in addition to the stressors of quarantine. However, scientific evidence at the Latin American level is scarce to describe this situation, despite being a highly relevant problem for dentists, who, like other health professionals, have been affected throughout this pandemic (12, 13) . In this sense, the objective of this study was to determine the impact of mandatory social isolation measures on the subjective well-being of Latin American and Caribbean dentists during the community quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.",

This instrument comprises five statements: I have felt cheerful and in a good mood, I have felt calm and relaxed, I have felt active and energetic, I have woken up refreshed and rested and, my daily life has been full of things that interest me; rated on a Likert scale from 0 to 5, where 0=never, 1= occasionally, 2= less than half the time, 3= more than half the time, 4= most of the time, 5= all the time. Subsequently, the scores are added to obtain a total value that must be multiplied by 4, obtaining a figure from 0 to 100, where the higher the score, the greater the well-being (15) . Socio-demographic characteristics dimension: These include the variables age, biologic sex, Body Mass Index defined as the weight of the individual in kilograms divided by the measurement in meters squared (kg/m2), according to this information is classified as underweight (BMI \u2264 18.50), normal weight (BMI between 18.50 and 24.99), overweight (BMI between 25.00 and 29.99) and obesity (BMI \u2265 30.00) (16). In addition, specialty for those who undertook postgraduate studies, place of origin and level of economic income during compulsory social isolation. Compliance with mandatory social isolation: This dimension includes variables such as the number of days in mandatory isolation, level of confinement during quarantine and compliance with social distancing. Dimension of responsibilities during mandatory social isolation: Composed of the number of people with whom he/she lived during quarantine, children under responsibility in quarantine and older adults under responsibility during quarantine. Preventive behaviors dimension: Comprised by the variables following recommendations to prevent CO-VID-19 and self-perceived level of concern about CO-VID-19.",

Within this context, people have perceived greater job insecurity in most economic sectors (18) , in addition to a reduction in the perception of health and increased feelings of distress (19) ; which directly affect the individual well-being of the general population, where health personnel are also immersed (1, 12 It is important to point out that according to the findings, this research establishes an explanatory type model, both because of the nature of the study and the model's capacity to understand how the change of an independent variable affects a dependent variable. In this regard, the study found a negative association between the subjective well-being of Latin American dental professionals and their adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures during community quarantine, which would involve high levels of stress and strain on these professionals to limit opportunities for transmission. Coincidentally, Ahmed et al. mention that dentists globally, despite having a high level of knowledge and practices, present a state of anxiety and fear associated with COVID-19 (20) ; likewise, Putrino et al. state that both physicians and dentists are aware of the risk associated with the de-velopment of their work activities, in addition to the responsibility that comes with knowing the characteristics of the virus, through accurate and truthful information; as well as the duty to assume a careful and proactive attitude for the protection of their patients and the entire community (21) . On the other hand, because of the high level of concern perceived by dentists due to the high exposure they face to the disease during the development of their professional work, a negative correlation was determined between subjective well-being and the level of self-perceived concern about COVID-19 during community quarantine, which is related to the research done by Mahdee et al., where there is a high concern among health care workers, especially dentists, regarding the occurrence, transmission and possibility of contracting COVID-19, coupled with a drastic increase in anxiety; despite the generation of a high level of knowledge on how to deal with the disease by these professionals (22) . Likewise, Ahmed et al. state that dentists around the world present a state of anxiety and fear, due to the impact that the CO-VID-19 pandemic has had on humanity (20) ; as well as that defined by Shacham et al. where this disease is associated with high levels of anxiety in dental personnel, due to the fear of contracting it because of having some comorbidity or in those with higher levels of overload (23) .",
