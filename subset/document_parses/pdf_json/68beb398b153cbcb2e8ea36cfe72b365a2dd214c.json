            "text": "Access to information via social media is one of the biggest differentiators of public health crises today. During the early stages of the Covid-19 outbreak in January 2020, we conducted an experiment in Wuhan, China to assess the impact of viral social media content on pro-social and trust behaviours and preferences towards risk taking with known and unknown probabilities. Prior to the experiment, participants viewed one of two videos that had been widely and anonymously shared on Chinese social media: a central government leader visiting a local hospital and supermarket, or health care volunteers transiting to Wuhan. In a control condition, participants watched a Neutral video, unrelated to the crisis. Viewing one of the leadership or volunteer videos leads to higher levels of pro-sociality and lesser willingness to take risks in an ambiguous situation relative to the control condition. The leadership video, however, induces lower levels of trust. We provide evidence from two postexperiment surveys that the video's impact on pro-sociality is modulated by influencing the viewer's affective emotional state.",

            "text": "On January 23, 2020, local authorities in China imposed a full lockdown of Wuhan city in response to the emergence of a novel coronavirus and associated disease, Covid-19. This event was followed shortly after by the lockdown of other cities across Hubei province. With the movements of over 50 million people in the centre of China being closely monitored, this represented one of the largest forced quarantines in human history. 1 The lockdown of Wuhan city was the first, and one of the most stringent, to be implemented globally. During those early days of uncertainty, with scant reporting in official media outlets, social media became a key source of information about the virus for ordinary Chinese citizens. The currency of social media are viral videos and associated messages; during this time, many videos were circulated in private chat groups, showing evocative scenes of containment and relief efforts. 2 Access to information via social media is one of the biggest differentiators of pandemics today from the past (Balinska & Rizzo, 2009) . Social media has become an important medium that individuals turn to for information in public emergencies (Reuter & Kaufhold, 2018) . Since information systems, rather than personal experience, are the most likely source of information during a crisis, social media is an important agent of risk amplification (Kasperson & Kasperson, 1996; Pidgeon et al., 2003) . Recent research recognises the potential of viral social media content to promote collective action in moments of crisis, alongside possible negative effects for trust and risk perception (Alexander, 2014; Haushofer & Metcalf, 2020; Taylor et al., 2012) . During a public health crisis, the coordination of individual efforts towards collective demands underpins the success of mitigating measures (Van Bavel et al., 2020) . Trust and risk attitudes are associated with the adoption of health behaviours and so indirectly for controlling the rate of disease transmission (Chuang et al., 2015) . It is, therefore, important to understand how social media content influences pro-social, trust and risk-related preferences.",

            "text": "This study examines the influences of social media content on such preferences via the modulation of a viewer's affective emotional state. A long literature in psychology emphasises that affective states influence normative judgements and decision-making processes (Forgas, 1995; Loewenstein & Lerner, 2003; Pham, 2007) . 3 Online media content that arouses emotions is more likely to go \"viral\" in the first place (for an example of this in the Chinese social media context, see Fan et al., 2014) . Thus, we conjecture that social media videos of the type used in this study 1 See, for example, https:// apnews. com/ 7f733 6d2ed 09993 6bd59 bf8cb 7f437 56. 2 See, for example, https:// www. nytim es. com/ 2020/ 01/ 24/ world/ asia/ china-social-media-coron avirus. html. 3 Various experimental economics studies also find a correlation between emotions and behaviour (Bolle et al., 2014; Charness & Grosskopf, 2001; Hopfensitz & Reuben, 2009; Joffily et al., 2014; Meshulam et al., 2012; Sanfey et al., 2003; Schniter & Sheremeta 2014; Xiao & Houser, 2005) . may act as an incidental (that is, not normatively relevant for the judgement at hand) influence on individuals' emotions and mood, which in turn affects their decisions. 4 An extensive experimental economics literature explores the ability of induced emotions to affect strategic behaviour and individual preferences. Capra (2004) finds that induced good mood leads to more altruistic giving. Drouvelis and Grosskopf (2016) and Bartke et al. (2019) observe that induced positive (negative) affective states increase (diminish) pro-social behaviour in a public goods game, while findings for cooperation are mixed (Hertel & Fiedler, 1994; Hertel et al., 2000) . Dunn and Schweitzer (2005) suggest that incidental anger reduces trust. In a gift-exchange game, Kirchsteiger et al. (2006) observe that those individuals who watched a funny movie clip are more generous, while those who watched a sad clip are more reciprocal. Kugler et al. (2012) show that induced mood can have a systematic impact on individual risk preferences: in their study, fearful participants make more risk-averse lottery choices than angry participants.",

The experiment was implemented in late January 2020, the time of greatest uncertainty about the coronavirus in China. All experimental tasks are incentive compatible: all choices have monetary rewards proportional to the good outcomes of the tasks. 5 The experiment comprises two treatment conditions and a control condition, using a between-subjects design. In the treatment conditions, participants are primed with one of two videos, each of which shows evocative content related to the Covid-19 crisis. The first of these videos shows a senior central government official's visit to a local hospital and a supermarket (henceforth \"Leadership video\"). The second of these videos shows health care volunteers from other provinces in transit to Wuhan (henceforth \"Volunteer video\"). Both videos were circulating widely and anonymously among chat groups on the Chinese social media application WeChat at the time of the experiment. In the control condition, participants watch a neutral product advertisement video, unrelated to the crisis (henceforth \"Neutral video\").",

Amounts sent by first movers in the TG are lower in the Leadership video treatment than in the Neutral video control, although this difference is only marginally significant (p value = 0.09, n L = 18 and n N = 20). We find no significant negative effect of the Volunteer video on trust (p value = 0.82, n V = 18 and n N = 20) and no significant difference in the raw TG amount sent between the Leadership and Volunteer video (p value = 0.26). Reciprocity, in terms of amounts returned, adjusts proportionally in each experimental condition. 9 Consistent with earlier TG experiments, a trustor's decision to transfer money is on average a breakeven strategy (Berg et al., 1995) . There are no statistically significant pairwise differences in average PD cooperation rates in the respective treatment conditions relative to the control condition (p value = 0.52 and p value = 0.64, respectively, n L = n N = 78 and n V = 76). An ancillary question is how the treatment condition videos influence participants' preferences towards risk taking with known and unknown probabilities. To examine this question, we use the first row in which the certain option was chosen in the risk and ambiguity preference elicitation tasks. For each task, there were nine rows; risk neutrality corresponds to choosing the certain amount for the first time in row five. While neither the Leadership nor Volunteer video significantly influences risk aversion with known probabilities (p value = 0.70 and p value = 0.85, respectively, n L = 77 n V = 75 and n N = 78), both videos reduce participants' willingness to take risks in an ambiguous situation (p value = 0.03 and p value = 0.02, respectively, n L = 74, n V = 75 and n N = 77). We advise against reading into the absolute levels recorded in the ambiguity preference elicitation task, because our implementation did not permit participants to choose the payoff-relevant colour and so this task may also pick up trust in the experimenter. 10 That participants' reactions to the treatment condition videos differ across risk and ambiguity domains is not unusual (see also Cavatorta & Groom, 2020) . Whereas risk involves known probabilities, ambiguity describes situations in which probabilities are vague. If the treatment videos heightened feelings of uncertainty about the situation in Wuhan in those early days of the Covid-19 outbreak, individuals may have been prone to act more cautiously when the likelihoods of outcomes associated with their actions are unknown. It does not necessarily follow that they would also prefer to take fewer risks. The probabilities of bad outcomes in an emerging public health crisis are far from well-defined.",

We include as covariates the aggregate number of diagnosed virus cases at provincial level, participant gender, cell phone operating system and screen size. 10 Since we focus on relative comparisons, this is a relevant confound only if the videos had differential impacts on participants' trust in the experimenter. While we cannot rule this out, we observe a (marginally significant) fall in generalized trust in the Leadership video condition, but not the Volunteer video condition, and so if this were a confound, we might expect to observe a larger negative effect on risk taking under ambiguity in the Leadership video condition.

There is strong statistical evidence that both treatment condition videos cause an increase in pro-sociality relative to the Neutral video. 12 In Table 3 , we further examine the impact of the Volunteer and Leadership video on ambiguity preferences.

The Leadership video has a robust negative effect on trust which is significant at the 5% level. The Volunteer video has no significant effect on trust. We then control for subjects' decisions in the risk and ambiguity tasks, and in the PD game, to isolate the effect of the videos on trust net of pro-sociality, risk and ambiguity aversion. 13 The negative impact of the Leadership video on trust remains significant at the 10% level. Scholars in the experimental economics literature have long debated whether risk preferences are a component of trusting behaviour (e.g. Ben-Ner & Halldorsson, 2010; Eckel & Wilson, 2004) . The decision to take a \"social risk\" on the trustworthiness of a stranger in the one-shot TG might be viewed as conceptually closer to a preference 11 In the Supplementary Material, we also present regression analyses for second-mover behaviour in the TG and UG, respectively (Table S2) . Amounts returned/acceptance rates are significantly increasing in the first-mover amount sent/offered, but there is no differential impact by treatment video. In a further set of regressions, we find no significant impact of the Leadership or Volunteer video on risk preferences and PD cooperation rates (Table S3) , nor on pooled risk and ambiguity decisions in a random effects model (Table S4) . 12 We are grateful to the editors for this suggestion. Random effects are included at the individual-level. Since the regression results reported in column 3 of Table 3 are based only on those subjects who played both the DG and the UG, the change in statistical significance on the Leadership video coefficient may be driven by a change in sample rather than by a treatment effect. To check this possibility, we compare giving in our sample between participants in the morning and afternoon sessions; there is no significant difference in mean DG amount sent between the morning subsample (1.53) and afternoon subsample (1.78) based on a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test (p value = 0.28). 13 In the Supplementary Material, we also present the results from a two-step regression to proxy for aspects of trust not directly captured by the tasks implemented (Table S5 ). The results are qualitatively unchanged. A limitation of the regression approach to decomposing trust is that measurement error may be a non-trivial confound (Gillen et al., 2018) . Further drawbacks are the restrictive assumption of a linear relationship and potential omitted variable bias. An alternative, non-parametric approach is to use exogenous treatment variation (Engelmann et al., 2021) . over ambiguity (Li et al., 2019) . Our results are consistent with the interpretation of the Leadership video-but not the Volunteer video-undermining the component of trust which is unrelated to preferences over risk, ambiguity and pro-sociality. There is, however, no significant difference between the Leadership and Volunteer video coefficient estimates. We will return to discuss these differential effects further in Sect. 5.",

The IRI is often used in the social sciences to measure pro-social behaviours along four dimensions: empathy, perspective taking, personal distress and fantasy (e.g. B\u00fcchner et al., 2007; Carlo et al., 1999) . The SOC provides a generalized measure of competence and contingency along two dimensions: personal mastery and perceived constraints. All responses are measured on Likert scales, with a higher number on the scale indicating greater agreement with the described feeling or emotion at the present moment. The sequence in which the three questionnaires were presented to participants in the experiment was randomized, to control for possible order effects. On completion of the psychological questionnaires, participants were asked to fill in demographic information. 17 They received a show-up fee of 5 RMB, and a payment of 8 RMB for each questionnaire completed.

There is some evidence that participants who watched the Volunteer video also feel more attentive than those who watched the Neutral video (p value = 0.08), and more active, inspired and interested than those who watched the Neutral video (p value < 0.01) or Leadership video (p value = 0.06). 18 By contrast, we find no significant difference in negative affect for either the Leadership video (p value = 0.42) or Volunteer video (p value = 0.35), and little underlying variability in the negative emotions of fear or hostility. An interesting exception is that participants in both the Leadership and Volunteer video conditions describe feeling a greater sense of guilt than their counterparts in the Neutral video condition (respectively, p value = 0.07 and p value = 0.08). We observe no systematic differences in responses to the IRI or SOC questionnaires. 19 16 The complete questionnaires are contained in the Supplementary Material. 17 Demographic characteristics of this follow-up sample are comparable to the main experiment (Tables  S1 and S6) . 18 We observe no other significant difference in emotional response between the Leadership and Volunteer video treatments. 19 Results of the IRI and SOC can be found in the Supplementary Material (Table S7) . The implied positive relationship between positive affect and pro-sociality in the economic experiment is consistent with prior studies (Bartke et al., 2019; Capra, 2004; Drouvelis & Grosskopf, 2016) . The relative effect sizes also support this interpretation. Compared to the Neutral video, the Volunteer video induced a larger emotional response across all four positive emotion sub-scales than the Leadership video (see second panel of Table 4 ), which translated into consistently larger behavioural estimates of the video's impact on pro-sociality (see Table 2 and columns 1-3 of Table 3 ).",

We find that, in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak in China, videos showing either a prominent government leader's visit to Wuhan or the inward transit of health care volunteers induce greater pro-sociality, relative to a neutral video unrelated to the crisis. In the field, this could translate to a rise in donations, assistance and willingness to comply with mandated health behaviours. On the other hand, the Leadership video used in our study had the unintended consequence of decreasing individuals' levels of trust. This may undermine the authorities' effectiveness in crisis response efforts.",

Thus, it is possible that the videos would have induced different emotional responses between the two time periods. In this regard, we take reassurance from the consistency of our psychological response data with the representative follow-up survey conducted in early March 2020, which indicate that the events broadcast in the two social media videos were perceived among ordinary Chinese citizens as positive motivating factors.",

            "text": "Second, we observe few systematic differences in emotional responses between the Leadership and Volunteer videos themselves, and so emotions cannot well explain the differential impact of the Leadership video on trust. An alternative explanation for this finding is that the content of the two videos had differential cognitive (rather than affective) influences. Li et al. (2019) show that participants' inability to discriminate between events with different likelihoods dampens their tendency to act based on beliefs; conditional on equally optimistic beliefs about the other's trustworthiness, the more insensitive individuals are less inclined to trust. If, as implied by our behavioural measurements, the Leadership and Volunteer videos increased participants' pro-sociality, but decreased their willingness to take risks under ambiguity, then the net outcome for trust may be a null effect (as observed in the Volunteer video). If the Leadership video further reduced the ability of participants to discriminate between different likelihood levels, then a negative impact on trust would result in this condition.",

The direction of communication in the Leadership video is from leader to citizen, whereas the direction of communication in the Volunteer video is citizen to citizen. Leadership studies have traditionally suggested a top-down communication style is most effective in establishing trust and conformity (the centralization thesis, e.g. 't Hart et al., 1993; McEntire & Dawson, 2007) . Other literature has challenged the veracity of the centralization thesis in times of crisis, postulating that bottom-up communication styles are more effective (Boin and 't Hart, 2003; Demiroz & Kapucu, 2012) . On this interpretation, our experimental findings on trust would come out in favour of the critics.",
