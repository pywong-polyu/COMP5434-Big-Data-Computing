The diagnosis and management of PID patients were performed by immunologist specialists in this clinic according to the criteria of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID). 9 All patients were followed from March 2020 to May 2021 for any sign of COVID-19, including fever, dry coughs, dyspnea, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The COVID-19 test was performed on patients with the clinical triad of coughs, fever, and dyspnea using a realtime reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swabs. Informed consents were obtained from all the participants. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (IR.SUMS.REC.1399.845). The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA, V. 21.00).",

This study included 36 (40%) female and 54 (60%) male patients. During the follow-up period, fever, dry coughs, dyspnea, and GI symptoms were recorded for 16.6, 8.8, 6.6, and 5.5 percent of the total patients, respectively. A positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was verified in nine PID patients (10%), and all cases had a history of exposure to another COVID-19-infected family member. The demographic parameters and clinical state of these patients prior to COVID-19 infection are summarized in table 1. Six out of nine PID patients (66.6%) with COVID-19 infection fully recovered, while three patients (33.3%) died from the disease. All patients had symptoms of COVID-19 infection, such as fever, coughing, respiratory distress, and dyspnea. In certain cases, GI symptoms, myalgia, and anosmia were observed. One case (P5) experienced allergic symptoms, such as a runny nose and sneezing. Eight patients showed the severe form of the disease and were required to be hospitalized. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and anti-viral therapy were used for all patients during the infection. The clinical data after COVID-19 infection and the outcomes of the treatment strategy of PID patients are presented in table 2.",

All COVID-19 cases belonged to the categories of CID and primary antibody deficiencies (PAD), with a higher fatality rate among patients with CID. Similarly, in a study performed by Delavari and colleagues, CID was the main PID entity among COVID-19-positive cases, followed by humoral immunodeficiencies. 6 In this context, several recent studies have found that lymphopenia with prominent decreased T cell counts (especially CD8 + cells) is associated with the severe course of COVID-19 infection. Guang Chen and colleagues reported decreased CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts, as well as interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) production by CD4 + T cells, in severe cases of COVID-19 infection. 10 Another study performed by Fan Wang and colleagues showed that total lymphocytes, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in COVID-19 patients, and severe cases had lower levels than mild ones. They also indicated a significant association between these cells and inflammatory status in COVID-19, especially for CD8 + T cells and the CD4 + /CD8 + ratio. 11 Reduced T cell counts (CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells) associated with increased serum levels of interleukin IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 concentration, and T cell exhaustion were seen in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 12 On the other hand, a multinational cohort study on 94 PID patients with COVID-19 infection revealed that older patients with CID manifested a milder course of COVID-19 infection than those of our study. 13 Primary antibody deficiencies were identified as another dominant PID category with four COVID-19 cases, all of whom recovered after hospitalization. According to Quinti and colleagues, patients with agammaglobulinemia showed a milder course of the disease than the patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) who were characterized by dysfunctional B cells. 14 As B cells are considered to be one of the main sources of IL-6 production, which enhances the level of inflammatory responses, the lack of B cells in agammaglobulinemia might be considered as an advantage, since they help avoiding the development of inflammatory responses and cytokine storms. 5 However, in our study, the clinical course of the disease resembled that of CVID and agammaglobulinemia In contrast with the results that show the mild form of the disease in children and adolescents to be due to the low expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and functional adaptive immunity, a fraction of them with PID who suffer from other comorbidities, may develop the severe course of the disease requiring hospital admission and even suffer a fatal outcome. In this regard, more caution should be exercised for complicated PID patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this should be taken into account by all physicians.",
