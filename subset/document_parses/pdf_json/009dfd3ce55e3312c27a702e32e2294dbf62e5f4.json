            "text": "The causation of Kawasaki disease has been a medical mystery for over 54 years. However, the causations of Kawasaki disease, its variations, and COVID-19-associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome have been recently explained to involve high replication rate viral infections. In a subset of patients, the extensive antigen-antibody immune complexes that are not quickly cleared by phagocytosis will create a type III hypersensitivity immune reaction. The subsequent release of proteases and other enzymes and the expression or exposure of new immunogenic antigens due to protease attacks on basement membranes of epithelial cells or endothelial cells in blood vessels will induce new autoantibodies and cause Kawasaki disease, its variations, and COVID-19-related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. There is now increasing evidence that a viral infection of a large surface area of tissue, such as the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract or blood vessels, and a resultant type III hypersensitivity immune reaction is the most plausible explanation for the causations of Kawasaki disease, its variations, and COVID-19-related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. Furthermore, an improved understanding of these causations also suggests several potential new treatments which can be more effective.",

            "text": "Infants and children under age 6 are the predominant targets of typical/atypical Kawasaki disease [5, 6] . There are logical fundamental immune response reasons why infants and young children suffer Kawasaki disease and its variations. Steps 2, 3, and 4 listed in Table 1 can explain why infants and young children are targeted, usually only one time. A first-time infection with an extremely virulent pathogen, such as a pulmonary virus like a coronavirus, will only be met with an initially mediocre T cell and B cell responses, but if the first-time infection is survived, this will lead to memory T cell, memory B cell, and long-lived plasma cell population subsets derived after affinity maturation to have a higher antibody affinity for the pathogen's antigens that will protect against a subsequent infection [9, 10] . If an individual experiences re-infection with the same or antigenically similar pathogens, memory T cells, particularly memory CD8 T cells in the case of viral pathogens, and memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells by higher affinity will more quickly target pathogen antigens and significantly reduce pathogen titers in infected lungs and other organs [9, 10] . This increased proficiency in targeting pathogens would either enable memory T cells, particularly memory CD8 T cells in the case of viral pathogens, to possibly handle a pathogen re-infection entirely by themselves without the need for antibodies; or enable memory B cells and long lived plasma cells to produce more effective antibodies to quickly target previously seen antigens of a pathogen re-infection. In either case, this more quickly targeted immune response would reduce pathogen titers and avoid the creation of a massive number of antibodies and a massive number of antigen-antibody immune complexes described in step 4 of Table 1 . This would then pre-emptively avoid the later immune response steps listed in Table 1 that would cause Kawasaki disease or its variations. In summary, the peculiar and mysterious infection characteristics of Kawasaki disease, its variations and MIS can be logically explained by considering the implications of each step listed in Table 1 .",

Host is infected by a very virulent pathogen, e.g., a coronavirus or influenza virus 2. Innate immune system and adaptive immune system T cells cannot stop the infection 3.

Antigen-antibody immune complexes activate receptors of several immune cells which release inflammatory cytokines that increase the permeability of blood vessels -a Type III hypersensitivity immune reaction is now initiated 7. Antigen-antibody immune complexes deposit in capillary tissues and induce microvascular thrombosis and adjacent tissue inflammation 8. Tissue inflammation triggers the complement system, including complement cytokines C3a and C5a releases 9. C3a and C5a attract neutrophils and proinflammatory M1 macrophages that release more proinflammatory cytokines, proteases and other enzymes 10. Proteases destroy basement membrane proteins, such as collagen and elastin, used by lungs and blood vessels in organs, skin and other luminal tissues 11. These proteases or other enzymes by themselves, or by their processing of substrate proteins, express or expose new antigens that induce new autoantibodies that bond with antigens to make new antigen-antibody immune complexes. 12.

The link of the virulent human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 to Kawasaki disease is especially supportive evidence to the premise that high replication rate respiratory viruses that infect a large area of tissue can cause Kawasaki disease, since this virus, like SARS-CoV-2, causes major respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract infections [12, 15] . The breadth of experimental evidence presented in the preceding papers implies that some virulent pathogens are the trigger that initiates Kawasaki disease. The most strongly linked pathogens cause respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, blood vessel infections, or other large surface area infections [12] [13] [14] . These types of infections can create extensive antigen-antibody immune complexes that cannot be quickly eliminated by phagocytosis in individuals having transient or permanent antigen-antibody immune complex clearance problems with their livers, spleens or complement systems.",

These cytokines will attract neutrophils and proinflammatory M1 macrophages that will secrete proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines, prostaglandins, and proteinases and other enzymes [7] . Therefore, quickly deactivating C3a and C5a can reduce the attraction of neutrophils and macrophages that release the proteinases and other enzymes that express or expose autoantigens that induce the autoantibodies. Fortunately, there are several anticancer drugs already available to deactivate C3a and C5a [29, 30] . There is a FDA-approved monoclonal antibody complement inhibitor for C5 called ecoluzimab, and another C5 complement inhibitor called pexelizumab [29] . There are C3 complement inhibitors, including AMY-103, which blocks C3a and C5a, and compstatin [29, 30] . There are also C3a receptor antagonists including SB290157, and C5a receptor antagonists including PMX-53 [29, 31] . C5a inhibitors, including the C5 and leukotriene B4 inhibitor nomacopan, ecolouzimab, and an anti C5a monoclonal antibody inhibitor IFX-1, can also reduce inflammation, coagulation and lymphocyte exhaustion caused by high viral loads, so there are potentially significant benefits from their use for treating Kawasaki disease [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .",

A type III hypersensitivity reaction induces macrophages and neutrophils to release proteinases (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases, cysteine proteinases, and serine proteinases) and other enzymes that will create systemic inflammation and express or expose autoantigens that lead to autoantibodies. However, an improved understanding of Kawasaki disease, its variations, and related diseases including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome also suggests several potential new treatments for these diseases which could be more effective.",
