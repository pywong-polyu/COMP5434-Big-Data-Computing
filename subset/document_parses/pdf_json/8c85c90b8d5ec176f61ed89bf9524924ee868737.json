            "text": "Lung surfactant dysfunction has a critical role in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Yet, efforts to treat ARDS patients with liquid instillations of exogenous surfactant have so far failed. One of the ongoing challenges in surfactant therapy is obtaining a homogeneous distribution of surfactant within the lungs despite an inherent tendency to non-uniform spreading, owing amongst others to the influence of gravity. Here, we show that liquid foam therapy (LiFT), where surfactant is foamed prior to intratracheal administration, may improve notably surfactant distribution while maintaining safety and efficacy. We first show quantitatively that a foamed surrogate surfactant solution distributes more uniformly in ex vivo pig lungs compared to endotracheal instillations of the liquid solution, while maintaining pulmonary airway pressures within a safe range. Next, we demonstrate that a foamed commercial surfactant preparation (Infasurf) is effective in an established in vivo rat lung lavage model of ARDS. Our results suggest that LiFT may be more effective than liquid instillations for treating ARDS and serve as a proof-of-principle towards large animal and clinical trials.",

Among the central factors underlying the pathophysiology of ARDS lies critically the dysfunction of lung surfactant 4, 5 . In turn, the administration of exogenous lung surfactant into the lungs of ARDS patients has been hypothesized as a promising therapeutic strategy with the potential to improve lung mechanics and oxygenation, while concurrently reducing ventilation-induced injury 4, 6 . The use of intratracheal liquid instillations of lung surfactant is known to substantially reduce mortality in premature neonates suffering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and has thus become an established rescue therapy in neonatal populations over the past decades 7, 8 . In parallel, surfactant therapy using liquid instillations has shown promising results in medium-sized clinical trials of pediatric and adult ARDS patients 9, 10 . Yet, larger clinical studies in ARDS patients have consistently failed to show clinical benefits [11] [12] [13] [14] . Several reasons have been hypothesized for the failure of such trials, including multi-organ failure due to the underlying disease 15 , poor performance of current surfactant preparations relative to natural lung surfactant 16, 17 , inactivation of lung surfactant by serum proteins 11, 18 , delayed administration of the surfactant therapy 17 and inadequate delivery to the alveolar regions of the lungs [19] [20] [21] .",

Such outcomes may suggest that instillations of liquid boluses tend to leave some lung regions untreated while dangerously overflooding others. The leading posited reason underlying inhomogeneous distribution in large lungs compared to a relatively uniform distribution in smaller neonatal lungs follows from increased gravitational effects on liquid plug propagation that are proportional to the square of the characteristic length scale 20 (e.g. airway diameter). In parallel to such efforts, alternative surfactant therapy strategies have included aerosol delivery of surfactant that 3 has shown improved distribution compared to liquid instillations 22 . While inhalation therapy is currently pursued as a treatment option for infants with RDS 25, 26 , its applicability for ARDS in adults has been largely hampered by low aerosol delivery efficiencies 6, [27] [28] [29] .",

First, we compared the distribution of a foamed versus liquid surfactant surrogate solution in ex vivo adult pig lungs. We hypothesized that foam would distribute more uniformly within large lungs compared to liquid due to its increased volume and lesser tendency to drain along the direction of gravity; a characteristic that follows from its high effective viscosity coupled with a low density 31 . Next, we tested the safety and efficacy of a foamed lung surfactant preparation in an in vivo rat model of ARDS induced by repeated whole lung lavage 32 . We posited that foamed lung surfactant has similar efficacy as liquid instillations in a well-established small animal ARDS model, where liquid instillations are known to be effective. Our efforts represent a significant first validation step of LiFT towards large animal studies and clinical trials.",

To compare the distribution of foamed and liquid lung surfactant following intratracheal administration into large lungs, we first developed an ex vivo experimental model in ventilated excised pig lungs (see Fig. 1a and Methods). In these experiments, an affordable dyed lung surfactant surrogate (DLSS) solution (normal saline with 14% Tween 80 and 1% green dye) was used as a substitute for costly animal-derived lung surfactants sold commercially (~$100/ml). This solution is easy to visualize and has a kinematic viscosity similar to that of Infasurf; a commercial surfactant preparation used in our in vivo experiments (see Methods). DLSS was readily foamed using a hand mixer and the resulting foam had bubble sizes in the range of ~50 to ~800 \u00b5m with a half-drainage time of ~2.5 min (see Fig. S3 ). The DLSS solution was administered to the lungs either as liquid (1 ml/kg, n=5) or foam (1 ml/kg before foaming, n=5), and the lung lobes were separated, sliced and imaged (see Methods). Since surfactant distribution depends heavily on volume doses and administration procedures, comparing foam and liquid administration is intrinsically challenging. Thus, we chose to follow closely protocols of recent clinical trials 11, 13 and explore whether surfactant distribution in such trials could be improved by foaming the surfactant prior to administration.",

Liquid DLSS exhibited a patchy distribution where some lung regions received high quantities of dye while other regions, as large as a few centimeters across, remained essentially void of dye. Moreover, the entire left cranial lobe (LCr) received very little dye in all (n=5) lungs treated with liquid DLSS (see Fig. 1b and discussion below). These results agree well with previous in vivo experiments that showed patchy pulmonary surfactant distribution 24 . In contrast, foamed DLSS reached all lung lobes and was more homogenously distributed throughout the tissue, typically leaving only millimeter-sized gaps between dyed areas. In both foam and liquid treatments, we observed reduced dye deposition in the caudal (and more distal) side of the caudal lobes compared to the cranial (more proximal) side.",

To quantitatively characterize these differences, we digitally divided the lung-slice images into smaller sub-regions (see Methods) and calculated the dyed fraction for each sub-region (Fig. S1) . We then constructed a normalized histogram showing the number of sub-regions for each 10 th percentile of dyed fraction, weighted by the area of the sub-region (Fig. 2b) . In the liquid group, 40\u00b12% of the lung slice area was found in sub-regions with a dyed fraction < 10% reflecting the large untreated areas observed qualitatively. In contrast, only 9\u00b12% of the area resided in sub-regions with a dyed fraction < 10% for the foam group indicating that untreated regions therein are typically small. This observation may be critical for surfactant treatment in adults since surfactant is known to spread promptly across small lung regions 33 but is less likely to spontaneously distribute across larger regions. It is thus possible that the small untreated gaps in the foam treatment would be bridged by the spontaneous spreading kinetics of surfactant, while the larger gaps in the liquid treatment would remain untreated. We underline that the percentage of area in sub-regions with a dyed fraction > 10% (i.e. sum of the nine right columns of Fig. 2b) was 91\u00b12% for the foam group and only 60\u00b12% for the liquid group (95% CI for the difference: 25 to 36%, p<0.001); a difference that may highly influence the efficacy of surfactant treatment in adults. Note that lobes receiving a small or no amount of DLSS were smaller in size than those containing high amounts of DLSS (e.g. left cranial lobes in Fig. 1b,c) . Since this bias leads to an underestimation of the contribution of large untreated regions in the analysis, our experiments are likely to overestimate the total dyed fraction in the liquid group.",

Notably, the average dyed fraction for the range D=12.5 to 17.5 cm (proximal region) was higher than the average dyed fraction in the range D=2.5 to 10 cm (distal region) for the foam group in the left caudal lobe (difference: 23\u00b14%, p=0.004), as well as for the liquid group in the left caudal lobe (difference: 23\u00b18% p=0.049), and the foam group in the right caudal lobe (difference: 24\u00b16%, p=0.02) but 6 not for the liquid group in the right caudal lobe (difference: -0.5\u00b112%, p=0.97). The difference between dyed fraction in proximal vs distal regions did not differ significantly between the treatments (p=0.9 and p=0.1 for the left and right caudal lobes, respectively). Such decreased levels of surfactant delivery to the distal regions of the caudal lobes were previously reported in in vivo experiments using natural bovine surfactant 24 . In the liquid group, this decrease is most likely a result of surfactant loss along the airway walls and alveolar filling in more proximal lung regions 20 . In the surfactant group, the increased effective viscosity of the foam may have resulted in the obstruction of distal airways (see below) and a preferred distribution to more proximal regions that are reached through shorter paths. Such sub-optimal foam distribution in distal lung regions may potentially be improved by increasing the dose above 1 ml/kg or including a post-treatment recruitment maneuver.",

However, for all foam administration sessions, the time-averaged pressure was lower than 30 cmH2O, and the peak momentary pressure never exceeded 60 cmH2O; such values are not expected to result in significant barotrauma to the lungs. For comparison, peak pressures are regularly raised to 40-60 7 cmH2O during recruitment maneuvers in ARDS patients 34 . Furthermore, the measured pressure values represent an overestimation of pressure inside the lung since the high effective viscosity of the foam increases pressure drop across the endotracheal tube and the pressure was measured outside the endotracheal tube. Nevertheless, an extended period of time was required to maintain low pressures while injecting foam (~5 min) compared to liquid (~1 min, Table 1 ). This could indicate a need to balance potentially harmful pressures during foam injection with the risk of extending the time period when a patient is not being ventilated. The increased PIP following foam injection is likely a result of the relatively high pressures required for propagating foam plugs in small airways due to the foam's high effective viscosity 31, 35 . Such foam plugs may also entirely obstruct lung airways, thus reducing the volume of the lung available for ventilation. This is in line with reduced foam distribution to the distal part of the caudal lobes (Fig. 3) . Nevertheless, these foam plugs seem to open up over time as witnessed in the gradual reduction in PIP within 40 min post-administration (Table 1) .",

Yet, recent studies indicate major disadvantages of liquid instillations when applied to adult ARDS patients, such as a patchy, non-uniform distribution. Here, we showed that LiFT results in a more uniform pulmonary distribution than liquid instillations in large ex vivo lungs when using a surrogate lung surfactant solution. In addition, foamed Infasurf was able to increase PaO2 and reduce PIP in an in vivo rat model of ARDS. These findings suggest that LiFT may greatly improve the efficacy of exogenous lung surfactant therapy in treating ARDS patients while being safe, thus advocating further investigation in large animal models towards new and more efficient surfactant treatments for ARDS. Furthermore, using LiFT as a drug carrier for topical delivery of drugs and cells to the lungs may hold tremendous potential for a wider range of pulmonary therapies 40, 41 .",

Ten pairs of lungs from ~90 kg adult pigs were purchased from a local provider (Lahav CRO, Israel) and kept at 4\u00b0C for up to two days and experiments were conducted at room temperature (22-25\u00b0C). To minimize potential damage to the lungs, the heart was not dissected from the lungs in the harvesting process and remained attached to them during the experiments. The lungs were ventilated using a PLV-100 ventilator (Respironics, USA) equipped with a single limb breathing circuit with an adjustable PEEP valve. This breathing circuit was connected to the lung via a silicone tube fitted with a ratchet pinch clamp, a three-way connector, and an 8.5 mm inner diameter endotracheal tube that was positioned at a 20-degree angle to the horizontal plane (Fig. 1a) . Air pressure was monitored throughout the experiment via one outlet of the three-way connector using an in-house built pressure measurement system composed of a pressure transducer (AS-0023, Biometrix, USA), a voltage amplifier (ETH-256, iWorx, USA) and a data acquisition board (Arduino Uno, Arduino, Italy). This pressure measurement system was calibrated using a water column before each experiment. Full recruitment of the lungs was then established by setting a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute (bpm), with an inspiratory:expiratory time ratio (I:E ratio) of 1:2 and slowly (within ~20 min) increasing the tidal volume up to ~1.5 L and the PEEP up to ~20 cm H2O while alternately placing the lungs in the supine or prone position. Air-pressure did not exceed 60 cm H2O during the recruitment procedure. Subsequently, the PEEP and tidal volume were set to ~10 cm H2O and ~1L, respectively, and small superficial holes or rips in the lungs were clamped using hinge clips or tied with small cable ties. To mimic the in vivo orientation of the lung at a right lateral position, the lungs were positioned with the right lung facing down and the heart was propped on an adjustable lift stage and tied in place. The PEEP was then reduced to 5 cm H2O, the tidal volume was reduced to 0.64L (7 ml/kg), and the respiratory rate and I:E ratio remained unchanged. These settings were kept constant throughout the experiment. Note that the positioning of the lungs in a right lateral position was performed while maintaining higher tidal volume and PEEP than in subsequent steps to prevent de-recruitment of the lungs during manual handling.",

Following the setup, the lungs were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: Liquid DLSS (1 ml/kg, n=5) or foamed DLSS (1 ml/kg before foaming, ~6.2 ml/kg after foaming, n=5). Both treatments were divided into two aliquots, such that the first half of the dose was administered in a right lateral position, while the second half was given in a left lateral position. In the foam group, 51 gr of DLSS were foamed inside a graded plastic beaker (inner diameter 5 inches) using a hand mixer at maximum power for 80 sec at room temperature (22-25\u00b0C) and then repeatedly foamed for an additional 10 sec (typically 1-3 times) until the volume of the foam reached ~325 ml. Before DLSS administration, the ventilation was stopped at end-expiration by closing the ratchet pinch clamp, and the ventilation circuit was disconnected from the silicone tube. Next, a 150 ml syringe was filled with 150 ml of foam by manually withdrawing foam from the beaker into the syringe, the tip of the syringe was inserted into the silicone tube, the ratchet pinch clamp was opened and the foam was injected into the lungs. An additional foam bolus of 150 ml was similarly administered immediately after the first one followed by two air boluses of 135 ml each that served to purge the foam from the tubing and conducting airways and propel it deeper into the lungs. An in vitro calibration performed before the experiments showed that this procedure produced a foam with a volume of ~280 ml at the distal end of the endotracheal tube, as measured using a measuring tube. This corresponds to a dose of ~3.1 ml of foam per kg body weight, and a total weight of 46 gr corresponding to a dose of ~0.5 ml of the original solution per kg body weight. To minimize the chance of barotrauma, the foam injection rate was adjusted to maintain a pressure of ~30 cm H2O. When injection was too slow, air pressure was allowed to rise up to ~40 cm H2O, with occasional peaks at ~50 cm H2O (see Results Table 1 for measured pressure values during foam and liquid administration). Ex vivo dye imaging and image analysis. Following foam or liquid administration, the lung lobes were separated using a sharp knife, and each lobe was sliced along the transverse plane at ~2.5 cm intervals. Since separating the right middle lobe from the right cranial lobe was difficult to perform accurately, these two lobes were not separated before slicing and were analyzed together as one unit. In addition, the accessory right lobe was sliced using a single cut orthogonal to the direction of the bronchus leading to this lobe. Note that the directions and orientations reported here relate to the geometry that the lungs assumed in this ex vivo experiment (see Fig. 1a ) and that this geometry may differ from their shape in vivo. The slices were immediately imaged using a digital camera (Sony alpha A6000) with constant lighting and exposure settings, and a ruler was included in the frame as a reference for image scaling.",

When sedation was deep, the continuous injection of propofol was temporarily replaced by normal saline. Importantly, this liquid administration regime was calibrated to avoid large drops in blood pressure. Buprenorphine (0.03 mg/ml, 0.2 ml) was given subcutaneously for analgesia. Bupivacaine was applied to the skin at the throat area for additional local anesthesia. Subsequently, the carotid artery was exposed and cannulated (BD Neoflon, 26GA) to allow blood pressure measurement and arterial blood sampling (a small spatula with inverse adhesive tape was inserted under the carotid to anchor it during cannulation). To avoid blood clotting in the tubes, the Following Lachmann et al. 44 , we measured the vital capacity of the rats' lungs as follows: the rats were disconnected from the ventilation machine and air was slowly injected (within ~20 sec) into the lungs from a 20 ml syringe while monitoring the air pressure. Air injection was stopped when the pressure inside the lungs reached 35 cm H2O. The rats were then immediately reconnected to the ventilation machine and the volume of injected air (defined as the vital capacity) was recorded.

In the foam group, Infasurf was foamed using a modified Tessari double-syringe technique 37,38 : first, a 5 ml syringe was filled with Infasurf (3 ml/kg + 0.2 ml to compensate for foam losses) and incubated for 5 min in a warm bath at 25\u00b0C. Next, the syringe was connected through a syringe filter (PES membrane, diameter 25 mm, pore size 5 \u00b5m) and a femalefemale Luer-lock connector to another 5 ml syringe. The volume of air in the second syringe was adjusted so that the air volume in the entire system (including 0.6 ml of air inside the filter and connector) was 3 times larger than the liquid volume. Finally, Infasurf was transferred 15-20 times between the two syringes, where the duration of each transfer was ~2 sec, resulting in dense and stable foam. The rats were then disconnected from the ventilation machine and the foam was slowly injected intratracheally within ~1 min. Based on prior calibration tests, this procedure resulted in the injection of 12 ml/kg of foam with a 1:3 liquid:air volume ratio. Immediately following foam injection, 1 ml of air was injected into the lungs from an adjacent syringe connected through a T connector to purge the foam from the tubes and conducting airways and push it deeper into the lungs. In the liquid group, a 2 ml syringe was filled with Infasurf (3 ml/kg + 0.1 ml to compensate for losses) and warmed for 5 min at 25\u00b0C in a warm bath. Infasurf was then injected into the lungs within ~10 sec followed by an air bolus (9 ml/kg + 1 ml, ~10 sec). In the control group, air (12 ml/kg + 1 ml) was injected within ~ 10 sec. In all three groups, pressure during the treatment was monitored using an analog pressure gauge and maintained below 35 cmH2O. Note that the overall volume injected was identical in all three groups to reduce confounding effects due to lung recruitment. Ventilation was resumed immediately after the treatment. In the foam group, ventilation immediately after the treatment was not optimal since the maximal pressure (set to 30 cm H2O) was reached. This resulted in a succession of short inhalation cycles that lasted ~1 min after which the ventilation resumed normally. Blood gases and PIP were measured at 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 min after the beginning of treatment. Rats were then euthanized using an overdose of pentobarbital (200 mg/ml, 4ml/kg).",

Finally, foam characteristics (i.e. effective viscosity, bubble sizes and foam stability) may differ between DLSS and a pulmonary surfactant (see Methods and Fig. S3).

As a result of the lavage-induced lung injury, the mean PaO2 value for the 17 rats included in this study reduced from a baseline of 442\u00b16 mmHg to 69\u00b13 mmHg 5 minutes after the last lavage, indicating severe hypoxemia (Fig. 4a). 30 min after the last lavage PaO2 levels remained stable at a mean value of 70\u00b14 mmHg. Mean PaO2 values increased dramatically within 15 min after treatment to >320 mmHg both in the foam and liquid treatments. These values remained stable until the end of the experiment (i.e. 90 min post-treatment). In the sham treatment, PaO2 values in two rats did not surpass 100 mmHg after treatment, while for the other 3 rats a gradual increase in PaO2 was observed; this latter improvement may be due to alveolar recruitment induced by the air bolus 39 . Following the methodology used in clinical trials 9,11 , we assessed the overall effect of the different treatments on PaO2 by calculating the area between the graph of measured values and a horizontal line representing the pre-treatment value measured prior to treatment (AUCPaO2). The mean difference in AUCPaO2 value between the foam group and the control group was 16,399 mmHg\u00d7min or ~202% of the mean AUCPaO2 value for the control group (95 percent confidence interval 8,412 to 24,387 mmHg\u00d7min or 103 to 300% of the mean AUCPaO2 value for the control group, p<0.001). Similarly, the mean difference in AUC values between the liquid and control groups was 15,969 mmHg\u00d7min or 196% of the mean AUCPaO2 value for the control group (95 percent confidence interval 7,982 to 23,957 mmHg\u00d7min or 98 to 294% of the mean AUCPaO2 value for the control group, p<0.001). The mean difference in AUC values between the foam and liquid groups was 430 mmHg\u00d7min or 1.8% of the mean AUC for the liquid group (95 percent confidence -7186 to 8046 mmHg\u00d7min or -29.8 to 33.4% of the meanAUCPaO2 for the liquid group, p=0.99). Thus, both liquid and foam treatments were effective in increasing PaO2 levels, and this effect was very similar for the two treatments. 5 min post-treatment administration the mean PaO2 value for the liquid group (PaO2=289\u00b123 mmHg) was higher compared to the foam group (PaO2=126\u00b120 mmHg, p<0.001) and compared to the control group (PaO2=107\u00b125 mmHg p<0.001),",

However, these differences are fortuitous since randomization took place after the pre-treatment measurements. 15 min after the treatment, the PIP value in the foam group reduced to 20.3\u00b10.5 cm H2O and remained stable until the end of the experiment. This is in contrast to the rise in PIP observed ex vivo and suggests that the foamed Infasurf helped in opening collapsed regions of the lung and/or reducing surface tension. A moderate reduction in PIP (to 19.9\u00b10.8) was also observed in the liquid group, but PIP did not change appreciably in the control group. The area between the PIP curve and a horizontal line representing the pretreatment value from treatment to 90 min after treatment (AUCPIP) was higher in the liquid (AUCPIP=217\u00b175 cmH2O\u00d7min, p=0.075) and foam (AUCPIP=487\u00b172 cmH2O\u00d7min p<0.001) groups compared to the control group (AUCPIP=46\u00b146 cmH2O\u00d7min), and higher in the foam group compared to the liquid group (p=0.017).",
