            "text": "Purpose To perform a systematic review on published cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) secondary to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, to highlight main features and increase the awareness of this condition. Methods Original reports of SAT developed after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (mRNA, viral vector, or inactivated virus vaccines) were retrieved from a search of electronic databases. Individual patient data on demographics, medical history, type of vaccine, workup and therapies were collected. Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kruskal-Wallis and chi-squared tests were employed for comparisons. Results 30 articles including 48 reports were retrieved, 3 additional cases evaluated by the Authors were described and included for analysis. Of the 51 patients, 38 (74.5%) were women, median age was 39.5 years (IQR 34-47). Patients developed SAT after a median of 10 days (IQR 4-14) after the vaccine shot. Baseline thyroid exams revealed thyrotoxicosis in 88.2% of patients, decreasing at 31.6% at follow-up. Corticosteroids were used in 56.4% of treated patients. Patients undergoing non-mRNA vaccines were most frequently Asian (p = 0.019) and reported more frequently weight loss (p = 0.021). All patients with a previous diagnosis of thyroid disease belonged to the mRNA vaccine group. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated SAT is a novel entity that should be acknowledged by physicians. Previous history of thyroid disease may predispose to develop SAT after mRNA vaccines, but further studies and larger cohorts are needed to verify this suggestion. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated SAT is usually of mild/moderate severity and could be easily treated in most cases, thus it should not raise any concern regarding the need to be vaccinated.",

            "text": "Viral infections are considered the main trigger of SAT, especially for the frequent association with recent upper respiratory tract infections [1] . Main viruses associated with SAT are coxsackievirus A and B, echovirus, mumps, measles, influenza. Shortly after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many cases of SAT induced by this virus have been described [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Direct evidence of viral presence in the thyroid gland has been indeed demonstrated for several viruses [7] , including SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9] . Genetic susceptibility seems to also have a key role in pathogenesis, since SAT is often associated with some HLA haplotypes, in particular HLA-B*35 [10] . SAT has also been described after vaccination against H1N1 vaccine [11] , seasonal influenza virus vaccine [12, 13] , Human Papillomavirus vaccine [14, 15] , and hepatitis B vaccination [16] ; more recently, a rising number of cases of SAT following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has also been reported, whether for the nucleic acid (mRNA), the viral vector (adenovirus), or the inactivated virus vaccine. So far, some possible pathophysiological explanations for post-vaccination SAT have been proposed, yet distinct mechanisms remain unclear. The first mechanism suggested is the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) [17] , an adjuvants-triggered immune reaction due to vaccine (or other drugs or products) excipients which could determine dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune systems, possibly causing destructive thyroiditis or even new onset of autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis [18] . SAT as part of ASIA syndrome has been formerly described also for hepatitis B, Human Papillomavirus, and influenza vaccinations [19] . A second hypothesis is linked to molecular mimicry: a recent in-vitro study [20] found that antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins could cross-react with several tissue antigens, including thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO). This immune crosstalk could then represent a common mechanism for immune-mediated complications both after SARS-CoV-2 infections [21] and for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.",

Data extracted from the reports were almost complete for the baseline outcomes, for the early (4-to-8-weeks) follow up thyroid function tests were reported in 74.5% of patients: for these data we consider the risk of bias to be negligible; however, late (8-to-16-weeks) follow-up data were only reported for 20% of patients, denoting a significant risk of bias due to missing results, thus this bias was carefully considered in evaluating results. After steroid discontinuation, the patient had a mild symptomatic and biochemical relapse, thus Prednisone was reintroduced with subjective relief After 4 weeks of therapy, symptoms and thyroid function tests improved, therapy was discontinued, and patient was instructed to undergo periodic screening for thyroid function tests Fig. 1 Thyroid ultrasound and scintigraphy in SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination SAT. Ultrasound performed a at diagnosis and b at resolution of symptoms in a patient with subacute thyroiditis developed after mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 (Case 1, described in Table 1 ). At diagnosis thyroid was enlarged, highly inhomogeneous and nodular. After therapy, at resolution of symptoms, thyroid echostructure remained inhomogeneous, but thyroid volume was back to normal and there were no nodules. c Thyroid scintigraphy revealed low/ absent thyroid uptake in a patient with subacute thyroiditis developed after mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 (Case 1, described in Table 1 )",

Considering this first aim, epidemiological and clinical features of patients affected by post-vaccination SAT seem similar to the classic form of virus-related SAT, as compared to a large cohort study [52] , with a strong female prevalence, and a median age of onset at 40 years, with most prominent symptoms being neck pain, palpitations, fatigue, fever, weight loss. As for laboratory analyses, reported patients were usually thyrotoxic, and presented raised serum inflammation markers, particularly ESR, which correlated with thyrotoxicosis severity. Ultrasound, scintigraphy or FNA confirmed, when performed, typical features of classic SAT. Treatment strategies encompassed NSAIDs, beta-blockers and steroids, in line with American Thyroid Association guidelines [53] . We treated our three patients with prednisone, besides symptomatic therapy, due to the major severity of symptoms and/or the severity of thyrotoxicosis. This decision was pondered after raising ourselves the question if steroid therapies could impair vaccine-induced immune response. The three original patients hereby described developed thyroiditis after at least 2 weeks from vaccine shot, therefore we concluded that it was safe to employ steroids since the vaccine-induced immune response should have already been established. Further studies are needed to evaluate if an oral therapy with steroid, at what dosage and timing, may affect vaccine efficacy. As a precaution, until this subject is clarified, it could be suggested that if SAT onset occur in the first days after vaccine shot, it would be cautious to avoid or delay, if possible according to symptoms and thyrotoxicosis severity, steroid treatment.",

Peculiarly, all patients with a previous diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease who developed SAT belonged to the mRNA vaccine group, possibly identifying a predisposition to develop SAT after mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine secondary to ASIA syndrome, which is often associated to a personal or familial history of autoimmune diseases [19] , but further studies and larger cohorts are needed to verify this suggestion.",

            "text": "In the face of several billion vaccine doses that have been administered globally so far [56] , 51 recorded SAT cases following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination seem to define a very uncommon side effect. It is possible, however, that incidence of SAT could be underestimated, and that the paucity of cases described is not due to the rarity of this association but rather to a lack of awareness of this condition. SAT symptoms, despite peculiar, may indeed be confounded for post-vaccination general systemic side effects and could resolve spontaneously with symptomatic therapy, before a specialist may define diagnosis. At the same time, it is not entirely feasible to rule out other possible SAT etiologies (e.g., viral infections), however the reported cases all had a strong temporal association with vaccination schedule and cases did not clear peaked in the summer season, as expected for viral SAT (data not shown) [1] ; moreover, some authors performed other tests to rule out other etiologies. Pujol et al [42] , in an exemplary way, first ruled out SARS-CoV-2 associated SAT by detecting negative IgG anti-N, which are specific for natural (and not vaccine-driven) immunity, then performed molecular search of the principal pathogens associated with SAT in the FNA sample, which resulted negative.",

It is possible that patients with a previous history of thyroid disease may be more prone to develop SAT after mRNA vaccines, but further studies and larger cohorts are needed to verify this suggestion. Most importantly, since SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated SAT it is usually of mild/moderate severity and could be treated in most cases with symptomatic therapy or a short course of steroids, it should not raise any concern regarding the need to be vaccinated, since the risks of COVID-19 undoubtedly outweigh the risks of the vaccination.",
