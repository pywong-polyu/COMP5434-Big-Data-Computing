This study aimed to investigate the effect of environmental, seasonal, and spatial variations on the spread of dengue fever in Sri Lanka. The study used secondary data of monthly dengue infection and the monthly average of environmental parameters of 26 Sri Lankan regions from January 2015 to December 2019. Besides the descriptive measurements, Kendall's tau_b, Spearman's rho, and Kruskal-Wallis H test have been performed as bivariate analyses. The multivariate generalized linear negative binomial regression model was applied to determine the impacts of meteorological factors on dengue transmission. The aggregate negative binomial regression model disclosed that precipitation (odds ratio: 0.97, p < 0.05), humidity (odds ratio: 1.05, p < 0.01), and air pressure (odds ratio: 1.46, p < 0.01) were significantly influenced the spread of dengue fever in Sri Lanka. The bioclimatic zone is the vital factor that substantially affects the dengue infection, and the wet zone (odds ratio: 6.41, p < 0.05) was more at-risk than the dry zone. The climate season significantly influenced dengue fever transmission, and a higher infection rate was found (odds ratio: 1.46, p < 0.01) in the northeast monsoon season. The findings of this study facilitate policymakers to improve the existing dengue control strategies focusing on the meteorological condition in the local as well as global perspectives.",

            "text": "Dengue fever is an arthropod vector-borne viral infection transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and secondarily by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. It has a higher infection rate in tropical and subtropical areas and poses a global threat for around four billion inhabitants of more than 141 countries. It has been estimated that approximately 390 million dengue cases with 25,000 deaths have occurred worldwide annually (Brady et al. 2014 ; World mosquito program 2021). Threequarters of the dengue cases come from the South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions of WHO (Bhatt et al. 2013) . In Sri Lanka, the first dengue case was confirmed in 1962, while the first outbreak had recorded in 1965 (Sirisena and Noordeen 2014) . The dengue virus has four serotypes DENV 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, one new serotype, DENV 5, was identified in Malaysia in 2007 (Mustafa et al. 2015) . All four dengue virus serotypes have been co-circulating in Sri Lanka for more than 35 years (Sirisena and Noordeen 2014) . The country experienced its worst-ever dengue outbreak in 2017, with more than 175,000 cases and nearly 400 fatalities (Daily News 2017) . A model predicted that the dengue infection will increase up to 2.25 billion worldwide by 2080 (Messina et al. 2019) .",

            "text": "Climate plays a significant role in the spared of dengue through impacting the mosquito life cycle (Liyanage et al. 2016a ). Mosquitoes are known as ectotherms, i.e., their breeding and activity depend mainly on the surrounding environment (Blanford et al. 2013 ). An entomological study showed that Aedes mosquitoes primarily breed in different containers with stagnant clean and organically Editorial responsibility: Chenxi Li. rich water like plastic buckets, tier, coconut shells, etc. (Sirisena and Noordeen 2014; Rahman et al. 2021b ). Precipitation plays a crucial role as water is required to hatch mosquito eggs and develop the larval stage (Wagner et al. 2020) . Larvae live in water, and their development takes about 7-10 days. The dengue virus transmission creates a complex interrelation with local meteorological factors. Rainfall and temperature play a crucial role in dengue fever transmission (Naish et al. 2014) . The transmission of the viruses occurs between 18 and 34 \u00b0C and peaks in the range of 26-29 \u00b0C (Mordecai et al. 2017) . However, previous studies in different countries showed a range of combinations of various surrounding environmental parameters on dengue transmission (Choi et al. 2016; Johansson et al. 2016; Rahman et al. 2021a ). The literature also stated that temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and population density were associated with dengue infection in high-risk areas (Zhu et al. 2016; Sharmin et al. 2018) . Investigations revealed that dengue fever incidence in Sri Lanka was caused by the factors: precipitation, wind, urbanization, land management, socio-demographic characteristics, etc. (Sirisena et al. 2017; Wagner et al. 2020) . Rainfall positively impacts dengue incidence in Sri Lanka (Liyanage et al. 2016a; Sirisena et al. 2017 ). The country's two annual peaks of dengue incidence are correlated with the two monsoons season during May to September and December to February (Liyanage et al. 2016a , Prabodanie et al. 2020b . Consequently, western provinces possessed higher dengue cases (41% in 2017) than the eastern parts of the country (7% during the 2017 outbreak) (Lazarus 2021) . Sri Lanka provides a compelling location for studying the effect of climate on dengue transmission due to highly varied rainfall patterns in the island (Prabodanie et al. 2020b) . Moreover, dengue fever shared a few common clinical signs with COVID-19 infection which has created misdiagnosis and delay diagnosis during the pandemic . The COVID-19 associated circumstances also hampered the usual surveillance and other programs of different diseases including dengue. Therefore, this study excluded the data of the year 2020.",

The island is divided into four climatic zones based on the yearly climate: wet, intermediate, dry, and arid. The wet zone receives rainfall in all seasons, and the average annual rainfall varies from 2000 to 5000 mm. Intermediate, dry, and arid zones receive 1100-2000 mm, 700-1000 mm, and less than 700 mm annual rainfall, respectively (Prabodanie et al. 2020b) . In this study, the aird zone has been merged with the dry zone and considered the country into three distinct zones. The different climatic zones in Sri Lanka are presented in Fig. 1a . The monsoon winds of the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean influence the pattern of precipitation which marks the climate seasons in the study area (Asian Disaster Reduction Center 2020). The spatial distribution of precipitation in different climate seasons in Sri Lanka is illustrated in Fig. 1b-e. The climate of Sri Lanka can be characterized into 4 seasons based on 12 months period that it inveterate: (1) The first inter-monsoon (FIM) season (March-April): this term is uncomfortable with thunderstorm-type rain, mainly throughout the afternoon or evening. The amount of rainfall varies between 100 and 250 mm in most parts of the island (Fig. 1b) .",

(3) Second intermonsoon (SIM) season (October-November): In the second inter-monsoon season, thunderstorm-type rain and cyclones are common in the Bay of Bengal. Widespread rain with strong winds leads to floods and landslides on the island. The whole country receives 400 mm or more rain, and higher rainfall (750-1200 mm) occurs in Southwestern slops during this season (Fig. 1d ). (4) Northeast monsoon (NEM) season (December-February): This season comprises relatively cool but dry weather that makes immediate comfortable and pleasant conditions over most parts of Sri Lanka. The days remain full of sunshine, and nights are cool with a cloud-free sky. Unless this pleasant weather, some parts of the country experience rain during this season ( ",

The key environmental factors considered in this study were temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, sky clearness, air pressure, and wind speed. In addition to these ecological factors, this study also included bioclimatic zone and climate season as exogenous variables suspected to influence the study variable significantly. Based on the annual rainfall, the country is divided into 3 bioclimatic zones in this study. From 26 regions, 13 regions belong to the dry zone, 6 to the intermediate zone, and 7 to the wet zone. The dengue infection data were collected from the Health Ministry of Sri Lanka (Epidemiology Unit of Ministry of Health 2019). The monthly dengue infection raw data for every year extracted from the website were organized in an excel sheet. Regions, months, and dengue cases were arranged in the first three columns in the excel sheet. The meteorological data were extracted from the NASA Power Data Access Viewer (NASA Power 2021). The environmental parameters were measured in different units: precipitation in millimeter (mm), relative humidity in percentage (%), air pressure in kilo Pascale (kPa), the temperature in degree Celsius (\u00b0C), wind speed in meter per second (m/s), whereas sky clearness was unitless. Generally, sky clearness is a dimensionless number between 0 and 1. It is defined as the ratio of radiation and extraterrestrial radiation (HOMER). The monthly averages of environmental factors were collected and systematically organized in each row corresponding to the individual region and months. The 4th and following columns were featured by the environmental factors, respectively. Eventually, the bioclimatic zone and climate season were included in the subsequent columns. This approach had been followed for each of the individual years. Finally, all 5-year data were merged into a single data file for the aggregate regression model.",

Descriptive statistics for the chosen environmental variables were mean, standard deviation (SD), maximum, minimum, skewness, and kurtosis. The 95% confidence interval indicates the impact size for the number of dengue cases in 26 cities of Sri Lanka. As the study variable considered here was a count variable, several statistical approaches were applied to find the appropriate statistical analysis. For testing the linearity of the variables, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tables was computed for each of the explanatory variables concerning the dependent variable. The p values corresponding to the deviation from linearity in the ANVOA table were observed, confirming the non-linear relationships (p < 0.05) between independent and dependent variables. Besides the linearity test, the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was applied to the data and found no evidence of normality (p < 0.05). Since the variables considered in this study did not follow linearity and normality assumptions, it would be apposite to use the non-parametric statistical methods. To assess the bivariate relationship between the spread of dengue infections and various environmental variables, Kendall's tau_b and Spearman's rho correlation coefficients were computed. The meteorological variables which found significant in bivariate analysis were also considered in multivariate analysis. In addition to the climate variables, spatial and cyclical or seasonal variables were also included in the multivariate model. Kruskal-Wallis H test was applied as bivariate analysis to test the significant mean difference of Aedes infections among the spatial, temporal, and seasonal variable categories. The multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) was employed to determine the factors that significantly influence the spread of dengue disease in Sri Lanka. Since the study variable was a count variable, the Poisson regression (PR) model and the negative binomial regression (NBR) model with the log link function were used as non-parametric regression analysis.",

The AIC value for the NBR model was found least than that of the PR model. Hence, it can be said that the NBR model is better than the PR model. Firstly, the NBR model was applied for each individual year from 2015 to 2019. Secondly, it was also employed for the aggregate dataset (2015-2019) as a whole. Augmented Dicky-Fuller (ADF) test was performed to test the possible existence of unit root in the aggregate dataset. The ADF test provides the evidence of no unit root, i.e., the dataset was stationary, indicating no restrictions to apply the usual statistical approach. Moreover, the Chi-square test statistic was calculated based on the NBR and PR model's loglikelihood deviation. The Chi-square test proved the evidence of overdispersion of the data. Hence, the NBR model had been consciously applied for the analysis as it is appropriate for the overdispersed count data.

The AIC value of the NBR aggregate model (AIC: 19587.67) was less than the PR model (AIC: 625303.13), indicating that the NBR model is appropriate for the current study. In the aggregate model, a new explanatory variable, \"year,\" was introduced to investigate the yearly nominal risk of the spread of dengue infection and is presented in Table 6 . The variable \"year\" was found significant with dengue infection in Sri Lanka, and the odds ratio was found 8.04 (p < 0.01) for the year 2017, indicating that the risk of dengue infection was 8.04 times higher in 2017 compared to 2015. The odds ratio for 2019 was 4.09 (95% CI 3.25-5.15, p < 0.01), approximately half of the year 2017. A study conducted in Sri Lanka supported the result of this study and disclosed that dengue infection increased significantly in 2017 compared to the preceding 5 years of surveillance (Tissera et al. 2020) .",

The odds ratio of precipitation 0.97 indicates that the risk of spreading dengue incidence decreased by 3% for a one-unit increase in rainfall. A model analysis in Hong Kong found a negative relationship between rainfall and Aedes infection (Yuan et al. 2020) . Moreover, heavy rainfalls create the chance of flushing or killing the immature mosquitoes and transiently reduce the infection risk, but the elevated humidity increases mosquito survival (Sarfraz et al. 2012 ). In contrast, some studies found that one extra rainy day in a month causes the increase in dengue cases by 6% in the following month ). Humidity (Odds: 1.05, 95% CI 1.04-1.07, p < 0.01) and air pressure (Odds: 1.46, 95% CI 1.36-1.56, p < 0.01) had substantial impacts on the dengue fever transmission. The odds ratio of humidity 1.05 indicates that for a one-unit increase in humidity, the risk of dengue infection also increases by 1.05 times. Similarly, the odds ratio of 1.46 for air pressure means for a 1 kPa increase in air pressure, the odds of dengue incidence would be 1.46 times more. A similar study supported our result, which found that relative humidity was significantly positively related to the increase in dengue incidence (Karim et al. 2012) . Increased rainfall and relative humidity strongly affected Malaysia's dengue transmission (Ismail et al. 2010) . Multivariate analysis did not show any significant impact of temperature on the spread of dengue infection. Similar to our findings, the literature found that temperature is not a significant factor and even had no immediate effect on dengue incidence (Sirisena et al. 2017; Santos et al. 2019) . The relation between temperature and infection was insignificant in the capital city Colombo, located in the wet region (Prabodanie et al. 2020a ). However, different studies revealed diverse conclusions regarding the effect of temperature on vector breeding and dengue infection rate. The recent literature stated that an increase in temperature could lead to the rapid development of the Aedes mosquitoes and increase subsequent dengue infections (Awang and Dom 2020) . More precisely, a study in Thailand stated the rapid growth but lower survival rate of Aedes albopictus at higher temperatures (Phanitchat et al. 2017) . Another study proved that a high-temperature condition with low fluctuation could raise the dengue cases in the next month (Sharmin et al. 2015) . Moreover, the high instability of warmer temperatures has reduced the transmission (Carrington et al. 2013; Liu-Helmersson et al. 2014 ). This study revealed that wind speed (Odds: 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.11, p < 0.01) significantly impacted the spread of dengue infection, but negative impacts were found in the years 2015 and 216. The literature supported the finding, which showed that the average wind speed has a significant negative correlation in Sri Lanka (Prabodanie et al. 2020a) .",

On the other hand, humidity and air pressure positively influence dengue fever. Growing humidity, air pressure, and wind speed increase the dengue illness. Bioclimatic zones substantially influence the spread of the infection, and the wet and intermediate zones were found more vulnerable to dengue disease than the dry zone. Moreover, the wet zone had the highest risk of spreading the disease among all other zones. Furthermore, the northeast monsoon season significantly impacted the Aedes infection in Sri Lanka, and in this season, the jeopardy of dengue disease was higher than in all other seasons. The risk of dengue infection was significantly higher in 2017 than in other years. The precipitation, air pressure, wind speed, and bioclimatic zone greatly impacted the outbreak in 2017, and the people who stayed in the wet zone were more vulnerable to this disease in the same year. Despite the meteorological features, the dengue vector's spread may be influenced by other socio-economic, demographic, and geographical factors such as population density, drainage system, disposal waste management which were not considered in the current research. This study intensively investigated the meteorological factors by applying the more appropriate statistical methods. Therefore, the obtained results will help local authorities to take the necessary steps for dengue prevention based on the climatic condition of the study area.",
