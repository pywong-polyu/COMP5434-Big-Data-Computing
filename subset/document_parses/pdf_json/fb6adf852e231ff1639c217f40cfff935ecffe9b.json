Informant interviews suggested these clinicians' views were influential, impacting general attitudes among both RTs and physicians and low and moderate adhering regarding the benefits of LPV and the LPV CDS tool.

Primary reasons for discussions centered on understanding and responding to instructions generated by the tool.

Once the required ventilation assessment is conducted, the data is automatically loaded into the ventilator protocol. The RT is then required to open another page and click for instructions and then read and accept or reject generated instructions. Reasons for declining instructions are documented by the RT using a drop-down list.

The initial LPV CDS tool implementation involved the rollout of all four components in a phased manner by individual site following the implementation of the new EMR. At the point of this study initiation, the phased rollout was complete and all 4 CDS tool protocols had been in place from 3 to 17 months, depending on the site. Users struggled to disentangle their sentiments about the LPV CDS tool itself from the impact on LPV CDS tool users' experience of system downtime and network delays during the broader EMR rollout.

The lack of an organized effort to discern from front-line clinicians what the barriers were, however, impaired the implementation team's ability to understand and address concerns.

This study's main findings revealed multi-factorial facilitators and barriers to use that varied by ICU site adherence level. The primary facilitator was that LPV and the LPV CDS tool could be used on all mechanically ventilated patients. Barriers included a persistent gap between clinician attitudes regarding the use of LPV and actual use, the perceived loss of autonomy associated with using a computerized protocol, the nature of physician-RT interaction in ventilation management, and the lack of clear organization measures of success. While clinicians consistently agreed that a set tidal volume \u2264 6.5 ml/kg PBW was optimal for patient care, we found more variation than expected when clinicians were asked to define LTVV and the appropriateness of ventilator modes other than volume control-our system standard-for the delivery of low tidal volumes. Consistent with prior studies [12, 13] , clinician's failure to recognize less-severe ARDS cases likely impedes LPV implementation. However, clinicians did not differentiate ARDS and non-ARDS patients when ordering the protocols or initiating an initial set tidal volume \u2264 6.5 ml/kg PBW but applied the standard to all mechanically ventilated patients. The fact that clinical teams are not required to differentiate ARDS patients when making decisions to utilize the LPV CDS tool or to initiate an initial low tidal volume setting is an important finding that simplifies implementation. This becomes important in situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where ICUs are experiencing high rates of ARDS and are likely to benefit from consistent use of LPV [36] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1159, "end": 1163, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1167, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1885, "end": 1889, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Consistent with earlier studies [11] , physician and RT statements that LPV strategies were most appropriate for patients with ARDS and indicated that they were consistently ordered and that an initial LTVV was used were not consistent with the provisional adherence data. This attitude-behavior gap [37] between intent and actual practice is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that clinician beliefs and perceived barriers to using LPV were not correlated with LPV initiation [11, 14] . Several factors may begin to explain this gap. Efforts to promote adherence continued between the time when we generated provisional measurement data and when field interviews were conducted. These findings also suggest that non-attitudinal barriers such as perceptions of control; structural elements, such as workflows; and normative influences, including perceptions by the care team regarding patient impact [12] , may continue to limit the use of LPV. These findings should be addressed in the development of implementation strategies [38] . The perceived loss of autonomy associated with following the LPV CDS protocol tools was difficult for more experienced RTs at low-performing sites. Under earlier paper-based systems, more experienced RTs may have felt empowered to function without physician orders in certain circumstances. Under relationship models theory, the traditional interaction between the physician and RT is based upon an authority ranking dyad relationship, asymmetrically ranked in a linear hierarchy with the critical care physician as the authority [39, 40] . At the low-performing sites, the traditional interaction was supplanted over time by an informal, negotiated market pricing relationship between the physician and RT. The critical care physician sought to optimize time in exchange for empowering more seasoned RTs to act in the patient's interest as the RT saw fit, without always obtaining a physician's order. The development of this informal, mutually protective dyad made it difficult to isolate and address the actual root causes of low adherence. Given that positive ventilation management outcomes are associated with the successful interaction of the physician and the RT, implementation strategies that target joint determinants should be considered. For example, using encounter-level data to identify on an exception basis those dyads that have higher nonadherence rates and conducting simulation training with each dyad to ensure that the required interaction is reasonably scripted and understood.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 32, "end": 36, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 300, "end": 304, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 488, "end": 492, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 493, "end": 496, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 911, "end": 915, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1043, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1580, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1584, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The lack of a definition for successful adherence to LPV and use of the LPV CDS tool was perceived as a key barrier at low-adhering sites.
