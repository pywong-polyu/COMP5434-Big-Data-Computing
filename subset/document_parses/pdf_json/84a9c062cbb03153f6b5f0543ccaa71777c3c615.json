The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in PAL which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to evaluate influence of sociodemographic and parental/familial factors on PAL levels before and during pandemic in adolescents from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The sample included 688 adolescents (15-18 years of age; 322 females) who were tested on two occasions: in January 2020 (baseline; before the COVID-19 pandemic) and in April 2020 (follow-up; during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown). Variables included PAL (measured by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents-PAQ-A) as well as sociodemographic-, parental-, and familial factors. A significant decline in PALs was recorded between baseline and follow-up (t-test: 11.88, p < 0.001). Approximately 50% of adolescents underwent sufficient PAL at baseline, while only 24% of them were achieving sufficient PAL at the time of follow-up measurement. Paternal education was positively correlated (OR (95%CI): baseline: 6.63 (4.58-9.96), follow-up: 3.33 (1.19-7.01)), while familial conflict was negatively correlated (baseline: 0.72 (0.57-0.90), follow-up: 0.77 (0.60-0.99)) with PALs before and during the pandemic. This study highlights the importance of the parent-child relationship and parental/familiar support in promoting physical activity both during regular life and during crises and health challenging situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Physical activity has a positive influence on the immunological system and can decrease the incidence of communicable diseases such as bacterial and viral infections [3] . However, due to technological advancement, physical activity in modern life has drastically reduced, directly contributing to the development of many non-communicable diseases (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity) [4] .",

PAQ-A is a 7-day recall and self-administered questionnaire that was developed to measure the PAL of adolescents aged 14 to 19 years. Item 1 assesses physical activity during spare time (e.g., bicycling, walking, running, dancing, football); Item 2 assesses physical activity during physical education classes; Item 3 assesses physical activity during lunch break; Item 4 assesses physical activity right after school; Item 5 assesses physical activity during the evenings; Item 6 assesses physical activity during the weekend; Item 7 assesses general physical activity during free time (\"describes you best\"); Item 8 questions the involvement in physical activity on each day of the week; and Item 9 is used to identify participants who are sick, injured, or have any other cause for reduced physical activity and is not used in the final score. Items 1 to 8 are scored on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 representing no activity or a low activity level and 5 representing a high activity level. The final theoretical PAQ-A score is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the scores from the first 8 items [27] . Apart from the raw PAQ-A results, for the purpose of statistical analyses in this study (details described later in the paper), the results of the baseline-PAL and follow-up-PAL were dichotomized, and scores below 2.73 were considered low-level-PAL, while scores above 2.73 were considered appropriate-PAL, as suggested in previous studies [28, 29] .",

Although Croatia and B&H share a long border, B&H is a country with many mountain massifs and valleys and where a temperate-continental climate prevails [34] . This study sampled adolescents from various territories, including continental and mountain parts of B&H. On the other hand, comparative Croatian studies have been conducted in coastal areas with a mild Mediterranean climate [17, 22] . Therefore, adolescents observed in recent Croatian studies have been exposed to a mild Mediterranean climate (temperature mostly higher than 10 \u2022 ), and consequently, the weather conditions during the studied period of COVID-19 pandemic were very favorable, so adolescents were able to spend some time outdoors participating in recreational activities while respecting the mandatory measures of social distancing [22] . Collectively, it is likely that the adolescents from B&H studied herein experienced greater declines in PAL than adolescents from Croatia because of (i) the stricter restrictions and measures of social distancing and (ii) the less favorable climate, which together led to lower PALs during the COVID-19 lockdown.",

Before explaining specific influence of paternal education status on the PAL of their children, a brief overview of parental influence on a child's PAL is needed. Generally, it is relatively well documented that fathers have a more pronounced influence on the sport-participation and physical activity of children than mothers [35] . Almost 30 years ago, Moore et al. established that children with more active fathers have a 3.5 times greater likelihood of being physically active in comparison to children with inactive fathers [36] . This was confirmed later by Yang et al., who reported that the PAL of fathers is significantly correlated with their children's PAL [37] .",

Nowadays, it is accepted that fathers use their own physical activity patterns to directly influence their children's physical activity habits [39] . With regard to differences between maternal and paternal influence, two issues should be contextualized. First, it is deemed that fathers provide a better example and model of sports skills, since men are generally more involved in sports activities than women/mothers [40] . Second, it seems that maternal influence on their children's behavior decreases with age, while the father-child relationship is relatively stable in terms of the PAL [23] .",

Supportively, previous research has recorded that a higher paternal level of education is associated with better health status of children [41] . Therefore, it is likely that better educated fathers are aware of the benefits of proper PAL during childhood and adolescence and are concerned about the PAL of their children [42] . Second, higher paternal education can lead to a favorable occupational status that contributes to a better financial status, while a better financial status of the family provides appropriate resources for allowing children to participate in organized sports activities [43] .",

Although these results are not surprising, the background should be specifically explained given the overall importance of PAL in adolescence. Under normal circumstances, parents and children usually spend a lot of time together. Parents determine and influence their children's life habits [44] , and this logically transfers even to physical activity habits [23] . More specifically, parents have a crucial role in the development of the social customs of their children. Therefore, parental activity habits and support are major determinants of children's physical activity behaviors [45] , and such parental influence can be both direct and indirect, influencing the social-cognitive, socio-economic, physical, and cultural environments [46] .",

Parental role modeling, therefore, represents a parent's activity patterns, attitudes, and efforts to model movement behaviors that their children observe and possibly imitate [50] . Role modeling can also include active involvement of parents in physical activity with their children (co-physical activities) which promotes healthy behavior of both the child and parent [51] .",

Furthermore, parental involvement, which represents a more overt level of parental support that includes playing with the child and coaching, has a positive influence on children's PALs [50] .

It is expected that more active parents will provide more support for sports involvement, provide more sports equipment, and will be personally involved in more frequent outdoor family time activities, through which they can also influence children's physical activity habits [38, 50] . Collectively, it is unquestionable that parental influence in forms of role modeling, social support, and social influence affect a child's attraction to physical activity and their perceived competence, through which a child's PAL can be influenced [47] .

Family cohesion is defined as \"emotional bonding that family members have toward one another\" [55] . It represents normal family functioning, including caring for other family members, familial support, and affection [56] . Trost et al. observed several constructs that can determine family cohesion: family functioning, family connectedness, family bonding, family control, family expressiveness, and parent-child communication [45] . It is expected that families with better family cohesion will create a more supportive environment for healthy-lifestyle habits, including physical activity habits [45] . Supportively, a positive correlation between family cohesion and children's PAL has been recorded, which has been explained by the theory that children from better-functioning families get more support and encouragement to be physically active [45] . This was also confirmed by Ornelas et al. who found positive associations of family cohesion, parent-child communication, and parental engagement in physical activity with PAL [57] . Prospective research by Bigman et al. showed a correlation between family cohesion and conflict with PALs among Mexican adolescents [58] . Adolescents who reported high family cohesion had a 32% greater likelihood of having a higher PAL than adolescents who reported lower family cohesion [58] . In contrast, a significant correlation between family conflict and PAL was not found [58] .",

Additionally, the likelihood of spending time in outdoor recreational activities is certainly limited if children are in conflict with their parents, because the parents are the ones who can provide them such activities. It is expected that due to conflict, some children do not have adequate parental influence and, therefore, do not have appropriate support and guidelines for being physically active.",

Precisely, parents reported that children were more involved in indoor activities, like household chores and activities including dance and physical education exercises, and outdoor activities, like riding a bicycle, walking, playing badminton, street basketball and hockey [25] .

Indeed, it is likely that all real-life influences appear in regular (i.e., \"real-life\") situations. In our case, baseline testing occurred during a period of regular life, when regular physical activities were possible. However, habits developed in such regular situations (pre-pandemic period) are logically translated even to irregular and challenging situations (period of lockdown). Therefore, although correlations obtained between familial factors and PAL at follow up were not so profound, it is still important to point out a certain \"transfer of influence\", as already suggested for other indices of overall well-being [17] .",

Therefore, participants may lean toward socially acceptable answers. However, knowing that the study was absolutely anonymous, there is a lower possibility of such bias. In addition, as in any other studies with self-reported data, there is a question of objectivity. While this is possible for some questions (i.e., parental conflict, socioeconomic status), some questions are less likely to be influenced (i.e., parental education). Additionally, this study did not take into account the possibility that some of the studied adolescents had to prepare for the final exam at the end of high school (e.g., maturita exam) and, therefore, probably had less time and opportunities to be physically active. Finally, this study observed adolescents who were involved in regular schooling system and who were able to respond to follow-up questioning using their own technological resources (i.e., smart phones, computers), which almost certainly influenced the participation at both testing waves and presented results. Therefore, associations between scholastic factors and PAL changes during pandemic should be examined in future This is one of the first studies which investigated the problem of parental influence on PAL during COVID-19 pandemic, and probably the first one which examined the problem in B&H. Results were comparable to previous studies using the same measurement tools. Therefore, although this study is not the final word on this topic, the authors believe that the findings will improve the knowledge about the problem and initiate further studies.",

Furthermore, solutions for providing similar content for people without access to technology and internet should be developed. Additionally, providing the support to participate in sporting organizations for youth is needed as sport is commonly used for promoting socialization, cooperation, respectful competition, and managing conflict. In addition, the provision of psychological support, ensuring that there are sufficient open spaces and encouraging people to get outdoors and try new outdoor activities as much as possible while respecting social-distancing propositions would be beneficial as well. It is important to note that such activities should be available to everyone in terms of financial, transportational, and security aspects (hand hygiene, maintaining proposed social distancing measures) in order to enable participation.",
