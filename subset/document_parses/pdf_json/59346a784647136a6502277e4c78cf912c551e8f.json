            "text": "A fusion protein expressed on the surface of enveloped viruses mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes to facilitate virus infection. Pre-and postfusion structures of viral fusion proteins have been characterized, but conformational changes between them remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the intermediate conformation of the murine coronavirus fusion protein, called the spike protein, which must be cleaved by a cellular protease following receptor binding. Western blot analysis of protease digestion products revealed that two subunits (67 and 69 kDa) are produced from a single spike protein (180 kDa). These two subunits were considered to be by-products derived from conformational changes and were useful for probing the intermediate conformation of the spike protein. Interaction with a heptad repeat (HR) peptide revealed that these subunits adopt packed and unpacked conformations, respectively, and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed a trimeric assembly. Based on biochemical observations, we propose an asymmetric trimer model for the intermediate structure of the spike protein. Receptor binding induces the membrane-binding potential of the trimer, in which at least one HR motif forms a packed-hairpin structure, while membrane fusion subunits are covered by the receptor-binding subunit, thereby preventing the spike protein from forming the typical homotrimeric prehairpin structure predicted by the current model of class I viral fusion protein. Subsequent proteolysis induces simultaneous packing of the remaining unpacked HRs upon assembly of three HRs at the central axis to generate a six-helix bundle. Our model proposes a key mechanism for membrane fusion of enveloped viruses. IMPORTANCE Recent studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) revealed the mechanism underlying activation of viral fusion protein at the priming stage. However, characterizing the subsequent triggering stage underpinning transition from pre-to postfusion structures is difficult because single-particle cryoEM excludes unstable structures that appear as heterogeneous shapes. Therefore, population-based biochemical analysis is needed to capture features of unstable proteins. Here, we analyzed protease digestion products of a coronavirus fusion protein during activation; their sizes appear to be affected directly by the conformational state. We propose a model for the viral fusion protein in the intermediate state, which involves a compact structure and conformational changes that overcome steric hindrance within the three fusion protein subunits.",

During membrane fusion in influenza virus and herpes simplex virus, a V-or Y-shaped density was observed in the intermediate state by cryoEM (14, 15) , and in the retroviral Env trimer, an asymmetric intermediate appeared to emanate from a single protomer in cryo-electron tomography experiments (16) .

The first step takes place after binding to a soluble form of the MHV receptor (CEACAM1a), upon which the metastable form of S protein is converted to a stable trimer possessing liposome-binding activity. The subsequent step is driven by protease digestion. From a single 180-kDa S protein, trypsin produces a 90-kDa subunit in the absence of receptor, but a 66-kDa subunit in the presence of receptor, and this 66-kDa species is thought to involve the formation of a 6HB structure (detected as a proteinase K-resistant 53-kDa subunit) (26) . A similar result of the protease digestion pattern was also reported in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins (4, 20) . Therefore, the sizes of protease digestion products are thought to be directly affected by the conformational state of the coronavirus S protein. Studying the MHV-2 S protein could illuminate the conformational changes occurring in each step and may provide novel insight into viral class I fusion proteins.",

As reported previously, the MHV-2f variant of MHV-2 harbors an amino acid substitution at the S1/S2 cleavage site that is cleaved by furin during biogenesis; this variant is sufficient to induce cell-cell fusion without supplemental trypsin in the culture medium (29) . To clarify whether cleavage at the S1/S2 site is sufficient for S protein priming prior to induction of conformational changes, we compared trypsin-treated MHV-2 and MHV-2f with MHV-2. To generate trypsin-treated MHV-2, the MHV-2 was exposed to 1 g/ml trypsin (or phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] for the uncleaved virus control) for 1 h, followed by the addition of trypsin inhibitors (both soybean trypsin inhibitor [STI] and camostat). Next, the viruses were purified using a Sephadex G-75 column. Figure 2A shows that, as reported previously (29) , half of the S protein of MHV-2f was cleaved (lane 9), whereas almost all of the S protein expressed by the trypsin-treated virus was cleaved (lane 5) (compare to PBS-treated MHV-2 S protein [lane 1]). The trypsin-treated virus was able to enter cells as efficiently as the PBS-treated virus (Fig. 2B) . The viruses were then exposed to both receptor and trypsin to induce conformational changes. A higher concentration of trypsin (50 g/ml) was needed to cleave the S protein, presumably due to residual trypsin inhibitors. Although background levels of the 67-and 69-kDa products were observed in the absence of receptor (lane 6) (presumably due to the use of preincubated viruses), clear production of a 67-kDa fragment was observed in the presence of receptor and trypsin (lane 8). Interestingly, induction of the proteinase K-resistant 53-kDa band from the trypsin-treated virus was observed in the presence of receptor, even in the absence of trypsin (lane 7); in contrast, the other two viruses (PBS-treated MHV-2 and MHV-2f) required both receptor and trypsin. This implies that the two types of cleaved S protein have different conformations: the precleaved S protein (cleaved by furin during biogenesis) needs additional cleavage after the receptor-binding step, whereas the trypsin-treated S protein (cleaved on virus particle) needs only receptor binding to trigger the conformational changes. Cleavage at the S2= site (to generate the 69-kDa species) may trigger conformational changes, as reported previously (20, 30) ; however, cleavage at either the S1/S2 site or the S2= site is presumably enough to activate the MHV-2 S protein. The 67-and 69-kDa species can be considered by-products of the S protein following conformational changes; therefore, these products were examined to probe the intermediate conformation(s) of the S protein.",

To identify the trypsin cleavage site that produces the 67-kDa fragment, we attempted to gain indirect evidence because the 67-kDa subunit has not been successfully purified from the virus particle for amino-terminal sequencing. Both the 67-and 69-kDa subunits were detected by MAb-10G and anti-CT, but not by anti-S2a, even following increased exposure of blots, and only the 69-kDa subunit was detected by anti-VHCR (Fig. 1B) . These results indicate that the 69-kDa subunit is a product of cleavage between S2a and VHCR epitopes at the S2= site, as previously reported (11, 30) , whereas the 67-kDa subunit is the result of cleavage at the C-terminal side of the VHCR epitope. Using the endoproteinases arg-C and lys-C to identify the specific arginine or lysine residue of the cleavage site, the 67-kDa subunit was found to be cleaved at a lysine residue (Fig. 3A) .",

The 90-, 69-, and 67-kDa bands were shifted to 65, 47, and 43 kDa, respectively, after treatment with 0.32 or 32 g/ml trypsin (Fig. 3B) . The 4-kDa size difference between 43-and 47-kDa deglycosylated bands indicates that the 67-kDa subunit is cleaved at K951, because the calculated molecular weight of the peptide fragment between S2= (R907) and K951 is 4.8 kDa, whereas cleavage at the neighboring lysine K917 would yield a 1.3-kDa size difference and cleavage at K1008 would afford a 10.6-kDa size difference. The K951 cleavage site was therefore designated postS2=. Notably, the postS2= cleavage site is in the 48th \u2424-strand (\u242448), which forms an anti-parallel \u2424-sheet with \u242447 in the prefusion form but not in the postfusion form of the S protein (10, 11) . Cleavage at postS2= is unlikely to contribute to S protein triggering because it is located at the C-terminal side of the fusion peptide (FP; Fig. 4A and B), and the appearance of the 67-kDa species does not correspond to the formation of the postfusion structure (53 kDa) or virus entry ( Fig. 1C and D), as described above.",

The receptor concentration was found to affect the total amount of 67-and 69-kDa species, but not the relative ratio between them (Fig. 3C) , implying that two different cleavable features of the S2 subunit were induced in the receptor-binding step. Furthermore, inclusion of dithiothreitol (DTT) at concentrations of \u05461 mM in the sample buffer shifted the 67-kDa band to a greater extent than the 69-and 90-kDa bands during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3D ). Two cysteine residues at positions 1169 and 1214 ( Fig. 4A and B) , between the HR1 and HR2 motifs (in the connector region), were predicted to affect the conformation of the 67-kDa subunit. Meanwhile, cysteine residues 932 and 943, located upstream of HR1, and residues 1119 and 1130 within the invariant motifs may affect the smaller shift observed for the 69-and 90-kDa bands. The connector region, including the disulfide bond, presumably contributes to folding of the 67-kDa subunit, but not to that of the 69-and 90-kDa subunits. Two different sizes of S2 subunit are present in the trimer. We next turned our attention to how two different sizes of S2 subunit (67 and 69 kDa) could be produced by trypsin digestion of a single 180-kDa S protein species, even though a single-sized (90-kDa) species is produced in the absence of receptor. We hypothesized that the S protein forms a heterogeneous trimer in the presence of receptor, so that each S protein in a trimer exposes a different cleavage site. In the first native SDS-PAGE step (gels were boiled before blotting so that the trimer could be detected by the antibody, as described in Materials and Methods), several different sizes of trimer were detected (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3) . In the second denaturing SDS-PAGE step, these trimer bands were separated into monomer bands (Fig. 5A , lanes 5 and 6). To examine the components of the trimer, we performed two-dimensional electrophoresis. After treatment with 10 g/ml trypsin, both the 67-and 69-kDa bands, or the single 67-kDa band, were separated from three species of trimer at around 140 kDa ( Fig. 5B and Cb), whereas only the 69-kDa band was detected following treatment with 0.32 g/ml trypsin (Fig. 5Ca) . These results suggest that a subset of S2 subunits can form a heterogeneous trimer comprising the 69-and 67-kDa species at a ratio of 3:0, 2:1, 1:2, or 0:3.",

Further characterization of S2 subunits was performed to investigate exposed and buried configurations of epitopes, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . MHV-2 was treated with receptor and trypsin to induce conformational changes, as described above. S protein detection was performed using four anti-S2 antibodies recognizing linear epitopes. Following soaking in stripping buffer to denature the S protein on the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, detection was then repeated with the same antibodies. When antibodies against the VHCR and CT epitopes were used, all bands detected in denatured blots (Fig. 6B) were the same as those observed in native blots (Fig. 6A) , indicating that these epitopes are exposed on the S protein in both the native and denatured states. In the postfusion form of the S protein treated with receptor and trypsin, doublet bands at 140 kDa were observed using anti-CT antibody (Fig. 6A , CT, MHV-2 treated with soluble receptor and trypsin was divided into two aliquots for unboiled (native) and boiled (denatured) treatments. After electrophoresis on a 3 to 10% gel, the gel was boiled in sample buffer at 105\u00b0C for 5 min in an autoclave and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. (B) Two-dimensional electrophoresis. The reaction mixture prepared as described for panel A was mixed with sample buffer containing molecular size markers, and two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out. After the first electrophoresis step, the first gel (3 to 10%) was boiled in sample buffer, sliced along the markers, and laid onto the second gel (7.5%). After the second electrophoresis step, the gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane. X marks indicate overlaid molecular size markers. (C) Cropped and enlarged blots. Blots from two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blot analysis corresponding to 0.32-or 10-g/ml trypsin treatment were cropped at 67 and 69 kDa and enlarged by graphical manipulation software. For all panels, Western blot analysis was carried out using MAb-10G antibody. Fig. 5Cb showing that the 67-and 69-kDa bands were separated from 140-kDa trimer bands. Using anti-S2a antibody recognizing a linear epitope (Fig. 1B, S2a ) (34), a 500-kDa band corresponding to a trimeric assembly was observed only after the receptorbinding step in native blots (Fig. 6A, S2a, lane 3) , as observed in a previous study (26) , but this was barely detectable in denatured blots (Fig. 6B, S2a, lane 3) . We do not currently have an explanation for exposure of the S2a epitope, but this hydrophobic epitope is buried in the globule in the pre-fusion state (10) and is presumably exposed only in the native trimer after the receptor-binding step, before disappearing following cleavage by trypsin. When antibody recognizing the 10G epitope was used, monomeric S2 subunit species were detected in the native blot (Fig. 6A, 10G , lanes 3 and 4), but trimeric species were not observed, although they were detectable in the denatured blot (Fig. 6B, 10G, lanes 3 and 4) . This indicates that the 10G epitope adopts a buried configuration in the trimer of pre-and postfusion forms. These observations provided clues that were used to predict the intermediate structure of the S2 subunit.",

As shown in Fig. 7A , trypsin treatment on ice for 5 min following receptor treatment was sufficient to generate the 69-kDa but not the proteinase K-resistant 53-kDa species (lane 2). The 53-kDa band was induced after a 1-min incubation at 37\u00b0C (lane 3), and the 67-kDa band appeared and became prominent over 4 min (lane 5), indicating that the conformational changes that induce the 6HB structure are complete at 1 min after treatment with trypsin.

To characterize the conformational states of 67-and 69-kDa subunits after the receptor-binding step, HR2-mimicking peptide was used. This 39-amino-acid peptide derived from the HR2 region of the S2 subunit is water soluble and interferes with packing of the HR1/HR2 motif, thereby inhibiting virus infection (35) . MHV-2 pretreated with soluble receptor was treated with HR2-mimicking peptide (50 M) and various concentrations of trypsin. The 69-kDa but not the 67-kDa subunit disappeared following treatment with HR2mimicking peptide, and the 55-kDa degradation product appeared after incubation in the presence of 8 g/ml trypsin (Fig. 8A, lane 13) . Presumably, protease-cleavable sites in the S2 subunit are vulnerable to scission by trypsin when the HR2-mimicking peptide is present due to the restriction of helical bundle formation by the HR motif; hence, the cleavage pattern was altered. This also indicates that the HR1/HR2 motif in the 67-kDa fragment forms a postfusion species in which the HR1 motif is occluded after the receptor-binding step. Interestingly, HR2-mimicking peptide completely inhibited production of the proteinase K-resistant 53-kDa fragment (Fig. 8C, lanes 11 and 13) , even in the presence of the packed 67-kDa species (Fig. 8A, lanes 11 and 13) , suggesting that HR2-mimicking peptide interferes with 6HB formation. The trimer in the receptor-binding step is presumably constructed from both packed and unpacked HR1/HR2 motifs, and HR2mimicking peptide interacts with an unpacked motif, and thereby interferes with 6HB formation. In the presence of 0.5 to 2 g/ml trypsin, HR2-mimicking peptide did not appear to affect degradation of the 69-kDa fragment due to the low concentration of trypsin (Fig. 8A , lanes 5 to 10). In addition, trypsin degradation products in the presence of HR2-mimicking peptide were detected by MAb-10G antibody (Fig. 8A, lanes 13, 15 , and 17) but not by anti-CT antibody (Fig. 8B, lanes 13, 15, and 17) , indicating that the 10G epitope region is folded and consequently avoids cleavage by trypsin, whereas the C-terminal side of the 10G epitope, including the HR2 region (residues 1253 to 1302, Fig. 4A ) is presumably unfolded and therefore degraded by trypsin. Although the mechanism remains unknown, HR2-mimicking peptide enhanced the production of the 69-kDa subunit following treatment with 0.25 g/ml trypsin (Fig. 8B, lane 3) .",

HR2-mimicking peptide was added to the S protein conformational change reaction at the indicated time points after stopping the reaction using dry ice-methanol, and mixtures were reincubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 min to facilitate production of the 67-and 69-kDa fragments (reincubation is required to visualize bands that reflect the structure present upon HR2-mimicking peptide addition). At each HR2-mimicking peptide addition time point, if the HR1/HR2 motif forms an unpacked structure, the HR2-mimicking peptide would be expected to bind to HR1 and trypsin would degrade the 69-kDa to produce the 55-kDa lacking the CT epitope as described above (Fig. 8A  and B ). As shown in Fig. 8G (lane 2) , the 67-kDa subunit appeared, the 69-kDa subunit disappeared, and the 55-kDa degradation product appeared following treatment with HR2-mimicking peptide after the receptor-binding step, suggesting that both packed and unpacked HR1/HR2 motifs simultaneously occur in the reaction. After a 1-min incubation at 37\u00b0C, undegraded 69-kDa subunit, which does not interact with HR2mimicking peptide, was observed (Fig. 8G, lane 3) , suggesting that both the 67-and 69-kDa fragments form a packed structure at this time point. Assembly of three S2 subunits at the center of the S protein trimer. As shown in Fig. 5A and 6A, interactions between subunits in the S protein trimer were enhanced by receptor and trypsin treatment, and it remained stable in sample buffer containing 0.5% SDS during SDS-PAGE. To compare the strengths of intermolecular interactions within the trimer at each step during the conformational changes, reaction mixtures of virus treated with receptor and trypsin were frozen at the indicated time points using dry ice-methanol, mixed with sample buffer containing trypsin inhibitor and 0.5% SDS, and incubated at different temperatures between 25 and 100\u00b0C at intervals of 5\u00b0C. Both the trimer and the dissociated monomer were detected via Western blotting following soaking of the PVDF membrane in stripping buffer used for trimer detection by MAb-10G. As shown in Fig. 9A , the nontreated trimer in the prefusion state dissociated into the monomeric form at 25\u00b0C. After receptor binding, the dissociation temperature was increased to \u03f360\u00b0C. The dissociation temperature of the trimer was further increased to 90\u00b0C after trypsin treatment and finally reached 95\u00b0C after 32 min (Fig. 9B) .",

These results correspond to liposome flotation assays in a previous study in which virus binding to liposomes was induced by receptor (26) . Virus particles disappeared at 1 min after trypsin treatment (Fig. 10Div) , and fused liposomes were the dominant species observed at 30 min (Fig. 10Dv) , suggesting that membrane fusion with liposomes was largely complete within 1 min, and liposomes then fused with each other using the remaining S protein. An enlarged view of virus-bound liposomes shown in Fig. 10Dii and iii is presented in Fig. 10E . The gaps between viruses and liposomes that are presumably bridged by S protein were \u03f3200 \u00c5 after the receptor-binding step (Fig.  10Eii) , and this distance was reduced by trypsin treatment on ice (Fig. 10Eiii) .

In contrast, most MHV variants carry S proteins that are cleaved by cellular furin at the S1/S2 site during biogenesis, which was believed to require only receptor binding to induce membrane fusion (37, 38) . However, previous studies of MHV and MERS-CoV suggest that the coronaviruses harboring precleaved S protein (cleaved by furin during biogenesis) at the S1/S2 site require further cellular proteases to facilitate cell entry (20, 30) . Our results also suggest that the S protein cleaved during biogenesis by furin requires additional cleavage to induce conformational changes required to adopt a proteinase K-resistant conformation (Fig. 2A, lane 12) . However, the trypsin-treated S protein cleaved on virus particles at the S1/S2 site does not require additional cleavage; it needs only receptor binding (Fig. 2A, lane 7) . Therefore, these two types of S protein cleaved at the S1/S2 site are predicted to have different conformations. In the present study, using MHV-2, the 67-and 69-kDa products were considered to be by-products that reflect intermediate conformations of the S protein, although the importance of cleavage at the S2= site was reported for coronavirus S proteins (20, 30) .",

However, no major differences in the HR region were observed. Although structural analysis using cryoEM is excellent for detecting stable protein structures, unstable structures such as the HR2 motifs in the S2 subunit cannot be analyzed using this technique, even if a large number of protein particles are captured; population-based biochemical analysis is needed to capture features of unstable proteins. Here, we predicted the dynamic rearrangements of S2 subunits underpinning the transition from pre-to postfusion structures based on Western blot analysis of the 67-and 69-kDa by-products that are induced following trypsin digestion of the S protein.",

These invariant MHV-2 S protein motifs are assumed not to change conformation and are displayed as a fixed globule represented by a gray column in Fig. 11 .

            "text": "In the present and previous studies, we observed eight features related to conformational changes that occur in the flexible regions of the S2 subunit. The first four features are induced by receptor binding. (i) During the first step, the S protein binds to the target membrane, as demonstrated by liposome-binding assays in a previous study (26) and negative-stain EM in this study (Fig. 10Dii) . Because the FP region is located close to \u242448, at least one \u242448 per trimer must be dissociated from \u242447 in invariant motifs for the FP region to be free. It is important to remember that the exact location of the FP region of coronavirus S protein remains controversial. The FP region (residues 867 to 949) immediately follows an S2= cleavage site (40) , and another possible FP region (pFP; residues 967 to 983) is adjacent to the region upstream of HR1 (Fig.  4) , as reported previously (41, 42) . (ii) The metastable form of the S protein trimer is converted to a stable trimer (Fig. 6A, VHCR, lane 3) , for which the dissociation temperature was increased from 25 to 60\u00b0C (Fig. 9C) . During this stage, the movement of HR1 to form a trimeric \u2423-helical coiled-coil on the distal side of the viral membrane is restricted because the S2 subunit is still covered by the S1 subunit in the uncleaved S protein (Fig. 10Aii) . Therefore, regions at \u242329 and \u242330 (the central helix) are only capable of interacting within the trimer (Fig. 4B ). This is consistent with a previous study in which the tightly packed central helix in the S2 subunit was detected by cryoEM after the receptor-binding step (4, 6) . (iii) The 106 amino acids of the connector region (residues 1155 to 1260, Fig. 4A ), including the 10G epitope and disulfide bond at positions 1169 and 1214, presumably form a folded structure because the 10G epitope in the trimer was undetectable in the native blot (Fig. 6A, 10G, lane 3) and was resistant to trypsin even in the presence of HR2-mimicking peptide (Fig. 8A) . Reduction of the gap between the S protein globule and the viral membrane (\u03f3200 \u00c5) in EM images ( Fig. 10Bii and Cii) may reflect a folded C-terminal side of the S2 subunit. In addition, the 10G region is likely fixed near helix \u242329 at the top of the S2 trimer to allow 6HB assembly in the following step (11) . These observations indicate that, in the S protein structure appearing after the receptor-binding step, the core of the connector leash is packed into the groove of the invariant motif (Fig. 11Aii, purple lines) , as seen in the postfusion structure (11) . (iv) The HR1/HR2 motif forms the packed-hairpin structure observed as the 67-kDa subunit after trypsin treatment that is unable to interact with HR2-mimicking peptide (Fig. 8A, lane 13, and Fig. 8G, lane 2) . Based on the steric configuration of the postfusion structure, HR1 of one S2 subunit must be packed with HR2 of another S2 subunit in the trimer to form a hairpin structure (11) . In addition, unpacked HR1, observed as the 69-kDa band that was degraded following treatment with HR2-mimicking peptide and trypsin (Fig. 8G, lane 2) , also appeared in this step. Interestingly, both 69-and 67-kDa subunits were present in the trimer, as revealed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 5Cb) , suggesting that a subset of S2 subunits form a heterogeneous trimer constructed from two different conformational states. We predict that the trimer includes at least one packed HR1/HR2 motif and extends at least one unpacked HR1 motif toward the target membrane to expose the FP region, and the S2 subunit is covered by the S1 subunit in the uncleaved S protein (Fig. 11Aii) . These features suggest that the S protein cannot form the typical homotrimeric prehairpin structure predicted in the current model of class I viral fusion protein assembly (Fig.  11B ). The next four features of the conformational changes are induced by trypsin treatment, during which obscure-shaped S proteins were observed by EM (Fig. 10Biii) .",

This conformation presumably facilitates formation of an asymmetric trimer. In principle, the class I viral fusion protein trimer must break its rotational symmetry during activation to overcome the steric hindrance within the three fusion protein subunits (43, 44) . When the different conformational states of the HR1/HR2 motif assemble in the trimer, the axis of the trimer is presumably tilted against the viral membrane (Fig. 11Avii) , resulting in the breaking of rotational symmetry. This is followed by formation of 6HB and membrane fusion. Flexibility at the juxtamembrane region and the tilted orientation against the viral membrane required for membrane fusion were recently reported by a study examining influenza HA in detergent micelles analyzed by cryoEM (45) . We anticipate that the mechanism suggested by Western blot analysis here will be confirmed by other approaches such as high-resolution cryoEM and/or in silico simulation.",

S protein activated by receptor and trypsin was deglycosylated using a deglycosylation enzyme mix. Nonrelevant lanes on the same blot were sliced out in Adobe Photoshop to align the lanes shown.
