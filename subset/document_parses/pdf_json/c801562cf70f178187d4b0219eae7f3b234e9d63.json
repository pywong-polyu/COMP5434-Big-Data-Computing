This IFN-induced ADP-ribosylation is dependent on the PARP9/DTX3L heterodimer, but surprisingly the expression of Nsp3 macrodomain or PARP9/DTX3L deletion do not impair STAT1 phosphorylation or the induction of IFN-responsive genes. Our results suggest that PARP9/DTX3L-dependent ADP-ribosylation is a downstream effector of the host IFN response and that the cellular function of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 macrodomain is to hydrolyse this end product of IFN signalling, and not to suppress the IFN response itself.",

In these experiments, we observed that the N40A mutant was expressed at lower levels than the WT macrodomain (Sup.

As expected, IFN\u03b3-induced ADP-ribosylation was indistinguishable between empty vector controls and either of the uninduced cells (Fig. 2D ). In agreement with the results above, doxycyclineinduced expression of the WT macrodomain reduced ADP-ribosylation, which was once again restored by the N40A mutation (Fig. 2D ). As before, the cells used in this analysis were gated to ensure similar expression levels between WT and N40A mutant macrodomain, with no effect on the result (Sup. Fig.2F -G).

For this, we performed a structure-based virtual screen of a library of 6364 compounds that have been approved for human use by any regulatory agency in the world, against the deposited crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 macrodomain bound to ADP-ribose (PDB 6W02) ( Fig. 3A and methods) . Of the final list of 79 compounds of interest, 69 were sourced and tested in biochemical and cellular assays (Supplementary Table 1 ). Using thermal shift assays, which measure thermal stabilization of a protein upon ligand binding, we observed that, in contrast to the substantial shift in thermal stability of the Nsp3 macrodomain induced by the ADP-ribose positive control , none of the 69 test compounds showed any evidence of binding to the recombinant macrodomain (Fig. 3B) . Similar results were obtained in cellular assays, in which none of the compounds substantially restored IFN-induced ADP-ribosylation levels in macrodomain-expressing cells (Fig. 3C) , and the slight effect of atorvastatin observed in the cellular screen was not confirmed in follow-up experiments (Sup.

Fig. 4B -C) and decided to test whether IFN-induced ADPribosylation was altered in these cells. As with A549 cells, IFN\u03b3 treatment induced detectable ADPribosylation in RPE1 retinal pigment epithelial cells, confirming that this response is not specific to A549 cells (Fig.4C) . Surprisingly however, PARP9 KO and particularly DTX3L KO cells displayed severely reduced IFN\u03b3-induced ADP-ribosylation compared to controls (Fig. 4C , Sup. Fig. 4D ). To determine if this was indirectly caused by an effect of PARP9 or DTX3L knockout on IFN signalling itself, we quantified STAT1-Y701 phosphorylation levels in response to IFN\u03b3 treatment in these cells, which revealed that PARP9 KO or DTX3L KO had no appreciable effect on STAT1 phosphorylation ( Fig. 4D ). To ascertain if the reduced ADP-ribosylation in PARP9 KO or DTX3L KO cells may be caused by a defect in IFN signalling downstream of STAT1 phosphorylation, we performed RT-qPCR to assess the transcriptional induction of four IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)-OAS1, IRF1, ISG15 and Mx1 (Fujita et al, 1989; Haller et al, 1979; Reich et al, 1987; Shulman & Revel, 1980 )-after treatment with either IFN\u03b3 or poly(I:C) (Fig. 4E ). As expected, strong transcriptional induction of these ISGs was observed in RPE1 cells after IFN\u03b3 or poly(I:C) treatment, but knockout of PARP9 or DTX3L did not affect the induction of any of these genes under any of the conditions tested (Fig. 4E ).",

Furthermore, expression of the Nsp3 macrodomain had no effect on the transcriptional induction of four ISGs in response to either IFN\u03b3 or poly(I:C) treatment (Fig. 5B ). In agreement with this, macrodomain expression also did not impair the induction of PARP9 or DTX3L protein observed in response to IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03b3 or poly(I:C) treatment ( Fig.5C ). Therefore, these data indicate that the Nsp3 macrodomain does not affect the host IFN signalling cascade or the induction of interferon-stimulated genes, but is instead involved in suppressing downstream biological processes triggered by IFN-induced ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 6 ).",

Importantly, we identified that the PARP9/DTX3L heterodimer, whose expression is IFN-stimulated ( Fig. 5C ), is absolutely necessary for this ADP-ribosylation, as the signal was lost upon knockout of either of these genes (Fig. 4) . Interestingly, PARP9 and DTX3L expression is also induced in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as long as viral load is high enough to induce an IFN response (Blanco-Melo et al, 2020) . In agreement with our results, PARP9/DTX3L induction under these conditions is completely prevented by treatment with a JAK kinase inhibitor (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) . While it is tempting to speculate that PARP9/DTX3L directly catalyse the formation of the IFN-induced ADP-ribose signal we detected, we cannot rule out a role of these proteins in a putative signalling cascade that culminates in ADP-ribosylation by another PARP.",

These data are surprising, considering previous reports showing that PARP9 and DTX3L overexpression increases ISG induction in response to IFN signalling in human fibrosarcoma cells (Zhang et al., 2015) and that PARP9 silencing reduces IFN\u03b3induced STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG induction in macrophages (Iwata et al, 2016) . While further studies are clearly required to clarify the role of PARP9 and DTX3L in the IFN response, we speculate that differences in genetic manipulation of PARP9/DTX3L levels (overexpression, RNA interference or CRISPR/Cas9 KO) or cell types (fibrosarcoma, macrophage or retinal pigment epithelia) could account for these differences.",

This was again surprising, since macrodomain mutation in a mouse coronavirus model (mouse hepatitis virus-MHV) was previously shown to cause an increase in IFN production by virus-infected murine macrophages (Grunewald et al., 2019) . In this MHV model, the macrodomain was proposed to mainly counteract PARP14 activity (Grunewald et al., 2019) , which is thought to act upstream of the production of type I IFN by virus-infected cells (Caprara et al, 2018) .

For most experiments, 6x6 adjacent fields of view were acquired per sample using automated autofocus and image acquisition settings. Images were analysed using StrataQuest software (TissueGnostics). For phospho-STAT1 quantification, individual nuclei were detected in the DAPI channel and the mean intensity of phospho-STAT1 signal per nucleus quantified for thousands of cells per sample. For ADP-ribose quantification, individual nuclei were detected in the DAPI channel and the approximate cell boundaries determined by growing outwards from the nuclear area for a fixed 30 microns, until neighbouring areas touched each other or until the ADP ribose signal reached background levels. Peaks of ADP-ribose signal intensity within this cellular mask (excluding the nucleus) were detected as \"dots\" and the total fluorescence signal contained in all dots per cell was quantified for thousands of cells per sample. In both cases, the fluorescence intensities of all cells within a sample were averaged and this value normalized to the average intensity of the IFN\u03b3-treated control sample for each biological replicate experiment (Sup. Fig. 1 ).",

Representative image of the same cells as in 2, showing the ADP-ribose signal (grey) and the ring mask area in which ADP-ribose signal was quantified. Inner red circle is based on nuclei detection in the DAPI channel, outer red limit is either grown by 30 microns outwards from the nucleus (blue arrow), until neighbouring areas touch each other (yellow arrow) or until ADP-ribose signal reached background values (green arrow).4. Scatterplots of DAPI area x Total DAPI intensity (right) or DAPI area x DAPI compactness (a measure of \"roundness\" of the nucleus) (left) for all nuclei detected in image 1. Each dot represents one nucleus, with clustering of nuclei represented by colour changes. Only nuclei within the shown gates were taken forward for quantification, as outliers were either incompletely acquired or not properly detected.",
