Our results indicate that face coverings show consistent efficacy at blocking respiratory droplets and thus provide an opportunity to moderate social distancing policies.

These droplets are either inhaled by a recipient, deposited on the recipient's mouth or conjunctiva, or deposited on a surface (thereby generating a fomite) and then mechanically transmitted through physical contact [1] . Droplet diameter varies according to the mode of exhalation (e.g. quiet breathing versus coughing) but ranges from approximately 100 nm to 1 mm [2, 3] . Intuitively, larger droplets potentially contain more virus, but the infectivity of viruses may vary between droplet size classes due to the influence of drying, making it extraordinarily difficult to determine the dominant mode of transmission [4] . Evidence indicates that transmission occurs both through the smallest droplets [5, 6] , known as an aerosol, as well as the direct deposition on the recipient's mouth, nose or conjunctiva of the largest droplets [7, 8] . This paper focuses on the effect of face coverings in mitigating the dispersion of the largest droplets.",

Liquid and airflows were connected to a purpose-built droplet generation system fitted inside an anatomically realistic, adult, medical simulation manikin's mouth (Resusci Anne QCPR) that creates controllable droplet sizes. Using shadow imaging (electronic supplementary material), we estimated that the manikin ejected a continuous distribution of droplets ranging from less than 26 \u00b1 7 \u00b5m, which is the size of the smallest droplet we could measure and that remained airborne, and up to 590 \u00b1 7 \u00b5m. There is no agreement in the literature on the average droplet size distribution of humans while speaking and coughing [18] , but several measurements suggest that the median is of the order of 10 \u00b5m, and droplets of 500 \u00b5m occur at a frequency that is one or two orders of magnitude lower [19] . Hence the manikin's range includes the largest aerosol droplets and all droplets with ballistic trajectories ejected by humans.",

To quantify the data, we counted the number of particles crossing the lower edge of the field of view at positions 1 to 7, therefore extrapolated to have deposited on the table. Data were compiled from 100 images taken from six replicate runs, each with no face covering, with a surgical mask or with a single-layer face covering. We used a new mask for each repeat to account for potential variability in the masks. The absolute particle count was divided by the length of the lower edge of the field of view and by the total period of observation to provide the rate of deposition of particles along the centreline of the table. Tests modelling speaking without a mask showed an exponential decline in particle deposition rate with distance, with none reaching the 2 m mark (figure 1c), while the distribution peaked at 1 m and dropped more slowly for coughing (figure 1d). When the manikin was fitted with either surgical or handmade masks, not one droplet was found to fall through the lower edge of the fields of view in either speaking or coughing simulations. Therefore, both face masks were largely impermeable to droplets larger than 20-30 \u00b5m.",

We measured droplet deposition rate according to distance, presented as the number of particles divided by the sampling area and the duration of the experiment by counting the droplets every 5 and 15 cm from the manikin for speaking and coughing, respectively. Each experiment was performed six times with and without both types of face covering, using a new mask for each repeat. The numbers of surface-deposited droplets were consistent with the measurements of falling droplets ( figure 2a,b) . Once again, the presence of a face covering very effectively blocked droplet deposition. However, because we measured droplets on a larger area and longer duration (up to 20 min) than the flight tests, we could capture less frequent events. With both mask types, small numbers of droplets (up to seven) were seen at various distances from the manikin, but these values were four and five orders of magnitude lower than those observed without a mask for speaking and coughing, respectively. Hence, these represent events with a frequency of one in 10 000 and one in 100 000, respectively.",

We then reconstructed the spatial distribution of droplets with and without masks ( figure 2c,d) . Consistent with other means of measurement, both types of face covering were extremely effective at reducing the particle deposition rate. As with UV imaging of droplets deposited on white paper, this technique also allowed a long experimental duration (20 min) and thus the capture of statistically rare events.

As these droplets are likely to be the main driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission [7, 8, 12] , our data suggest that the wearing of masks can substantially reduce the probability of an infected person transmitting the virus. In this study, however, we focused only on the large respiratory droplets that land on a surface within a few seconds. According to the shadow imaging estimation of droplet size applied to the laser acquisition (electronic supplementary material, S4), these correspond to particles with diameters between 170 \u00b1 7 and 590 \u00b1 7 \u00b5m. Droplets as small as 26 \u00b1 7 \u00b5m were detected with the laser but excluded from the analysis due to their non-ballistic trajectory. Other studies such as Fischer et al. [17] , which focuses on in-flight droplets that include smaller droplets and aerosol, are likely to show a lower level of effectiveness depending on the fabric type. The aerosol is now widely accepted as a contributory route of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission [5] , and if this is later determined to be the main driver of infection, then our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of face coverings.",

Assuming that SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission through aerosol is small compared to through large droplets, these results suggest that physical distancing can be reduced with the use of face coverings.
