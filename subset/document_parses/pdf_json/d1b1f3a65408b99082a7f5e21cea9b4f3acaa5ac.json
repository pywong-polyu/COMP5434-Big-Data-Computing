At present, the prognosis of the disease is poor and there is a lack of effective treatments. Therefore, it is urgent to explore its pathogenesis and treatment methods. Method. We downloaded a set of expression profile data from GSE75097 related to OSAS based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and selected the representative differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the sample of the GSE75097 dataset. WGCNA was used to find genes related to OSAS and obtain coexpression modules. The Gene Ontology (GO) function and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were used to analyze genes from key modules. Finally, Cytoscape software was used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and analyze the hub genes. Result. We obtained a total of 7565 DEGs. Through WGCNA, we got four coexpression modules and the modules most related to OSAS were green-yellow, magenta, purple, and turquoise, and we screened out eight hub genes (DDX46, RNF115, COPA, FBXO4, PA2G4, NHP2L1, CDC20, and PCNA). GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the key modules were mainly enriched in tRNA modification, nucleobase metabolic process, DNA ligation, regulation of cellular component movement, basal transcription factors, Huntington disease, and vitamin digestion and absorption. Conclusion. These pathways and hub genes can facilitate understanding the molecular mechanism of OSAS and provide a meaningful reference for finding biological targets of OSAS treatment.",

The disease often occurs in the obese and the elderly, and it is also common in children with sleep-disordered breathing [3] . It is worth noting that OSAS can also affect the patient's cardiovascular system, respiratory system, cerebrovascular, central nervous system, endocrine, sexual function, kidney, blood system, and digestive system and even threaten life [4] . Currently, adenoid and tonsillectomy are the main treatments for most children with OSAS [5] .

The so-called epigenetics refers to heritable phenotypic changes without those in DNA sequence [16] . In recent years, hypoxia-mediated epigenetic regulation has had a major function in the mechanism of OSAS [17] . Under chronic intermittent hypoxiareoxygenation circumstances, the epigenetic process influences the adaptive potential and phenotypic variability, which contributes to the development of numerous deleterious effects of OSAS [18, 19] .",

It includes modulating tRNA bases to regulate translation or cytosine methylation and demethylation in the promoter region to silence and reactivate genes. Chen et al. speculated that hypomethylation of the six gene promoter regions implicated in the NPR2 and SP140 pathways may play a crucial role in the establishment of the OSAS phenotype of excessive daytime sleepiness [20] . Nevertheless, chronic IHR may trigger these DNA methylation changes, leading to frequent hypoxia and lethargy phenotypes in OSAS [21] . In the KEGG pathway analysis, the enrichment results in the green-yellow module are not highly correlated with OSAS. In the magenta module and the purple module, reports are showing the roles of cardiac muscle contraction, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and folate in breathing. Apnea during dynamic exercise activates the human muscle metabolism reflex [22] . During apnea, the decrease in O 2 delivery to the working muscles triggers the muscle metabolic reflex. The activation of the muscle metabolic reflex is one of the potential mechanisms of the blood pressure response induced by significant apnea [23] . The study by Kuo et al. showed that maximum expiratory apnea increased the kinetic energy of the heart which was calculated from shock cardiography BCG and seismocardiography SCG, as well as sympathetic nerve activity [24] . Therefore, cardiac contraction is closely related to apnea.",

RNF115 induces a significant arrest of the G1 phase of LAC cells to achieve the function of inhibiting cell viability in vitro, further reducing tumor proliferation in xenograft models. These findings suggest that RNF115 might be a novel predictive biomarker and that the RNF115-p53 axis could be a target for LAC therapy. The cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA) is a modified Guedel-type oral airway with a cuff on the end. Propofol and sevoflurane are equally effective in promoting the placement of COPA [31] . However, propofol usually causes apnea, which is complicated by the poor sealing effect of COPA on the airway. At the same time, sevoflurane allows spontaneous breathing to continue and provides sufficient pharynx seal immediately after that COPA is placed, so it may be advantageous when apnea is not required.
