            "text": "Background As the volume of scientific publications increases, the rate of retraction of published papers is also likely to increase. In the present study, we report the characteristics of retracted papers from clinical neurosurgery and allied clinical and basic science specialties. Methods Retracted papers were identified using two separate search strategies on PubMed. Attributes of the retracted papers were collected from PubMed and the Retraction Watch database. The reasons for retraction were analyzed. The factors that correlated with time to retraction were identified. Detailed citation analysis for the retracted papers was performed. The retraction rates for neurosurgery journals were computed. Results A total of 191 retractions were identified; 55% pertained to clinical neurosurgery. The most common reasons for retraction were plagiarism, duplication, and compromised peer review. The countries associated with the highest number of retractions were China, USA, and Japan. The full text of the retraction notice was not available for 11% of the papers. A median of 50% of all citations received by the papers occurred after retraction. The factors that correlated with a longer time to retraction included basic science category, the number of collaborating departments, and the H-index of the journal. The overall rate of retractions in neurosurgery journals was 0.037%. Conclusions The retraction notice needs to be freely available on all search engines. Plagiarism checks and reference checks prior to publication of papers (to ensure no retracted papers have been cited) must be mandatory. Mandatory data deposition would help overcome issues with data and results.",

The reasons for the retraction of published papers and the rates of retraction vary across scientific disciplines. Data fabrication/falsification, plagiarism, research misconduct, and errors in the articles have been identified to be common reasons for retraction [12, 16, 17] . In open-access journals, one of the most common reasons for retraction is a compromised peer review process [16] . Very often, limited information regarding the reasons for retraction is available, and thus, it becomes difficult to distinguish retractions due to genuine errors from those due to misconduct [17] . The rate of retraction in a specialty can act as an indirect indicator of the efficacy of the institutional and post-publication checkpoints in addressing errors and fraud in that specialty. In clinical disciplines, these mechanisms are of particular importance, since published results often lead to changes in clinical practice and thus directly impact patient safety and outcomes.",

The majority of the retracted papers had been published in HMJ (n = 126, 66%). Similarly, the majority of the articles were published in journals that were of the FP model (n = 130, 68.1%). The rate of retractions due to compromised peer review was not different between the OAJ and HMJ or between the PP and FP journals. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the rate of papers withdrawn due to misconduct between the OAJ and HMJ or between the PP and FP journals ( Table 5) . Twenty-two journals were identified to exclusively publish papers of relevance to neurosurgery, and were categorized as \"pure\" neurosurgery journals ( Table 6 ). The journal Cureus was included even though it is a multi-specialty journal, since it has a separate channel for neurosurgery and the number of papers pertaining to neurosurgery could easily be identified. Thus, the retraction rate was computed for these 23 journals. The rates of retraction ranged from 0.013 (European Spine Journal) to 0.25% (Cureus). The median rate of retractions was 0.037% (IQR 0.67). Six journals had a retraction rate lower than the average computed rate for biomedical sciences, which was 0.02% in 2012 [9] .

            "text": "Formal mechanisms to detect malpractice and to prevent compromised data from being published are thus of great importance. The first checkpoint in the publication process is the editorial review, where many compromised manuscripts are rejected even prior to peer review and before plagiarism checks are carried out. However, this study found that despite the existence of many plagiarism-check software services, plagiarism remains one of the most common reasons for retraction of neurosurgical articles, even for those published after 2010. This could imply that several \"low-impact\" journals do not routinely use such services, and this is a lacuna that requires to be addressed. The next checkpoint in the publication cycle is the peer review process. However, this is far from being foolproof. A compromised peer review process was responsible for 12.6% of all the retractions analyzed in this study and for 16.3% of the retractions that occurred after 2010. The rates of retractions due to compromised peer review did not vary between HMJ and OAJ or PP and FP model neurosurgical journals. It is notable thereore, that even the \"standard\" HMJs had a significant incidence of compromised peer review. Compromised or inadequate peer review processes can lead to disastrous consequences. Possibly, the most infamous example of the global and lasting impact of compromised data published in a \"high-impact\" journal is the paper postulating a link between vaccines and autism in children [23] . Similarly, several high-profile retractions have occurred during the ongoing COVID pandemic as well [14, 15] . The Lancet retracted a paper that wrongly raised concerns about the safety of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19 [15] . On the same day, the New England Journal of Medicine retracted a paper that falsely concluded that angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensinreceptor blockers (ARBs) were safe in patients with Covid-19 [14] . Although the papers were retracted relatively early, the fallout had already occurred. Based on the findings reported in these papers, the World Health Organization prematurely suspended the hydroxychloroquine arm of the SOLIDARITY trial over safety concerns. This arm of the trial was restarted once the papers were retracted, but there was unnecessary delay in the completion of the trial. The urgent need for information regarding a novel pathogen, and thus the pressure to publish any paper related to the ongoing pandemic, has possibly led to compromised peer review processes across journals. The number of retracted publications related to COVID now stands at 32 [1] .",

Postpublication review also led to the retraction of a paper that found that cloth masks were as efficacious as surgical masks in preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus from the cough droplets of infected individuals [4] . Dissemination of wrong data from this paper could have had disastrous consequences for healthcare workers across the world.

For instance, the present study found that the neurosurgery channel of the journal Cureus, which largely relies on post-publication peer review for quality control, had the highest rate of retraction among neurosurgical journals (0.25%). Thus, a combination of effective editorial-, peerand post-publication-review mechanisms is required for optimum quality control.",

Basic science and allied specialty papers, as well as multi-department collaborative studies, had a longer time to retraction. Journals with a higher H-index took longer to retract compromised papers. This is of concern, since the \"high-impact\" journals are also the ones from which articles are heavily referenced and cited. Thus, a longer time to retraction for papers in these journals would lead to wide dissemination of false data. The time to retraction was much higher when the reason for retraction was misconduct (22.33 months) than when papers were retracted due to genuine errors (7.13 months).",

A median of 50% of citations to retracted neurosurgery papers occurred after they were retracted. Moreover, papers that reported level 1 evidence and are more likely to change clinical practice received more postretraction citations than other papers. The issue of compromised information continuing to be cited and disseminated after retraction is of concern [13] . For instance, despite the well-publicized retraction of the compromised Wakefield vaccine-autism paper in 2010, a study in 2019 found that 8.2% of papers that had cited the retracted paper reported attempts to replicate the discredited findings. Of equal importance is the fact that 28.2% of the papers that were published after 2010 and that had cited the retracted paper did not mention the retraction in relation to the citation [19] . Thus, it is imperative to reduce the time to retraction and expeditiously complete independent reviews once a paper has been flagged. It is also essential to prominently display the retracted status of the paper in all search engines and reference management software.",

The reasons for retraction varied by country. China, the United States, Germany, and Japan accounted for the majority of retractions because of fraud or suspected fraud, whereas the USA, Japan, China, and India accounted for most cases of plagiarism [9] . In countries such as China and India, there could be enormous institutional pressure to publish so as to demonstrate returns on the investment in science as well as for career advancement [5, 10, 18] . Similar pressures could exist in countries such as the USA and Japan, owing to a competition for grants and tenured positions.",

In a study of 134 retraction notices issued on the open-access platform BioMed Central, the majority were due to misconduct (76%). This included compromised peer review (33%), plagiarism (16%), and data falsification/fabrication (7%). \"Honest\" errors accounted for only 13% of the total [16] . In an analysis of the reasons for retraction in human studies overall, misconduct (51%), errors (14.4%), and duplication (12.6%) accounted for the highest number [12] . A similar trend was seen in anesthesiology where misconduct (specifically fraud or data fabrication) accounted for nearly 50% of all retractions [17] . This pattern was replicated across surgical specialties as well; plagiarism, data falsification, and duplication were the most common reasons for retraction in surgery, orthopedics, and obstetrics and gynecology [6, 11, 21] . In congruence with published data, the present study found that plagiarism (18.59%), duplication of articles (14.59%), and compromised peer review (12.56%) were the most common reasons for retraction of neurosurgical papers. When categorized, genuine errors accounted only for 15% of the retracted neurosurgery papers, whereas misconduct accounted for 67.6% of all retractions. Despite the wide availability of plagiarism and reference-check software, the continued high incidence of retractions due to plagiarism could only imply that these resources are not universally employed.",
