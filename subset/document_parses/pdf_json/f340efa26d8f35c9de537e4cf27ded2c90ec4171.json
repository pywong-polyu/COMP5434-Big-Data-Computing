While the base filtration efficiency of a material is of primary importance when a perfect seal is possible, ideal fit is not likely to be achieved by the average person preparing to enter a public space or even a healthcare worker without fit-testing before each shift. Our findings suggest that parameters including permeability and pliability can play a strong role in the filtration efficiency of a mask fabricated with various filter media, and that the filtration efficiency of loosely fitting masks/respirators against ultrafine particulates can drop by more than 60% when worn compared to the ideal filtration efficiency of the base material. Further, a test method using SARS-CoV-2 virion-sized silica nanoaerosols is demonstrated to assess the filtration efficiency against nanoparticulates that follow air currents associated with mask leakage.",

            "text": "There is a critical knowledge gap between understanding the dependencies on the relationship between filter material properties and mask fit. Indeed, one of the benchmark testing standards, ASTM F2299:2017 \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Initial Efficiency of Materials Used in Medical Face Masks to Penetration by Particulates Using Latex Spheres\", calls out many of these limitations, including that it \"does not assess the overall effectiveness of medical face masks in preventing the inward leakage of harmful particles\". 11 This shortcoming has been demonstrated in the testing of medical masks before; 12 while the base material used to make common medical masks may demonstrate strong filtration efficiency according to established methods, the masks themselves often fail a basic quantitative fit test due to poor fit and resulting leakage. 13 A multitude of experts have proclaimed that airborne transmission of COVID-19 is a major and even primary source of the spread of the virus. 14,15 Use of face masks in public is especially critical to the reduction of virion exhalation by carriers of the virus; face masks significantly reduce the travel distance and concentration of virus-carrying particulates exhaled from the nose and mouth of COVID-19-positive individuals. 1, 3 It is the opinion of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and multiple research teams that the wearing of masks in public should be strongly encouraged due to the scientific evidence that mask usage reduces transmission from virus carrying individuals, whether they are symptomatic, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic. 1, 3, 8, 16 Recent evidence has shown, for instance, when two Missouri hair salon employees and their customers were wearing masks and other guidelines were followed, that symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 from the employees to the customers was avoided when precautions were taken. 17 Therefore, wearing masks to protect others continues to be a main focus of CDC recommendations, i.e., \"the cloth face cover is meant to protect other people\". 18 The present work seeks to address concerns that publication of only the ideal filtration efficiency of materials in perfectly sealed settings can give mask wearers a false sense of security when venturing into areas of high exposure risk; of specific concern are healthcare workers and persons known to be atrisk due to age or pre-existing conditions. While a material or combination of materials may reportedly offer high filtration efficiency in an ideal, well-sealed test scenario, masks made from or combined with these materials may not provide an equivalent level of protection when worn. Persons who must enter areas presenting high risk of infection should be careful to wear respirators that are properly fitted and rated for filtration efficiency according to fitted filtration efficiency data where possible, and fit testing should be performed in professional settings before shifts begin.",

Nanoaerosols regularly produced the average particle concentrations and size distribution shown in Figure 1 . Summarily, a nanoaerosol with median diameter of around 40 nm was generated by tightly controlling the pressure and flow rate of nitrogen gas over tetraethyl orthosilicate before passing it through a tube furnace at 850\u00b0C and out through a diffuser for ejection of the aerosol inside a 1.36 m 3 electropolished stainless steel enclosure built to an ANSI standard 24 with total particle concentrations measuring around 1000000 particles/cm 3 .

These masks/respirators were fitted to the headform consistently using physical markers to ensure equivalent fit across tested materials, with qualitative visual and tactile inspection to ensure that no obvious gaps or crevices were present. This method was followed in lieu of quantitative fit testing in keeping with resources available to a typical user of a homemade face mask (namely, providing best fit possible by touch and sight) in order to capture filtration efficiency of masks in a real-use scenario. Further, quantitative fit testing (i.e., using TSI Portacount) cannot differentiate between particles that penetrate the filter media versus particles that leak through areas of poor fit; fit factor is quantified as the ratio of measured particulate concentration outside versus inside the mask or respirator, where any particulates measured inside the mask are assumed to have arrived due to leakage. As many of the tested mask materials do not provide highly efficient particulate filtration, quantitative fit testing by existing methods Nano Letters pubs.acs.org/NanoLett Letter is not appropriate. Instead, removal and reattachment of the masks between samplings was conducted to capture the statistical variance associated with this necessarily qualitative method, providing a quantitative measure of repeatability. Nanoaerosol measurements were made using a Nanoscan 3910 scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS; TSI, Inc.), sampling 0.5 LPM. Detailed measurements were taken at particle sizes of 60 and 125 nm at a rate of 1 per second for a total of 180 s per sample, with samples taken in triplicate for a total of at least 540 measurements per filter media tested. These two particle sizes were chosen to represent the minimum and average reported SARS-CoV-2 virion size, respectively. 19 The experimental configuration for ideal base filtration testing is illustrated in Figure 2 (left). The SiO 2 challenge aerosol described previously was generated in an electropolished steel environmental chamber designed according to the specifications of ANSI/CAN/UL 2904, measuring 4\u2032 \u00d7 3\u2032 \u00d7 3\u2032 with cleanroom air (background total particulate concentration <10 particles/cm 3 ) injected at a rate sufficient to induce one full chamber air exchange per hour. Ports at the top of the chamber allowed for intake of the challenge aerosol, which passed through the sealed 37 mm cartridge on its way to the characterization equipment. A blank 37 mm cartridge was inserted for measurement of unfiltered aerosol concentration immediately before the measurement of every filter media sample, which formed the basis for filtration efficiency calculations. By this method, ideal filtration efficiency of various media using methods similar to those reported previously 2,7,26 was determined.",

If a material is relatively impermeable, airflows (and the aerosols they carry) may be more likely to follow contours around the mask into leaks and other areas of low resistance rather than seek to penetrate the filter material; cascade impactors take advantage of similar principles of differential inertia in order to segregate particulates by size. 27 More pliable materials were observed to qualitatively fit and fill the cotton mask more effectively, allowing for a closer fit to the face, reducing opportunities for leaks. Illustratively, while the FTR467 ULPA material exhibited the best base filtration efficiency of all measured materials (better than 99.8%), it provided the worst protection as an insert, offering no additional protection over the unfilled cotton mask; it was also the least permeable and least pliable material tested. Similarly, while a double layer of N95 material provided excellent filtration efficiency in base measurements while maintaining adequate permeability, its relative stiffness appears to have limited its efficacy as a cotton mask insert, though other unidentified factors may have also contributed. The highest performing mask insert materials (the surgical wrap and ShopVac materials) exhibited a combination of strong base filtration efficiency and air permeability and were also among the most qualitatively pliable of the tested materials. There are likely other factors such as electrostatic interactions at play that were not quantified during these experiments. These results suggest that a combination of pliability and permeability should be considered alongside suspected or measured filtration efficiency when choosing a material for homemade mask or mask insert.",

Two outcomes are desired; first, while wearing a homemade mask can and does significantly reduce virion-sized particulate exposure (as-worn filtration efficiencies of 15\u221240% are reported here), masks of this style cannot provide the level of protection measured and more commonly reported in ideal-fit scenarios. Users should, therefore, exercise caution when entering areas of high exposure risk and consider using PPE known to create a better sealed fit, such as a half-or full-face respirator, when contact with infected persons is inevitable, and perform quantitative fit testing before shifts where possible. These implications also hold true for mask and respirator usage in other activities (such as construction), as fit affects the ability of the mask or respirator to protect the wearer against ultrafine particulates represented by the SiO 2 nanoaerosol used in this study.",

Measured pressure drops across filter media were largely similar; the FTR467 ULPA material exhibited a pressure drop that would likely preclude use in a passive filtration mask, as it is designed for use in pleated, high surface area filter cartridges for powered applications. Figure 5 . When inserted into a 2-layer cotton mask, all filter materials exhibited a significant drop in filtration efficiency compared to the measured base filtration efficiency. The 3M 8511 and KN95 respirators as well as the medical and dust masks were all tested asreceived in mask form, whereas the remainder were tested through insertion between the two layers of the cotton mask. A KN95 respirator that was sealed to the headform before testing with thermoplastic adhesive (i.e. to demonstrate a leak-free fit) provided filtration efficiency very near to its base filtration efficiency, proving that the cause of efficiency reductions was related primarily to fit quality. testing; we suspect the greatest source of leakage remains around the bridge of the nose.
