SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly in our country as it did in other countries [1] . According to reports from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), children constitute only about 2% of infected people [1, 2] . Despite all the uncertainties about the epidemiology and clinical course of the disease in children, the first reports indicated a favorable clinical course and prognosis for affected children [3] [4] [5] . However, recent studies show that SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe disease requiring intensive care in a small percentage of infected children [1, 6] . As the pandemic continued, another severe clinical situation emerged. In April, 2020, a critical illness associated with hyper-inflammation syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined in children and adolescents [7] . Subsequently, this was reported to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and termed 'multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children' (MIS-C) [8, 9] .",

Because of this clinical diversity, the CDC has proposed the diagnostic criteria for MIS-C [11] : age < 21 years, persistence of fever, involvement of at least two organ systems, elevated inflammatory biomarkers, laboratory or epidemiologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and exclusion of other clinical etiologies. Among all clinical presenting symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms are not only the most frequently seen in MIS-C but also very commonly seen as the presentation of COVID-19 disease [6, 9, 10] . This frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms may cause diagnostic challenges, such as delayed diagnosis even after surgery for acute abdomen [9, 12, 13] . Moreover, the abdominal pain may mimic appendicitis, gastroenteritis, or inflammatory bowel disease, causing more diagnostic challenges [12] [13] [14] . Therefore, careful evaluation of abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms has become more important in children when we consider today's conditions. Based on this issue, we conducted a retrospective analysis of children presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms during the disease course of COVID-19, with a subsequent diagnosis of MIS-C.",

The weight percentiles on admission were above the 75th percentile for five children and five children had co-morbidities; namely, familial Mediterranean fever, G6PD deficiency, ependymoma, and asthma (Table 1 ). An epidemiological review revealed that 12 children (80%) had a history of close contact with a confirmed COVID case, all being relatives in the last 1 month. All children were tested for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and all but two were found to be positive for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Table 1 summarizes the demographic features and presenting symptoms of the patients. All the children had experienced fever for at least 1 day prior to presentation and had signs of involvement of two or more systems. Table 2 lists the results of laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and all inflammatory markers. There were no pathologic findings on the abdominal X-rays of 13 patients, but an air-fluid level was seen in two patients, who were managed surgically. Abdominal ultrasound (USG) was performed for 12 patients, revealing terminal ileum wall thickening in 3 patients and duodenum wall thickening in 1 patient who was vomiting on admission. Abdominal USG also revealed pelvic abscess in two patients and inter-loop free fluid in two patients. Abdominal CT or MRI was performed for persistent abdominal pain and tenderness in nine patients. A diagnosis of appendicitis was made by abdominal MRI in two patients found to have a pelvic abscess on abdominal USG. Terminal ileal wallthickening and mucosal enhancement was found by abdominal CT/MRI in six patients, two of whom had not had prior abdominal USG, two had normal findings on abdominal USG, and two had thickened bowel wall and inter-loop free fluid on abdominal USG.",

He had been in close contact with a PCR (+) relative and his COVID-19 PCR test was found to be positive. During his hospitalization, abdominal tenderness developed, and a second abdominal CT scan revealed appendicitis. The patient underwent appendectomy, and his postoperative course was uneventful. The third patient presented to another medical center with abdominal pain and was hospitalized for suspected MIS-C. He was referred to our center, because the symptoms persisted, where abdominal MRI scans showed perforated appendicitis. After appendectomy, his fever recurred. His care-giver and he were tested and found to be positive for COVID-19 on postoperative day 4. He was managed accordingly and discharged uneventfully. The 12 patients managed non-surgically were all examined by pediatric surgeons. MIS-C was diagnosed in all, and none underwent surgical exploration. After exclusion of surgical pathology, all were managed with intravenous hydration without oral feeding for 2 days (range 1-3 days) and resumed oral intake after the abdominal tenderness had resolved. One patient continued to experience nausea and vomiting, which delayed oral intake by a day. Later he suffered pneumothorax and required tube thoracostomy insertion. He was followed up for 14 days after tube removal.",

Although statistical analysis was not possible because of the small number of cases in the surgical group, several differences were evident between the two groups. First, the duration of abdominal pain was longer in the surgically managed patients. Second, the absolute lymphocyte count was higher in surgically managed patients, whereas the levels of inflammatory markers were higher in the nonsurgically managed patients. Abdominal USG and CT/MRI seem to be descriptive in such cases. Finally, although the duration of hospitalization varied, follow-up was longer for the surgically managed patients, probably because of the postoperative follow-up.",

However, a small number of children become critically ill approximately 2-3 weeks after exposure to COVID-19, even if they were asymptomatic at the time of exposure. This condition was explained by a post-infectious hyperinflammation syndrome secondary to COVID-19 infection; later called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) [7] [8] [9] . Although the clinical course is generally favorable, the gastrointestinal system is involved in 20% of COVID-19 cases and may be severe in children [6, 12] . Several reports from all over the world have identified gastrointestinal symptoms as the most common presentation of MIS-C, seen in 70% to 90% of cases [9, 10] . The gastrointestinal symptoms of MIS-C may be so severe that they are confused with acute surgical pathologies, or they may mimic a chronic bowel disease such as inflammatory bowel disease. This heterogeneity in presentation highlights the importance of every piece of knowledge about the various clinical presentations, so that this new clinical entity is managed appropriately. We conducted this study to analyze children with gastrointestinal complaints subsequently diagnosed as MIS-C as well as COVID-19. Now, we identify if any children presenting with abdominal pain have a history of COVID-19 infection or close contact with a COVID-19 positive person. This epidemiologic evaluation has become routine in our department even for patients who have only gastrointestinal symptoms. On the contrary, early consultation with the pediatric surgery department is considered for all children with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or MIS-C in our center.",

These three patients had a longer duration of abdominal pain, a higher lymphocyte count, and lower levels of inflammatory markers in contrast to the non-surgically managed cases. Malhotra A et al. compared the findings of patients with appendicitis and those with abdominal pain related to COVID-19 [15] . They found that the patients with appendicitis had more acute abdominal pain, higher neutrophils, and lower levels of inflammatory markers than those with COVID-19; consistent with our results. The small number of cases in the present series made statistical analysis impossible, so further comparative studies on more patients are needed to reach a firm conclusion.

The most likely mechanism is thought to be that angiotensin converts the enzyme 2 receptor (the entry site for the COVID-19 virus) at great density in the small intestine and colonic enterocytes [16] . This mechanism may also explain why obesity is a risk factor for critical illness in these patients [14] . Five of the patients in the present series were obese, and one needed mechanical ventilation and intensive care. The small intestine and colon involvement can also be detected with imaging techniques such as abdominal USG, BT, or MRI. The most prominent radiological findings are bowel-wall thickening, mucosal enhancement, and edema [9, 13, 14] . When a diagnosis cannot be made with abdominal USG, abdominal CT/MRI can be performed. We performed abdominal CT/MRI for nine of our patients, six of whom had no abdominal USG findings.",
