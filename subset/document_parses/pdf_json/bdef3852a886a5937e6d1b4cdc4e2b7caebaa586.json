Natural populations of Andrographis alata are dwindling due to destruction of natural habitat and over exploitation. Therefore, in vitro propagation of Andrographis alata was undertaken, and successful method is presented here. Results: Micropropagation of Andrographis alata was realized on MS nutrient medium augmented with BAP (10 \u03bcM), and multiple shoots were regenerated from nodal explants. Induction of roots was attained from shoots on \u00bc concentration of MS nutrient medium supplemented with IBA (1 \u03bcM). Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis showed that there is genetic fidelity in the regenerated plants. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic analysis of regenerated plants showed the presence of neoandrographolide, equivalent to that of mother plants. Conclusions: Successful in vitro regeneration of Andrographis alata is presented here, and it is quite useful for its mass multiplication. The micropropagated plants are useful for restoration of plants in nature and for utilization by the pharmaceutical industry for extraction of neoandrographolide.",

The injection volume was 20 \u03bcl. The temperature of the column was controlled at 25\u00b0C, and samples were detected using PD-M20A photo diode array detector. The neoandrographolide was identified by comparing retention time of samples with reliable standard chromatographic peaks at 205 nm, and neoandrographolide concentration was calculated using absorbance intensity (mAU) against standards.

Among the varied cytokinins applied to the MS medium, BAPcontaining medium was found suitable for regeneration of multiple shoots from nodal explants (Table 1) . Multiple shoot regeneration from nodal explants on cytokinin medium was also reported in other medicinal plants such as Artemisia nilagirica var. nilagirica [17] , Artemisia japonica [18] , Feronia limonia [19] , Spilanthes oleracea [20] , and Vitex trifolia [21] . Among various cytokinins used, BAP was found excellent for axillary shoot induction (Table 1) , and again of the several concentrations BAP tested, 10 \u03bcM BAP was superior in optimum axillary shoot induction (Table 1) . These results are in congruent with earlier reports of BAP being used as a potent cytokinin for induction of multiple shoots in Artemisia vulgaris and Puya berteroniana [22] [23] [24] . Further, shoot regeneration frequency depends on type and concentration of cytokinin used (Table 1) , such reports are already on record including Andrographis paniculata [25, 26] , Nothapodytes nimmoniana [27] , and Enicostema axillare [28] . Rooting of in vitro regenerated shoots is crucial for acclimatization of plants. Salt strength of medium and growth regulators supplemented to the medium is important factors which control the rooting of shoots. Auxins play a pivotal role in induction of adventitious root from in vitro regenerated shoots. Optimum root induction was realised on IBA-supplemented medium (1 \u03bcM; Fig. 1c ; Table 2 ). Similar results were recorded in Andrographis paniculata [25] , Artemisia nilagirica var. nilagirica [17] , and Artemisia japonica [18] wherein IBA was best for induction of roots from regenerated shoots. It was reported that higher salt strength of medium inhibits rooting of in vitro regenerated shoots and invariably roots develop callus along with roots [17] . In the current study, optimal percentage of rooting, number of roots, and root length were recorded on the medium supplemented with \u00bc strength MS nutrient medium Table 2 ). Similarly, reduced salt concentration of the culture medium was reported to be beneficial for root regeneration from shoots of Feronia limonia [21] and Cattleya [29] . Plant regenerated from axillary and apical buds are reported to possess genetic fidelity, whereas callusmediated regeneration may depict tendency for genetic variation [30] . In the present study, genetic fidelity of regenerated plants was assessed using molecular markers. RAPD and ISSR analysis results demonstrated the development of monomorphic bands with the mother and in vitro regenerated plants which depicts genetic fidelity (Fig. 2) . Such strategy adopting molecular technique for assessing genetic fidelity has been well documented in the literature [17, 20, 26] .",
