The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging countries to improve efforts to contain the disease and protect healthcare workers and notes that a solution calls for 'aggressive preparedness', all around the world [1, 2] . On 11 March 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic [2] . Healthcare systems around the world are operating at, or preparing to operate at, above usual capacity, and significant adjustments in surgical services will be required. It presents challenging choices about whether aesthetic surgical care can and should be delayed or reprioritized, with the immediate goal of minimizing exposure risk for frontline healthcare providers and vulnerable patients [2] . International healthcare systems have variable environments, with conditions differing significantly by locality [3, 4] . Critical decisions concerning the deployment of resources and the management of elective aesthetic surgical procedures should be made based on institutional policies and recommendations from local, national and international authorities, considering the availability of finite and essential resources [5, 6] .",

These societies must determine the topics to be addressed based on questions that are received from its members and others, as well as input from their leadership and clinical experts outside aesthetic surgery. For each topic, national and international aesthetic surgery society staff must work with clinical experts to develop guidance in an iterative, collaborative fashion. This guidance refers to and highlights, where possible, evidence published in the peer-reviewed literature as well as guidance issued by local, national and international health authorities and professional organizations. Once draft guidance is developed for the topic, it must be reviewed by society leadership, who approve all statements regarding patient care. Approved guidance is then posted online. The guidance is updated as new information emerges and all content is reviewed periodically in its entirety by national and international aesthetic surgery society staff to ensure consistency with rapidly changing guidance from other organizations and government agencies. The date of the last review/update must be on the online page.",
