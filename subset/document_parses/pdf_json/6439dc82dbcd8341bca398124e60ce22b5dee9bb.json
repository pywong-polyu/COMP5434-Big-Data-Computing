Despite high assay efficiencies (98% for E_Sarbeco and ~90% for orf1a), false positive amplification was observed for both targets in many samples, prompting the inclusion of assay-specific, dual-labeled probes purchased from IDT. False positive amplification was determined by melt curve/melt peak analysis performed for each SYBR-based assay. This analysis clearly showed a significant difference between the melting temperature of the standard (all dilutions were consistent) and melting temperature of the samples (Table S2) . Additionally, many samples, including some negative controls, had two uneven melt peaks with low fluorescence signals. Both instances demonstrated that amplification in samples was non-specific and unrelated to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. Furthermore, probe-based E_Sarbeco and orf1a qPCR assays did not produce amplification curves for all of the samples in question, confirming the melt curve analysis and false positive designations for the SYBR-based results. to use as a qPCR standard, otherwise assay efficiency and reported concentrations may be impacted (Hou et al., 2010) .",

The Cq values for high starting quantities of the IDT standard (10 6 -10 2 ) were shifted 3-4 Cqs later in comparison with the same starting quantities of the ATCC standard. In contrast, Cq values for low starting quantities of the IDT standard (10 1 -10 0 ) were less than the Cq values for the same concentrations of the ATCC standard, especially for the N1 target. This resulted in substantial overestimation of the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in actual samples. Furthermore, the overestimation was not consistent across the entire range of the standard curve, rather higher Cq values (lower starting quantities or gene copies) were more affected than lower Cq values (higher starting quantities or gene copies) (Table S4) . Therefore, all N1 and N2 data were ultimately quantified using the ATCC standard. Table S3 .

However, measured concentrations of this positive control by ddPCR have been found to be approximately 5-fold lower than the manufacturer's reported concentration (personal communication), which can lead to overestimation of SARS-CoV-2 concentration.

The ESVs were determined by incorporating sample-specific volumes obtained at (or used after) each sample concentration (e.g., HFUF, Centricon) and molecular processing/analysis step (e.g., nucleic acid extraction, cDNA synthesis, qPCR). An example for the overall HFUF-Centricon sample concentration approach is shown in Eq. S2. Sample concentrations were calculated by dividing the gene copy (gc) number obtained for each assay (gc/reaction) by the corresponding ESV.(Eq. S2) Virus recovery. Virus recovery was determined by (a) spiked vaccine-strain bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and (b) ambient levels of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV). The BCoV stock (Calf-Guard, Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ, USA) was obtained from Mark Borchardt and Susan Spencer at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The lyophilized material was resuspended in 3 mL of 1X TE buffer (stock solution) and then diluted 4.35-fold in 1X TE buffer (diluted stock solution). The diluted stock solution was titered via direct extraction (350-\u00b5L volume) using the Purelink Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and then quantification by RT-qPCR as described earlier. After correcting for dilution, the concentration of the 3-mL resuspended stock solution was determined to be 1.6\u00d710 8 gc/mL, and the concentration of the diluted spiking stock was determined to be 3.6\u00d710 7 gc/mL. The baseline concentrations used in PMMoV recovery calculations were based on direct extraction of wastewater samples prior to sample concentration. Recovery experiments evaluated recovery for the overall sample concentration methods and also isolated each step in the process (when secondary concentration was employed). All recovery experiments involving HFUF were carried out by spiking 1 mL of the diluted BCoV stock (3.6\u00d710 7 gc/mL) into 10 L of wastewater (final concentration of ~3.6\u00d710 6 gc/L). For recovery experiments intending to isolate small-volume concentration (i.e., Centricon and PEG), experiments were carried out by spiking 150-250 \u00b5L of the diluted BCoV stock (False positives with E_Sarbeco qPCR assay. To examine potential cross-reactivity between BCoV and SARS-CoV-2, the diluted BCoV stock solution was assayed on 4 occasions for the N1, N2, E_Sarbeco, and orf1a genes (in duplicate)-a total of 32 qPCR reactions. The N1/N2 qPCR assays were carried out in 20-\u00b5L reaction volumes, while 10-\u00b5L reaction volumes were used for E_Sarbeco and orf1a. The SARS-CoV-2 assays did not cross-react with BCoV, except for one BCoV extract showing a positive signal in duplicate reactions for the E_Sarbeco assay (Cq = 34.90\u00b10.40 and starting quantity = 3.97\u00b11.06 gc/reaction). The E_Sarbeco assay also yielded a positive signal in 22% of negative controls, with Cqs ranging from 34.00 to 36.30 (corresponding starting quantities of 7.22 and 1.71 gc/reaction). The other assays showed no amplification in all negative controls and negative reverse transcription (RT) controls. Other researchers have also observed false positive amplification in negative controls with the E_Sarbeco assay (Konrad et al., 2020; personal communication).",
