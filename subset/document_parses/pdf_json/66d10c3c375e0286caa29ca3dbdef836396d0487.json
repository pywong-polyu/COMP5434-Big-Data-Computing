The use of face masks has been described as an important strategy to slow its transmission. We evaluated the effects of coaching caregivers via telehealth technologies to teach face mask wearing to children with autism spectrum disorder. Six participants with a history of challenging behavior associated with mask wearing were recruited from different parts of the world, and trained using graduated exposure, shaping, and contingent reinforcement. By the end of the intervention, all participants wore a face mask for a period of 10 min without exhibiting challenging behavior. The skills generalized to a novel mask or a community setting. Mask wearing did not affect the percentage of oxyhemoglobin saturation of participants, and caregivers found the intervention useful. The findings support previous tolerance training treatment evaluations in children with developmental disorders exhibiting resistance to healthcare routines.",

            "text": "As of November 2020, more than 48 million cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed worldwide, and more than 1.2 million people have died from complications of the disease. The disease affects the lungs, heart, kidneys, gut, and brain, but the respiratory symptoms (pneumonia) induced by an inflammatory cytokine response have proved to be life-threatening (Lake, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . While most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 present with mild or no symptoms, COVID-19 complications can be lethal among individuals with preexisting medical conditions and the elderly (Shahid et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Mitigating actions to reduce the rate of infection have included emergency lockdowns, travel restrictions (Ji et al., 2020) , and behavioral recommendations such as thorough and frequent hand-washing, social distancing, and avoiding hand-to-face contact (G\u00fcner et al., 2020) . Ongoing research studies offer support for the effectiveness of nonpharmacological strategies to slow the spread of the disease (e.g., social distancing, Ghanbari et al., 2020; hand-washing, Pogrebna & Kharlamov, 2020) . In addition, the use of face masks has been suggested as an important risk mitigation strategy against virus transmission (Cheng et al., 2020; Esposito & Principi, 2020) . Mask wearing can prevent onward respiratory droplet transmission from an infected person (e.g., surgical masks; see MacIntyre & Chughtai, 2020, for a review) and filter airborne particles, offering protection to an uninfected person (e.g., N95/FFP2 masks; Bartozko et al., 2020) .",

For example, in Belgium and the United Kingdom, a face mask is mandatory on public transport and in all shopping areas for all individuals over 12 years of age. A face mask is also recommended in crowded situations when social distancing is not possible. In population-dense countries like India, wearing a mask is required at all times in all public spaces. There is evidence to suggest that wearing a surgical or a reusable cotton face mask can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in public and health care settings (Chu et al., 2020) .",

Moreover, individuals with ASD may lack the instructional control to adhere to hand washing, refrain from face touching, and, particularly, wear a face mask. It is possible that the discomfort caused by wearing a mask may evoke escape-maintained refusal among children with ASD. Previous research indicates that individuals with ASD exhibit reactions to various types of tactile stimuli, and their adaptation to novel tactile stimuli may be delayed or altered (Kohn, 2007; Puts et al., 2014) . Abnormal behavioral reactions (e.g., aggression) to stimuli such as tags on clothing and food textures have been commonly reported (Marco et al., 2012) . Escapemaintained refusal of wearable items has also been described for earplugs (Cox et al., 2017) and prescription glasses (DeLeon et al., 2008) in this population (see also Piazza et al., 2003) .",

The exposure hierarchy involved gradually increasing proximity to the haircutting equipment and then increased contact duration with the equipment. Following the intervention, both boys tolerated hair clipping for a mean duration of 15 min. Graduated exposure also has been evaluated in this population in combination with response prompting for toothbrushing (Bishop et al., 2013) , increasing food repertoire (Tanner & Andreone, 2015) , and undergoing a neuroimaging scan (Cox et al., 2017) . In addition to graduated exposure, participants in these studies also received brief breaks contingent on the omission of escape-maintained problem behavior or differential reinforcement of other behavior. Moreover, Cook et al. (2015) evaluated differential negative reinforcement of other behavior (DNRO) to increase compliance with wearing a medical bracelet in a boy with autism. The authors reinforced progressively longer periods of bracelet wearing with the contingent removal of the bracelet. Bracelet wearing increased steadily to a target duration of 7 daily hours. DeLeon et al. (2008) evaluated the effects of noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) on the use of prescription glasses in four individuals with intellectual disability. Their study showed NCR alone to be effective for one participant, whereas the other three required response blocking and response cost to establish compliance. Similarly, Richling et al. (2011) evaluated the effectiveness of NCR in increasing compliance with wearing foot orthotics in two individuals with a developmental disability. The authors reported that receiving preferred items on a fixed-time schedule increased the duration of orthotics wearing relative to baseline.",

Thomas had a score of 17 on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale, Second Edition (ADOS-2; Lord & Rutter, 2012) , which was administered 6 months before the study. He spoke in short sentences in both English and French, used nouns (e.g., \"flower\"), actions (e.g., \"crying\"), and adjectives (e.g., \"wet\") when shown pictures, and followed simple instructions (e.g., \"get your cap\"). He did not engage in a conversation, make unprompted comments about events, or ask questions. Abhi was a 6-year-old boy from India. His family spoke English and Tamil at home. His score on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS; Schopler et al., 1980) was 35, based on administration 2 years before the study. Abhi spoke using single words, asked for approximately 10 different items, and receptively identified approximately 50 items (e.g., \"find the bag\" from a series of 4-6 pictures). He emitted no spontaneous labels and did not answer questions. Juan was a 7.5-year-old boy from Mexico. He wore prescription glasses and participated in the study with his therapist. His score on the ADOS, administered 1 year before the study, was 15. Juan spoke in simple phrases (e.g., he could say, \"give me big train\"), responded to instructions (e.g., \"find all the vehicles in the picture\"), and asked and answered questions. He did not engage in conversations on a topic, narrate, or describe events. Maria was a 6.5-yearold girl from Costa Rica. She required \"substantial support\" as per the DSM level of support scale, completed 1 year before the study. She requested items using single words (e.g., \"ball\"), labeled items upon request (e.g., when asked \"what is this?\" while holding up a ball), and engaged in identity match-tosample with objects and pictures. She did not answer questions, identify colors or shapes (either as a listener or as a speaker), or match nonidentical pictures (e.g., matching animals with their young ones, or matching items belonging to the same category). Selva was a 7-year-old boy from India. He spoke English and Tamil at home. His score on the CARS was 33. Selva, primarily communicated using gestures, followed basic instructions delivered with accompanying gestures (e.g., \"sit down here\" while pointing to the chair), and performed identity match-to-sample tasks. He did not engage in any vocal verbal behavior besides simple echoics (e.g., repeating monosyllabic sounds following a model). Mateo was a 6-year-old-boy from Mexico. His score on the ADOS, which was administered 1 year before the study, was 14. He made requests using short phrases, followed simple, context-relevant instructions (e.g., bring the crayons, let us do some art), and tacted simple and complex objects and activities when presented with pictures (e.g., \"eating a banana\"). He did not answer questions or label items or events spontaneously.",

The experimenter signaled to the caregiver the start (i.e., \"please, start now\") and end (i.e., \"stop!\") of all baseline, treatment, and generalization sessions. Prior to each session, the experimenter listed the teaching steps to be carried out during that session, and had the caregiver vocally repeat the sequence.

However, the design of the study did not allow us to evaluate whether this gradual increase was indeed necessary. In addition, both Abhi and Maria required caregiver support throughout the study for fitting the mask loops. It is possible that additional training sessions specifically targeting the steps in the exposure hierarchy that required full physical prompts might have led to better outcomes for these participants. In addition, it must be noted that we did not provide physical prompts when the participants did not put on the mask during baseline. Therefore, the possibility exists that the participants did have mask-wearing skills during baseline in spite of caregiver report. Future studies may consider physically prompting the child through all of the mask-placement steps in baseline and only provide escape contingent on problem behavior or mask removal.

The existing literature on mask-induced deoxygenation offers mixed results. Although studies featuring surgeons as participants have found minor decrements in oxygen saturation after prolonged mask use (e.g., Beder et al., 2008) , other analyses have reported no physiological burden due to mask wearing (Roberge et al., 2012) . The pulse oximetry data reported in this study suggest that mask wearing did not lead to low oxygen saturation in our participants. Nevertheless, our assessment of pulse oximetry should be verified with a larger sample using gas exchange oximeter readings in comparable settings.",

However, four participants engaged in problem behavior during baseline during which the caregiver provided contingent escape. Second, we did not establish mask wearing for periods longer than 10 min or conduct follow-up probes. Additional research is needed to monitor mask wearing for longer periods, in a variety of different contexts (e.g., during low preference activities, school settings, group activities etc.), and to determine the specific mechanisms contributing to the continued tolerance of face masks. Evaluating the effects of mask choice is also an avenue for future research. Comparing baseline preference for face mask types (e.g., surgical, cloth mask) with posttraining tolerance for mask-wearing could provide more robust generalization data. Third, we did not conduct stimulus preference assessments to select the high-preference activities provided to participants while wearing the mask. Instead, we informally verified preference by monitoring continued activity engagement during sessions.",

Fifth, we included prompted responses in our treatment integrity data, making it difficult to form conclusions about the caregivers' ability to implement the procedures independently. We also did not measure fidelity of the experimenter's telehealth coaching. Finally, we must assume a potential role for the various levels of instructional control shown by caregivers before the start of the intervention (Shimoff et al., 1981) . As described earlier, all caregivers had prior experience implementing behavioral programs with the participants.",
