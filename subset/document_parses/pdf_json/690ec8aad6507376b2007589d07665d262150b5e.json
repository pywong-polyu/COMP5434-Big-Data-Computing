This work explores the perceptions of Spaniards with IDD during the lockdown with respect to four topics: access to information, emotional experiences, effects on living conditions and access to support. Methods The topics were explored using a subset of 16 closed-ended questions from an online survey. In total, 582 participants with IDD completed the survey. The frequencies and percentages of responses to the questions were calculated, and chi-square tests performed to explore the relationship between participants' sociodemographic characteristics and responses. Given that people differed in the way in which they completed the survey, the relationship between participants' responses and completion method was also analysed. Results Participants reported that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown have had a deleterious effect on their emotional well-being (around 60.0% of participants) and occupations (48.0% of students and 72.7% of workers). Although access to information and support was reportedly good overall, being under the age of 21 years and studying were associated with perceptions reflecting poorer access to information (V = .20 and V = .13, respectively) and well-being support (V = .15 and V = .13, respectively). Being supported by a third party to complete the survey was consistently related to perceptions of worse outcomes. Conclusions The study yielded data on the perceptions of people with IDD regarding the effects that COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown have had on their lives. Suggestions on how to overcome the difficulties reported and future lines of research are discussed. Percentages in bold indicate the level of the variable for which the standardised residual exceeded \u00b11.96 z scores, indicating that the existing relationship occurred for that response category.

Several international studies have highlighted the vulnerability of people with IDD in terms of their health, inclusion and rights arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and measures implemented to 'flatten the curve' (e.g. Courtenay & Perera 2020), and guidelines have been developed on how to provide support during this crisis (e.g. Alexander et al. 2020) . However, few studies have explored how this situation has directly affected people with IDD, with the majority focusing on carers' perceptions (e.g. Neece et al. 2020) . Indeed, in the review conducted for this article (search terms, language, databases, period and records are available on request), only two of 205 works on COVID-19 and IDD included people with IDD as direct participants (Drum et al. 2020; Embregts et al. 2020) . In a survey distributed to 930 adults with IDD in the USA, Drum et al. (2020) found that 20% of participants who suffered anxiety and depression were unable to access emotional support, 25% stopped receiving direct care services, more than half experienced disruptions in their regular healthcare treatment services and 38% experienced difficulties accessing health care. In the other study, conducted by Embregts et al. (2020) on six people with IDD in the Netherlands, their main concerns were found to be the need for social contact, the changes to daily life posed by the lockdown and difficulties in understanding preventive measures.",

Among these questions is the need to examine whether people with IDD have been provided with access to COVID-19 resources to promote their rights to health and information [European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities (EASPD) 2020; United Nations 2020]. Moreover, research into the emotional experiences of people with IDD during the pandemic is necessary given the higher prevalence of mental health conditions among this group (Emerson et al. 2010; Hughes-McCormack et al. 2017) , meaning that they may face greater difficulties compared with the general population. Finally, the literature highlights the need to understand the effects of COVID-19 on people with IDD in terms of their living conditions and access to support. This is because the lockdownalong with the lack of social service planning by authoritiesmay have resulted in this group not receiving the support and services necessary for inclusion in their communities (EASPD 2020; Hughes & Anderson 2020) .",

Research in Spain on the effects of the pandemic and lockdown on the lives of people with IDD has remained stagnant in comparison with international studies. In fact, none of the 205 works mentioned earlier have explored how the situation has affected Spaniards with IDD from their own perspectives or those of their relatives.

To reach participants who were supported by other service 3 providers, the online survey was also disseminated via the Plena inclusi\u00f3n and Institute for Community Inclusion websites and social media using easyto-read instructions. This strategy was complemented with an email distribution list to all organisations that had collaborated with the research team in previous investigations, with more than 1000 emails sent in total. Given the possibility of the survey being implemented as an interview by a relative or carer, instructions accompanying the survey stated that interviewers should not reflect their own perceptions but those of the participants being interviewed. The survey was created using the Lime Survey platform. Along with general and question-specific instructions, the survey incorporated visual prompts to help participants answer the questions. The survey was hosted on the University of Salamanca's server to maximise data privacy and security (only the members of the research team could access the data). Participants could save their answers to avoid having to complete the survey in one attempt. The survey took around 20 min to complete, as reported by the person with IDD who helped to validate the survey in an easy-to-read format.",

This will help to focus the 11 discussions and proposals as new literature on the topic emerges. Regarding the statistical relationship between participants' sociodemographic characteristics and their answers, young people with IDD (38.6%) and students (27.2%) perceived greater difficulty in understanding COVID-19 information, and 25.0% of young people found it difficult to understand the reason for the lockdown. This finding suggests that, despite the efforts, the information was not disseminated to everyone equally. The literature reveals strategies that should be considered to maximise access to information for people with IDD. First, given that people with IDD represent a heterogeneous group, information resources should be developed in a range of formats and versions appropriate for different levels of ability (Lennox et al. 2005; Mulhall et al. 2019) , support needs (Thompson et al. 2018 ) and learning styles (Buchanan 2017) . Second, people with IDD should be involved in developing these resources (EASPD 2020). Finally, it is essential to use an appropriate information dissemination strategy that considers the characteristics of the target group (e.g. age and motivational and learning styles) and is updated, proactive and preventive (Meltzer 2020) . Maryanti et al. (2020) provide an example of how these considerations may help in the dissemination of information while empowering people with IDD to combat the virus.",

In the absence of studies analysing the psychological consequences of the pandemic for people with IDD, this finding is consistent with studies on the general psychological response to the pandemic, which have shown that women are more likely to experience a poorer adjustment compared with men (e.g. Moghanibashi-Mansourieh 2020; Zou et al. 2020 ). More research is necessary to understand the potential gender-related variables affecting the psychological adjustment of individuals with IDD in challenging circumstances. Living context was associated with being more anxious during the pandemic, especially for 65.1% of the participants who lived in organisational housing services. The challenges related to living in residential facilities in Spain help shed light on this finding. Indeed, organisations providing these services have reported to have been overwhelmed because of the lack of resources to prevent contagion between carers and people with IDD and the lack of time to prepare and explain the measures taken. Consequently, many people with IDD have experienced sudden changes in their environments, including changes in the professionals providing support to them, the people with whom they live (because of isolations and quarantine) and their routines (Corretj\u00e8 2020; Plena inclusi\u00f3n 2020b) . This helps to explain why almost 10% of participants changed their living situation at the onset of the lockdown, in most cases moving from organisational facilities to their family homes. The lockdown has interrupted the occupations of both students and workers. The results from students are strikingapproximately half have been unable to follow online education, and although nearly 60% have received educational support, professional support has been lacking and the responsibility for this has fallen primarily on families. This highlights the burden for families in terms of supporting their relatives with IDD, the poor preparation of educational systems for the online education of individuals with IDD and the need for family-school collaboration to support students (Esent\u00fcrk 2020) . Since the start of the lockdown, experts have highlighted that the Spanish educational system's poor preparation for online education may increase the education gap experienced by vulnerable students (C\u00e1ceres-Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2020; Espinosa 2020) . Nevertheless, 3 months after schools have reopened, there remains a lack of data on the experiences of students with IDD. Thus, research on the education of students with IDD is needed for two reasons: (1) to address the challenges faced by students with IDD and their needs following lockdown and (2) to analyse the indicators (e.g. percentage of students with IDD attending general education at the beginning vs. the end of the academic year) to determine whether the education gap has increased since the lockdown. This would enable the identification of priority areas to support students with IDD and mitigate the potential negative effects of the lockdown.",

Organisations have had to prioritise support for people with IDD living in residential facilities (Plena inclusi\u00f3n 2020b) over the support for younger people and students, most of whom live with their families (Navas et al. 2017) . This finding should raise awareness for organisations of the need to reinforce their support for young people with IDD regardless of their living context. This is critical given that the mission of most Spanish disability support organisations is to enhance the well-being of their clients at all stages of their lives (Verdugo 2018; Gonz\u00e1lez 2019) .",

It may be hypothesised that those who answered the survey via an interview did so because they had greater support needs, preventing them from completing an online survey. These participants' responses may reflect their need for more intensive and persistent support when facing the demands posed by COVID-19 and the lockdown than is required by their counterparts. However, this can only be hypothesised because the only certainty about the completion method was the way in which answers were provided, and other interpretations may exist (e.g. lack of access to technology). For this reason, the authors of the present study did not further stratify the analyses under the assumption that the means of answering the survey reflected the participants' support needs. This work has some limitations that should be considered. The primary limitation was the lack of collection of data on participants' personal functioning. Specifically, without the inclusion of a 'support needs' variable, it is impossible to control for the confounding effects that it may have introduced in the results. The research team decided not to collect this information because of the potential difficulty of some individuals to provide it and to avoid stigmatisation. Another limitation refers to the sampling method. Despite the large number of respondents, the sample was not stratified, which may affect the generalisability of the results. Third, because the survey was voluntary and online, those with difficulties accessing technology or without a support person to help them complete the survey are likely to have been under-represented. Fourth, each topic was analysed using a relatively small number of questions, and although the literature highlights the need for people with IDD to be given a voice, studying their perceptions does not mean analysing the phenomenon in depth. For these reasons, the findings reported in this study should be regarded as preliminary and a foundation for future research.",

Findings on the relationships between sociodemographic characteristics (i.e. living context, age or occupation) and participants' perceptions may be informative for other researchers.

It is also worth stressing that most participants were able to personally complete the online survey. This should encourage future researchers to use this technology more often in order to include people with IDD in their studies.
