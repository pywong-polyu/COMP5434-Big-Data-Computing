The challenges and solutions of providing prevention, treatment, and care for those affected with issues related to substance use and addictive behaviors are still being discussed by the global community. Several international documents have been developed for service providers and public health professionals working in the field of addiction medicine in the context of the pandemic (1-3), however, less is known about country-level responses. In the current paper we, as individual members of the Network of Early Career Professionals working in Addiction Medicine (NECPAM), discuss emerging country-level guidelines developed in the 6 months following the outbreak.",

The combination of a reduction in the availability of services, increased reliance on telemedicine, physical distancing protocols, and travel restrictions may exasperate underlying health inequities in terms of access to addiction services (31) (32) (33) (34) . This seems to disproportionately affect the most marginalized and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients (32) who may lack access to internet-enabled devices, sufficient internet, the necessary private spaces to engage in telemedicine and means of transport to services.",
