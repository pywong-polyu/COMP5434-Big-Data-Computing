This study was aimed at discovering vital hub genes and potential molecular pathways of DM through bioinformatics analysis, which contributes to identifying potential diagnostic or therapeutic biomarkers and targets. In this study, a total of 915 DEGs in DM samples including 167 upregulated genes and 748 downregulated genes were screened out by the limma package based on the GSE142807 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Furthermore, the results of Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these downregulated genes were highly associated with the immune-related biological processes and pathways. Therefore, 41 genes closely related to DM were extracted for further study based on the subcluster analysis through the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) software plugin in Cytoscape. Ultimately, 10 hub genes (including ISG15, DDX58, IFIT3, CXCL10, and STAT1) were identified as the potential candidate biomarkers and targets. Besides, we found that the identified hub genes directly or indirectly communicated with each other via molecular signaling pathways on the protein and transcription level. In general, under the guidance of bioinformatics analysis, 10 vital hub genes and molecular mechanisms in DM were identified and the expression of proinflammatory factors and interferon family proteins and genes showed high association with DM, which might help provide a theoretical foundation for the development of point-to-point targeted therapy in the future treatment of DM.",

As a kind of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), DM affects both children and adults. In patients with DM, the quality of life is seriously affected. Previous clinical studies on the treatment guidelines of DM mainly emphasized its early diagnosis, treatment, and management. With the deepening of the disease research and clinical literature reports in recent years, the glucocorticoid and immunosuppressant in combination have been recommended for the treatment of the DM, resulting in the reduced incidence of adverse reaction among affected patients [2] .",

            "text": "Based on the current research reports, the pathogenesis of DM is mainly closely related to immune disorders and genetic factors [3] . Cytokines, including interleukins and interferon (IFN), are small protein molecules with cell signal transduction functions involved in the development progression of DM [4] . DM is an autoimmune disease mediated by humoral immunity. It is chiefly characterized by infiltration of lymphatic B cells and CD4+ T cells, which are mostly concentrated around blood vessels [3] . Meanwhile, microRNAs (miRNAs) are fundamentally important to the pathogenesis of DM through extensive and precise regulation of various biological processes at the transcriptional level. Recent studies have confirmed that the plasma levels of hsa-miR-4442 in patients with DM changed significantly before and after treatment, which may serve as a potential biomarker [5] . Apart from this, some researchers have also proposed that miR-193b-3p, miR-199b-5p, and miR-665 are related to DM [6] . As an important part of the immune system, Janus Kinase (JAK) family genes are involved in and mediate innate and adaptive immune processes in the human body. The mRNA and protein factors produced by the JAK family genes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) are closely related to the regulation of cytokines such as interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin 5 (IL-5) and some main biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In recent years, with the deepening of research on the JAK family, it is becoming potential therapeutic management for DM [7, 8] . Moreover, both in vitro pathological tissue experiments and PCR experiments on DM have proven that the mRNA expression level of IFNrelated genes (IFITM2, IFIT6, LY6E, etc.) in skeletal muscle tissues of DM patients is more significant. It can promote the secretion of inflammatory factors in muscle tissues and mediate the abnormal apoptosis of skeletal muscle tissues. Other candidate genes include STAT1, DDX58, MX2, and PLSCR1 [9] . In addition, studies have found that mutations in HLA genes can be found in patients with DM, and related genes such as HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 are associated with susceptibility to DM. It also has indicated that the genetic variation of the HLA gene family and HLA alleles and nonalleles may be related to the pathogenesis of DM [10] . Considering that the main genes involved in DM's pathogenesis and molecular pathways are still unclear, this study was aimed at identifying the key differential genes and molecular pathways that may cause the pathogenesis of DM, ascertaining the biological processes mediated by genes and signaling pathways. On this basis, this study will further investigate the relationship between IFN-related genes and DM's physiology and pathology, providing a theoretical basis for clarifying a new potential biomarker, which may help biomedical researchers and experimental biologists to better understand the pivotal differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways of DM. Furthermore, a bioinformation platform was built to help manage and develop potential therapeutic targets, which will help provide a theoretical foundation for the development of point-to-point targeted therapy in the future treatment of DM [11] [12] [13] .",

Studies have shown that the level of CXCL10 in the serum of patients with DM is significantly higher than that of healthy people, which indicates that CXCL10 has significant significance in the study of DM [29] . Furthermore, related studies have shown that CXCL10 can significantly chemoattract inflammatory cells to the lesion. The mechanism is that the IFN-\u03b3 strongly induced the production of the chemokine CXCL10, which activated the G protein-coupled pathway to participate in Th1-type response by binding to the CXCR3 receptor and mediated T cell migration to the inflammatory site. It is positively correlated with the severity of DM injury [30, 31] . Previous studies showed that CXCL10 was required for the classic PI3K/Akt signaling pathways of inflammatory response, which supported that CXCL10 was involved in regulating immune system response [32, 33] . DDX58, also known as retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), is retinoic acid-(retinoic acid) induced gene protein I. Previous studies have shown that DDX58 can promote cell secretion of type I interferon and participate in the regulation of immunity [34] . In addition, previous studies have indicated that DDX58 was involved in viral double-stranded (ds) RNA recognition and RIG-I-mediated innate immunity triggered by viruses or injury signals plays an important role in the pathogenesis of DM [35] .

In addition, IFIT3 was involved in the interferon-gamma signaling pathway to modulate response to interferon in the immune system [39] . Recent evidence suggests that IFIT3 is overexpressed in pathological muscle tissues in immunoomic experiments and type I interferonmediated innate immunity plays a key role in DM [40] . STAT1, a member of the STAT protein family, is involved in gene regulation induced by type I, II, and III interferons as a transcription factor and various basic biological processes [38, 41] . It is worth noting that it is also relevant to immune response. STAT1 encodes proteins that can be activated by diverse ligands, including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-6, which mediate the expression of various genes. In addition, STAT1 involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway regulates the immune system response to interferon, which prompts a high correlation with the interferon system [42] . Moreover, type I interferon can participate in the myopathy of patients with DM through the STAT1 signaling pathway, resulting in muscle tissue damage [43] .

In addition, studies have confirmed that OAS1 is a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling genes, which reminds us that OAS1 is closely correlated with type I interferon signaling pathway [44] . Related studies have shown that all OAS genes are regulated in patients with DM. In addition, 99% of OAS gene family networks are significantly upregulated [45] . IFI6 is an interferon stimulus that can be upregulated by the type I interferon gene. And with the research of IFI6 in recent years, it is widely accepted that IFI6 may play a critical role in regulating apoptosis and antiviral activity. Also, previous studies have suggested that in the muscle tissue of patients with DM, the mRNA expression level of IFI6 is significantly increased [9] . We notice that IFIT6 is involved in the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling pathway, which may have a close relationship with the regulation of viral infection in the pathogenesis of DM.",

            "text": "HLA-A is one of the sites on the HLA gene. Studies have shown that the strong expression of HLA-A in DM patients causes muscle fibers to be damaged by inflammatory cell infiltration, causing muscle damage [46] . At the same time, HLA-A participates in interferon-gamma signaling to modulate the immune response. Therefore, HLA-A is closely related to the inflammatory response of DM. TRIM25 belongs to the TRIM family and plays an important role in natural immune regulation. Studies have found that TRIM25 is significantly upregulated in the muscle tissue of patients with DM [47] . In addition, TRIM25 is closely associated with RIG-I, leading to the activation of RIG-I and stimulating the production of the antiviral cytokines IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, which mediated signaling in the IFN pathways [48] . GBP1 is a kind of monomer engine protein composed 8 BioMed Research International of 593 amino acids. It is not expressed in normal human muscle tissue, so it may be a potential early warning signal for the occurrence and development of DM [49, 50] . Meanwhile, we conducted the interrelation analysis for the above vital hub genes that may be most closely associated with DM to elucidate their interactions [51] [52] [53] . As shown in Figure 6 , the identified hub genes directly or indirectly communicated with each other via molecular signaling pathways related to response to type I interferon, response to virus, cellular response to interferon-gamma, and regulation of type I interferon production. ISG15, STAT1, IFIT3, IFI6, and OAS1 are mainly directly involved in and affect the type I interferon signaling pathway and response to virus, whereas HLA-A and DDX58 are mainly involved in the regulation of molecular mediator of immune response and cytokine production involved in immune response [54, 55] . ISG15, STAT1, TRIM25, and DDX58 are highly correlated with the positive regulation of type I interferon production. Moreover, ISG15, STAT1, and DDX58 are directly associated with the regulation of the ISGylation pathway in antiviral immunity [38] . In general, these findings suggested that these hub genes involved in the development of DM could be crucial factors in regulating the type I interferon system and the immune system. They could be new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

The KEGG pathway sensory perception of smell, enriched by upregulated genes, was consistent with the hypothesis that sensory perception of smell may participate in the regulation of DM. But there is not much literature involved. However, all the enrichment terms of downregulated genes in the GO enrichment analysis were associated with type I interferon and response to virus. The characteristics of patients with DM are mainly skin lesions and progressive muscle weakness [26] , which are autoimmune diseases and are closely related to the enrichment of related type I interferon and viral response in GO downregulation enrichment analysis. Guanylate-binding protein 2 (GBP2) is a protein induced by IFN. It can mediate cellular immunity, participate in many biological responses, and increase IL-6 and IL-12. The secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and other inflammatory factors plays an important role in the pathogenesis of DM [56] . Oligoadenylate synthase 3 (OAS3) is an essential antiviral protein, which can be induced by IFN and plays a key role in regulating protein synthesis and immune response [57] . Type I interferon is also involved in myopathy in patients with DM through the STAT1 signaling pathway. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 can promote the expression of type I interferon-induced genes by combining IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 to activate the STAT1 signal transduction pathway, leading to muscle tissue damage [58, 59] . Therefore, from the analysis of GO downregulation enrichment, the above enrichment is significantly related to immune response.",
