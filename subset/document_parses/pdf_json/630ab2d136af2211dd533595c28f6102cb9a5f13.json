            "text": "Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. It is responsible for the deaths of millions of people and has caused global economic and social disruption. The numbers of COVID-19 cases are increasing exponentially across the world. Control of this pandemic disease is challenging because there is no effective drug or vaccine available against this virus and this situation demands an urgent need for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential medicines. In this regard, the main protease (Mpro) has emerged as an essential drug target as it plays a vital role in virus replication and transcription. In this research, we have identified two novel potent inhibitors of the Mpro (PubChem3408741 and PubChem4167619) from PubChem database by pharmacophore-based high-throughput virtual screening. The molecular docking, toxicity, and pharmacophore analysis indicate that these compounds may act as potential anti-viral candidates. The molecular dynamic simulation along with the binding free energy calculation by MMPBSA showed that these compounds bind to Mpro enzyme with high stability over 50 ns. Our results showed that two compounds: PubChem3408741 and PubChem4167619 had the binding free energy of \u2212 94.02 kJ mol \u22121 and \u2212 122.75 kJ mol \u22121 , respectively, as compared to reference X77 (\u2212 76.48 kJ mol \u22121 ). Based on our work's findings, we propose that these compounds can be considered as lead molecules for targeting Mpro enzyme and they can be potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. These inhibitors could be tested in vitro and explored for effective drug development against COVID-19.",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) began to emerge in 2002 and 2012, respectively. The world is currently witnessing a pandemic, the COVID-19 disease, caused by rapidly spreading a new strain of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was identified in late 2019, initially named 2019-nCoV [1] . COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO, March 11 2020) . There are two main ways for the spread of COVID-19, first is indirect contact in which the infected droplets of the virus fall, and second is direct physical contact. It has posed a global health threat, causing an ongoing pandemic in all continents except the Antarctica [2] . According to Worldometer's report, about 12,415,582 peoples have been infected with COVID-19, and 557,923 deaths occurred worldwide, till July 10, 2020, and the numbers are abruptly increasing on a daily basis. In India, the numbers of cases have gone on beyond 798,128 and deaths more than 21,654. COVID-19 is not only affecting the healthcare system but also the global economy.",

This situation has forced the requirement of such medicines, which can be used against this new pandemic and find a cure for it. Scientists have been trying to develop efficient therapy, but unfortunately, no appropriate vaccines and anti-viral drugs have been made available in the market yet. On March 17, 2020, the USA reported starting a vaccine trial against COVID-19, but stated that it will take more than a year for it to be introduced in markets. Recently, combination therapy of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was investigated and its results of the non-randomized clinical trial were published [3, 4] . But it has been found that hydroxychloroquine can cause side effects like drug poisoning in hypersensitive and diabetic patients. Adverse neuropsychiatric condition has been reported in post-treatment of hydroxychloroquine [5] . The administration of high doses of hydroxychloroquine, along with atorvastatin, showed the highest decline of blood glucose in diabetic patients [6] . Therefore, an effective control mechanism is needed to prevent COVID-19 [3] .",

To determine 3D structure of a protein, X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool, but it is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, not all proteins can be crystallized to resolve 3D structure successfully. Therefore, to acquire the structural information structural of bioinformatics tools can be applied successfully [6] . In this regard, the rapid development in sequential and structural bioinformatics has driven the medicinal chemistry which is undergoing an unprecedented revolution currently [7] . Computational biology has played increasingly important roles in stimulating the development of finding novel drugs and can be used to develop potential novel medicines to combat SARS-CoV-2. Recently, several efforts have been made to design anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs through computational methods [8, 9] . In March 2020, a group of researchers at UBC screened 1.3 billion small molecules as potential inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (Mpro) by deep docking method [10] . According to the Web site (https ://www.guide topha rmaco logy.org/coron aviru s.jsp), many ligands synthetic in nature have been proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 and are in clinical trials. Several pharmacophore-based studies have also been carried out to identify compounds from PubChem database against different diseases [7, 11] . Consequently, in order to develop novel drugs against COVID-19, we conducted computational screening of compounds from PubChem database.",

These compounds were finally subjected to molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) to analyze the Mpro-ligand complex's stability. Our study shows that both compounds form a stable complex with Mpro and are potential anti-viral compounds. These could be further explored in vitro and in vivo for effective testing and drug development. The present study's findings will provide other researchers with opportunities to identify the novel drug to combat COVID-19.",

We adapted the following five steps in our pharmacophore-based screening: (1) selection or construction a valid benchmark dataset to train and test the predictor; (2) representation of the samples with an effective formulation that can truly reflect their intrinsic correlation with the target to be predicted; (3) introduction or development of a powerful algorithm, method, or application of a suitable algorithm to conduct the prediction; (4) properly perform cross-validation tests to evaluate the anticipated prediction accuracy objectively; and (5) use of Pubchem database to screen inhibitors [17, 18] . Chou's 5-steps rules have the following notable merits: (1) crystal clear in logic development, (2) completely transparent in operation, (3) easily to repeat the reported results by other investigators, (4) high potential in stimulating other sequence-analyzing methods, and (5) very convenient to be used by the majority of experimental scientists. Therefore in this study, we used Chou's 5-steps rule to study Pharmacophore-based virtual screening of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. protease enzyme assay data for the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection, containing 10,964 compounds, which are suitable for high-throughput screening. We also analyzed these data and compared them with the predictions from our pharmacophore models. We also collected and curated the data to identify active/ inactive compounds from the assay. At the NCATS Browser, compounds with AC50 below 12.6 \u03bcM (\u2212 logAC50 = 4.9) are considered \"low quality active\" [19] . We also applied the same rule for defining active/ inactive compounds. After curation, we found 308 (297 active and 111 inactive) compounds from the assay by removing all duplicates. The active classification was done on the basis of \u2212 logAC50 value (\u2212 logAC50 \u2265 4.9 active, \u2212 logAC50 < 4.9 inactive). Finally, these 308 compounds (297 active and 111 inactive) were tested against our pharmacophore models.",

The topology of protein and ligands was generated by using 'pdb2gmx' script and CGenFF server, respectively, by using CHARMM 36 force field [27] . Then, we assembled protein and ligand topologies to make the protein-ligand complex structure. After that, the solvation of the complex was accomplished by using transferable intermolecular potential water molecules (TIP3Pmodel) with dodecahedral periodic boundary conditions. After solvation, neutralization of the complex was done by adding ions. Further, energy minimization of the complex was done with the steepest descent algorithm by using Verlet cutoff scheme at 10 kJ mol \u22121 by taking Particle Mesh Edward (PME) columbic interactions. Equilibration of the system was attained in two phases. First, NVT ensemble was performed at 300 K for 5000 ps, which stabilized the temperature of the system. While in the second step, NPT ensemble took 1 atm pressure and 5000 ps of steps for NPT simulation. Finally, all systems were subjected to the production MD at a constant temperature of 300 K and a constant pressure of 1 atm with a time step interval of 2 fs, using the Parrinello-Rahman for constant pressure simulation. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for 50 ns. After successful completion of MDS, the MD trajectories were used to calculate root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (R g ), hydrogen bonds, solvent accessible surface area (SASA) [28] , principal component analysis (PCA) [29] , and distance to analyze the stability of Mpro and Mpro-ligand complex.",

According to Fig. 2 , O01, and O13 of X77 interact with Gly143 and Glu166, respectively, and N18 interact with His163 of Mpro. Using Pharmit, the Pharmacophore features were developed by loading the crystallographic structure of Mpro-X77 complex (6W63). To develop the pharmacophore models, these pharmacophore features were manually optimized. Finally, the best model was achieved with the following pharmacophore features present in the Mpro-X77 complex-one aromatic ring, one hydrogen bond acceptor, and two hydrophobic groups. The structure of Mpro-X77 pharmacophore is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 . The pharmacophore features, radius, and x, y, z coordinates are shown in Supplementary Table 1. The pharmacophore model was validated by screening the compounds of CHEMBL3927 and NCATS dataset. On the basis of compounds that matched the pharmacophores, out of 31 active (positive) and 86 inactive (negative) compounds of CHEMBL3927 dataset, our pharmacophore model predicted 26, 5, 62 and 24 as true positive (active compounds that match the pharmacophores), false negative (active compounds that do not match the pharmacophores), true negative (inactive compounds that do not match the pharmacophores), and false positive compounds (inactive compounds that match the pharmacophores), respectively, against SARS-CoV-2 with the accuracy = 75%, sensitivity = 84%, and specificity = 72%. From NCATS dataset, we screened 167, 130, 70, and 41 compounds as true positive, false negative, true negative, and false positive compounds, respectively, from 297 active (positive) and 111 inactive (negative) by using our pharmacophore model with the accuracy = 58%, sensitivity = 56%, and specificity = 63%. Our model had good accuracy ( \u2265 55%) in both cases; therefore, we conclude that our model can be used for virtual screening. These pharmacophore features of Mpro-X77 were further studied and were used to screen the compounds from PubChem library of Pharmit server. After that, compounds were minimized by mRMSD (minimized RMSD, which is the heavy atom difference between pharmacophore aligned pose and minimized pose) and score computed using AutoDockVina scoring function. Using the pharmacophore model, by applying filters and minimization, 15 compounds (9 from 26 active/true positive and 6 from 24 inactive/false positive, respectively) were screened out from the CHEMBL3927 dataset, and 14 compounds (11 from 167 active/true positive and 3 from 41 inactive/false positive, respectively) were screened out from the NCATS dataset (Supplementary Table 2 and 3) .",

The docked X77 showed interaction with the same amino acid residues by hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds as found in the crystal structure in PDB (Fig. 2) . After that, to screen novel compounds against COVID-19, the molecular docking of 11 screened compounds was performed with target protein Mpro using PyRx. The docking results are ranked based on binding energies. Out of 11 compounds, two compounds were finally screened out by docking based on low binding energy/ high binding affinity as shown in Table 1 . The binding energy of reference compound X77 was \u2212 8.3 kcal/mol, while PubChem-4167619 and PubChem-3408741 had \u2212 9.3 kcal mol \u22121 and \u2212 8.5 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively.

Table 5 shows that Mpro-PubChem3408741 and Mpro-PubChem4167619 complexes possess the lower negative binding energy (\u2212 94.02 \u00b1 0.66 kJ mol \u22121 and \u2212 122.75 \u00b1 0.70 kJ mol \u22121 , respectively) as compared to the reference complex Mpro-X77 (\u2212 76.48 \u00b1 0.53 kJ mol \u22121 ). It confirms that both compounds bind efficiently at the active site of Mpro protein and could be used as lead compounds. Further various energy terms contributing toward binding free energy revealed that in all the studied complexes, the driving component of binding was the van der Waals energy which plays a major contribution in strengthening the binding mode. The polar solvation energy does not show a favorable contribution to the total binding in all the studied complexes. The electrostatic energy and SASA nonpolar solvation energy contribute significantly to the binding free energy.",

For the clear depiction of the results, only active site residues are highlighted in figure. From the plot, it is clear that Thr25, Leu27, Met49, Cys145, Met165, Asp187, and Arg188 are participating amino acids in all complexes. The per residue interaction plot indicates that most of the residues have negative binding energy, while few residues have positive binding energy. The residues that showed negative binding energy play an important role in stabilizing the Mpro-ligand complex. Three active site residues, i.e., Met49, Cys145, and Met165, showed higher binding affinity as compared to other residues.

A combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine is being advised to the affected patients in case of emergency. Hydroxychloroquine increases intracellular pH and has been considered as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2; however, it may cause side effects. Hence, there is an urgent need to discover potent alternatives. As we were interested in finding potent pharmacophore-based inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, so we discovered the compounds, Mpro-PubChem3408741 and Mpro-PubChem4167619 which show excellent pharmacological properties. These compounds possess excellent properties of drug ability, small molecular weight, and molar refractivity which confirms that these drugs are permeable through particular membranes and can remain constant even in strong or weak solute-solvent, solvent-solvent interactions. Drug-likeness RO5 was followed by these compounds which describes the compound can act as a drug in the biological systems. The toxicity prediction indicates that both the compounds, PubChem3408741 and PubChem4167619, are safe and can be given as a drug to COVID-19 infected patient as predicted by OSIRIS. The MD simulation results indicate that PubChem3408741 and PubChem4167619 bind to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro efficiently and form a very stable complex. Binding free energy analysis by MMPBSA shows the better binding energy of both compounds to Mpro as compared to X77. It means that these compounds may potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and could be used as potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. This study may be helpful to develop effective medications against SARS-CoV-2 in the future.",

Therefore, it is necessary to discover effective drugs candidates for treatment of COVID-19 successfully. In this direction, bioinformatics tool-based drug discovery could be a useful approach to combat COVID-19. The present study aimed to identify novel inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Therefore, structure-based pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, molecular docking, and MD simulation were successfully performed to discover novel inhibitors of Mpro. A total of 93,067,404 compounds were screened from PubChem database by the pharmacophore-based virtual screening followed by molecular docking, drug-likeness, and toxicity prediction. Finally, the relative stability of two-hit compounds was validated by 50 ns MD simulation. The MD trajectories analysis showed good structural stability with Mpro during the simulation period. Hence from this study, two hits, i.e., PubChem3408741 and PubChem4167619, were identified against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Thus, the outcome of this study reveals that these two compounds may represent potential treatment options against COVID-19.
