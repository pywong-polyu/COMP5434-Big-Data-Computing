The study period spans from January 1, 1994, to August 3, 2017. We employ the approximate entropy approach and find that stock market efficiency evolves over the period. The degree and nature of evolution vary across regions and the development stage of the markets. The global, regional, domestic economic, and non-economic factors influence the adaptive nature of the stock markets. The emerging stock markets have improved efficiency by financial liberalization policy but are adversely affected by global shocks. The estimates validate the relevance of the adaptive market framework to describe the rejection of random walk without excess returns. The results suggest the growing presence of technical analysis and active portfolio managers. The emerging markets in Asia hold policy lessons for their peers. The findings suggest that global investors need to overcome the homogeneity bias as returns opportunities exist within the region and types of markets.",

Ostensibly, a large volume of research tests the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), but conclusive evidence is elusive. 1 The assertion of EMH as dated research is a blindside view, whereas the need is to examine it as a dynamic system. We need to view informational efficiency as a dynamic mechanism, whereas empirical research on EMH confines it to a static theory. The rejection of random walk does not necessarily imply profitability (Canarella et al. 2013) , nor markets are efficient over the period (Campbell et al. 1997) . Instead, informational efficiency is relative and possibly varies over the period and across the markets. Several factors, including financial liberalization, domestic macroeconomic policy, accounting standards, market regulations, tax structure, and political environment, among others, influence the efficiency of markets (Rejeb and Boughrara 2013; Hooy and Lim 2013; Stoian and Iorgulescu 2020; Lin et al. 2021; Liu and Li 2021; Galvani and Ackman 2021) .

We assess the cross-regional market efficiency in the alternative rolling window lengths and find the change in the market dynamics as per the change in the window size.

However, these methods fall short in measuring the degree of market efficiency. At best, these approaches reject or accept the null of the random walk hypothesis (RWH). Therefore, our definition of stock market efficiency is based on the degree of complexities in the patterns contained in a random sequence of price changes. 3 The approximate entropy allows us to measure the degree of randomness and predictability. The entropy method is efficient in the presence of noise and possesses better power properties. Wang et al. (2012) and Alvarez-Ramirez et al.

The extent of information incorporation in adaptive markets depends on the market environment and the nature of the participants. Non-synchronous trading, high transaction costs, poor accounting standards, lack of disclosure norms, and poor corporate governance are the characteristics of EMs. The EMH, which assumes a frictionless market, hardly captures the intricacies of information aggregation in EMs. The AMH accommodates all the market frictions, including behavioral biases.

Although the literature on behavioral biases successfully explains the market anomalies and role of beliefs, biases, and investors' sentiment, an alternative framework that convincingly reasons the empirical puzzle of the unpredictability of returns despite deviation of asset returns from the EMH is lacking. Lo (2005) uses an evolutionary approach of Farmer and Lo (1999) and Farmer (2002) to study interactions in financial markets and asserts that 'dynamics of evolution, i.e., competition, mutation, reproduction, and natural selection determine the efficiency of markets. In AMH, the market is like a biological environment; various kinds of investor groups are distinct species. The interaction of such species with the environment (or ecology) determines the degree of information that eventually reflects in prices. The profit opportunities are similar to that of food and water in ecology. The availability and magnitude of these opportunities dictate the level of competition in the market. Hence, the profits and losses are subject to the market conditions and the number of entry and exit of investors. The successful traders survive in the market, whereas unsuccessful traders eventually extinct (exit) after losses beyond the bearable point. Thus, the survival of the richest and the law of natural selection determines the market's evolution. In an adaptive market, fit and adaptable are relevant than rationality and biases.",

The changing information situation drives away the asset prices from the random-walk benchmark and allows the market dynamics to adapt optimally. Accordingly, the level of stock market efficiency varies over time and across the region based on its adaptability to dynamic economic situations, which motivates us to use AMH as an underlying theory in assessing the pricing part of informational efficiency across the regions over 3 decades. Further, the adaptability of the domestic stock market not only depends on the domestic but also on the external factors in a globalizing world. Underdeveloped economies have been introducing economic and microstructure reforms to improve the quality of the financial markets. Our conceptual framework allows us to capture these changes and explain their influence on the evolution of developing markets.",

Moreover, the static all-or-nothing market condition remains invalid in an efficient market under the adaptive framework. Therefore, the combined analysis of the dynamic price patterns and adaptability of agents to the changing economic and non-economic environments provide a base for measuring stock market efficiency under AMH. From a macroscopic viewpoint, approximate entropy efficiently deals with diversities and variations in the price patterns exhibited by the market under a dynamic information environment. The method further possesses better power properties to deal with the financial noise (Pincus and Kalman 2004) . In this aspect, our estimation of the approximate entropy approach in a rolling window framework and analysis of the cross-regional factors associated with each entropic variation of the markets provides a better assessment of the informational efficiency under the adaptive market framework. Accordingly, our definition of informational efficiency is based on the degree of time-varying complexities in the patterns in a random sequence of price changes, which provides an efficient estimate for AMH across the regions. The properties of approximate entropy efficiently capture the complexities of the stock returns, and hence a composite index of various methods is not appropriate to address the current research problem. The AMH discusses the complexities of the evolving market system, and hence the investors often do not beat the market despite the presence of excess returns. The approximate entropy is appropriate to capture these complexities.",

Therefore, APEn is the indicator of financial market stability (Pincus and Kalman 2004) . Another unique strength of APEn lies in its ability to distinguish different systems, namely high and low dimensional chaotic systems, periodic and multi-periodic systems, a hybrid and stochastic system with a simple algorithm. This ability ensures the robustness of the inferences (Sleigh and Donovan, 1999) . APEn also computes the irregularity of less-frequently analyzed systems with the correlated and non-identically distributed random variables in an unbiased manner (Pincus 1991) .

Vosvrda (2013, 2014) and Baciu (2014) employ the composite efficiency indices constructed by combining multiple methods such as long-range dependence, fractal dimensions, and entropy. APEn approach efficiently ranks the markets in the presence of financial noise and complexities. Hence, this approach is suitable to address the current research problem. APEn has an advantage over other methods in examining the time-varying patterns of the price complexities and, therefore, is considered an efficient indicator of financial market stability (Pincus and Kalman 2004) .

The disaggregated analysis 9 of different market conditions implies the highest level of efficiency in Brazil, South Africa, and India among EMs. A higher degree of informational efficiency of these markets is associated with setting up the common currency reserve pool with the minimum capital of $100 billion reserves after the global financial crisis (GFC). This reserve plays a vital role in protecting these markets against further external financial shocks and funding the local market infrastructures.

The EMs in Asia and North-South America are the least efficient. The geopolitical tensions in these regions and the greater vulnerability of the markets to the regional crisis explain the lower degree of information aggregation. Our results on the ranking of regional stock market efficiency are in line with Vosvrda (2013, 2014) , who document the highest (lowest) efficient markets in Europe (Asia-Latin America) during 2000-2011. Our finding on the highest efficiency in Europe also supports the findings of Mensi (2012) . These studies employ composite index and Shanon entropy, respectively. The extent of variation in APEn values from one market to another motivates us to cluster the regional stock markets according to their level of efficiency (Eq. 8). The cluster analysis presented in Fig. 1 indicates a higher level of efficiency in the (Panel A 1 , B 1 , C 1 for Asia, Asian DMs, and Asian EMs, respectively), and their ranking and clustering (in Panel A 2 , B 2 , C 2 for Asia, Asian DMs and EMs respectively) based on the level of absolute efficiency. Panel A 1 and A 2 represent the ranking and clustering of the stock markets in Asia. Panel B 1 and B 2 shows the ranking and clustering within the sub-sample of Asian DMs, whereas Panel C 1 , C 2 report ranking and cluster analysis within the EMs. The centers of the ranking plots (A 1 , B 1 , and C 1 ) suggest the normal deterministic state. The higher deviation from the center suggests the presence of a higher degree of complexities in the particular market and thus suggests a higher level of informational efficiency, and vice versa. The cluster analysis (Panel A 2 , B 2 , C 2 ) reports the benchmark entropy estimates for the higher or lower degree of informational efficiency in Asia along with in its disaggregated DMs and EMs. The threshold for the higher degree of efficiency in the aggregated sample (i.e., 1.3, shown in Panel A 2 ) and regional DMs (i.e., 1.7 in Panel B 2 ) remain the same as in the previous full-sample and full-DMs sub-sample analysis respectively (Fig. 1) . Nevertheless, the EMs in Asia, unlike the full-EMs sample (Fig. 1) , are highly efficient due to their higher APEn values of above 1.5 sample stock markets except Greece, Jordan, Egypt, Mongolia, Venezuela, Panama, Palestine, Peru, and Costa Rica (Panel A). The market returns in DMs and EMs exhibit a higher degree of complexities (i.e., above 1.7 and 1 respectively) (Fig. 1,  Panel B ) and thus are highly efficient. Nevertheless, the degree of efficiency is lower in Slovakia, United Arab Emirates, Iceland, Bermuda, Kuwait, Cyprus, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, and Greece among the DMs, and Venezuela, Panama, Palestine, Peru, and Costa Rica among the EMs.",

This approach overcomes the problem of an arbitrary division of the full sample into various subsamples, which are often biased (Campbell et al. 1997) . The pre and post-analysis or a structural break approach do not capture the impact of any event, policy, or regulatory change over the period. Static analysis cannot capture such continuous changes. The event study analysis is often biased because of their sensitiveness to the event date and other biases in financial market research (Campbell et al. 1997) . Therefore, the rolling window framework is appropriate for investigating the time-varying efficiency and identifying the events associated with such time variation. In the rolling window analysis, the selection of the length of the window size remained controversial (Zhou and Lee, 2013; Charles et al. 2012 ). Hiremath and Narayan (2016) suggest that the length of the window size should have enough observations to capture the size and power properties of the time series methods. Therefore, we choose an optimal window length of 500 time-series (Panel A 1 , B 1 , C 1 for Europe, European DMs, and European EMs, respectively), and their ranking and clustering (Panel A 2 , B 2 , C 2 ) based on their level of absolute efficiency. In other words, panel A 1 and A 2 represent the ranking and clustering of the stock markets in entire Europe. Panel B 1 and B 2 shows the ranking and clustering within the sub-sample of European DMs, whereas Panel C 1 and C 2 report ranking and cluster analysis within the European EMs. The centers of all the ranking plots (Panel A 1 , B 1 , and C 1 ) represent the deterministic points, and the greater deviation from such points indicate the presence of specific unpredictable patterns in the stock return series, which explains a higher level of informational efficiency, and vice versa. The cluster analysis indicating the market efficiency characteristics of the region and the regional sub-groups-DMs and EMs are presented in A 2 , B 2 , and C 2, respectively, which reports the benchmark entropy estimates for the higher or lower degree of informational efficiency in the particular sample. The threshold for a higher degree of informational efficiency in the aggregated European sample (Panel A 2 ) and regional EMs (Panel C 2 ) remained the same as 1.7, which is higher than the previous full-sample and full-EMs sample (Fig. 1) . Similarly, the DMs in Europe, unlike the full-DMs sample (Fig. 1) , are highly efficient due to their greater APEn values of above 1.8 \u25b8 observations following the approach of Inoue and Rossi (2017) . This method minimizes the quadratic loss function and performs excellently under structural changes. Besides, the method is asymptotically valid. Our sample is rolled one point forward by eliminating the first observation and including the next one to estimate the next entropy value.",

The positive skewness of the entropy series for most DMs suggests a greater magnitude of unpredictability and, thus, a higher degree of efficiency. In EMs, negative skewness of the entropy values suggests that most of these markets are characterized by a lower degree of efficiency due to their peculiar characteristics. Nevertheless, the returns pattern of the EMs such as India, Philippines, Sri-Lanka, Thailand, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine, Italy, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, and Turkey display remarkable improvement in the degree of informational efficiency but not identical to the DMs. The kurtosis of the entropy values with a few exceptions suggests the platykurtic statistical distribution and, therefore, distraction is flat, and the tail is thick. Jarque-Bera statistics also reject normal distribution (Table 3) . We present the rolling entropy estimates across the regions in Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9. We observe the evolution of the level of informational efficiency over the period, and markets switch between efficiency and predictability. This transition from episodes of efficiency-predictability is neither smooth nor fixed. It shows that the market continuously changes, and thus challenging for an investor to earn excess returns despite potential opportunities. We inquire into the economic and non-economic events attributed to episodic stock market efficiency. Therefore, we broadly survey the annual reports of the respective country's monetary authority, newspapers, economic and financial surveys of the IMF and the credit rating agencies.

Besides, the sound macroeconomic fundamentals attracted major institutional investors, which enriched the domestic stock markets with global information (Bae et al. 2012) . Nevertheless, Israel, Oman, South Korea, Chile, and Jamaica could not benefit from global influence because (Panel A 1 , B 1 , C 1 for the entire region, regional DMs and EMs, respectively), and their ranking and clustering (in Panel A 2 , B 2 , C 2 for North-South American markets, regional DMs and EMs respectively) based on their level of absolute efficiency. In particular, panel A 1 and A 2 represent the ranking and clustering of the stock markets in North-South America. Panel B 1 and B 2 shows the ranking and clustering within the sub-sample of regional DMs, whereas Panel C 1 and C 2 report ranking and cluster analysis within the regional EMs. The centers of all the ranking plots (Panel A 1 , B 1 , and C 1 ) represent the deterministic points. The higher deviation from such points suggests the presence of greater irregularities in the stock return series and a higher level of market efficiency and vice versa. The cluster analysis (Panel A 2 , B 2 , C 2 ) reports the benchmark entropy estimates for the higher or lower degree of informational efficiency in the region and the regional subgroups of DMs and EMs. The threshold for the higher degree of informational efficiency in the aggregated region (Panel A 2 ) and the regional EMs (Panel C 2 ) remained the same as 1.5, whereas, for the regional DMs, it is nearly 2, which are higher than that of the previous full-sample analysis (shown in Fig. 1) \u25b8 of their domestic political instability and deterioration in macroeconomic situations. Further, the local financial crashes restrained Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Mexico, Argentina, the US, Peru, Jordan, Kuwait, Philippines, Lebanon, and Portugal from taking advantage of the conducive global environment.",

Several financial shocks such as the East-Asian currency crisis, the US dot-com bubble burst, and a terrorist attack on World Trade Center, the US-Iraq war, dollar crisis, global financial crisis (GFC), Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, and fluctuation of international oil prices are associated with the respective international troughs. Nonetheless, some markets with better market characteristics, advanced trading infrastructure, and an improved macroeconomic environment defy such global downtrends and hold better diversification opportunities for international investors. For instance, Japan was immune to the major downturns in the global markets thanks to its unique big-bang reforms. The creation of Euronext 11 positively influenced the informational efficiency of France and the Netherland between 1997 and 2005 and therefore held better returns for both the US and Asian investors. 12 With their limited degree of financial openness, Kenya, Lithuania, and Sri Lanka remain immune to the significant troughs.

Diversification and higher return opportunities exist within the region as well as the same type of markets.

Note: Panel A and Panel B report the descriptive statistics of the approximate entropy for the DMs and EMs. We follow IFC to classify the sample markets into DMs and EMs based on the level of per capita gross national income (PGNI). SD denotes the standard deviation, and JB indicates Jarque-Bera normal test. Skew and Kurt are skewness and kurtosis, respectively. *** and ** denote significance at 1% and 5% level, respectively. ",
