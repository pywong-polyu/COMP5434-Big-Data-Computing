Racism, understood as an ideological structure that \"provides the rationalizations for social, political, and economic interactions between the races,\" [11] is a fundamental cause of health [12, 13] and has been shown to have strong and lasting impacts on the health of minoritized populations [3, 14, 15] . Racism, a topic that is quite difficult to discuss within an educational context and may require specialized teacher training and education, has gained traction as a topic of increased research and discussion within public health scholarship and teaching [16] [17] [18] [19] . While there is growing interest in advancing medical school curriculum to incorporate discussions around race and racism [20, 21] , early exposure for undergraduate students aiming to continue in the basic sciences or medicine is important to countering the deceptive and insidious belief that race is genetic or biological [22, 23] .",

Just as we expect our public health students to better understand the context in which health is occurring, it is important to consider the sociopolitical and campus climate surrounding students' learning of this complex material.

At primarily White institutions (PWI) these microcosms, especially for students of color, can often reflect intensified racism and stigma at multiple points throughout their college education [26] . Despite efforts to increase the representation of students of color at PWIs [27] , students of color remain a minority on these campuses, leading to heightened experiences of microaggressions, feelings of not belonging, and a lack of representation in course material and instructional staff [28] . On many campuses of PWI, large scale racist events have led to student organizing and protests mobilizing for increased engagement by campus administrators to address issues of racism, with a specific interest in how faculty address these dynamics in their instruction [29] . The movement to increase our understanding of people of color's experiences within socially hostile environments and their resultant disparities within health is one way that students of color may better relate to material within public health classrooms [30, 31] . Undergraduate students who come into contact with public health classes may feel that these classes attend to issues and address societal and structural issues in a way that other classes may not [32, 33] . In particular, undergraduate public health classes that have a dedicated focus on addressing issues among vulnerable populations may provide an avenue for students of color and underrepresented students to engage with scholarship that is responsive to increased interests for greater representation and visibility in the classroom [34, 35] .",

Investigators analyzed how students demonstrated their comprehension of racism within their stated responses in the final exam question through qualitative coding and quantitative comparisons. By examining students' responses over multiple semesters, investigators hope to examine the ecological impact of large societal changes (such as a presidential election) and local school-wide events (such as racist hate crimes taking place on-campus) on how students chose to respond to an exam question on racism, with specific attention to the semantic construction of students' responses. The goal of the pedagogy in the course was to help students name racism as a fundamental determinant of health and health disparities. In effect, the study's conceptual framework builds upon past sociological work evidencing individuals' longstanding aversion to explicitly discussing racism [11] . The study design offers a nexus between scholarship on social justice, health, and educational research to refine current understandings of students' use of the term racism and how this has changed over time and in response to events happening within society.",

Alternative explanations were coded to account for the theory that individuals are comfortable discussing issues about racism with \"anything but racism\" [44] [45] [46] . Finally, if the exam response attempted to discuss racism explicitly without using the term but used words like \"discrimination\", \"prejudice\", etc., it was coded as a semantic alternative. Inclusion of the word \"racial\" without explicit use of the word \"racism\" was deemed a semantic alternative. Semantic alternatives were coded to account for the fact that the term racism often feels loaded and uncomfortable. Despite the fact that the alternatives are not sufficient, individuals think that they can \"write around racism\" which may reduce their discomfort [46] .",

            "text": "Overall, students' ability to name racism as a reason for health disparities among Black and White mothers in the United States increased with time. Additionally, a large and racially charged national event, the election of the 45th President of the United States, seems not to have impacted students' ability to name racism or provide alternative explanations. A local campus-level racist event did seem to be correlated with student responses naming racism and providing alternative explanations. Specifically, we see that students were more likely to name racism as a determinant after the racist event on campus and less likely to provide an alternative explanation. This work lends itself to our understanding of how local climate may impact public health teaching and may also impact students' learning about important social and structural determinants of health. There were significant differences in the proportion of students discussing racism before and after campus events. This result may suggest that students interrogated their own biases and had discussions given the proximity of the event to students' everyday lives. Students cannot necessarily ignore racist incidents when they happen on campus, and this may therefore be a reason for the increased discussion of racism in these instances. Students' perception and awareness of these issues may also be heightened and the events may cause these issues to be on the forefront of students' minds. Given that the racial and ethnic compositions across students in different classes did not differ significantly, we argue that close proximity of racist incidents on college campuses correlates to students' explicitly attributing racism as a health determinant that explains differential outcomes in maternal and child health between Black and white individuals. There is some evidence from psychological experiments with college students that hearing other students condone or condemn racism strongly influences a students' verbalized beliefs [24] . It could, therefore, be true that because students were exposed to the topic and the use of the word outside of the classroom in social settings that these changes were occurring over time for this particular population.",

A large proportion of students (20-40%) continue to use semantic alternatives to the word racism in their exams. These moments demonstrate the opportunity for public health educators to more clearly delineate the unequivocal evidence that demonstrates how racism is a structural determinant of health [13, 44] . This invitation for greater clarity in educators' instructional framing of racism as a structural determinant of health aligns with current efforts for public health scholarship to explicitly name racism as a structural element explaining disparate health outcomes [2, 4] . Instructors in public health courses have an opportunity to deliver intentional instruction to discuss racism in the classroom and teach students about the importance of normalizing racism as a term used in public health scholarship. Given the stability of the proportion of students that engaged in semantic alternatives in their responses across various iterations of this course, we suggest that these semantic alternatives are emblematic of students' inability to explicitly engage with racism as germane to discussions in public health.",

When taking a public health course, they may find themselves in an unfamiliar learning environment given the explicit course materials' focus on societal issues and issues related to race-especially on exams where answers can be openended written responses (unlike in in basic science exams). Because the majority of students in the classes each semester were biology or nursing majors, this may be one of the first opportunities for students to write on these topics [48] . Future studies should aim to examine differences by individual major declared. This could also lead to a better understanding of the role of the core curriculum and liberal arts education in educating students preparing for clinical practice to engage with issues related to social justice [49] .

These semesters would have been important to our understanding of students' reactions to national events. We were not able to pair personal demographic information to the individual responses which means that only ecological conclusions can be made from data analyses that exclude considerations of students as the unit of analysis. Additionally, the person instructing the class on maternal and infant health disparities changed each semester which suggests that there may be differences in teaching style or structure that may account for differences in students' responses on the exam.

Additionally, this work suggests that administrators and faculty should be responsive in addressing local campus events that may lead to stigma on campus. Understanding public health has become more important in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic [50] . Additionally, heightened attention to structural racism and police violence have highlighted the importance of racism as a structural determinant of health. All students, regardless of their future careers, will benefit from accurate and evidence-based presentations of racism as a public health issue. Better understanding how to frame class material so that it is responsive to local and domestic environments may help produce more responsive public health professionals in the future. ",
