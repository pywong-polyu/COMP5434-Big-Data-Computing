For children with disabilities and their caregivers, the transition to kindergarten can be especially difficult due to changes in environment, supports, and services that occur as part of the transition. The purpose of this article is to highlight specific practices and strategies that can enhance collaboration throughout the transition to kindergarten. Fictional vignettes are used to describe the perspectives of, and also the practices and strategies used by, members of an education team as they support a child with a disability and her caregiver. Readers are provided with examples of practices and planning tools that can be used to support children with disabilities throughout the transition to kindergarten process. High-intensity transition practices and strategies that can be used before, during, and after kindergarten transition are specifically highlighted. Additionally, the need for both preschool and kindergarten collaboration and support is emphasized.",

An outgoing 5-year-old, she has developmental delays and receives support from her preschool special education teacher in an inclusive setting. Talia also receives speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, and services and support from a social worker. During parent-teacher conferences, her preschool teacher asks Talia's mom, Naomi, if she has any questions about her child's transition to full-day kindergarten. \"I'm not sure. But, I hate to think about leaving the preschool program. We love it here. I'm not sure if Talia's even ready for kindergarten. Aren't the expectations in kindergarten different? What will her day look like? How will she get the support she needs if she is in a general education classroom? I feel like we are heading into the unknown.\" While the preschool teacher has nurtured a strong relationship with Naomi and wants to make sure Talia's transition to kindergarten is smooth, she is not sure how many of the things she has implemented in the preschool classroom will be feasible in the kindergarten classroom at the elementary school. She wonders what she can do to make sure Naomi and Talia have the support needed to make the transition successful.",

Because children with disabilities may have limited social-emotional and/or academic competencies to support them during this time of change, the transition to kindergarten may be particularly difficult (McIntyre et al., 2010) . In this article, we highlight transition practices and strategies that enhance collaboration throughout (before, during, and after) the transition of children with disabilities to kindergarten and which align with the Division for Early Childhood's (DEC) Recommended Practices for transition (2014) . Fictional vignettes created by the authors were based on real scenarios and designed to illustrate practices and strategies used to support Talia, a child with a developmental delay, and her mother, Naomi during her final year of preschool, during the transition to kindergarten, and after her first few weeks in kindergarten. The DEC Recommended Practices support practitioners, including teachers and support staff, as they pursue the ultimate goal of transition-\"to support children with disabilities' developmental, academic, and social success in the next environment\" (Rous et al., 2007a (Rous et al., , 2007b . Because transition is a process that begins prior to a child's actual departure from a program and continues as a child and family acclimate to the new environment, creating opportunities throughout this transition process where preschool and kindergarten staff can share information, and implement activities and experiences using strategies that will promote a child and family's successful adjustment and positive outcomes is essential (DEC, 2014) . Programs and practitioners can determine how to best support individual children with disabilities by establishing early opportunities to understand future environments and critical factors related to classroom or teacher, family, and child characteristics (Rous & Hallam, 2012) .",

However, the transition to kindergarten is unique as many parents still perceive kindergarten as the start of a child's academic career. Additionally, while preschool classrooms are strongly encouraged to use familycentered practices (Division for Early Childhood, 2014) and often do make an attempt to use a family-focused approach, many elementary schools may or should desire family engagement yet utilize a more child-centered approach. Additionally, for children with disabilities, the transition process may include changes in eligibility, future placement, services, and instructional support-all of which can further challenge a child's successful transition to kindergarten (U.S. Department of Education, 2009 Education, , 2016 . For these children, the already challenging transition to kindergarten can include less support and monitoring than what they had received in preschool, and in some cases fewer opportunities to participate in general education settings (Guralnick et al., 2008) . The effective use of kindergarten transition practices may increase opportunities for inclusion by engaging staff, families, and community members in collaborative processes in which alignment and continuity of inclusive practices between preschool and kindergarten can better occur.",

Researchers believe possible reasons for the additional concerns may be the planning meeting decisions and eligibility determinations that may accompany the transition process for children with disabilities. Parents who have children with disabilities often feel the need to demonstrate strong advocacy during the transition to kindergarten (Burke et al., 2016) and teachers express concerns regarding this process (Welchons & McIntyre, 2015) . General education teachers may have a desire to participate in the transition process but face barriers in doing so, and may lack an understanding of how to support diverse learners in their classrooms (Walker et al., 2012) . Furthermore, for children who are culturally and/or linguistically diverse participation, the transition process may need to include additional staff that can ensure family's full participation and address strategies to ensure cultural responsivity (Rivera et al., 2020; Acar & Blasco, 2018) .",

Formal transition practices are often routinely conducted and based on local or state policies (e.g., open houses, conferences, meetings; Rimm-Kaufman & Pianta, 2000), whereas informal transition practices may be offered less uniformly across programs (e.g., phone calls, parent/ teacher conversations, conversations with kindergarten teachers).

When Naomi and Talia arrived, the kindergarten teachers introduced themselves and gave both a chance to look around and observe during large group time and center time. While the children went to music class, the kindergarten teachers answered Naomi's questions about the transition process and kindergarten expectations.

Therefore, preschool programs and kindergarten or elementary staff, including general and special education teachers, need to prioritize having opportunities to meet and plan for individual children's transition to kindergarten. Ideally, these meetings would include all members of a child's current educational team, in addition to those who will serve the child in the kindergarten setting. Preschool and kindergarten teachers have both expressed the need for more opportunities to collaborate with one another and with families (Rous et al., 2010) and ongoing opportunities to do so could be used to better understand and align developmentally appropriate program expectations, and identify general and individualized kindergarten transition practices as well as roles and responsibilities of staff. Opportunities to visit possible placements, and collaboratively plan for the transition to kindergarten, provide families with opportunities to meet with preschool and kindergarten practitioners and familiarize themselves with the staff, environments, and expectations. It also provides families with an opportunity to share their child's unique history, strengths and needs with kindergarten practitioners. Preschool and kindergarten staff (e.g., teachers, speech-language pathologists, school psychologist, etc.) should be in communication prior to visits and transition planning meetings to ensure each have the information that may be needed to prepare for these activities (e.g. child's current IEP, etc.). Together as a transition team, families, preschool and kindergarten practitioners can then create individualized plans for transition to kindergarten (see example Fig. 1) .",

One way to ensure communication is maintained during these months is to establish a communication plan and designate one practitioner on a child's kindergarten team to serve as a primary contact. Changes that occur related to a child's abilities, needs, or staffing, and parent concerns and questions may necessitate updating a child's transition plan or accessing additional resources. To ensure that teams are able to take proactive measures to address a child's needs, parents and the primary contact might schedule opportunities to touch base several times during the summer. Additionally, the collaborative creation of a timeline that can be distributed to families and practitioners, and that includes a schedule of individualized activities and scheduled contact meetings would support a family's and staff's involvement throughout the summer leading into the child's transition to kindergarten (see example in Fig. 2 ). As the school year begins, collaboration between families and preschool and kindergarten teachers remains important. Preschool teachers and staff may already be familiar with a child and their family, whereas at the start of the year kindergarten teachers and staff will be building rapport with a child and their family and becoming familiar with the child's strengths and needs within the new environment. Working together, families and practitioners can create unique experiences for children with disabilities and their families at the start of the year to ensure each child and member of their transition team feels supported. One example of intra-agency collaboration is hosting a welcome week at the elementary school where preschool and kindergarten teachers and team members spend the first couple of days of kindergarten welcoming children together. In this scenario, a district establishes a slow start for their preschool program and children come for 30 min the first two days to allow teachers and team members to then use the rest of their day working alongside kindergarten teachers and staff to support the first two full days of kindergarten together. This action supports all children as they adjust to the different environment and allows preschool teachers an opportunity to provide kindergarten staff with guidance and support regarding implementation of individualized strategies that have been used with specific children in the past. While this type of collaboration may require state and local administrator support, it can be beneficial for everyone involved-children and parents see a familiar face in the new environment, kindergarten teachers are provided with additional support during a typically hectic time, and preschool teachers have another opportunity to observe a kindergarten classroom and learn how they might better prepare children for such a transition. Other ideas for collaboration and communication at the start of the year include kindergarten home visits, and kindergarten and preschool teacher co-planning lessons for the first few weeks of school.",

Naomi asked if she thought it was helpful that the preschool teacher was available the first week to model how she used the visual schedule with Talia to help prepare her for transitions throughout the day. \"I did,\" said the teacher. \"I hadn't used a visual schedule like that before, so it really helped that she was able to show all of us on the team how Talia could use it.\" The kindergarten teacher then explained that the distance to the library could possibly be the reason that Talia struggled with the transition. The teacher mentioned to Naomi that she and the special education teacher thought they might possibly ask Talia to carry some of the library books to the library next week as one way to possibly keep her more on-task during the transition. \"What do you think of that idea?\" \"I think that's a great idea.

Researchers should also consider exploring how technologies such as teleconference, text messaging, and other communication applications may enhance or ease classroom or programs' use of these recommended practices, especially in response to COVID-19. Finally, there exists limited research to describe to what extent use of highintensity transition practices can impact a child's social or academic outcomes in kindergarten, or which high-intensity transition practices may have more of an effect in compared to others. By understanding which high-intensity transition practices have a more significant impact on positive child and family outcomes, this could help individuals in the field prioritize their use.",
