I do so through the study of a single academic in Australia who sustained a back injury at work. Through an analysis of in-depth interviews and documents, I attempt to show the embodied experience of an injured worker's struggle for care, recovery, and survival in the neoliberal academy. Writing from the nexus of workplace health and safety and critical management literatures, the raw testimony of this injured academic lays bare the violences that are enabled within a wider culture of selfdiscipline, individualism, and performativity in the university. The story presented in this article exposes how physiological and psychological injuries can be exacerbated through the very health and safety procedures that are designed to prevent and alleviate harm. Please note that this article contains references to suicide and suicidal ideation.",

According to Takala et al.'s (2014, p. 326 ) study, there are 2.3 million deaths globally for reasons attributed to work each year. The primary cause of death are work-related diseases such as cancer, accounting for 2 million fatalities, while occupational injuries comprise the remaining 300,000 fatalities (Takala et al., 2014, p. 326) . Non-fatal injuries tend to be under-reported, but have risen significantly in the last decade (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen et al., 2017) . The latest estimates from H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen et al. (2017, p. 11) suggest that there are 373 million work-related accidents around the world.",

Universities, in particular, have featured as sites of OHS interest, with concerns over the rising rates of work-related stress and mental illness (Morrish, 2019; Pignata et al., 2018; Winefield et al., 2008) . Growing mental health risks in academia appear to coincide with the marketisation of universities under neoliberal capitalism (Ratle et al., 2020) . A prevailing culture of 'targets and terror' (Jones et al., 2020) has institutionalised metrics-based management and exacerbated careerism, overwork, bullying, anxiety, and depression in academia (Clarke & Knights, 2015; De Vita & Case, 2016; Keashly & Neuman, 2014; Smith & Ulus, 2020) .",

In this way, the safety climate literature assumes greater responsibility for OHS on the part of the employer than more traditional approaches. For instance, this literature has promoted the importance of developing principled ethical climates in order to encourage safety-enhancing behaviours (Parboteeah & Kapp, 2008) . It has likewise been suggested that senior managers' safety behaviours may have a 'trickle down' effect and improve safety behaviours overall (Tucker et al., 2016) . The subtext of many of these studies nevertheless see individual workers as the source of danger and risk and as the primary sites for change.",

Critical and sociological perspectives are not so much interested in identifying and enhancing safety attitudes of employees, but are more concerned with the co-constitution of OHS and its links with \"the material and ideological circumstances of regulatory rules, managerial control, work processes, and social relationships\" (Zoller, 2003, p. 119) . The ideological, regulatory, managerial, organisational, and relational dimensions of OHS are important because examined together, they allow researchers to develop more holistic understandings of how workplace safety and hazards are socially constructed in organisations and informed by structures of power in the wider culture. The few critical voices in this space have shown that the dominant focus on individual factors has enabled organisations to downplay their workplace hazards and shift the responsibility for addressing and circumventing injury and illness onto employees (Fan et al., 2019; Frick, 2011; Hart, 2010) . For instance, Gifford and Holmes' (1996) study of painters recounts how employers blamed individual painters' apathy as a personal failure to accept responsibility for risk control. Meanwhile, the owners of the painting companies attempted to reduce costs by purchasing cheap and poorly maintained equipment and stocking discounted, toxic chemicals.",

In a context of growing precarity, workers face a dichotomy between health and work through what Zoller (2009) conceptualised as 'job blackmail'. The roots of this term can be traced to Kazis and Grossman (1991[1988] , p. 7) who described how companies that produced environmental hazards blamed \"faceless government bureaucrats and 'elitist' environmentalists\" for plant closures and employee lay-offs. In Zoller's (2009) use of 'job blackmail', workers are similarly enlisted as sympathetic victims by organisations against a faceless enemy. Employers persuade them that the risks of injury and illness are essential to profitability, and therefore, assuming those risks is necessary to secure their employment. Without acknowledging the unequal power between capital and labour, explorations of OHS will struggle to develop a fuller picture of the challenges to creating safe work environments (Hart, 2010; MacEachen et al., 2016) .",

Neoliberal academia is a discursive and performative space in which the ideal academic subject is formed as one who acts, speaks, thinks, produces and behaves in line with an economic rationale (Peruzzo, 2020) . Disability comes into tension with a neoliberal system that marginalises and subjugates people whose bodies do not conform to its norms (Peruzzo, 2020) .

A mutual colleague had given her my contact details, believing I could offer advice about treatment and recovery as I had also survived a back injury the year before. Indeed, when I experienced my own injury, I was surprised by the number of colleagues who disclosed their own musculoskeletal issues, lending both information and support for my recovery. As their testimonies of pain emerged out of the woodwork, I appreciated then \"the masculine structures and behaviours that are illustrative of neoliberal academia\" (Smith & Ulus, 2020, p. 2) . The prevalence of pain (both physical and psychological) that I experienced, along with a surprising number of my fellow colleagues, laid behind a fa\u00e7ade of productivity, performance, and academic 'excellence'. After corresponding for a few months, the academic, who I will refer to under the pseudonym of Ashley, suggested that I interview her about her lived experiences with her injury. We debated about whether or not she could join me in a joint autoethnographic inquiry, but in the end, she decided she would prefer to remain anonymous. This study is positioned within a social constructionist paradigm that recognises the relational and contextual nature of social reality (Burr, 2003 ; see also Berger & Luckmann, 1966) . From a social constructionist approach, I see knowledge to be produced and reproduced through ongoing processes of meaning-making between social agents. As such, knowledges around risk, health and safety, and workers' bodies are not understood as having any fixed and universal 'objective' meanings (Turner & Tennant, 2010) . Rather, this study seeks to explore the explicit and implicit meanings around these constructs as they are negotiated within particular local contexts. For example, our participation in (often) mandatory OHS training produces collective understandings of organisational 'safety'. Individual safety checks like ergonomic self-assessments reinforce assumptions about who is responsible for everyday workplace safety and injury prevention. Social cues from colleagues, such as commonplace stories of sick or injured workers coming into work anyway, delivering classes with a fever, etc., communicate tacit expectations of workers and what they ought to be able to tolerate with regards to illness and injury. These everyday experiences of organisational life then inform our understandings of work and what it means to be a 'good' employee.",

Although she had shared many details of her experiences informally with me prior to the interviews, they were opportunities to elaborate and codify the events of her injury and subsequent navigation through the organisational and regulatory frameworks. Given Ashley's understanding of research practice, our interviews were highly collaborative and unstructured.

Nevertheless, the focus here on Ashley's lived experiences is valuable as it has the potential to enrich the existing OHS literature by providing a vivid and detailed view from the perspective of an injured worker. It also supports the growing critical analysis of academia by showing how physiological and psychological harms may be exacerbated via university OHS procedures that are intended to reduce those harms.",

However, I decided to present the findings in a way that highlights Ashley's embodied and emotional testimony rather than my codified themes. Following recent trends in organisation studies rooted in long-established traditions in critical sociological research (Gilmore et al., 2019) , I present extensive excerpts in the next section to centre Ashley's voice and vividly illustrate the profound impact her injury and its management had on her health and wellbeing.",

The unspoken expectation that I'd just get over my injury and get on with my work felt like a growing impossibility with the intense and persistent pain. I finally caught the health and safety coordinator on the phone four weeks after my injury. She was cheery and warm on the phone but had a habit of repeating my name in every sentence like a telemarketer. I relayed my physiotherapist's advice and she advised that any adjustments I needed with my work can be directly negotiated with my manager as long as they're supported by medical statements. I immediately emailed my physiotherapist after and asked him to put his advice in writing to say I should only do tasks during which I can freely sit, stand, and move about. I battled between pain and guilt, and eventually, I asked my manager if I could be relieved from tutorials where I would have the least flexibility to move around or take breaks. I offered to continue taking my lectures even though privately, I worried about how I would climb the stairs to get to the theatre and feared being overwhelmed with pain in front of my students. I kept imagining my brokenness exposed to students if I collapsed on the floor of the theatre, screaming and crying from pain as I did in my bedroom waiting for the ambulance.

She explained that the university can't make accommodations on the advice of a physiotherapist and they needed a letter from a doctor instead to answer a series of questions about my diagnosis, prognosis, and workplace adjustment requirements, with a summary statement concluding \"whether you are fit to perform the inherent requirement of your role\". I was irritated that these instructions hadn't been specified at our first call. She had said nothing about a doctor let alone the template of questions. But I also began questioning myself. The disconnect between our two conversations were so stark. I wondered if my pain was affecting my interpretations or my memories of conversations with the health and safety coordinator. Maybe she did send me these questions, but I forgot? Maybe I got confused and accidentally told her I'll get her a letter from my GP? My manager was amused. When debriefing about this sudden change in plans, he shares how the health and safety coordinator calls him after every phone call with me to verify my claims. He imitates her furtive questioning, whispering \"is Ashley really allowed to be working from home?\" and laughs at her ignorance about academic work. Meanwhile, students are emailing me every day asking what is happening with our classes every time I bear the pangs of guilt to say, \"I don't know\". My chronic pain became constant and unbearable, exacerbated by the uncertainty and stress of the situation. When I returned to my GP with the set of questions from the health and safety coordinator, she was unimpressed. She asked me to describe all my work tasks and concluded in her letter that I ought to \"participate only in work that allows regular sit/stand breaks as required based on her symptoms and has capacity to work in aspects of her current role that does not involve teaching\". I dreaded telling my manager the news. As I was leaving her office, she asked me point blank, \"Are you sure I can't be filling out a workers compensation report for you?\". Her question stumped me. I went home and reviewed the OHS flowchart. It specified that it is the employer's responsibility to lodge a notice with the insurer within 48 hours of a worker reporting their injury. I assumed then my case must be ineligible, but the question nagged at me. The health and safety coordinator called me immediately after she received the medical certificate, her friendly demeanour is strained, her suspicion and impatience barely concealed. \"But why would the doctor say you can't teach?\" \"I gave her your questions and that is her professional recommendation\". \"So, if you can't teach, what are you supposed to do?\" I began telling her about my research, the book I was working on, a grant I received, the service roles I still fulfilled.

As such, as long as academics are conscious, they can and should work; overcoming any physical limitations through self-governance with indiscernible disruptions to their productivity (Ruth et al., 2018) . These expectations of academic productivity are entwined with an individualist logic (Ratle et al., 2020) . Ashley's account suggests a persistent assumption from others, and herself, that she ought to get over any disturbances to her work and get on with her work tasks. Ashley unquestioningly accepted personal responsibility for addressing and circumventing the physical restrictions of her 'failed', injured body (Fan et al., 2019; Frick, 2011; Gifford & Holmes, 1996; Hart, 2010) , such as when she purchased a sit-stand desk at her own expense immediately after her injury so that she could continue to coordinate teaching relief and answer emails from home, even during her sick leave. Ashley was complicit with this disciplinary regime in initially offering to continue delivering lectures even though she knew she could not cope with sustaining a task for two hours without breaks. Her self-disciplining tendency was then used against her to cast doubt on the doctor's assessment that she was unfit for teaching and the rehabilitation manager's recommendation that Ashley only work 35 h/week during her recovery.",

Within these expectations, universities and their human resource departments can partially evade their legal obligations and duty of care. Organisational ethics thus broke down in the division between policy and practice. The policies outlined the employers' OHS responsibilities, yet academic norms and practices compelled academics to become self-governing subjects who take personal responsibility to overcome any barriers to their never-ending production of capital for the institution (Brown, 2020) .

Her manager and multiple senior colleagues perpetuated the assumptions that illness and injury ought to be borne by the individual academic and that when they could not endure their conditions without disruption, they were told they would cause 'pain' to their colleagues who needed to cover their research, teaching, or administrative tasks. Being in pain was equivalent to being a pain. As such, Ashley's experience shows that job blackmail (Zoller, 2009) need not be an overt and deliberate act on the part of employers but can be a subtle and pernicious aspect of academic culture. In academia, the dualism between jobs versus health (Zoller, 2009 ) is invoked when universities marginalise unhealthy and 'failing' bodies (Peruzzo, 2020) . Academics are then pitted against one another with employers relying on relational bonds and responsibilities between colleagues to encourage self-and peer-regulation of productivity. When responsibilities of sick and injured academics are thrusted onto their colleagues, workers like Ashley may feel that they are harming their colleagues when they require OHS support. Ashley's teaching activities were eventually taken up by casual staff rather than delegated to full-time colleagues as unpaid overtime. Yet the threat that colleagues would be shouldering 'her' burden was enough to make Ashley feel as though she was letting her department down, even when her condition was caused by her excessive workload in the first instance.",

The dominant norms and practices in this context enable employers to leverage a more subtle and diffuse form of job blackmail (Zoller, 2009) , where they are able to rely on the self-disciplining regime in academia to see individual employees take over responsibility for overcoming bodily limitations, navigating regulatory frameworks, and managing their own recoveries with minimal impact on university operations. This study of an injured academic shows how the ideological, regulatory, managerial, organisational, and relational dimensions of OHS are important because examined together, they allow researchers to develop more holistic understandings of how workplace safety and hazards are socially and politically constructed in organisations.",

Her university remembered her as a \"passionate and dedicated teacher\".

Given Ashley's account of ethical malpractice on the part of her employer, it did not seem advisable in this sensitive case to pursue interviews with the employer and expose Ashley as a whistleblower. As such, the study can only be considered to provide insight into an injured worker's experience and perception of care (and its lack thereof) in the individualising OHS systems of a neoliberal university, and the effects on her physical and psychosocial health.

I was working more days from home but my manager, my primary contact within the department, stopped communicating with me. Even days I came into the office, he struggled to look me in the eye. Given how casually he disclosed my colleague's injury to me, I wondered to how many of my colleagues he had griped about my injury. Around that time, my physiotherapist told me that there were no physiological reasons why my back muscles would continue to be inflamed three months after my injury except that my stress at work was impeding my physical recovery. My GP wrote me a referral for a psychologist. She stated on my medical certificate that \"ongoing workplace resistance and obstructiveness impacted psychosocial rehabilitation\". My mother gently suggested if I could just resign from my job and focus on my health. I replied that I wished I had just died instead.",
