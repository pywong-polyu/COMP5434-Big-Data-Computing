            "text": "As an occupational group, clergy exhibit numerous physical health problems. Given the physical health problems faced by clergy, understanding where physical health falls within the priorities of seminary students, the ways students conceptualize physical health, and how seminary students do or do not attend to their physical health in the years immediately prior to becoming clergy, can inform intervention development for both seminary students and clergy. Moreover, understanding and shaping the health practices of aspiring clergy may be particularly impactful, with cascading effects, as clergy serve as important role models for their congregants. Drawing on 36 in-depth, qualitative interviews with first-year seminary students, this study examines the complex dynamics between religious frameworks related to physical health, explicit intentions to maintain healthy practices, and reported physical health behaviors. Our findings suggest that even students who deploy religious frameworks in relation to their physical health-and who, as a result, possess positive intentions to implement and maintain healthy behaviors-often report being unable to live up to their aspirations, especially in the face of barriers to health practices posed by the seminary program itself. After reviewing these findings, we offer suggestions for physical health focused interventions, including action and coping planning, which could be implemented at seminaries to reduce the intention-behavior gap and improve clergy health.",

This research literature has implications for intentions formed in religious contexts, which may be both morally coded and identity based, and leads us to anticipate that when physical health and healthy behaviors are given transcendent meaning through religious frameworks, a reduction in the intention-behavior gap would follow .",

These interviews are part of a larger longitudinal study of the experiences of divinity students preparing for careers in religious ministry. All students entering masters level programs at Duke Divinity School in 2019 were invited to participate in a longitudinal series of surveys; 75 percent of eligible students completed all three surveys. We then used stratified random sampling to select M.Div. students from the pool of survey respondents and invited them to participate in a longitudinal series of interviews. In total, we invited 48 students and 75 percent (n = 36) of these students agreed to participate. The final interview sample was representative of the larger M.Div. class in terms of gender, race, and denominational affiliation. Of the 36 students, 75 percent (n = 27) were ages 21 to 29 years old, 78 percent were White (n = 28), 56 percent were female (n = 20), and 47 percent (n = 17) were United Methodist.

In the physical health portion of the interview, we asked students to describe their personal philosophy on physical health as well as their current and pre-seminary health practices including exercise, sleep, and diet (see online supplement for full set of relevant questions). Interviews were audio-recoded with students' explicit oral consent and transcribed verbatim. Potentially identifying information was redacted from the transcripts prior to analysis, and participants were assigned pseudonyms. Students received a $50 gift card as compensation for their time.

A team of three analysts met to discuss coding discrepancies and establish inter-coder reliability. During this time, the structural codebook was refined and transcripts re-coded as needed. This paper is based on a second round of inductive, thematic coding conducted on transcript portions identified as relevant to the topic of \"physical health.\" On average, this topic covered a fifth of the full interview (with a range of 14-28% code coverage). Two analysts reviewed this material to identify emergent themes and collaboratively developed a thematic codebook. These content-based codes were then applied to the text by a single analyst to ensure consistency in code application. Themes related to physical health were summarized in analytical memos.",

In total, 19 of the 36 interviewees (53%) made a connection between their faith and their physical health during the interview. In several different ways, students described caring for their bodies as a spiritual responsibility and saw their bodies and/or their physical health \"through the lens of faith\" (Doug). Some respondents discussed their physical health through the language of stewardship. For example, Sharice said the following about her body: \"It's a gift and it's my responsibility to maintain that gift. I don't want to live my life in a manner in which I am asking God for miracles for something that I just need to steward well.\" Logan also used the language of stewardship. She reported, \"You're a steward over your body the way you are a steward over that [your mental health], and everything else. To me, it is important to maintain good physical health and wellness.\" Karen shared a similar perspective: \"Well, 'God only gave you one body, and you need to take care of it,' I guess is my overall philosophy \u2026 Get enough sleep, eat properly, get exercise.\" These students describe their bodies as a gift from God, one which they are tasked with caring for and maintaining. Under this framework, healthy behaviors, such as eating properly and exercising, become a means to \"honor God,\" as one student, Josh, told us.",

In fact, participants felt that some philosophies, rooted in theological ideas that emphasize the separation between the physical and the spiritual, explicitly discourage people-pastors and/or the laity-from prioritizing their physical health. Generally speaking, however, we found that religiously infused physical health philosophies (e.g., gift, temple, foundation) tended to be associated with positive personal values and intentions toward healthy behaviors. In other words, students used religious frames, such as stewardship and/or the body as a temple, to describe physical health as a Christian responsibility and/or as a foundation for spiritual well-being and formation and, as a result, these students aspired to enact healthy practices.",

In this section, we build on our core findings (as outlined above) to offer several proposals for action. First, our findings-in line with existing research Jacobson, 2014; Webb et al., 2013) -suggest that religious frames vary in terms of the degree to which they encourage people to prioritize or de-prioritize physical health. Seminaries that aim to promote physical health among their students should explicitly encourage religious frames that promote health and actively counter those that do not (Walther et al., 2015) . In doing so, seminaries can also explicitly communicate the importance of physical health to being a successful religious leader. Frames which link identity to physical health practices, like those that link religious leadership, ministry, and calling with health, would likely be most successful in reducing the gap between intentions and behaviors (Rhodes et al., 2016; Sheeran & Orbell, 2000) . Brandon's comment in the section above suggests that this is already happening to some degree within the Duke program and has had an impact on students' beliefs and intentions in relation to physical health practices. Our findings demonstrating variation in students' use of religious frames, however, suggest that there is room for seminaries to further promote this perspective.",

One model, which distinguishes action planning and coping planning (Sniehotta et al., 2005) , seems particularly promising. Action planning \"can help initiate action by specifying when, where and how to act\" (Sniehotta et al., 2005) . Coping planning, on the other hand, asks participants to imagine potential barriers to desired actions and develop detailed plans for overcoming them. As prospective forms of self-regulation, both action and coping planning require time and resources. We suggest that seminaries encourage and provide opportunities for concrete action and coping planning as part of broader efforts to improve health among seminary students and clergy.

He reported, \"I can't just do that. I need to be living healthier, eating healthier, working out, not just sitting on the couch.\" However, the intention to do better next time may not be enough. David could benefit from engaging in both concrete action and coping planning. To do so, David would first further clarify his desired actions and intentions. What would it look like to live and eat healthier? What does \"working out\" look like for David, and when and where will he do so? Action planning involves translating vague aspirations (\"living healthier\") into concrete and specific behavioral intentions. Second, David would imagine the kinds of barriers he is likely to face in maintaining healthy behaviors and then outline detailed strategies for what to do when and where those challenges occur. For example, if David is often invited by congregants to talk over a meal, he could have ready a list of places with healthy options. Or, he could review menus of common meeting spots in advance to identify the healthiest options so that he does not need to rely on an in-the-moment decision. When attending church functions where he anticipates there will not be healthy options-and where refusing what has been offered would be considered rude-David could have a clear plan to limit portion size and skip dessert (or take a doggie bag home). If David anticipates that he may often be on the road between visits or churches, he could prepare by always keeping healthy snacks in his car and office. Anticipating these challenges in advance and devising strategies for dealing with them eliminates the need to deliberate in-the-moment when it is more difficult to make good choices.",

Ideally, planning-related interventions would occur during orientation or even sooner, so students can identify local exercise options and test out healthy on-the-go snacks and meals. Recognizing that graduate school is a busy, stressful time, this planning process could make students aware of the health facts most relevant to them, such as: stress fuels increased eating and also increased weight retention; the physical cues of tiredness and thirst are often misinterpreted as hunger, leading to more eating; physical activity in general and not just \"exercise\" has been shown to be good for health; and physical activity as well as sleep can help one's mind work better. Relevant planning could then follow-for example, making a list of relatively easy-to-prepare and enjoyable meals that can be brought to campus, or scheduling walks and frequent but brief physical activity while studying.",

One approach would be to help students discern their hopes and values related to graduate school in advance, and to foster a growth mindset. A growth mindset is the belief that one's intellectual abilities are not set but can instead be shaped. Students who believe that intelligence is fixed have higher levels of cortisol, a stress indicator, when grades are declining (Lee et al., 2019) . In contrast, college students with a growth mindset in a recent study experienced less stress during online learning caused by COVID-19 policies (Mosanya, 2021) . Seminary faculty could remind students at key points during the semester that: learning challenges are expected in graduate school; students, with effort, will grow and learn; and feeling challenged is appropriate and does not signal any lack of appropriateness of being in graduate school. Faculty could repeatedly send the message that the true measure of success is growth, not grades. This perspective may help students keep the larger picture of their holistic formation in mind and prevent them from abandoning healthy practices to prioritize good grades.",

            "text": "Importantly, seminaries (and denominations) could also consider broader changes that would make it easier for students (and clergy) to maintain healthy behaviors. Community health capacity models suggest there are three interrelated processes for promoting health: (1) activating existing community resources for health, for example, in the form of individuals' expertise and the setting's infrastructure; (2) expanding the community's health-promoting assets; and (3) empowering community members, in this case, students, to control health problems and priorities (Stokols et al., 2003) . Steps one and two typically involve changes at the extra-individual level, for example, at interpersonal, community, institutional, and policy levels (McLeroy et al., 1988) . The current study can provide guidance on areas to target. For example, we found that seminary itself, which mirrors life as a pastoral leader (Carroll, 2006; Carroll et al., 2014) , by nature of having inconsistent days, heavy workload, and disrupted routines, gets in the way of student's ability to maintain healthy behaviors. While inconsistent days may be inevitable, seminaries might preserve a mid-day hour for exercise and offer a room for students to lead an exercise class, should they choose. Seminaries might subsidize healthy food options or make them easily accessible on campus, while also offering a fridge and healthy options in campus vending machines. Building in an occasional class-free weekday that is a 'break day' or 'catch up' day might help relieve some pressure. These kinds of structural changes shift the burden of maintaining healthy practices off of individuals and onto institutions and communities.",

In an unpublished study, we had students log their observations during internship placements and debrief twice (mid-summer and end-of-summer). Students named many health lessons about what they hoped to do (and not do) once on the job. In a similar program, students could be encouraged to observe how their pastor-mentor handles a variety of health-related aspects, from negotiating the potluck line to vacation-taking. Finally, there is strong evidence for the efficacy of peer support in health behaviors (Ginis et al., 2013) . In a seminary setting, the school could pair upperclassman with incoming students and set a schedule for them to meet for general advice and support, including instructions to discuss sleep, exercise, eating, and how to handle high-stress periods. Alternatively, during orientation, students could sign up for a kind of exercise they like, such as walking or running, and the seminary could facilitate an initial event where students have a chance to identify potential exercise partners. These are just some of the many possibilities. Ultimately, a combination of supports for student health at individual, interpersonal, and institutional levels will yield the best results (Paskett et al., 2016; Stokols et al., 2003) .",

This study therefore supports recent work on the intention-behavior gap (Sheeran & Webb, 2016) . Still, religious frames that actively discourage a focus on the body and physical health are likely to translate into lower buy-in for students in the kinds of interventions we suggest. We have argued that planning-based interventions would likely work best when combined with exposure to and engagement with theological ideas that position the body and its care as a spiritual responsibility. Moreover, we argue that programs targeting student health are most likely to be successful if they take a multi-pronged and multi-level approach, addressing individual, social, cultural, and institutional barriers to healthy behaviors.",

First, seminary programs may be a particularly effective time and place to change health practices. Seminary students are a relatively captive audience, one that is particularly amenable and open to new ways of thinking and doing. Likewise, seminary students-especially those who attend residential programs-are, by definition, in a transitional period. As students transition into the program, their prior routines and habits are disrupted. While this can present a challenge to pre-existing health routines, it can also serve as an opportunity for students without those routines to consciously and deliberately establish new, healthy habits and/or eliminate unhealthy ones. Finally, seminaries may be particularly well-suited (relative to other kinds of graduate programs) to offer didactic courses that encourage health through a combination of transcendent (theological) framing and practical strategies.",

Both have fragmented days (Proeschold-Bell et al., 2011) , which makes it hard to establish patterns and feel like work is being accomplished. Both feel called to their work, which makes it likely that they will routinely over-extend themselves Proeschold-Bell & Byassee, 2018) . In other words, the very identity that might encourage students to adopt a theological framework of health may also encourage them to sacrifice sleep and other healthy behaviors. Students and clergy both lack time to prepare nutritious meals, and clergy in particular have frequent evening meetings and a lot of driving to pastoral visits (Carroll, 2006) . Helping students ingrain healthy behaviors during the difficult rhythm and demands of graduate school may well help them sustain healthy behaviors later as clergy.",

As trusted leaders and authorities, clergy and chaplains can be influential role models for their congregants and wider community, potentially leading to broader ripple effects. But the impact of pastors on the behaviors of those under their care depends on whether or not clergy \"practice what they preach\" (Anshel & Smith, 2014; Bopp et al., 2013) . Seminaries, as spaces in which aspiring clergy are being formed (their values and approaches to ministry), have the power to make positive and lasting impacts on clergy's values and beliefs related to physical health, establishing a foundation that can shape whether and how they make physical health a priority, not only in their personal lives but also in their ministry. Despite this potential, recent research suggests that \"there is a relative lack of health promotion resources available to seminary students\" and \"environmental and policy supports for health also were relatively minimal (smoking, vending machine policies)\" (Bopp & Baruth, 2014 . Interviews with clergy across denominations report minimal or no instruction on health during seminary training and a desire for greater focus on self-care .

For one, the struggles and challenges faced by Divinity school students may also be common among other graduate and professional students in other fields. Clinical psychology graduate students have shown a reluctance to practicing selfcare themselves, despite their goal of increasing the well-being of clients (Schwartz-Mette, 2009 ). Medical and dentistry students globally have adequate knowledge about health and the importance of healthy behaviors, and yet fall short in applying this knowledge personally (Tufail et al., 2020) . A study of 2,683 graduate students across all graduate programs at two large public United States universities found they sleep an average of 6.4 h per night, with 38% indicating less than good sleep quality; both sleep duration and quality buffered emotional exhaustion, a component of burnout (Allen et al., 2021) . Regardless of field, facilitating healthy behaviors is an important aspect of setting students up for success during graduate school and beyond.
