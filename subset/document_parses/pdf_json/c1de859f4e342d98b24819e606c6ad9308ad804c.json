We aimed to evaluate the genetic profile of TLR pathway-related key genes; the myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MYD88), IL1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), the nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NFKB1), and interleukin 6 (IL6) in the blood of neonates with sepsis at the time of admission and post-treatment for the available paired-samples. This case-control study included 124 infants with sepsis admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and 17 controls. The relative gene expressions were quantified by TaqMan Real-Time qPCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 relative expressions were significantly higher in sepsis cases than controls. Higher levels of MYD88 and IL6 were found in male neonates and contributed to the sex-based separation of the cases by the principal component analysis. ROC analysis revealed MYD88 and NFKB1 transcripts to be good biomarkers for sepsis. Furthermore, patients with high circulatory MYD88 levels were associated with poor survival, as revealed by Kaplan-Meier curves analysis. MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 transcripts showed association with different poor-outcome manifestations. Clustering analysis split the patient cohort into three distinct groups according to their transcriptomic signature and CRP levels. In conclusion, the study TLR pathway-related transcripts have a gender-specific signature, diagnostic, and prognostic clinical utility in neonatal sepsis.",

Activation of TLRs, as shown in Fig. 1 , recruit several downstream adaptor molecules, including the major player \"myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88)\", which contributes to signaling amplification through interleukin-receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family proteins. Convergence of IRAK at the NF\u03baB induces the transcription of interleukin 6 (IL6) that counteracts the threat imposed by the invaders and participates in stimulating other immune components 5,8-10 . Identifying the molecular profile of these genetic signatures may provide novel diagnostic/prognostic clinical utility and/or predict neonatal outcomes. In this sense, the present work aimed to evaluate the genetic profile of TLR pathway-related key players (i.e. MYD88, IRAK1, NFKB, and IL6) in the blood of neonates at the time of admission and after antibiotic treatment (for three days) to evaluate the change in gene expression signature and to correlate the expression levels with the available clinic-laboratory findings. | (2021) 11:13374 | https://doi.",

Both study groups were matched for baseline demographic parameters such as age at sampling (2 \u00b1 1.1 days versus 3.3 \u00b1 3.9, p = 0.17), gestational age (37.1 \u00b1 1.9 weeks versus 36 \u00b1 3.6 weeks, p = 0.22), and birth weight (2.6 \u00d7 10-3 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10-3 g versus 2.4 \u00d7 10-3 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10-3 g, p = 0.16) in cases and controls, respectively. Of the sepsis cases, 93 were early-onset (onset of sepsis features within 72 h of life), while 31 neonates presented with late-onset sepsis (onset of sepsis features after 72 h of life). Comparison between male and female patients is presented in Table 1 . A higher frequency of premature rupture of membranes was observed in male newborns (42% vs. 23 .3%, p = 0.049). In male Figure 1 . Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. On exposure to pathogens secreting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), their recognition is initiated via pattern recognition receptors, including several Toll-like receptors (TLRs). For example, lipopolysaccharides on gram-negative bacteria activate TLR4, lipoteichoic acid of gram-positive bacteria activates TLR2, while TLR3 recognizes viral PAMPs, generating innate immune responses via the MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines with activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) and the downstream gene targets 9, 10 . The MyD88independent pathway associated with the induction of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible genes [Data source: KEGG pathway, hsa04620 and created by Biorender.com]. Bioinformatic selection of Toll-like receptor pathway. The transcriptomic analysis of 324 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 305 upregulated and 19 downregulated genes in preterm infants during late-onset sepsis, is shown in Figure S1 . Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs identified TLR signaling pathway (hsa04620 | hits = 13 out of 104 | FDR = 7.93e\u22125) and NFKB signaling pathway (hsa04064 | hits = 12 out of 100 | FDR = 1.83e\u22124) to be the top deregulated pathways (Table S1 ). A total of 73 gene hits involved in pathways is depicted in the gene heat map ( Figure S2 ). For the Toll-like receptor pathway, CCL3L3, CCL4, CXCL8, IL1B, IRAK4, IRF7, MAP2K6, MYD88, NFKBIA, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 genes were significantly enriched. As shown in Fig. 1 , MYD88, IRAK4, and NFKBIA genes master a cascade of signaling transduction which leads to the expression of many inflammatory genes for cytokines, chemokines, endothelial adhesion molecules, and costimulatory molecules. NFKBIA gene was iterated in 9 out of the 10 top pathways, MYD88 gene was enriched in 3 pathways, and IRAK4 was the only gene located on chromosome X. Their diagnostic accuracy was compared to IL6, which is used in our hospital protocol as a gold standard test for inflammatory reaction in sepsis.",

Stratification analyses by sex and time of onset of the disease and comparing paired samples at admission with the second blood sample three days after treatment are shown. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 , across all neonates, relative expression levels of MYD88 (p < 0.001), NFKB1 (p < 0.001), and IL6 (p = 0.027) were significantly higher in sepsis cases compared to controls. Higher levels of MYD88 (p < 0.001) and IL6 (p < 0.001) were found in male infants compared to females. None of the gene levels were significantly altered after receiving treatment. Clustering of patients into distinct phenotypes. Sepsis patients exhibited a different pattern of gene expression combinations. Gene co-expression analysis across the 124 sepsis cohorts showed that IL6 gene expression was directly correlated to MYD88 (r = 0.26, p = 0.004) and NFKB1 (r = 0.19, p = 0.039) transcript levels ( Fig. 3A ). Clustering analysis split cohorts into three distinct groups according to their transcriptomic signature and CRP levels; cluster 1 included 67 infants with low IRAK1 gene expression, cluster 2 including 49 neonates Association of gene expression levels with clinical characteristics of the patients.

For www.nature.com/scientificreports/ patients, which were persisted across the different stages of sepsis 13, 14 . Adib-Conquya et al. also reported a significant upregulation of MyD88s in monocytes of septic patients compared to either resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest or healthy controls. Their transfection experiments identified that the short form of \"MyD88\" could negatively regulate \"TLR2-dependent NF-B response\" 15 . Furthermore, Khailova et al. confirmed the significant increase of MyD88 with other assessed TLR pathway-related molecules (TLR-2 and NF\u039a) in the lungs of septic mice model of cecal ligation and puncture peritonitis relative to healthy shams 16 . This overexpression was ameliorated on \"Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG\" or \"Bifidobacterium longum\" probiotic treatment. The present finding of MYD88 upregulation showed sex disparity with significantly higher levels in male neonates than females, contributing to the previous observations in which females exhibited a less exaggerated immune response than males 17, 18 . While the exact mechanism underlying this observation is not conclusive, hormonal and epigenetic factors were proposed to contribute to this phenomenon by impacting the pathogenspecific inflammatory responses (particularly lipopolysaccharides) and the immunological differences [18] [19] [20] . Naugler et al. have found that \"MYD88-dependent activation of IL6 production\" could be negatively regulated by estrogen in their model of hepatocellular carcinoma induced by liver inflammation 21 . Estrogen has displayed a suppressive effect on inflammation, mainly via downregulating the NFKB1 transcriptional activity with a subsequent decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, including IL6 [22] [23] [24] . El Sabeh et al., in their recent preprint, revealed that MYD88/estrogen receptor-\u03b1 interaction during the inflammatory signaling might contribute to the gender-dependent bias in the inflammatory response 25 . In addition, Crisostomo et al. identified that the stimulated female-derived murine mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated less inflammatory response, including IL6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 production, compared with the male-derived ones 26 . All these observations, including ours, highlight the importance of running \"sex-based therapeutic interventions,\" which will improve neonatal outcomes, particularly in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) 27 .",

Also, it was difficult to find healthy preterm neonates during sample collection in our hospital and obtain parental consent for sample withdraw in such cases (if any); hence, this study included full-term neonates as a control group. This issue (matched case-control groups regards the gestational age) should be considered in future studies. Furthermore, because of the small volume of blood collected in this work, the authors could only investigate the expression of the studied genes at the level of mRNA. It would be useful to demonstrate the protein levels of the studied genes in future studies as the mRNA levels may not always reflect the corresponding protein expression due to the posttranscriptional processing. Indeed, the role of other genetic/epigenetic and environmental factors should be considered.",

Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, clinically relevant sex-based therapeutic strategies should be implicated as adjunct approaches to the ordinary ones to increase the potentially favorable outcomes in male neonates. 42 and expected to be diagnosed clinically as neonatal sepsis were included. Neonates with a gestational age below 28 weeks, a history of perinatal hypoxia, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, or gross congenital anomalies and genetic syndromes were excluded. If mothers had positive hepatitis C or B infection or were known to have a history of misuse drug intake during pregnancy, the neonates were also excluded. The controls included 17 samples of healthy full-term neonates collected in the same period during the routine screening of serum bilirubin. Because of the difficulty of blood sampling in some neonates, the drop-out sample (due to non-survivors), and the mother's non-approval for including a second sampling of their neonates, only 43 paired samples were available for the comparison.",

Extraction of total RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMN) cells was done using a Qiagen RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Cat No. 74106), following the manufacturer's protocol. All samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. RNA concentration and purity at A260:A280 ratios were determined by NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Tech., Inc. Wilmington, DE, USA) followed by agarose gel electrophoresis check for RNA integrity. For reverse transcription (RT) reaction, High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (P/N 4368814, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used.
