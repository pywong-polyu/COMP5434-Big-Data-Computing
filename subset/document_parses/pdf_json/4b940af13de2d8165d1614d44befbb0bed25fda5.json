The fast outbreak of Covid-19 and the wide spread all over the world transformed a local disease, initially located in China, into a global problem; thus the name: pandemic (Fauci et al., 2020) . Italy (60.5 million inhabitants) is one of the most plagued nations by this pandemic with almost 28000 official deaths in the hospitals (as of 30-apr-2020) and over 4000 ICU beds to treat patients at the peak of Covid-19 emergency (Livingston & Bucher, 2020; Remuzzi & Remuzzi, 2020) . Likewise, Lombardy (10 million inhabitants) is the most crowded region of Italy and the most hit and afflicted region of Europe with over 13800 official deaths in the hospitals and almost 1400 ICU beds (Grasselli et al., 2020a; Grasselli et al., 2020b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 262, "end": 282, "text": "(Fauci et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 516, "end": 543, "text": "(Livingston & Bucher, 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 544, "end": 568, "text": "Remuzzi & Remuzzi, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 773, "end": 798, "text": "(Grasselli et al., 2020a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 799, "end": 823, "text": "Grasselli et al., 2020b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Before the pandemic, the number of ICU beds for any treatments in Lombardy was about 700 (Grasselli et al., 2020a; Manca, 2020a) and in winter months those beds are usually 85-90% occupied (Grasselli et al., 2020a) . The pandemic called for doubling that number at an incredible pace to cope with the repeated tsunami waves of very complicated patients affected by DIP (i.e. diffuse interstitial pneumonia). Those patients required ever-increasing treatments ranging from oxygen masks, to helmet C-PAP, to NIV, and eventually tracheal intubation (Desai & Aronoff, 2020) . In some hospitals, such as the Lodi hospital in Lombardy (the one where the first Covid-19 italian patient was diagnosed and sheltered in ICU, a 38 year-old sporty male with no comorbidities who remained in the ICU ward for 18 days before moving to PIP, i.e. post-intensive care, for other 14 days) before the pandemic there were 6 ICU beds (Cutuli, 2020) . In a matter of few weeks, the beds became 18 and eventually 27 at the peak of the emergency (i.e. 4.5 times more). This called for huge efforts in terms of burden on medical doctors, nurses, and managing team that literally transformed the original wards, operating rooms, and recovery rooms to set up and operate that high number of new ICU beds. The mathematical models describing the phenomenon dynamics, which are reported in this paper, have allowed understanding the fast evolution and preparing daily for the continuously increasing burden. Besides the predicted numbers, those models allowed also forecasting the different phases of the pandemic and quantifying some basic indicators about the daily variations, the key times, the key figures, the expected decrease, the progressive reach of a maximum plateau before facing with the decrease of ICU beds for Covid-19 which we are measuring right now.

The \"saturation\" term means that the capacity of daily increasing the number of beds, to cope with the tsunami wave of new patients requiring an ICU treatment, was lower than the compulsory number of new ICU beds.

It is rather easy to show that a phenomenon is exponential when it fits a straight line in a semilogarithmic diagram (i.e. a diagram where x-axis is linear (time, number of days) and y-axis reports the logarithm of the real values (ICU beds).

This is the case of the so-called exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) trend (Golubev, 2010) . On a standard Cartesian plane, the phenomenon is well described by two distinct regions. The first one with upward concavity and the second one with downward concavity. The upward concavity reflects the exponential trend that becomes progressively linear at the inflection point where the concavity changes from upward to downward. At the inflection point, the maximum positive velocity of change occurs. In math terms, we say that at the inflection point the first derivative (i.e. maximum daily change of the observed variable, ICU beds) has the highest positive slope (i.e. maximum increment). These are the toughest days to stand the tsunami wave as day over day the increment of ICU beds is the highest one. In addition, the bigger the region/country with its number of infected patients, the higher its inertia. After the inflection point, the phenomenon continues to increase but at a slower pace. In this phase, the increase is monotonic, which means that the number of ICU beds continues to climb, but the daily growth reduces progressively up to a maximum plateau (around days 39-43). Again, the inertia of the system is usually high and instead of having a train at the top of a rollercoaster that quickly starts falling, the plateau remains stable for a few days. That maximum plateau is critical for the whole system as the ICU stay is rather long (Murthy et al., 2020) . Usually, patients remain in ICU wards at least fifteen days (with twenty-day stay the standard value) (Cutuli, 2020) and, respect to Covid-19 emergency, this quite a long time allows describing the whole ICU beds inflation period with curves such as the logistic (Hosmer et al., 2013) or the Gompertz (Panik, 2014) ones. At the maximum plateau, small oscillations may occur but finally the system starts decreasing (days 42-45). The reverse trend of the first ascending period occurs in this second descending phase up to a final null value when the pandemic is out. When the descent starts, the concavity is downward and becomes upward after a new inflection point (with negative slope, i.e. downhill).

It is straightforward to remark that these are predictions based on a mathematical model that is subject to the availability of reliable data. The more the real data the better. Indeed, every day the national and regional reports release new data and one can carry out forecasts that are more reliable. In addition, the model forecasts ground on the assumption that future values will be registered and made available according to the same boundary conditions in terms of social distancing measures and data collection conditions.

He had to wait 46 days from the first positive swab). Therefore, the total number of swabs is not representative of the number of people tested. In addition, a large number of probably infected people have not been tested with a swab and nonetheless have to undergo a quarantine of at least 14 days.

Second, these models can be used to predict the evolution of the phenomenon over either short or long-term horizons. During the very first tough days, the most important forecasts are required over short-time intervals to understand the doubling times of ICU beds and allocate/prepare suitable resources to cope with the repeated tsunami waves of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. When the pressure is at least partially released, the models can be used to predict when some safer thresholds will be reached. In those cases, it will be possible to decrease the number of Covid-19 beds, to close dedicated wards, to reallocate human resources, to restart elective hospital activities that were intentionally shutdown or reduced to the minimum to focus on the demanding emergency.

The mathematics behind the proposed models is rather simple and can be implemented in an Excel file that can be used by most decision makers and medical doctors. Based on real data that most countries/regions produce daily, these regression models can be identified in terms of their adaptive parameters and used to forecast the trends of ICU and deaths on either short or longterm horizons.
