Therefore, understanding the willingness of a community to receive a COVID-19 vaccine will help to develop and implement effective means of promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Objectives: This study was aimed to assess the willingness of the Ethiopian population to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and its determinant factors. Methods: E-survey was conducted from February 2021 to March 2021. After developing the questionnaire, the template was created on Google Forms and disseminated in public on different social media channels (e.g., Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook, email, etc.) by using a shareable link. Descriptive statistics were performed. Finally, multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to assess their relationship with socio-demographic factors. Results: In total, 31.4% (n = 372) of respondents were willing to get a vaccine. One-third of respondents, 32.2% (n = 381), reported that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Almost all 94.9% (n = 1124) responded that health workers should be vaccinated first. Only 21.7% (n = 257) willing to buy the vaccine if it is not provided free.

            "text": "COVID-19 vaccines were manufactured within one year after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be an international public health emergency. Due to remarkable determination in vaccine research, development, and production, COVID-19 vaccines were developed within the shortest period in the history of vaccine production. 1 The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility is striving to deliver a minimum 2 billion doses of vaccine to concerned countries around the world in 2021, which includes at least 1.3 billion doses funded by donors to the 92 lower-income countries. 2 As a component of the above actions, AstraZeneca vaccines manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) were delivered to Ethiopia on 6 March 2021 with the aim of curbing a recent spike in COVID-19 infections. 3 COVAX facility allocated 7,620,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine for Ethiopia of which about 2,184,000 doses were already received. 4 Under the current global distribution plan, 5.4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine are expected to reach Ethiopia by May 2021. As per the Ministry of Health's aim, 20% of the population in Ethiopia is planned to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. 5 Despite these efforts to decrease the burden of COVID-19 through vaccination and other measures, vaccine reluctance is increasing worldwide and hindering efforts to control its spread. 6 The main sources of this vaccine hesitancy may be due to a substantial amount of misinformation regarding the COVID-19 vaccine circulating on social media, 7 which is augmented by an existing general high level of vaccine misinformation. 8 The WHO now considers vaccine hesitancy as a major danger to world health, due to its substantial increase. 8 Vaccine hesitancy specifically towards the COVID-19 vaccine is mainly due to its accelerated development which contributes to the wrong impression that the vaccine might not be appropriately verified for safety and efficacy. 9 Even health workers who were expected to be models for others and prioritized for the vaccine at the start, are not all convinced to take the vaccine in Ethiopia. 5 Therefore the understanding of communities' readiness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and the main factors influencing their attitudes towards it will help to develop and implement effective means of promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake and to curb the recent alarming increase in COVID-19 infections.",

Respondents' occupation and religion were also asked. They were also asked whether their occupation is healthrelated or not. Additionally, a further \"yes/no\" query was whether they took all recommended vaccines in their lifetime or not. Overall 18 items (6 questions for knowledge, 6 questions for attitudes, and 6 questions for perceptions) were used to assess respondents' level of knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions.

Even though Ethiopia has multiple vaccination services, the novelty of the COVID-19 vaccination raises many concerns about vaccine acceptance. The results of a new study conducted in Ethiopia to determine willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccinations are presented in this paper.

This proportion is not enough to reach herd immunity either through past infection, spread prevention or vaccination according to the estimates of the basic reproduction number. 19, 20 When we compare the acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine of the Ethiopian population with other vaccination programs in Ethiopia it indicates a huge difference. For instance, the study conducted to assess the acceptance of human papilloma vaccine (HPV) showed that the majority of the respondents (81.3% 21 and 81.8% 22 ) accepted that the HPV could be administered to their teenage girls. Some studies also indicated that only a small fraction of the population are vaccine non-receipt and refusal in Ethiopia towards the expanded program on immunization coverage survey. 23 This level of discrepancy on the vaccine hesitancy specifically towards the COVID-19 vaccine is mainly due to its accelerated development which contributes to the wrong impression that the vaccine might not be appropriately verified for safety and efficacy. 9 Moreover, the main sources of this vaccine hesitancy may be due to a substantial amount of misinformation regarding the COVID-19 vaccine circulating on social media. 7 The discrepancy might be because of the introduction of the new vaccine program to the community which might affect their level of acceptance and information. Additionally, some of the above studies were conducted after the provision of the vaccine and summary of information to participants which can lead to an increased level of acceptance.",

In the final regression model, females are more willing to take COVID-19 vaccination than males, which showed males are more vaccinehesitant than their counterparts. In contrast, the global study by Lazarus and colleagues, a study by Malik and colleagues, and an Israeli study found that males were more likely to accept the potential COVID-19 vaccine. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Awareness creation campaigns designed to specific community needs have been recognized as the most effective in increasing vaccination rates. 34 Our study revealed that those who have information about the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine were more likely to get vaccinated. Though most respondents were informed about COVID-19 by social media, the internet, or other sources, it does not show any association with willingness to vaccination, contrary to a study conducted in Greek populations. 13 About half (50.7%) of the study participants believed that everyone should get the COVID-19 vaccine in Ethiopia. Additionally, most of the participants (93.9%) thought health professionals should be vaccinated first. This insight might be because health-care professionals are at the forefront during diagnosis and management. This is supported by a study that the probability of reporting a positive COVID-19 test was higher for frontline health workers. 35 ",

Since the online survey was conducted just before the beginning of the vaccination program in Ethiopia, its findings might vary after the vaccination program is established.",

Being female, age group, marital status, residence, occupations, not having a health-related job, religion, and educational status were statistically significantly associated with willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings suggested that we need tailored education messages for the entire population to emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, address the concerns of side effects of general vaccines by dispelling misconceptions, and target the most vulnerable subgroups who reported a high level of risk exposures while showed low intention to take the vaccine.",
