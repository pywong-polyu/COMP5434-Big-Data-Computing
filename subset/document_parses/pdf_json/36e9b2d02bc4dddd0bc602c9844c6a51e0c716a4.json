The teams then went to several designated geriatric facilities per day and administered the vaccines to the residents in-house. The vaccine used was BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), which requires two doses administered at 3 week intervals. 4 The programme consisted of vaccinations over two 20 day intervals from Dec 22, 2020, to Jan 31, 2021, with a 1 day break on Jan 11, 2021. The average vaccination time was 3 mins. There was a brief 4 day learning curve (Dec 22-26, 2020), after which the numbers quickly increased to over 3000-4000 per day with decreasing numbers on Saturdays (the Jewish Sabbath). There were a total of 92 793 vaccines administered as the first dose: 62 811 for residents of geriatric facilities and 29 982 for staff. The daily median number of first-dose vaccinations administered was 2048 to residents and 1207 to staff. There was a similar number of 89 508 vaccines administered as the second dose: 60 468 for residents and 29 040 for staff. The daily median number of second-dose vaccinations was 1950 to residents and 1169 to staff (figure). In over 90% of cases, the second vaccine was given to the same residents within the same facilities on the same day of the week exactly 3 weeks later. By early February, 2021, over 90% of individuals aged 60 years and older had received their first vaccine, 5 and it is believed that by now an even higher percentage (some reports say that almost all) of nursing home patients have received both doses.",
