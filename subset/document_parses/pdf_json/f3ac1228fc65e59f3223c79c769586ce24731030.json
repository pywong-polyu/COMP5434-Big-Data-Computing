The first case was diagnosed in the canton of Ticino, which borders the Italian region of Lombardy that already experienced an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the time. In the subsequent days, additional cases were reported in several cantons leading to a rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 all over Switzerland. Starting on 28 February 2020, the federal government sequentially issued a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that included closing of primary schools, non-essential shops, and restaurants, culminating in the prohibition of gatherings of more than five people on 20 March 2020 ('lockdown'). The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic subsequently decreased with 30,243 confirmed cases and 1,860 deaths until 10 May 2020 [2] when major restrictions with regards to schools, non-essential shops, and restaurants were lifted again. In order to better prepare for a resurgence of cases in Switzerland, it is crucial to understand how the timing of implementing NPIs influences the dynamics and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.",

We showed that the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that were diagnosed and reported increased during the early phase of the epidemic and decreased to around 10% after implementation of all NPIs. The counterfactual scenarios illustrate that introducing NPIs one week earlier or later would have resulted in 399 (95% PI: 347-458) and 8,683 (95% PI: 8,038-9,453) deaths, respectively. The urgency of a rapid implementation of NPIs is further underlined by our finding that one week of uncontrolled spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland required 3.1 weeks (95% CI: 2.8-3.3 weeks) of 'lockdown'.",

            "text": "Our study comes with a number of limitations. First, we did not have access to line lists of patients and used aggregated data of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Compared to the numbers communicated by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), cantons typically report somewhat higher numbers of hospitalized and deceased patients. For example, FOPH communicated only 1,640 deaths [1] , while the cantonal data reported 1,860 deaths by 10 May 2020. The discrepancies may result from missing or delayed patient records that cannot be linked in the line lists at FOPH. Second, we opted for a maximum likelihood framework and fixed a number of model parameters, such as hospitalization periods, to values that were informed by the literature. While our model can accurately describe the changes in hospitalized patients and ICU occupancy, the calculated CIs can be overly narrow for some parameters. Third, we described the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland overall and did not consider cantonal differences in the transmission dynamics as in Lemaitre et al. [11] . We think that this simplification is justified for the purpose of our study but acknowledge that cantonal differences in the epidemic trajectories were arguably important for the timing of the implementation of NPIs at the federal level. Fourth, we did not stratify the population by sex and age and cannot provide age-specific infection attack rates [24] . Fifth, we assumed a fixed IFR of 0.75% [11] , which is in the range of estimates for Switzerland and similarly affected European areas [9, 10] . Higher or lower IFRs would result in lower and higher model estimates of the infection attack rate, and higher and lower estimates of the proportions of SARS-CoV-2 infections that were diagnosed and reported. Sixth, the model parameters on the probability of death in hospital bed (\u03b5 3 ) and ICU (\u03b5 4 ) need to be interpreted with caution, as they contribute to a phenomenological description of the hospitalization pathway and implicitly account for deaths outside of hospitals as well. Hence, it is worth noting that the probability of death for ICU patients in Switzerland was reported at 23% [25] , which is lower than the 50% used in our model. Finally, our modeling framework was not adapted to investigate the individual effects of single NPIs between 28 February and 20 March 2020. Instead, we assumed that NPIs in Switzerland primarily reduced transmission during a period of two weeks around 17 March 2020, which is in agreement with the study by Lemaitre et al. [11] . Similarly, Flaxman et al. [12] estimated that the majority of reduction in transmission in Switzerland derived from the banning of gatherings of more than five people on 20 March 2020, and Scire et al. [26] showed that the reproduction number dropped significantly below the critical threshold of one after that date.",

While our estimate of R 0 for Switzerland is similar to early estimates for the epidemic in Wuhan, China [3, 4] , we found a faster epidemic spread with a lower doubling time. The estimated doubling time for Switzerland is consistent with the epidemic expansion in other regions of Europe during late February and early March. However, it could also be biased due to underreporting of hospitalized patients and SARS-CoV-2-related deaths during the early phase of the epidemic. A lower epidemic doubling time before the implementation of NPIs in Switzerland would result in smaller differences in peak hospitalization and ICU occupancy and total numbers of deaths between the counterfactual scenarios that are presented.",

This finding may partially explain the lower numbers of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in Austria, which was similarly affected by the proximity to the early outbreak in Italy but implemented strict control interventions at an earlier time point compared to Switzerland [12, 28] . Implementing the sequence of NPIs in Switzerland only one week later would likely have led to an overburdening of the healthcare system with a peak demand for ICUs of 1,908 (95% PI: 1,685-2,149), which is higher than the effective ad-hoc ICU bed capacity of 1,275 in April 2020 [25] .",

Each week of uncontrolled spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland required roughly three weeks of 'lockdown' to reduce the number of new infections to the same level again. There are several lessons to be learnt for the further management of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland. First, a rapid implementation of NPIs in the case of a resurgence of the epidemic can limit the necessary duration of strict control measures possibly resulting in lower economic and social costs. Second, new epidemic flare-ups are likely to occur in regionally confined areas given the cantonal differences in incidence. A rapid outbreak response at the local level would likely be most effective in such situations. In summary, we showed that while an earlier implementation of NPIs in Switzerland would have resulted in considerably lower numbers of hospitalized cases and deaths, the measures that were taken successfully prevented a much higher burden of SARS-CoV-2-related morbidity and mortality.",

The sequential introduction of NPIs reduced the transmission rate to \u03ba = 24% (95% CI: 23%-26%), resulting in a effective reproduction number R e = 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61-0.66) (fig. 3). The values of R 0 and R e correspond to an epidemic doubling time of 2.9 days (95% CI: 2.8-3.1 days) during the early phase of the epidemic and a half-life of 8.9 days (95% CI: 8.3-9.7 days) after implementation of all NPIs. Hence, one week of exponential increase in new infections during the early epidemic spread required 3.1 weeks (95% CI: 2.8-3.3 weeks) of 'lockdown' to reduce the number of infections to the same level. The cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Switzerland reached 264,287 (95% PI: 251,776-276,430) by 10 May 2020, corresponding to an infection attack rate of 3.1% (95% PI: 2.9%-3.2%) for Switzerland overall. The diagnosed and reported infections represent only a fraction of the overall epidemic in Switzerland. Based on the assumed IFR of 0.75%, we estimated that the proportion of new infections that were diagnosed and reported at the beginning of the epidemic was around 10% and increased to around 20% before the strengthening of social distancing measures on 17 March 2020 (fig. 4). During the 'lockdown', the proportion of diagnosed and reported infections decreased and stabilized at around 10% again.",
