Bayesian image analysis can improve image quality, by balancing a priori expectations of image characteristics, with a model for the noise process via Bayes Theorem. We have previously given a reformulation of the conventional Bayesian image analysis paradigm in Fourier space, i.e. the prior distribution (the prior) and likelihood are given in terms of spatial frequency signals. By specifying the Bayesian model in Fourier space, spatially correlated priors, that are relatively difficult to model and compute in conventional image space, can be efficiently modeled as a set of independent processes across Fourier space. The originally inter-correlated and high-dimensional problem in image space is thereby broken down into a series of (trivially parallelizable) independent one-dimensional problems. In this paper we adapt this Fourier space process into a data-driven framework in which the Fourier space priors are built empirically from a database of images and then used to enhance future images. We will describe the data-driven Bayesian image analysis in Fourier space (DD-BIFS) modeling approach, illustrate it's computational efficiency and speed. Finally, we give specific applications of DD-BIFS to improve the quality of arterial-spin-labeling (ASL) perfusion images via a database of human brain positron emission tomography (PET) images.",

In contrast, for the datadriven approach, although we again choose the probability distribution forms across Fourier space, the parameters are estimated empirically from a database of transformed images. That is, all of the images in the database are Fourier transformed, the data at each location in Fourier space are extracted, and the distribution parameters for that Fourier space location are estimated from that data. In this way empirical maps of parameter estimates is generated over space. These parameter estimates are then used as the parameters for the prior at each Fourier space location. Separate priors and associated parameter functions are defined for each of the modulus and argument of the complex value at each Fourier space location. Working with the modulus and argument provides a more natural framework for defining prior information at specific Fourier space locations (i.e., specific spatial frequencies) than working with the real and imaginary components, because prior information (e.g., smoothness, edges, or features of interest) most strongly relates to the magnitude of the process involved.",

Preliminary data indicates that ASL based perfusion patterns associated with FTLD are coherent with PET, albeit with reduced image quality due to increased noise (Fig. 2) . The objective of our BIFS modeling procedure is to improve ASL perfusion maps toward the quality of PET by using a DD-BIFS prior generated from a database of PET images. ",
