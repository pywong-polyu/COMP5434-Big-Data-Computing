Evidence suggests that COVID-19 is associated with new onset of ketosis-prone forms of diabetes or the insulinopenic decompensation of preexisting diabetes (2) (3) (4) . These observations raise the prospect of a diabetogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2, beyond the known stress response associated with acute illness. For example, SARS-CoV-2 infection may produce new mechanisms of pancreatic insulin-producing \u03b2 cell failure or aggravate the pathophysiology of \u03b2 cell dysfunction in preexisting type 2 diabetes (3, 5) . In parallel, emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 produces pancreatic exocrine dysfunction resulting in acute pancreatitis (6) . Still, epidemiological data supporting the idea that COVID-19 leads to new onset of insulin-deficient diabetes are limited.",

Studies on ACE2 expression in pancreatic insulin-producing \u03b2 cells have shown conflicting results, with some studies reporting ACE2 expression in \u03b2 cells (8) (9) (10) (11) Evidence suggests an association between severe acute respiratory syndrome-cornavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the occurrence of new-onset diabetes. We examined pancreatic expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), the cell entry factors for SARS-CoV-2, using publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data sets, and pancreatic tissue from control male and female nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans. We also examined SARS-CoV-2 immunolocalization in pancreatic cells of SARS-CoV-2-infected NHPs and patients who had died from coronavirus disease 2019 . We report expression of ACE2 in pancreatic islet, ductal, and endothelial cells in NHPs and humans. In pancreata from SARS-CoV-2-infected NHPs and COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 infected ductal, endothelial, and islet cells. These pancreata also exhibited generalized fibrosis associated with multiple vascular thrombi. Two out of 8 NHPs developed new-onset diabetes following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two out of 5 COVID-19 patients exhibited new-onset diabetes at admission. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the pancreas may promote acute and especially chronic pancreatic dysfunction that could potentially lead to new-onset diabetes.",

Similar to our observations in SARS-CoV-2-infected NHPs, we observed colocalization of SARS-CoV-2-NP with CK19 + ductal cells in the male subject with new-onset diabetes, and in 1 female subject with a history of type 2 diabetes who had died from COVID-19 (COVID19-3). This was not observed in pancreata from noninfected control subjects, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 infected the exocrine pancreatic ducts ( Figure 5 , B and C). In addition, we observed colocalization for SARS-CoV-2-NP with CD31 + endothelial cells in all 5 male and female subjects who had died from COVID-19, including one normoglycemic individual (COVID19-4), which we did not observe in pancreata from noninfected controls ( Figure 5, D and E) . Additional analysis of pancreatic sections by electron microscopy revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in the endothelium and ductal architecture of a female COVID-19 individual (COVID19-3; Figure 6, A and B) .",

In this study, 2 out of 8 NHPs developed new-onset hyperglycemia following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 2 out of 5 patients with COVID-19 exhibited new-onset hyperglycemia at hospital admission. After assembling a pancreatic single-cell expression atlas from 6 publicly available scRNA-seq data sets, we provide information on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpression in human islet cells in males, extending results obtained by others without sex stratification and without coexpression at the same single-cell level (9, 12) , and demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect islet cells. Accordingly, two studies reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in islets cells, including individual \u03b2 cells, in male and female subjects who had died from COVID-19 (9, 12) . Here, we provide additional evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infected \u03b2 cells in a male COVID-19 patient who exhibited new-onset diabetes at hospital admission. We also report that SARS-CoV-2 infected the islet microvasculature in a female NHP.",

Further, we observed elevated pancreatic fibrosis in male and female NHPs and humans who had died from COVID-19. During pancreatic inflammation, activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, inducing ECM deposition, altogether resulting in pancreatic fibrosis (32) .

In severe cases, massive endothelial dysfunction, disseminated coagulopathy, and complement-induced thrombosis produce systemic microangiopathy and thromboembolism (34) . Consistent with this concept, we observed expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in pancreatic endothelial cells. Surprisingly, as in the case of islet cells, we observed coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the same cells in males only. The absence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpression in the same female islet and endothelial cells from the scRNA-seq data sets should be interpreted with caution, as it could be an artifact derived from the lack of sufficient sequencing depth of the scRNA-seq. Nevertheless, we observed SARS-CoV-2 infection of islet microvasculature in female SARS-CoV-2-infected NHPs. We did not observe SARS-CoV-2 in human islet capillaries, but SARS-CoV-2 infected the microvasculature of the exocrine pancreas in all male and female NHPs and humans who had died from COVID-19. Notably, in NHPs and humans, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with multiple thrombi of microvessels and with markers of endotheliitis in humans. To what extent endotheliitis and thrombosis are a direct effect of In summary, SARS-CoV-2 infects pancreatic islet, ductal ,and endothelial cells in male and female NHPs and humans with COVID-19. In both species, SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with disseminated pancreatic endotheliitis, microthrombi, fibrosis, and new-onset hyperglycemia, suggesting that COVID-19 produces new-onset diabetes. Most importantly, the long-term consequences of a fibrotic/ thrombotic pancreas, such as chronic pancreatic exocrine dysfunction and late-onset diabetes, should be investigated as postacute sequelae of COVID-19.",
