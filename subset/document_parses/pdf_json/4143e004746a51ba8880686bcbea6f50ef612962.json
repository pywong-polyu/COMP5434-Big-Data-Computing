            "text": "Objectives Promoting smoke-free policies is a key intervention for reducing secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, many indoor smoking spaces in workplaces were closed. This study aimed to reveal the association between a workplace smoke-free policy and SHS exposure among non-smoking employees, distinguishing between SHS exposure from cigarettes and exposure to secondhand heated tobacco product (HTP) aerosol, which have recently become popular in Japan. Design and setting We used data from the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey conducted in August-September 2020. Participants Among the 25 482 eligible respondents, 8196 non-smoking employees were analysed. Primary outcome measure Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the impact of smoke-free policies in the workplace. Results Compared with complete smoking bans, the ORs and 95% CIs for workplace SHS exposure at least once a week from cigarettes were 2.06 (95% CI: 1.60 to 2.65) for partial bans with no longer available smoking spaces, 1.92 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.25) for partial smoking bans with still available smoking spaces and 5.33 (95% CI: 4.10 to 6.93) for no smoking bans. The corresponding ORs and 95% CIs for exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol were 4.15 (95% CI: 3.22 to 5.34), 2.24 (95% CI: 1.86 to 2.71) and 3.88 (95% CI: 2.86 to 5.26), respectively. Conclusions The effect of partial bans was limited, and temporary closure of smoking spaces might contribute to increased exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol. Complete smoking bans in the workplace were reaffirmed to be the best way to reduce SHS exposure from cigarettes and exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol.",

On 12 March 2020, there was a call by Japan Society for Tobacco Control that all smoking rooms and areas should be closed to prevent the spread of infection. 18 In Japan, many companies changed their smoke-free policies, for example, many indoor smoking spaces were closed. Meanwhile, heated tobacco products (HTPs) have recently become popular in Japan, 19 and HTPs have been introduced to the market as 'less hazardous' versions of cigarettes and as a means to evade smoke-free regulations. 20 According to a previous study conducted during February-March 2020 with individuals aged 15-74 years (n=9044), the prevalence of current HTP use was 10.9% in 2020 in Japan. 21 Some workplaces have adopted different smoke-free regulations for different tobacco products. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of workplace smoke-free policies on workplace SHS exposure among non-smoking employees during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, distinguishing between SHS exposure from cigarettes and exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol.",

According to the 2019 Japan Society and New Tobacco Internet Survey study whose respondents included those that registered with the same internet survey agency as those in our study, 11.9% of HTP users had used HTPs in smoke-free locations. 26 Moreover, approximately one-fourth of the HTP users thought that HTP use was not prohibited in places where smoking was not allowed, and these respondents were likely to use HTPs in such locations. 26 Considering these findings, HTPs might have been used outside the temporarily closed smoking spaces. In Japan, recently, the number of HTP users has been increasing. However, there had been no legislation banning HTP use in the workplace, and some workplaces have voluntarily adopted their own smoke-free policies regarding HTP use. 27 To improve such situations, the Health Promotion Law was revised to include smoke-free regulations with fines in 2018; moreover, tobacco use, including cigarettes and HTPs, has been forbidden indoors in facilities for children and patients such as schools, hospitals and government offices since July 2019. In other places, such as general offices, factories and restaurants (except for restaurants with 100 m 2 or smaller), tobacco use has been allowed in two types of designated tobacco rooms since April 2020: (1) tobacco rooms for tobacco products (including cigarettes and HTPs): only smoking is allowed in this room and (2) tobacco rooms for only HTPs: HTP use is allowed in the room as well as eating/drinking and other activities. 9 In other words, HTPs are regulated differently from cigarettes, despite WHO recommending that HTP use should be regulated in accordance with the policy and regulatory measures applied to all other tobacco products. 28 29 Such Japanese smoking regulations, which distinguish HTPs from cigarettes, 9 as well as the assumption that HTPs are less hazardous than cigarettes may lead to confusion about the use of HTPs and promote HTP use in places where smoking is not allowed. Comprehensive regulation, as recommended by WHO, should be enforced.",

A previous study conducted in China reported that working in a company with strict smoke-free policies was significantly associated with low SHS exposure, and they suggested that all countries should enact stringent smoke-free policies in workplaces. 30 Another study conducted in Japan reported that partial smoking bans were less effective than complete smoking bans 31 ; in that study, partial smoking bans were associated with an approximately twofold increased risk of SHS exposure among nonsmoking employees. 31 Partial smoking bans were not enough to reduce SHS exposure and complete smoking bans might be the best way to reduce SHS exposure. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, we examined the effect of temporary closure of smoking spaces on SHS exposure. According to previous studies, 30 31 SHS exposure was expected to decrease in workplaces that had adopted partial bans but had substantially shifted towards complete bans by permanently closing smoking spaces. However, the closure of smoking spaces examined in our study was a temporary one during COVID-19 pandemic, and this temporary closure had no significant effect on SHS exposure from cigarettes and contributed to increased exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol. Temporary closure of smoking spaces is insufficient, and permanent transition to complete bans might be necessary to especially reduce exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol.",

These results were similar to those of a previous study that examined social inequalities in SHS exposure among Japanese nonsmokers. 32 There are social inequalities in SHS exposure both at workplace and home, and these inequalities may lead to unequal prevalence of smoking-related diseases among different social groups. 32 33 Our study showed a difference in SHS exposure from cigarettes and exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol between various employee age groups. Although younger employees were more likely to report SHS exposure from cigarettes and exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol, they were also more likely than older employees to report exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol than SHS exposure from cigarettes. Since HTPs were recently introduced to the Japanese market 19 and cigarettes have been popular for a long time, HTPs have become more popular among the younger generation. 27 No recognition of adverse health effects of SHS exposure contributed to increased SHS exposure from cigarettes and exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol. People who did not understand the adverse effects might be careless and less likely to avoid SHS exposure. Moreover, approximately 30% of respondents were not sure about the adverse effects of SHS exposure. Although less educated people tend to ignore such effects of SHS exposure, this high rate might be attributed to incomplete smokefree policies, which allow partial bans as an option. The comprehensive smoke-free regulation is essential to give such people a chance to know the adverse effects of SHS exposure. It could be possible that associations between sociodemographic patterns and SHS exposure within complete smoking bans differ from those within partial smoking bans, but there was no significant difference within complete and partial/no bans (data not shown).",

Although we excluded respondents whose data showed discrepancies and/or artificial/unnatural responses, our results may contain some reporting bias because of the self-report nature of the survey. Second, as HTPs look like e-cigarettes and the definition of these tobacco products is complicated, it might be difficult for non-smokers to distinguish between them. Although it is possible that some reports of exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol may be related to exposure to secondhand e-cigarettes aerosol, the prevalence of e-cigarettes use is considerably lower than that of HTPs in Japan. 20 Third, the respondents had voluntarily registered themselves as internet survey participants. The percentage of smoking in our study were similar with that of national representative survey in Japan, although the percentage of smoking in women was slightly higher than that of national survey. 4 Therefore, our study population may, to some extent, be representative of all non-smoking employees in Japan. However, our hypothesis was limited to non-smoking employees, and the 8196 sample size of our study was determined post hoc and may not have been an adequate sample size for our study. Fourth, this was a cross-sectional study. We observed an association between non-complete workplace smoke-free policies and SHS exposure from cigarettes and exposure to secondhand HTP aerosol. However, we could not examine whether smoke-free policies affect the habits of smoking cigarettes and using HTPs. Similarly, we are unable to examine the effect of 'work from home' policies, although people who worked more frequently from home than before COVID-19 pandemic might be less exposed to SHS from cigarettes and secondhand HTP aerosol. Finally, this study used data from Japan. Since workplace smoke-free policies may differ from country to country, studies based on the regulations in different countries are needed to examine the widespread effect of smoke-free policies globally.",
