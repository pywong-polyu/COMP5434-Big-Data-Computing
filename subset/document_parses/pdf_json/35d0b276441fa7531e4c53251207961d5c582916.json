Stress, for example, has been linked to professional dissatisfaction, increased anxiety, and workplace burnout. We explore the impact of positive and negative life events on a number of psychological constructs through a multi-month longitudinal study of hospital and aerospace workers. Through causal inference, we demonstrate that positive life events increase positive affect, while negative events increase stress, anxiety and negative affect. While most events have a transient effect on psychological states, major negative events, like illness or attending a funeral, can reduce positive affect for multiple days. Next, we assess whether these events can be detected through wearable sensors, which can cheaply and unobtrusively monitor health-related factors. We show that these sensors paired with embedding-based learning models can be used \"in the wild\" to capture atypical life events in hundreds of workers across both datasets. Overall our results suggest that automated interventions based on physiological sensing may be feasible to help workers regulate the negative effects of life events.",

Organizations see worker wellness as being central to their mission to develop a healthy and productive workforce while also maintaining optimal job performance. These goals are especially important in high-stakes jobs, such as healthcare providers working at hospitals, where job-related stress often leads to burnout and poor performance [1] , [2] , [3] , and is one of the most costly modifiable health issues at the workplace [4] . An additional challenge faced by workers is balancing demanding jobs with equally stressful events in their personal life. Adverse events-such as attending a funeral, the death of a pet, or illness of a family membermay amplify worker stress, and potentially harm job performance. On the other hand, positive life events-such as getting a raise, getting engaged, or taking a vacationmay decrease stress and improve well-being. The ability to detect such atypical life events in a workforce can help organizations better balance tasks to reduce stress, burnout, and absenteeism and improve job performance.",

For example, they can detect if workers [21] or students [22] are stressed, even at a minute-by-minute level (c.f., cited literature in [23] ). Recent research has also explored detecting the degree to which a subject is stressed at shorter [6] , [9] , [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] , and longer [27] , [28] timescales. Papers on stress typically induce stress externally [6] , [21] , [29] , [30] , but there are also papers on detecting natural stresses [9] , [23] , [27] , [28] . While most related works have explored stress detection, there is some literature on detecting bio-markers associated with other psychological constructs. This includes anxiety [31] , positive and negative affect [32] , [33] , and depression [34] . In addition, recent literature has explored predicting (instead of detecting) multiple constructs using multi-task learning [35] . Notably, however, researchers needed access to data on social interactions, exercise, drug use, and sensors of several modalities, which may be unavailable in many situations. Finally, detecting acute positive and negative events is similar to research on using sensors for anomaly detection [20] . In contrast to previous literature, however, we detect events that affect psychological constructs rather than physiological constructs such as heart rate or sleep. In order to detect biomarker patterns, sensors used in previous research measure a number of modalities including phone usage [22] , skin conductance [6] , [9] , [21] , [36] , heart rate [6] , [7] , [9] , [21] , [24] , [30] , or breathing rate [6] features.",

First, research has focused on either short time intervals (up to two weeks) and very small sample sizes (on the order of tens of subjects) [6] , [9] , [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] , or collected data sporadically (once every several months) [27] , [28] . Second, previous literature has typically detected very short-term stresses (e.g., stresses that affect people on minute level [6] , [9] , [23] , [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] ) rather than individual stressful events that impact someone over the longer term, such as funerals. Our work differs from these previous studies through continuous evaluation over several weeks of hundreds of subjects, allowing us to robustly uncover effects in diverse populations. Moreover, we uncover patterns associated with unusually good or bad events that can affect multiple psychological constructs over multiple days.",

Although other sensor data was collected during each study, including location data and audio or environmental features, we focus on this modality since it was common to both studies, and is the only sensor we have access to in the aerospace dataset. The Fitbit wristband captures dynamic heart rate and step count. It also offers a summary report of duration and quality of sleep for each day. Data is collected voluntarily by each subject, which was recorded at sub-minute levels. It was then uploaded to servers, where we aggregate the data. Table 1 summarizes the modalities captured by the Fitbit Charge 2 sensor. For the embedding approach, we only used the signals extracted from Fitbit (heart rate and steps) but for the aggregated method we also included the static summary features. Study participants exhibited varying compliance rates. As a result, collected data varied in the amount (hours per day) and length (number of days) across different participants. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the data collected in these two datasets and the average ratio of atypical events for participants as a function of their compliance rate. We find in the left panel of Fig. 1 that most participants had several days of data, but a minority had only a few days of data over the entire study period. Pre-processing was therefore as follows. We only used data from participants who had at least two days worth of data and one day marked as an atypical day. This brings the hospital data down to 8,155 days for 150 participants and the aerospace data to 10,057 days for 207 participants. We find in the right panel of Fig. 1 that removal of these low compliance subjects does not appear to significantly bias the data. Instead the frequency of atypical events is relatively independent of the compliance rate.",

We therefore applied a protocol, using human annotators, to categorize text as major negative events (such as deaths or injuries of loved ones), minor negative events (such as being stuck in traffic), or positive events (such as promotions). Major negative events were classified as negative life events such as major medical issues and funerals while minor negative events were daily hassles, sickness, or negative work events. Positive events were awards, promotions, weddings, and other events that were beneficial.

We can therefore conjecture that atypical events create an asif random assignment of any given subject over time. This is not always true, as in the case of subjects who report being on vacation multiple days, or are at different stages of burying a loved one. These are, however, relatively rare instances, with sequential events occurring in less than 15% of atypical events in either dataset and exclusion of this data does not significantly affect results. To determine the effect of atypical events on subjects, we use a differencein-difference approach to causal inference. Specifically, we look at all subjects who report an atypical event and then look at a subset who report stress, anxiety, negative affect, or positive affect the prior day. This is usually the majority of all events (83%). We finally take the difference in their self-reported constructs from the day before the event. If subjects report construct values after the event (which is usually the case) we report the difference between these values and the day prior to an atypical event. We contrast these measurements with a null model, in which we find subjects who did not report an atypical event on the same days that other subjects reported an atypical event, and find the change in their construct values from the prior day. This null model shows very little change in constructs over consecutive days, in agreement with expectation. The difference between construct values associated with the event and the null model is the average treatment effect (ATE).",

Unlike classical hidden Markov models, BP-AR-HMM is flexible by allowing the number of hidden states to be inferred from the data. Based on these datasets the model found 73 states in the hospital data, and 130 states in the aerospace dataset, i.e., we find 73-130 \"activities\" that subjects perform, although they may only do a small fraction of these activities in a day. In addition, these states are shared among all subjects, rather than specific to one subject. This makes it feasible to embed data across different subjects and across different days. After the states are learned, we calculate the stationary distribution of time spent in each state to embed the daily data into the activity space (Fig. 2,  right panel) .

For the hospital data, we categorized atypical events as positive, minor negative, or major negative events, and determined the relative effect each has on subjects, as shown in Fig. 4 . We find that, as expected, positive events increase positive affect (p-value= 0.009), but have no statistically significant effect on negative affect, stress, or anxiety (p-value \u2265 0.3). Minor negative events do not substantially change positive affect on the day of the event (difference from null = \u22120.15, p-value= 0.57), and have a small effect on positive affect the day after the event (difference from null = \u22120.42, p-value= 0.04). On the other hand, they significantly increase negative affect, anxiety, and stress (pvalue < 0.001). Finally, major negative events both decrease positive affect the day of the event and the day after the event (p-value= 0.005, 0.03 respectively).

We use Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance on each dataset to select the best features (23 and 26 for the aerospace and hospital data respectively) [50] . Alternative features selection approaches using random forest feature importance produced poorer results. Typical features in the hospital data relate to sleep (for example, the top feature was tomorrow's minutes in bed).

Next, personalizing our methods to individuals has the potential to substantially improve detection performance [35] .

It's feasible, however, that a model may be trained on one dataset and tested on another. To approximate this scenario, we instead split users, rather than days of data, into training and testing folds. We show our model performance results in Table 3 . Atypical events can be detected 91-220% above baselines based on F1 score, but results are more modest than in the Results section, with a reduction in ROC-AUC from 0.66 to 0.58 for hospital atypical events. These results are alike to other recent papers, which split subjects into training and testing and found relatively poor model performance [9] , [24] . On one hand, this means that these models will not necessarily be able to work out of the box. They need to be personalized to users. That said, once they are tuned to the cohort, the performance is respectable. Human heterogeneity therefore make physiologically-based psychological modeling especially difficult.",
