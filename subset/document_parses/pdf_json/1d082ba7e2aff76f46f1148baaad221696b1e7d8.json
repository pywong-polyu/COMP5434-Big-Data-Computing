The standard of care for treating opioid use disorder during pregnancy includes medications for opioid disorder (MOUD). However, tobacco use often goes unaddressed among pregnant women on MOUD. In 2018, our team received a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) funded R34 to conduct a three year-randomized trial to test the feasibility of a novel tobacco intervention for pregnant women receiving MOUD. Aims: The aims of this study are: (1) to determine the impact of the B-EPIC intervention on maternal tobacco use and stage of change; (2) to determine the impact of B-EPIC on tobacco-related maternal and infant health outcomes including gestational age at birth, birthweight, NAS diagnosis and severity, and number of ear and respiratory infections during the first six months; (3) to compare healthcare utilization and costs incurred by pregnant patients that receive the B-EPIC intervention versus TAU. Methods: We plan to enroll 100 pregnant women on MOUD for this randomized controlled trial (B-EPIC intervention n = 50 and treatment as usual n = 50). A major strength of this study is its wide range of health and economic outcomes assessed on mother, neonate and the infant. Conclusions: Despite the very high rates of smoking among pregnant women with OUD, there are few tobacco treatment interventions that have been tailored for this high -risk population. The overall goal of this study is to move towards a tobacco treatment standard for pregnant women receiving treatment for OUD.",

Intravenous opioid use increases the risk of infectious diseases such as hepatitis C and endocarditis [2] , which complicate pregnancy [3, 4] . As opioid use in the U.S. has increased, there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) [5] . From 2004 to 2014, the total healthcare costs covered by Medicaid for infants with NAS increased from $65.4 million to $462 million [6] .",

[7] .According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA), these medications help pregnant women stop injection drug use and reduce withdrawal and cravings [8] . However, tobacco use often goes unaddressed, which is unfortunate because pregnant women in MOUD programs have high rates of smoking (88-95%) [9, 10] and smoking is an independent risk factor for several maternal and infant adverse health outcomes [9] . For instance, smoking during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage [11] , premature birth [12] , and sudden infant death syndrome [13] . In addition to the general risks, smoking during pregnancy is associated with higher amounts of medication needed to treat NAS, longer duration of treatment, and longer hospital stays [14] . Smoking during pregnancy also has adverse economic consequences for families and the healthcare system. Maternal smoking increases the risk admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by 19% [15] , which results in significant smoking-attributable hospital costs during the episode of delivery.",

Primary motivators and lifestyle characteristics of women who do not relapse to cigarette smoking [25] for at least 6 months were investigated. Women's narratives described the process of postpartum smoking abstinence. Four themes emerged and provide the basis for the holistic theoretical model Smoking Cessation Model for Childbearing Women (Fig. 1) : a) pregnancy is the primary motivator for change; b) changes in thought processes that promote quit attempts and help maintain abstinence; c) focus on healthy behaviors, which may serve as healthy coping skills/replacement smoking behaviors and prevention of smoking lapse/relapses; and d) child's health as primary motivator for cessation [25] .",

The women reported: a) a desire to stop smoking for their health and the health of their baby, which was similar to the previous study and provided further support for the idea that smoking cessation interventions would be welcome by pregnant patients receiving MOUD; b) complex barriers to cessation, including the use of tobacco products to deal with chronic stress, which fits into the need to develop healthy coping and relapse prevention skills for stress; c) periodic nicotine abstinence in tobacco-free rehabilitation facilities and in prison, which supports that abstinence is feasible; and d) desire for intensive support for tobacco cessation, which suggested that the intervention would need regular follow-up and opportunities for supplemental help [22] .

Cigarettes per day is measured via self-report on a survey. Readiness to quit is measured using a ladder scale with ten options to indicate an individual's readiness to quit smoking [24] .",

Baseline characteristics between the intervention group and the control, and between those who complete the study and those who drop out will be examined for potential covariates. These comparisons will be done using t-sample t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, or chi-square tests of association, and significant outcomes will be used as covariates in the following analyses. Primary outcomes to be compared between treatment groups will include tobacco indicators, such as smoking and illicit drug use status (abstinence via urine cotinine) smoking frequency and readiness to quit (cigarettes per day and stages of change), and maternal-child measures (gestational age of birth, birthweight, NAS, NAS severity, early childhood respiratory and ear infections). The collected variables will include not only these primary outcomes and covariates, but also feasibility indicators, such as average number of sessions completed and satisfaction ratings of the intervention by participants randomized to the intervention group. We will also make group comparisons between other variables that may affect maternal-child outcomes, including second hand smoke (SHS) exposure, infant feeding status at discharge (breastfeeding vs. formula), and number of people smoking in the home. The continuous outcomes for the first two study aims will be analyzed with a two-factor (group x time) repeated measures mixed model. Generalized estimating equation (GEE), analyses with an exchangeable correlation structure will assess for significant differences between groups and across time for categorical and dichotomous outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, NAS) using the SAS GENMOD procedure. The main effects of group and time and the interaction between them will be included in each model, and covariates will be added to control for group differences. As appropriate, post-hoc pairwise comparisons will be calculated using Fisher's least significant difference procedure for mixed models and using contrast statements for GEE models. All analyses will be conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc) and considered significant at p \u2264 0.05. For Aim 3, the economic analysis will combine outcomes data from Aim 2 (gestational age, birthweight) with cost data (direct and indirect program costs, infant health services utilization) to assess incremental cost effectiveness from a health system/payer perspective. Direct program costs will include personnel time directly associated with intervention delivery, including logged staff time and travel, but also pro rata portions of supervision and office costs and any other costs that may be associated with care delivery (e.g. printed materials). Indirect program costs will include personnel time, materials, or facilities associated with general program development and operations. This will be derived from grant budgets and information supplied by community partners. Health services utilization (e.g. physician office visit, emergency department visit, hospitalization) will be costed out using average payment rates for these services, by age, gender and year (source: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey). Any facility usage (square feet) will be converted to an imputed rent amount, using local rental rates (per square foot) for office properties in the same zip code. This offers a conservative (high) estimate of the cost of space and represents the opportunity cost of the space. Personnel time will be converted into monetary costs using actual wage rates available through grant budgets or Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) area wage surveys. To facilitate translation of our results to other settings while maintaining privacy, our publications will summarize labor cost data by category (direct program, indirect program, participant) and subcategory (e.g. faculty, staff, participant), and include information on both time (in hours) and average hourly wage rates.",

In a preliminary study of this population by our group (EMPOWR), we found that 14% of pregnant women decreased their cigarette consumption between intake (typically during the second trimester) and the third trimester. While smoking cessation is the ultimate goal of this intervention, prior research has demonstrated that cutting cigarette consumption below 8 cigarettes per day is a risk reduction strategy for preventing low birthweight, so we will consider outcomes of both successful cessation as well as reduction in consumption for this project. Analysis of these power estimates indicates that 100 subjects (50 per group) completing the proposed study will be sufficient to detect significant main effects of treatment group.",

Second, this feasibility study has the potential to lead to a larger, multi-site trial intervention, which if successful, would have the capacity to shift clinical practice paradigms to give specific emphasis on tobacco use rather than letting it fall into general group discussions on illicit substance use and psychosocial issues. Current standard of care does not prioritize tobacco treatment for pregnant women with OUD. Due to time constraints on clinicians, and the complex issues facing many women with substance use disorders, tobacco often does not receive priority of attention. Third, we are conducting a comprehensive evaluation of this major public health issue, including a wide-range of maternal, neonatal, and infant health outcomes, as well as associated healthcare costs and cost effectiveness of the B-EPIC intervention.",

However, pregnant and postpartum women who smoked before or during pregnancy have reported that point-of-care cotinine testing had benefits, including encouraging conversations around tobacco cessation [36] . Further, in order to rigorously evaluate the impact of the intervention on smoking outcomes, it is necessary to verify smoking status.
