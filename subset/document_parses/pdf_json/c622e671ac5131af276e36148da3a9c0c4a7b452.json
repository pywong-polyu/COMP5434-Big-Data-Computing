Mammalian transcriptomes are CpG-poor, and ZAP may have evolved to exploit this feature to specifically target non-self viral RNA. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that ZAP and its paralogue PARP12 share an ancestral gene that arose prior to extensive eukaryote divergence, and the ZAP lineage diverged from the PARP12 lineage in tetrapods. Notably, the CpG content of modern eukaryote genomes varies widely, and ZAP-like genes arose subsequent to the emergence of CpG-suppression in vertebrates. Human PARP12 exhibited no antiviral activity against wild type and CpG-enriched HIV-1, but ZAP proteins from several tetrapods had antiviral activity when expressed in human cells. In some cases, ZAP antiviral activity required a TRIM25 protein from the same or related species, suggesting functional co-evolution of these genes. Indeed, a hypervariable sequence in the N-terminal domain of ZAP contributed to species-specific TRIM25 dependence in antiviral activity assays. Crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with RNA sequencing revealed that ZAP proteins from human, mouse, bat and alligator exhibit a high degree of CpG-specificity, while some avian ZAP proteins appear more promiscuous. Together, these data suggest that the CpG-rich RNA directed antiviral activity of ZAP-related proteins arose in tetrapods, subsequent to the onset of CpG suppression in certain eukaryote lineages, with subsequent species-specific adaptation of cofactor requirements and RNA target specificity.",

ZAP was initially found to inhibit the replication of broad range of unrelated viruses, and to act by destabilizing viral RNA [4] [5] [6] . Human ZAP is composed of three structural domains: an N-terminal RNA-binding domain that has four CCCH-type zinc fingers, a central domain that has an additional CCCH-type zinc finger plus two WWE domains, and a C-terminal poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP)-like domain. ZAP requires certain cofactors for its antiviral activity, including TRIM25, a E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with ZAP via its SPRY domain [7, 8] . However, the precise role of TRIM25 in ZAP function is unknown. Several helicases and ribonucleases, including the putative endonuclease KHNYN, have also been reported to be required for ZAP activity [9, 10] .",

Specifically, ZAP binds directly to RNA elements that contain CpG dinucleotides, and RNAs that contain CpG-rich sequences exhibit cytoplasmic depletion in the presence of ZAP. X-ray crystal structures of the N-terminal RNA binding domain in a complex with an RNA target have revealed that the specificity of ZAP for CpG dinucleotides is conferred by a binding pocket positioned within a larger RNA binding domain [12, 13] . This pocket can only accommodate CpG dinucleotides, and its integrity is required for specific binding to CpG-rich RNA.

The purging of CpG dinucleotides (or 'CpG-suppression') from host genomes has occurred through DNA methylation followed by spontaneous deamination at CpG dinucleotides over millions of years and to varying degrees in different lineages [14] . A commonly accepted theory that would enable this phenomenon argues that the emergence of DNA methyltransferases-enzymes that catalyse the conversion of cytosines in a 5'-cytosineguanine-3' (CpG) context to 5-methyl-cytosine-led to increased levels of methylated CpG. While spontaneous deamination of the methylated cytosine generates thymine, an authentic DNA base, deamination of an unmethylated cytosine generates deoxyuridine, that would be repaired. Thus, many DNA genomes have become purged of CpG dinucleotides and enriched in TpG dinucleotides [15] .",

A paralogue of ZAP, PARP12, exists that also lacks poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity, but catalyses the addition of mono(ADP-ribose) to proteins [16] . Like ZAP, PARP12 also contains five CCCHtype zinc fingers, two WWE domains and has been reported to exhibit antiviral activity against several RNA viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV) and Dengue virus [17] [18] [19] . Since ZAP and PARP12 share domain and sequence homology, it is likely that these antiviral genes have shared the same ancestral gene. However, when this gene duplication occurred and when specific CpG-binding affinity of ZAP-like proteins emerged remains unknown. We examined the genomes of vertebrates and invertebrates for gene products with sequence and domain homology to ZAP/PARP12. Phylogenetic analysis of ZAP/PARP12-related sequences showed that these genes arose early in the divergence of vertebrates and have their origin in an ancestral gene whose descendants are present in some modern invertebrates, such as cnidarians, but absent in others, such as arthropods. Each of the ZAP-related proteins from tetrapods that were examined showed antiviral activity against CpG-enriched HIV-1 when overexpressed in human cells. Notably, in some cases co-expression of a cognate TRIM25 protein in human cells was essential for the activity of ZAP proteins from non-mammalian species (e.g., chicken and alligator) suggesting that these proteins have co-evolved. Finally, we found that while CpG targeting specificity is common among ZAP proteins of human, mouse, bats and alligator origin, ZAP proteins of avian origin were less specific for CpG enriched targets and inhibited the replication of both wild type and mutant HIV-1. These data suggest lineage-specific evolution of ZAP and its cofactors with distinct non-self RNA targeting abilities that could influence the host range of viruses with zoonotic potential.",

One set of ZAP/PARP12 related sequences were more closely related to PARP12, and appeared to be represented once in tetrapod genomes and several fish genomes (Figs 1B and 1C and S1D ). In the case of teleost fish, several ZAP/ PARP12-related sequences were found, including PARP12a, PARP12b and ZC3HDC1L (S2A Fig) . Phylogenetic analysis showed that ZC3HDC1L is unique to teleost fish and it is equally distantly related to tetrapod ZAP and PARP12 (S2A Fig) . This gene has a unique feature that is not shared by any paralogue of ZAP and PARP12 of all the species that we studied, which is that it contains an additional domain located at the C-terminus of the PARP-like domain (S2B Fig). Since ZC3HDC1L is only found in teleost fish, we excluded this gene from our analysis, however it is likely that the whole-genome duplication that occurred in teleost fish preserved at least three ZAP/PARP12-related sequences in some fish lineages (S2C Fig). A clearly distinguishable set of ZAP/PARP12 genes emerged exclusively in tetrapods, and this linage contained the human ZAP gene that has been demonstrated to exhibit antiviral activity against CpG-rich viruses (Fig 1C) . Within tetrapods, the ZAP-related genes were more diverse in sequence than the PARP12-related sequences (Figs 1C and S1D Fig) . Overall these data suggest that ZAP originated in tetrapods from the duplication of an ancestral PARP12 gene, and that ZAP may have been under stronger diversifying selective pressure than PARP12 [20] .",

To assess whether the emergence of ZAP-like proteins was potentially enabled by the prior presence CpG suppression in eukaryotic genomes, we generated an in silico library of open reading frames (ORFs) and 3'UTRs from organisms across the tree of life, including: vertebrates, nematodes, insects, molluscs and plants. We first calculated the frequency distribution (observed/ expected) for each of the 16 possible dinucleotides in ORFs (Fig 3A) . Notably, dinucleotide or PARP12-3xHA and 24h later culture medium was supplemented with 100\u03bcM 4SU. After overnight incubation cells were irradiated with UV light, and ZAP-L/PARP12 were immunoprecipitated. RNA bound to each protein was radiolabeled and protein-RNA adducts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to autoradiographic film. In parallel, a western blot of immunoprecipitated proteins was done using anti-HA antibody. IP, immunoprecipitation. IB, immunoblot. frequencies among distantly related species were similar, with the exception of the dinucleotide CpG. Specifically, ORF sequences from arthropods and nematodes had CpG frequencies close to that expected based on their mononucleotide compositions. Conversely, CpG dinucleotides were suppressed in vertebrates (Chordata) and molluscs (Mollusca) (Fig 3A and 3B) . CpG suppression was even more evident in vertebrate mRNA 3'UTRs (Figs 3C and S3A), while the presence of CpGs in 5'UTRs was variable, more so than any other dinucleotide, perhaps reflecting the comparatively short length of many 5'UTRs and a role for RNA structure in translation regulation (Fig 3C) . Overall, these data indicate that CpG-suppression is observed primarily in vertebrates, is not specific to coding sequences, and was likely present in animals prior to the emergence of genes closely related to the human ZAP CpG-specific antiviral gene.",

Therefore, in an attempt to circumvent this confounding variable, we constructed plasmids expressing chimeric proteins in which the N-terminal zinc finger domains of mouse, bat, chicken and alligator ZAPs were fused to the remaining portions (including the WWE and PARP-like domains) of human ZAP (Fig 4A) . Importantly, the isolated N-terminal domain of ZAP has been reported to be sufficient for antiviral activity [4] and is responsible for RNA recognition. By constructing these chimeras we aimed to maintain the RNA-binding specificity of ZAP proteins while also maintaining the putative regulatory functions of the WWE and PARP-like domains of human ZAP. All ZAP chimeras had equivalent expression and localization as demonstrated by western blot analysis and immunofluorescent microscopy (S4A and S4B Fig). To test the activity of these chimeric proteins, we first transfected HEK293T ZAP -/cells with proviral plasmids and increasing amounts of plasmids encoding the various ZAP chimeras. Chimeric ZAP proteins with N-terminal domains (NTDs) from human (huZAP) and bat (baZAP) had antiviral activity against HIV-1 CG , while ZAP chimeras with NTD's derived from alligator (alZAP) and mouse (moZAP) were less potent, the ZAP chimera with an NTD from chicken (chZAP) had little or no antiviral activity (Fig 4B and 4C) .",

Next we conducted coimmunoprecipitation experiments in which the ability of full-length human ZAP-L, a truncated form of ZAP lacking the NTD (\u0394ZnF ZAP-L) or a truncated form comprised only of the NTD (ZAP 254) to coimmunoprecipitate with TRIM25 was compared (Figs 5C and S5B and S5C). While full length ZAP and ZAP 254 coimmunoprecipitated with TRIM25, the inactive (Fig 5D) truncated ZAP, lacking the NTD, failed to coimmunoprecipitate with TRIM25 (Fig 5C) . These data suggest that ZAP and TRIM25 functionally interact via the N-terminal ZAP zinc finger domain and the C-terminal SPRY domain of TRIM25.",

To explore this hypothesis, we generated a ZAP mutant (R74A, R75A, K76A, hereafter referred to as ZAP RNA null ). Notably ZAP RNA null bound undetectable levels of RNA in crosslinking immunoprecipitation assays (Fig 5E) . We transfected HEK293T ZAP -/- . After overnight incubation cells were irradiated with UV light, and ZAP proteins were immunoprecipitated. RNA bound to each protein was radiolabelled and protein-RNA adducts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to autoradiographic film. In parallel, a western blot of immunoprecipitated proteins was done using anti-HA antibody. IP, immunoprecipitation. IB, immunoblot. (F) HEK293T ZAP -/cells were transfected cells with plasmids expressing wildtype ZAP-L or the ZAP RNA null mutant, lysed the cells and treated the cell lysates with RNase A or a mixture of RNase A and T1 prior immunoprecipitation (Fig 5F) . RNase A or A/T1 treatment only slightly affected coimmunoprecipitation of ZAP with endogenous TRIM25. Furthermore, the ZAP RNA null mutation increased, rather than decreased, the amounts of coprecipitated endogenous TRIM25. Similarly, in experiments where HEK293T ZAP -/-TRIM25 -/cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing wildtype or RNA-binding-defective mutants of ZAP (ZAP WT and ZAP RNA null ) and TRIM25 (TRIM25 WT and TRIM25 7KA [21] ), the amount of coprecipitated TRIM25 did not suggest a role for RNA in mediating ZAP-TRIM25 interactions (Fig 5G) . Specifically, the amount of TRIM25 coprecipitated with ZAP was the same or increased when either ZAP RNA null or TRIM25 7KA mutants were expressed in place of the wild-type proteins. Overall, these results suggest that ZAP NTD and TRIM25 interact in a manner that is dependent on protein-protein rather than protein-RNA interactions.",

To explore this hypothesis, we tested whether the expression of TRIM25 from various species could support the activity of ZAP chimeras encoding a ZAP NTD from that species. TRIM25-related genes are present in mammals, birds and reptiles and some species of fish (Fig 6A) . To assess whether the expression of cognate TRIM25 could augment the antiviral activity of each ZAP chimera, we measured infectious HIV-1 CG yield from HEK293T ZAP -/-TRIM25 -/cells cotransfected with plasmids expressing TRIM25 and chimeric ZAP proteins from various species (Figs 6B and S6A and S6B). While there was some variation in potency, ZAP chimeras from mammalian species generally exhibited antiviral activity in the presence of TRIM25, regardless of the species of origin. Conversely ZAP proteins from more distantly related species (chicken and alligator) were poorly active when coexpressed with mammalian TRIM25 proteins, but exhibited greater antiviral activity when coexpressed with a TRIM25 protein from the same species (Fig 6B) . Of note, expression of cognate TRIM25 slightly affected the expression of each ZAP chimera (S6C Fig), perhaps through ZAP ubiquitination reactions [7, 22] .",

We focused on chicken ZAP, and used crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with RNA sequencing (CLIP-Seq) to determine its RNA-binding preference in HEK293T ZAP -/-TRIM25 -/cells cotransfected with an HIV-1 CG proviral plasmid along with plasmids encoding human or chicken ZAP. This analysis revealed that, as expected and previously reported [11] , human ZAP bound primarily to regions of the genome that contained a high number of CpG dinucleotides (Fig 8A) , Notably, the chicken chimeric ZAP preferentially bound to the CpG-rich portion of the viral genome, but also exhibited a comparatively higher level of binding to the CpG-poor portions of the viral genome. We quantified the representation of each of the 16 dinucleotides in ZAP-crosslinked total reads from the viral genome for both human and chicken ZAP (Fig 8B) . While CpG dinucleotides were enriched in RNAs crosslinked to both chicken and human ZAP chimeras, CpG enrichment was clearly less pronounced in chicken ZAP. The reduced specificity of chicken ZAP for HIV-1 CG was mirrored in experiments where by the overexpression of either human ZAP or chicken ZAP chimera were coexpressed with luciferase-based reporters containing as 3' UTR VSV-derived sequences with low (WT) or high (CG) CpG dinucleotide frequencies (S7A Fig). Indeed, while human ZAP reduced luciferase activity only when a CG-rich 3' UTR was present, the chicken ZAP chimera reduced the activity of both luciferase reporters. Together these data suggest that chicken ZAP is less selective toward CpG-rich RNA and this property corelates with the broader antiviral activity of chicken ZAP.",

In an attempt to determine what region in the ZAP NTD is responsible for this species-specific dependence, we inspected aligned protein sequences from human and chicken ZAP NTDs. We noticed that a divergent protein sequence, composed of two predicted \u03b1-helices is present in the C-terminal portion of the NTD (Figs 9A, 9B, and S8) . Based on the crystal structure of human ZAP [12] , these \u03b1-helices are located proximal to the third and fourth zinc fingers, facing away from the RNA-binding pocket (Fig 9A) . To test whether this element is important for species-specific TRIM25 dependence, we generated a chimera that contained the four Nterminal zinc fingers from chicken ZAP, and the divergent NTD \u03b1-helices from the human ZAP (chZAP-X, Fig 9B) . We compared the activity of chZAP-X with that of the human ZAP, and the previously constructed chZAP chimera in the presence of human or chicken TRIM25 (Fig 9C) . As previously observed, human ZAP was active against HIV-1 CG in the presence of either human or chicken TRIM25. Conversely, the original chZAP chimera was more potent in the presence of chicken TRIM25 than human TRIM25, and also exhibited activity against HIV-1 WT in the presence of chicken TRIM25 (Fig 9C) . Notably, the ZAP-X chimera was more active against HIV-1 CG than chZAP in the presence of human TRIM25. Moreover, chZAP-X was also active against HIV-1 WT in the presence of either human or chicken TRIM25. Overall these data indicated that the four NTD zinc fingers of chicken ZAP are responsible for the its expanded antiviral activity against HIV-1 WT , while the two divergent NTD \u03b1-helices are at least partly responsible for the species-specific dependence of chicken ZAP protein on chicken TRIM25.",

Viral infections impose a strong selective pressure on their hosts, thus gene [24] . While our analysis suggests that ZAP originated from a duplication of the PARP12 gene, and both human PARP12 and ZAP have been reported to exert antiviral activity against a broad range of viruses, the mechanisms by which they exert their function are different. Specifically, ZAP proteins' antiviral function is primarily related to their RNA recognition [4, 5, 11] , while PARP12 showed no detectable RNA-binding activity. Indeed previous work has indicated that PARP12 antiviral activity is linked to PARP domaindependent ADP-ribosylation of viral proteins [17, 25] . The PARP-like domain of mammalian ZAP proteins is catalytically inactive, and therefore, cannot catalyze ADP-ribosylation of viral or endogenous proteins [26, 27] . Interestingly, however, sequence alignments of PARP domains of chicken and alligator ZAP revealed that these ZAP proteins likely contain catalytically active PARPs, raising the possibility that these are bifunctional antiviral proteins. A more recent gene duplication has apparently occurred in mammals, as revealed by the existence of another paralogue of ZAP, termed ZAP-like or ZC3HAV1L. This gene encodes a shorter protein, that contains four CCCH-type zinc fingers and appears paralogous to the ZAP RNAbinding domain (S1 Fig). Since the ZAP RNA-binding domain is sufficient to inhibit virus replication [4] , it is plausible that ZC3HAV1L has antiviral activity. However, this awaits definitive experimentation.",

CpG suppression in animal genomes is thought to be the by-product of DNA methylation and subsequent deamination of 5-methylcytosine into thymidine, followed by the repair of the mispaired G on the opposing strand [14] . Thus, the extent to which CpG dinucleotides in a given genome is methylated is linked to the degree of CpG suppression therein. Indeed, while the dinucleotide frequency distributions are similar for most dinucleotides in most organisms, CpG dinucleotide frequency in animal genomes can vary widely (Fig 3A) . In particular, the coding sequences of several vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, fish) and some non-arthropod invertebrates (molluscs) show substantial levels of CpG suppression, while in arthropods, nematodes and some species of plants the frequency of CpG dinucleotides is higher. This property correlates with the extent of DNA methylation observed in these organisms [28] . Thus, the CpG suppressed state of animal genomes creates the opportunity for self-nonself discrimination by ZAP-related proteins that has apparently been exploited in tetrapods. Nevertheless, one study showed the rate of CpG DNA methylation in genomes may be insufficient to explain the extent to which vertebrate mRNA is CpG-suppressed [29] . Indeed, RNA transcripts in some organisms seem to be under additional selective pressures to purge CpG dinucleotides, as suggested by the observed frequency of C-to-A mutations in a CpG context. Thus, it is possible that the emergence of ZAP/ PARP12 related genes may have further shaped the dinucleotide composition of coding sequences in modern genomes.",

            "text": "We found that the activity of ZAP proteins from different organisms was inherently dependent on the cellular context. Indeed, in line with previous reports [7, 8] we found that the expression of a ZAP cofactor, TRIM25, was important for its antiviral activity against CpGenriched HIV-1. In fact, the activity of ZAP proteins from certain species (chicken and alligator) was dependent on the coexpression of a cognate TRIM25 protein. This species-specific dependency suggests that ZAP and TRIM25 interact in a way that is maintained across different species. Concordantly, replacing two poorly conserved \u03b1-helices immediately C-terminal infectious virus yield was determined using MT4-R5-GFP target cells (C). Whole cell lysates were analysed by western blotting probing with antibodies against HIV-1 proteins ZAP-FLAG and TRIM25-HA (D). to the RNA binding domain in chicken ZAP with the equivalent element from human ZAP enabled the chimeric protein to function better in the presence of human TRIM25. This result strongly suggests a species-specific component of the interaction between ZAP and TRIM25. Consistent with this finding, prior work, confirmed herein, has suggested a physical interaction between ZAP and TRIM25 in a manner that was dependent on the TRIM25 SPRY domain [7] . Additionally, we showed that the ZAP NTD, that includes the RNA binding domain, is necessary and sufficient to co-immunoprecipitate TRIM25. Notably, two domains in TRIM25 have been reported to bind RNA: (1) a short section of positively-charged amino acids located between the coiled-coil domain and the PRY/SPRY domain (N-KKVSKEEKKSKK-C, amino acids 381-391 [21] ), and (2) a small region (470-508) within the PRY/SPRY domain [22] ). Additionally, two reports suggested that RNA enhances the E3-ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM25 in vitro [21, 22] . However, we found that a TRIM25 mutant in which the lysine cluster at 381-391 was replaced by alanines (TRIM25 7KA) supported antiviral activity. Moreover, TRIM25 7KA, ZAP-RNA Null and RNAseA/T1 treatment were all compatible with ZAP-TRIM25 coprecipitation. Together, these results suggest that ZAP-TRIM25 interaction is not RNA-dependent and is likely mediated by protein-protein contacts. That there exists a species-specific restriction in ZAP-TRIM25 functional compatibility, that can be mapped to a specific protein element, is consistent with this notion.",

Consistent with this finding, CLIP-Seq analysis using chicken ZAP revealed that it binds more promiscuously throughout the viral genome than does human ZAP. Recently, two structures of ZAP (from human and mouse) bound to a target RNA elucidated the nature of the interaction between ZAP and CpG dinucleotides [12, 13] . Key contacts are established by ZAP residues K89, Y98, K107 and Y108 [12] . Of these, K89, K107 and Y108 are conserved between human and chicken ZAP. Notably, the second zinc finger of chicken ZAP is three-amino acids shorter than the human counterpart; how the structural divergence between these human and avian ZAP influences RNA-binding specificity required further investigation, but mutations at various positions surrounding the CpG binding pocket in human ZAP can cause relaxation in strict CpG specificity [12] . An important caveat to these studies is that the ZAP constructs used herein are of chimeric nature, and therefore further investigation is required to validate the RNA-binding specificity of avian ZAP in their native cellular context. Interestingly, birds are important vectors for certain human viral infections, such as influenza and West Nile virus. The CpG dinucleotide content of influenza A viruses has progressively decreased in human populations following zoonotic transmission from birds [30, 31] . Moreover, the frequency of CpG dinucleotides in viral genomes can be used to predict animal reservoirs [32] . In the case of birds, viruses that infect Neoaves-and to some extent viruses that infect Galliformes-have higher CpG dinucleotide frequencies than viruses that infect primates or rodents. Together, our results provide a potential molecular explanation for the observed fluctuations in CpG-content of viruses that have adapted to different hosts, and suggest that ZAP's antiviral activity represents a selective pressure that influences the dinucleotide composition of viral genomes.",

ZAP chimeras were generated by fusing the RNA-binding domain of ZAP isolated from indicated species to the residues 255-902 of the long isoform of human ZAP-L, that was C-terminally tagged with three HA epitopes or one FLAG epitope, as indicated, and inserted into the expression plasmid pCR3.1. TRIM25 sequences were fused to a C-terminal HA epitope and inserted into pCR3.1.
