Impressions are calculated as the sum of the number of times an account has tweeted multiplied by the number of an account's followers, repeated for all accounts; these reflect the theoretical maximum number of Twitter users a tweet could directly reach in a follower's timeline [18] . To create the healthcare stakeholder categories, Symplur uses a combination of self-identification information in public Twitter biographies and algorithms, machine learning models, and manual human evaluation. Users are divided into default categories, including doctor, healthcare professional (i.e. nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists etc.), researcher/academic, and various types of organizations, among others [19] .

Inclusion criteria were publication between November 7 th , 2018 and March 15 th , 2019, and a reference to the advocacy movement via the use of one or both hashtags and/or phrases in the context of firearms. Unrelated items were removed and qualifying documents were compiled into an Excel spreadsheet. Information collected included the search source, publisher, type of item, publishing medium, title, author, date, URL, location, language, Altmetric score (if applicable), and notes. Exact duplicates were removed. Mass media items with the same author and title but different date, publisher, and/ or publishing medium (e.g. internet versus newspaper) were included. Items were sorted by date (if available) and grouped by type of item (article, audio interview/podcast, video, petition, blog, event, fundraiser, letter, graphic, press release, summary, transcript, or testimony). Location and language were determined via the publisher/host website. Altmetric Attention Scores were collected for scientific articles via the journal's website, when available. This publicly available score is derived from an automated, weighted algorithm sourced from the Web, and is an indicator of the amount of attention a research item has received across various social and traditional media, blogs, and reference manager platforms. Although the scores are dependent on the context and not normalized, in general an article scoring 20 or higher is receiving more attention than most of its contemporaries, a time period comprised of three months surrounding the article's publication date [20] .",

User profiles varied between the two hashtags; most using #ThisIsMyLane were unknown due to a lack of user-provided data, while users of #ThisIsOurLane mainly identified as doctors, researchers/academics, and journalists/media. For both hashtags, many participants were located in the United States and most were tweeting in English. Overall, users participated from over 200 countries in 26 languages (Fig 2A) .

Since publication, this article has achieved an Altmetric score of 3099, placing it in top five percent of all research scored by Altmetric [4] . This document prompted the NRA to post a tweet on November 7 th , 2018 telling \"self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane,\" along with an article challenging the ACP position paper claims [5, 29] . At the time of publication, the NRA's tweet had received 3100 likes, 1200 retweets, and over 20,000 comments [5] . Later on November 7 th , a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California at the Borderline country music bar killed 13 people, some of whom had survived the Las Vegas shooting only a year prior [30] . In response to the large #ThisIsOurLane #ThisIsMyLane response on social media the Twitter account @ThisIsOurLane was created [21]. On November 14 th , 2018 the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma Firearm Strategy Team Workgroup released their initial set of recommendations to reduce firearm injury, death, and disability in the United States [31] . Amidst multiple television and radio interviews with prominent physicians and researchers in the field, the November 14 th Dr. Oz Show featured select experts and leaders of the #ThisIsOurLane movement to discuss the firearm violence crisis in the United States (Fig  1) [32] . A domestic violence shooting incident on November 19 th at Mercy Hospital in Chicago, which killed a police officer, a pharmacist, and an Emergency Medicine physician, did show a subsequent message volume spike on Twitter and in the mass media [33] . A second increase in Twitter message volume occurred on November 29 th , corresponding with a #ThisI-sOurLane Press Conference on Capitol Hill hosted by Congresswoman Robin Kelly, an event organized in response to the This Is Our Lane movement that included healthcare professionals from around the country [34] .

Similar results have been seen when using social media to track infectious disease outbreaks. Data from informal media are available earlier, facilitating more timely estimates and planning in dynamic situations, while subsequently correlating with official reports, such as for the 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak [38] and the 2019 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 global pandemic [39, 40] . Our results also suggest that social media potentiates traditional methods of mass communication, with the possibility for multidirectional synergy and amplification between all media types, as well as prompting off-line organized activities. This is highlighted by the initial activity spike on social media followed by the other mediums, scientific publications with high Altmetric scores, mentions of the hashtags throughout mass media, and temporally downstream, related real-world events. Even with the strong promise of social media, diverse types of publications remain valuable due to social and professional norms for receiving information and sharing evidence, as well as differing data source strengths and impacts.",

The only identified negative effect was opponent mobilization of the targeted policy in one study on underage drinking policies in Louisiana, leading to defeat of the bills being advocated for. Study authors speculated that this could have been related to more effective counter-media messaging funded by influential special interests and stakeholders [12] .

Research primarily consists of case studies like Hefler et al. [44] on the strategic use of a tobacco control Facebook group to stimulate protests of tobacco company-sponsored concerts in Indonesia. Additional examples include a Planned Parenthood social media campaign to reverse funding decreases [41] and the Ni Una Menos (not one less) movement against femicide in Argentina [45] . Freeman et al. [46] reviewed nine corporate and public health case studies of planned social media campaigns and highlighted lessons learnt, with some of the recognized practices occurring during the #ThisIsOurLane campaign despite its spontaneous nature. These strategies include tapping into existing networks to build online communities and using engaging content that has a clear call to action. However, the authors recognized the continued gap of correlating online engagement with real-world action and behavior change, and the need to pursue more outcome-based measures. Additional tactics are provided in a 2020 systematic review on effective dissemination strategies for research to U.S. policymakers [47] . While print materials and personal communication were the most frequently used communication channels, some studies also employed traditional and social media, with the most successful approach being to start early, use champions and brokers, understand the stakeholders and process, know the context, engage supporters, and ensure timeliness, relevance, and accessibility of the topics, aligning with many characteristics of the This Is Our Lane movement. However the authors note further studies are needed to investigate exactly how the various communication channels effectively influence policy.",

This effect is thought to have played a role in stimulating action in other public health crises via the use of photographs, such as the Flint, Michigan water emergency and the AIDS epidemic, among others [50] . Healthcare workers united in the #ThisIsOurLane #ThisIsMyLane community to create a thoughtful dialogue based on a threat to their collective identities: senseless, unpredictable injury and deaths due to firearm-related violence. Public narrative is a method of translating personal values into motivation to stimulate action, such as creating a social movement.

A 2019 systematic review assessed the evidence for using narratives to impact health policy [52] . Although none of the eighteen studies contained explicit evidence linking the narrative intervention to the outcome, study findings suggested narratives may stimulate policy inquiries through inspiration and empowerment, provide education and awareness to motivate policy discussions, and serve as tools for advocacy and lobbying to draft, approve, or implement policy. However, the authors also warned of certain downsides of narratives, including the potential for bias due to selective inclusion or omission of details or limited viewpoints, and too heavy of a reliance on narrative over scientific facts, all of which supports the use of validity standards and narratives founded on evidence.",

Healthcare workers are widely viewed as credible sources of health-related information for the public and policymakers alike [53] . Many are interested in reducing injustices in health, following in the footsteps of prior healthcare advocates who spoke up for water and sanitation systems, improved working conditions, criminal justice reforms, safe driving practices, and tobacco control, among others [54] [55] [56] . Furthermore, multiple professional organizations have released policy statements recognizing firearm-related violence as a public health crisis that warrants the involvement of health professionals [57] . A 2014 survey of state legislators highlighted important factors affecting whether health issues are placed on a policy agenda, with constituent needs and opinions, and scientific effectiveness of the intervention at the top of the list. These findings argue the need for informed citizens, such as healthcare professionals, to communicate with, educate, and mobilize constituents and stakeholders to advance critical public health policy, such as via social and traditional media [58] . Healthcare providers caring for firearm-injured patients have long understood the urgency to combat this public health crisis for the sake of their patients and loved ones. Via digital media using #ThisIsOur-Lane #ThisIsMyLane, healthcare professionals posted vivid photos and personal stories to form a community based on the shared values of an equal right to life and health. Subsequent organized action included a Capitol Hill press conference organized by Robin Kelley and petitions to Congress for increased research funding and background checks, both of which were passed by the House in Spring 2019 [37, 59] . Although a direct causal link cannot be made between the This Is Our Lane advocacy movement and these select policy successes based on available evidence, there are likely associations that should be further explored.",

There are a variety of ways to become proficient at effective social media engagement, public narrative, and advocacy message framing, including professional society tutorials and events [60] , published guides and consensus statements [61] , and course work [62, 63], among others. These skills can be applied to interactions with elected officials, leveraging the respect of the medical profession to advocate and speak for those whose voices are not or cannot be heard. Interested clinicians should also explore professional society firearm-related activities to identify opportunities for expansion or collaboration, as well as to initiate multidisciplinary, multisectoral discussions on firearm violence with a public health approach. It is also critical to be aware of how public health issues are framed in the media, and actively move away from episodic or portrait stories to more thematic, landscape viewpoints. This perspective shift transfers the responsibility from the individual to the community, more accurately describing how an event occurred in the context of its surroundings and making the public health problems more visible [56] . There is also a need to further study the effects of media advocacy and public narrative on the actual adoption of public and health policy, such as via qualitative approaches, discourse analysis, and realist evaluation studies, which focus on the implementation contexts and processes that yield impact versus the more traditional intervention and outcome [12, 52] .",

However, as seen through our analyses, the most active time points were captured with subsequent lower publication quantities across all media types at later dates during the study period. Symplur relies on hashtag registration to ensure accurate metrics, and also has limits on the amount of retrospective data they can receive from Twitter, with potentially not all tweets for the two hashtags being captured prior to their registration. Due to Symplur not routinely tracking accounts, in-depth analytics were not available for the @ThisIsOurLane handle. Additionally, the Symplur data only included the hashtags' use on Twitter, and did not quantify posts on other platforms nor related posts on Twitter that did not use or misspelled the hashtags. Symplur is also unable to filter out uses of the hashtag unrelated to firearms. Demographic data provided by Symplur is restricted to what users share in their profiles, and default healthcare stakeholder categories do not enable access to more granular data besides doctor or healthcare professional. Therefore we were unable to account for specific healthcare professional participants, such as nurses, advanced practice providers, etc. However, none of the above is thought to significantly alter our conclusions. Finally, mass media searches may not have located all forms equally, especially television and radio spots. To combat this potential source of bias, a diverse array of search engines and terms were used. Additionally, library news databases appeared to list many non-print media by their transcripts, facilitating inclusion of television and radio programs. The authors' selection of events significant to the movement could have potentially missed important occurrences that only slightly influenced message or publication volume, or provided additional evidence of off-line events in response to the movement. Yet we feel the risk is low given the collective expertise and involvement of the authors in the movement's pivotal events, as well as a lack of unexplained message volume spikes.",
