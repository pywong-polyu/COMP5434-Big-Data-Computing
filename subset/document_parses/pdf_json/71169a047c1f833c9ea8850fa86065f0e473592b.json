Given the initial need to limit trainee exposure to infected patients, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and perform only urgent procedures, gastroenterology and advanced endoscopy fellows significantly reduced their hands-on endoscopy experience [1] [2] [3] . The decreased number of procedures has been of great concern to our GI fellows regardless of their year of training and has been particularly worrisome for our advanced endoscopy fellows due to the short, one-year training period allotted to acquire these specialized skills.",

Many courses throughout the world and at the ASGE Institute for Training and Technology (IT&T) Center include hands-on demonstrations aimed at teaching new skills and reinforcing previously learned techniques. Ex vivo and live models may have limited utility during the COVID period and have higher associated costs, but plastic models may be cost-effective and more widely available. If an endoscope is available, there are models that can be used to practice ERCP techniques such as biliary cannulation and sphincterotomy. Models that do not require an endoscope and could be utilized outside of the endoscopy suite may facilitate familiarity with device setup and deployment and could potentially even be used in a trainee's home. These models can be purchased directly from vendors or accessed in collaboration with industry partners that already have them available and may be especially useful for practicing stent deployment (luminal, biliary, and lumen apposing metal stents).",

This review illustrated that simulator training may assist with gaining specific technical skills early in training although the benefits may be reduced with greater experience levels. Simulators can provide experience with upper and lower endoscopy, as well as some advanced procedures such as ERCP and EUS. Given there are typically 1-2 advanced fellows at each center, it may be feasible for faculty to provide real-time feedback by virtually observing the advanced fellow during the use of hands-on models or simulators.",

The virtual format facilitates direct Q&A, as well as a chat feature enabling fellows to text questions, which may be a less intimidating means of interaction than are the traditional in-person queries at conferences. This format allows a broader diversity of faculty (GI, surgery, pathology, radiology) not only from our institution but also from other centers to participate. Since access to visiting faculty is typically limited by cost and traveling time, remote access provides a chance to increase exposure for fellows to experts from around the country. Without the time constraints of an actual procedure, this format also encourages feedback in a nonstressful environment and may be of particular interest to advanced fellows.",

There are Web sites from the major GI societies and journals, podcasts, apps (ASGE GI Leap), online channels (YouTube), and social media platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where users can post video clips of procedures with commentary [11] . Some platforms lend themselves to simultaneous, interactive discussion but most can be archived and viewed on-demand. These platforms allow users to post comments and critiques that can be discussed further for learning purposes. The main concern with some platforms that allow content to be posted without a rigorous peer review process is that they may contain faulty information or describe inappropriate techniques. It is thus important to stress to the trainees that this content should only serve as a jumping-off point for discussion and not a replacement for detailed and comprehensive teaching from the local faculty. Furthermore, as we adapt our methods of endoscopic education and clinical practice while incorporating new scientific knowledge in this COVID-19 environment, social media allow for real-time changes to be shared and discussed among peers and for studies to be carried out. Social media may enhance camaraderie among advanced fellow around the country who are undergoing similar challenges in their educational curricula and career development.",

First, there may be limitations on funding available to support some advanced endoscopy programs with a consequential reduction in the number of advanced training programs or the requirement for more income-generating activity from advanced fellows in order to offset costs. Second, the incoming advanced fellows starting on July 1, 2020, may not be performing as many procedures as in the past and may have to adapt to the changes in training curriculum as outlined above. Simulators have typically been found to be most helpful in the early training periods.

For the faculty, decisions will be made upon brief virtual interviews that may not be the optimal representation of a candidate's strengths. For both applicants and faculty, virtual interviews, which may include a virtual tour of the endoscopy unit, will be relied upon to replace the in-person interactions that are key to determining compatibility. Active participation by both parties can help ensure that a virtual interview can impart knowledge that can identify the best fit for a successful interventional fellowship, career, and extended mentorship.",

Due to the time constraints of their training period and decreased volumes of procedures being performed, advanced endoscopy fellows may feel their training has been compromised to a greater extent than for gastroenterology fellows. Therefore, it is imperative for advanced endoscopy program directors to adapt to this fluid situation when concluding the training of advanced fellows who began the final third of their training during this pandemic and anticipating the needs of incoming fellows. Advanced endoscopy training programs will need to be more creative in their curriculum development, incorporating hands-on training with models and simulators, virtual and in-person observation and feedback, online learning, and social media interaction. This will require a shift in thinking of both advanced endoscopy trainees and the faculty training them to maximize successful outcomes as typically robust procedure volumes may be compromised in the future should additional restrictions in elective procedures be required.",
