We scanned more than 182,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for selective sweep signatures and found that a distinct footprint of positive selection is located around a non-synonymous change (A1114G; T372A) within the Receptor-Binding Domain of the Spike protein, which likely played a critical role in overcoming species barriers and accomplishing interspecies transmission from animals to humans. Structural analysis indicated that the substitution of threonine with an alanine in SARS-CoV-2 concomitantly removes a predicted glycosylation site at N370, resulting in more favorable binding predictions to human ACE2, the cellular receptor. Using a novel bacteria-free cloning system for manipulating RNA virus genomes, we experimentally validated that this SARS-CoV-2-unique substitution significantly increases replication in human cells relative to its putative ancestral variant. Notably, this mutation's impact on virus replication in human cells was much greater than that of the Spike D614G mutant, which has been widely reported to have been selected for during human-to-human transmission 2,3 .",

The virus was first described in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread globally 1 . SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV, which caused a more limited outbreak in several countries in 2003 5, 6 ; however, several bat and pangolin-derived viruses are even more closely related to SARS-CoV-2, indicative of a zoonotic origin [7] [8] [9] . Bat coronavirus RaTG13-originally isolated in China from Rhinolophus affinis bats in 2013-shares 96% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 across the genome and ~97% amino acid identity in the Spike (S) protein, which mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion, and is the key coronavirus determinant of host tropism 10 . Similarly, several viruses found in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) are closely related to SARS-CoV-2; with up to 97.4% amino acid concordance in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein 8, 9 . However, the exact origin and mechanism of cross-species transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 progenitor are still unknown.",

Typically, only modest changes to a virus are required to initiate adaptation to a new host; for example, only two amino acid changes were necessary to produce a dramatic difference in human adaptation in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins 15, 16 . This phenomenon is readily observed in other viruses: Ebola viruses' human adaptation following spill-over from bats was at least partly mediated by a single alanine-tovaline mutation at position 82 in the glycoprotein 17, 18 . Similarly, individual amino acid changes have been associated with recent outbreaks of several RNA viruses: chikungunya virus 19 , West Nile virus 20, 21 , and Zika virus 22 . While an individual mutation that likely increases replication of SARS-CoV-2 in humans has been identified-a single aspartic acid to glycine change at position 614 in the S protein 2,3 -this occurred after emergence into humans, and the genetic determinants of SARS-CoV-2's expansion from an animal reservoir into humans remain entirely unknown.",

For example, several rounds of adaptive changes have been demonstrated in SARS-CoV genomes during the short SARS epidemic in 2002-2003 23, 24 . However, in its brief epidemic, SARS-CoV-2 has been characterized by relatively low genetic variation, concealing signals of positive selection, and leading to contradictory reports of limited positive selection 25 , \"relaxed\" selection 26 , or even negative (purifying) selection 27, 28 . However, these results are based on dN/dS tests that are traditionally designed for eukaryotic interspecies comparisons, and thus ill-equipped to detect hallmark signatures of positive selection in viral lineages with limited sequence divergence 29 . Here, we employ highly sensitive methods enabling detection of selective sweeps, in which a selectively favorable mutation spreads all or part of the way through the population, causing a reduction in the level of sequence variability at nearby genomic sites 30 . With unprecedented statistical power that leverages information from more than 182,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we demonstrate that positive selection has played a critical role in the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2, manifested as selective sweeps in Spike and several other regions, also providing candidate mutations for further analysis and interventions. Given its role in coronavirus host tropism, we hypothesized and experimentally validated that the selective sweep identified in the S protein involves an adaptive mutation increasing replication in human lung cells, which, in turn, could facilitate more efficient human-to-human transmission.",

Eight selective sweep regions were detected, including four in ORF1ab and four in the Spike region ( Fig. 1 & Table 1 ). The Spike protein plays an important role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process during viral infection, and this protein is highly conserved among all coronaviruses. Next, we screened genomic sites in the Spike region that may be involved in the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the new host by comparing the non-synonymous differences between SARS-CoV-2 and four other Sarbecovirus members (one pangolin coronavirus and three bat coronaviruses; see Materials and Methods). A total of six such sites were identified (Supplementary Table 1) ; notably, only a single site (A1114G) was centrally located in one of the sweep regions, whereby the 372 nd amino acid threonine in the Spike protein of the four Sarbecovirus members was substituted with alanine (Thr372Ala) in human SARS-CoV-2. Out of the 182,792 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, no sequence polymorphism was found in this position (1114G), suggesting a rapid fixation of this mutation via hard sweep. The alternative, putatively ancestral, coronavirus variant (A1114) was perfectly conserved in Sarbecovirus members from bats and pangolin. Structure-based analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants. Comparative molecular modeling of WT (372A -SARS-CoV-2), 372T, and 614G S protein was performed to connect the selective sweep G1114A mutation to structural data (Fig. 2 ). Structures were energy-minimized after mutation and analyzed for change in ACE2 The N370-glycosylated 372T S protein, colored by the residue side-chain properties -colors represent: green for hydrophobic, blue for positively charged, red for negatively charged, teal for polar uncharged, and gray for neutral.

In Calu-3 cells, the D614G mutant produced significantly higher titers than WT 1 day post-infection (dpi) but levels were similar for the remaining timepoints ( Fig. 3d; p=0 .0066 by 2way ANOVA with Dunnett's correction at 1 dpi). No differences were observed 24 hours after infection between the WT and A372T mutant but later timepoints showed a marked reduction in replication for the A372T mutant (p=0.0033, <0.0001, and <0.0001 for 2, 3, and 4 dpi, respectively). Compared to WT, the D614G had modest differences of 2.9-, 2.9-, 1.3-, and 0.8-fold in viral titers on 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpi, respectively; in contrast, as compared to WT, A372T titers were 1.8-, 5.5-, 31.1-, and 64.1-fold lower on 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpi, respectively (Fig. 3d) .

Further, the growth of the A372T S mutant was greatly reduced for multiple days, which may be indicative of an impact on viral shedding kinetics in humans. Of note, we also generated the D614G S mutant here--widely reported to increase SARS-CoV-2 infectivity 2 -which only increased viral titers by a maximum of 2.9-fold in Calu-3 cells compared to WT, a finding that is consistent with previous results 3 . We also observed a slight attenuation for the A372T S mutant in Vero E6 cells (3.8-fold lower titers compared to WT 2 dpi). The large differences in replication differences between the two cell lines suggest a cell-specific mechanism of attenuation. In fact, besides their species of origin, Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells differ in several important aspects. First, Vero E6 cells are deficient in type-1 interferon signaling 40 , which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication 41, 42 . However, the S protein is not known to antagonize IFN production, and, therefore, interferon is unlikely driving the differences observed here. Additionally, the S protein requires host-mediated proteolytic cleavage to undergo fusion, which can be driven by several proteases, including TMPRSS2 at the cell surface and cathepsins B and L (CatB/L) in endosomes 43 . Notably, Calu-3 cells express low levels of cathepsins but high levels of TMPRSS2, suggesting a TMPRSS2-dependent entry mechanism in Calu-3 cells 44 . In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells is CatB/L dependent 43 . Clinical isolates of coronaviruses prefer entry through TMPRSS2 as opposed to CatB/L 45, 46 ; accordingly, Calu-3 cells mimic the human environment closely in terms of S protein priming. Thus, these data hint that the A372T S mutant's attenuation could be mediated by inefficient TMPRSS2 cleavage of Spike. Host proteases have been implicated in the cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV from bats to humans 16, 47 . Hence, it will be important for future studies to define the importance of TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage of the S protein in the context of these mutations.",

Our findings suggest, though, that efficient replication in a human would be unlikely with a threonine at S protein position 372, from which we could infer that transmission would be equally unlikely.

(e) Predicted N-glycosylated residues identified by NetNGlyc 1.0 Server with the probability of being glycosylated. binding and probability of N-linked glycosylation sites as a result of mutation. Increased probability of N-linked glycosylation at N370 was observed in the 372T variant (Fig. 2a-c), given the mutation to a threonine both provided a standard N-linked glycosylation site motif (NXT/S) and the solvent accessible surface area of N370 (Fig. 2d-e). No glycosylation site was predicted at N370 in the WT S protein. To further probe the impact of the predicted glycosylation site at N370 as a result of presence of a threonine at position 372 of S protein, N370 was glycosylated with a mannose glycan and energy-minimized on the 372T S protein model in order to observe any minor side chain readjustment as a result of N-glycan presence. N370 glycosylation of 372T S protein occurs in close structural proximity to the essential glycosylation site of N343 33 , further providing additional N-glycansshielding of the RBD(Fig. 2a). Surface maps also reveal an additional space-filling and polar surface that is now occupied by the N370 N-glycan(Fig. 2b-c). Additionally, Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) free energy of binding of ACE2 to S protein was calculated for WT, 372T, and N370-glycosylated 372T S protein. Free energy of binding of ACE2 to WT S protein showed a very negative, favorable relative binding affinity (-180.503 kcal/mol) while free energy of binding of ACE2 to the putatively ancestral 372T variant and N370-glycosylated 372T variant was less negative and favorable (-95.7685 kcal/mol and -69.825 kcal/mol, respectively), highlighting that while the glycosylation at N370 is not in close proximity (>10 \u00c5) of the receptor binding motif (RBM), it is influencing the RBD of S protein and its potentiality in binding ACE2. Structural analysis of 614G did not indicate any major modifications to the structure of S protein. Residue 614 is in close proximity to a glycosylation site (N616) but 614G did not change probability of glycosylation or general surface properties compared to 614D.",

Although phylogenetic and epidemiological data suggest a zoonotic origin for SARS-CoV-2, little is known about the viral mutations that likely occurred to adapt the virus to human transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 progenitor would have likely required new adaptations to sustain human-to-human transmission-a process that likely included a strong positive selection event, favoring the viruses with the greatest replication in the human respiratory tract. Here, we identified a region in the Spike gene with a strong signal of such an event-a selective sweep-from over 180,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Within this region, present in the receptor-binding domain, we identified a non-synonymous single",

The threonine-to-alanine change may have enabled the putative ancestral virus to replicate more efficiently in human cells, thus enabling efficient human-to-human transmission. While other studies have identified evidence of positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 2,25,48 , these studies are either entirely computational or use pseudotyped viruses. Although useful information can be obtained using pseudotyped viruses, they typically express only the Spike protein; consequently, they do not fully recapitulate the viral life cycle, including interactions between different viral proteins and the host, and cannot complete an entire viral replication cycle. Plante et al. used a reverse genetics system to generate the D614G S protein mutant andshowed increased replication in cell culture and hamsters 3 , highlighting the utility of using live virus to characterize critical viral mutations. Our use of live virus enables future studies in hamster or ferret models that recapitulate human-to-human transmission[49][50][51][52] .",

A total of 182,792 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes (low coverage genomes with N's > 5% were excluded) were downloaded from the GISAID EpiCov database (www.gisaid.org) as of Nov. 11, 2020. Sequences were first aligned to SARS-CoV-2 reference (NCBI Reference Sequence/NC_045512.2) using Minimap2 55 (with default parameters other than '-ax asm5'). Sequences with aligned lengths less than 20,000 were excluded from the analysis. The 136,114 remaining sequences were then aligned by using MAFFT56 . OmegaPlus 31 and RAiSD 32 were used for sweep region detection, and the bat coronavirus RaTG13 (GenBank/MN996532.2) genome was used as an outgroup. OmegaPlus was performed with parameters '-minwin 100 -maxwin 1000 -grid 20000 -impute'. RAiSD was executed with parameters '100'. The common-outlier method integrated in RAiSD was used to identify the overlapped positions reported by both methods, with setting the cut-off threshold of 0.05 (-COT 0.05) and the maximum distance between outliers of 100 (-COD 100). Finally, the common outliers were manually grouped into eight regions with the size of each region greater than 50 bp. Four genome sequences(Pangolin coronavirus isolate PCoV_GX-P5L: GenBank/MT040335.1; Bat coronavirus RaTG13: GenBank/ MN996532.2; Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate Rs4231: GenBank/KY417146.1; Bat coronavirus BtRs-BetaCoV: GenBank/MK211376.1) were used to assess the nucleotide changes among different Sarbecovirus members. Molecular Modeling and Free Energy of Binding Calculations. Glycosylated S Protein structure was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 7A94 57 ) and was energy minimized using Schr\u00f6dinger-Maestro (v. 2020-2) software 58 . The S Protein was mutated using PyMOL 59 to the D614G and A372T S protein variants. After mutation, energy minimization was performed using the OPLS3e force field. To identify glycosylation propensity and predicted glycosylated residues of the WT S Protein and the A372T mutant, the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server 60 and Schr\u00f6dinger-Maestro's BioLuminate (v. 2020-2) Reactive Residue package was used 58,61-63 . Schr\u00f6dinger-Maestro's (v. 2020-2) Workspace Operations was used for glycosylation of the Asn370 with mannose, to identify various Asn370-glycan rotamers, to analyzes the surface residue properties of the WT S Protein and A372T mutant. Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy was calculated using Schr\u00f6dinger-Maestro's (v. 2020-1) Prime Package 64,65 .

PCRs were performed using Platinum SuperFi PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen) or repliQa HiFi ToughMix (Quantabio). Amplicons were purified from a GelGreen nucleic acid stained-gel (Biotium) using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel). Gel-purified amplicons were then assembled using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix at a 1:1 molar ratio for each DNA fragment and incubated at 50\u00b0C for two hours. To confirm that no parental yeast-clone was carried through the process, we included a control containing the DNA fragments but no assembly mix; this was then treated identically to the other samples for the remainder of the process. The assembly was then digested with Exonuclease I, Exonuclease III, and DpnI to remove single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, and bacterial-derived plasmid DNA, respectively; note, in this case, DpnI was not strictly necessary because yeast-derived plasmids are resistant to DpnI-cleavage 66 ;",
