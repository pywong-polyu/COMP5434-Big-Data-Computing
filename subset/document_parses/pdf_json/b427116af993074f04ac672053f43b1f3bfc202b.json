            "text": "It has been estimated that more than 390 million people are infected with Dengue virus every year; around 96 millions of these infections result in clinical pathologies. To date, there is only one licensed viral vector-based Dengue virus vaccine CYD-TDV approved for use in dengue endemic areas. While initially approved for administration independent of serostatus, the current guidance only recommends the use of this vaccine for seropositive individuals. Therefore, there is a critical need for investigating the influence of Dengue virus serostatus and immunological mechanisms that influence vaccine outcome. Here, we provide comprehensive evaluation of sero-status and host immune factors that correlate with robust immune responses to a Dengue virus vector based tetravalent vaccine (TV003) in a Phase II clinical cohort of human participants. We observed that sero-positive individuals demonstrate a much stronger immune response to the TV003 vaccine. Our multi-layered immune profiling revealed that sero-positive subjects have increased baseline/pre-vaccination frequencies of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells and the Tfh related chemokine CXCL13/BLC. Importantly, this baseline/pre-vaccination cTfh profile correlated with the vaccinees' ability to launch neutralizing antibody response against all four sero-types of Dengue virus, an important endpoint for Dengue vaccine clinical trials. Overall, we provide novel insights into the favorable cTfh related immune status that persists in Dengue virus seropositive individuals that correlate with their ability to mount robust vaccine specific immune responses. Such detailed interrogation of cTfh cell biology in the context of clinical vaccinology will help uncover mechanisms and targets for favorable immuno-modulatory agents.",

Currently, there are several challenges in the development of a DENV vaccine including the existence of four different serotypes, which are all capable of causing disease and antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). For complete protection, a vaccine must be able to generate neutralizing antibodies against all 4 serotypes to avoid ADE. Currently, there is one licensed DENV vaccine, CYD-TDV (DENGVAXIA). However, this vaccine is only efficacious in protecting against severe disease in DENV seropositive individuals therefore serostatus effect must be further studied for optimal vaccine design. A subset of CD4+ T cells called T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells have been well known to play a major role in aiding high affinity antibody production. Therefore, we chose to look at subsets of Tfh and the cytokines they produce in human blood that can serve as biomarkers for effective vaccine design. We found that DENV sero-positive participants had increased pre-vaccination frequencies of Tfh cells and higher levels of the Tfh related chemokine CXCL13/BLC that plays a role in directing antigen-specific responses. This pre-vaccination Tfh profile and CXCL13/BLC are then correlated positively with the vaccinees' ability to produce neutralizing antibody against all four sero-types (breadth of the Response) of DENV, an important goal for all DENV vaccine trials.",

The rate of Dengue infection has been estimated to be more than 390 million cases annually in tropical and subtropical countries, of which 96 million manifest clinical pathologies [1, 2] . Besides the health problem, DENV is a global economic burden [3] . In 2013, the total annual cost of symptomatic Dengue cases was approximately $1.51 billion. This economic burden has risen substantially over the years, as the total annual cost of symptomatic Dengue cases in 2016 reached $5.71 billion [4] . Billions of lives and dollars could be saved globally by preventative interventions, particularly the development of the Dengue vaccine. Thus, there is an urgent demand for an efficacious Dengue vaccine, and this is illustrated by the international collaborative efforts from various world health organizations and federal institutions.",

One of which is the presence of 4 different serotypes of DENV, with each having the ability to cause disease. Moreover, the presence of 4 different serotypes causes cross-reactive antibody interaction [5, 6] . An effective vaccine must be able to generate neutralizing antibodies against all serotypes of DENV to ensure full protection. Antibody-dependent enhancement can be induced due to pre-existing antibodies in the second infection with a heterogeneous type of DENV [5, 6] . There are several vaccine candidates with different platforms under clinical development including live attenuated, purified inactivated, and DNA vaccine platforms. Thus far, only live attenuated candidates had entered phase III trials [7, 8] . CYD-TDV, developed by Sanofi Pasteur with the trade name of DENGVAXIA, is the only vaccine that has completed phase III trials and licensed in many countries worldwide since 2015 [9, 10] . CYD-TDV is a tetravalent, live attenuated, recombinant vaccine with a Yellow fever 17D backbone [11] . The prM and E proteins of the Yellow fever virus are replaced by the prM and E proteins of 4 serotypes of DENV combined with the nonstructural genes of yellow fever 17D vaccine strain (chimeric yellow fever Dengue-CYD) [12] . CYD-TDV has been licensed to be given only to Dengue seropositive individuals due to the observation of disease enhancement among seronegative vaccinated individuals [13] . Therefore, Dengue serostatus effect must be further investigated for optimal Dengue vaccine design and development.",

The role of Tfh has become the interest of many studies, including vaccination, due to their fundamental role in facilitating the generation of pathogen-specific and long-lasting antibodies [16] . Tfh cells enhance GC Bcells function through secreting IL-21 and up-regulating numerous proteins and transcriptional factors such as ICOS, CD40, Bcl-6, and PD-1 [17] . The primary location of Tfh cells is within the germinal centers. However, due to lack of non-invasive means to access this compartment, a surrogate of these cells that share similar phenotypic and functional characteristics found in the peripheral blood called circulating Tfh cells (cTfh) are intensively studied [16, 18] . The cTfh cells are characterized by the expression of CXCR5, inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) and programmed death-1 (PD-1). The cTfh cells can be evaluated to predict GC's activity since they have been positively correlated with neutralizing antibodies and vaccine responses [19, 20] . cTfh cells are comprised of different subsets; cTfh1, cTfh2, and cTfh17. Each subtype expresses different cytokines and provides distinctive help for B cells [21] . All cTfh subsets are capable of providing B cell help with varying degree of efficacy, where cTfh17>cTfh2>cTfh1 [22] . Thus, cTfh cells provide an excellent tool for monitoring vaccine responses [19] .",

It is expressed by follicular dendritic cells, stromal cells in lymphoid organs, and in GC Tfh cells. CXCL13/BLC recruits cells expressing CXCR5 on their surface [23] . Targeting either CXCR5 or CXCL13/BLC results in defects in the formation of the germinal center in lymphoid organs. Therefore, CXCL13/BLC is presumed to direct both B cells and antigen-specific T cells into germinal centers in lymphoid organs. Germinal centers specific Follicular helper T cells (GC-Tfh) and B cells express CXCR5 on their surface, a receptor crucial for their migration to the B-cell follicle [24] . A strong and direct correlation between plasma CXCL13/BLC and lymphoid GC-Tfh cells has been established previously [25] . Additionally, GC-Tfh cells are robust producers of CXCL13/BLC [25] . Follicular Helper T cells preferentially secretes CXCL13/BLC to attract B cells to the germinal centers. Various studies on HIV infection revealed the role of CXCL13/BLC as a plasma biomarker of germinal center activity in which elevated plasma levels of CXCL13/BLC associated with the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies [25, 26] . Recently, it has been shown that CXCL13 levels in plasma provides strong indication for germinal centers activities in response to vaccines and infections [27] . Thus, measuring CXCL13 in plasma provides critical information on the immune activities occurring in lymphoid tissues.",

We investigated both the cellular differences and the immune signatures differences at baseline/pre-vaccination (Day 0) prior to TV003 vaccination in the two groups.

Individuals were dichotomized as Immune (seropositive) and Naive (seronegative) based on their respective capacity to neutralize any of the 4 DENV serotypes prior to vaccination or absence of neutralization. We investigated the neutralizing antibody titers at day 28, 56, and 91 against all four Dengue virus serotypes, which were then integrated using area under the curve pre boost (AUCp) to account to represent the magnitude of the serotype-specific responses. The heatmap visually represents neutralizing antibody titers area under the curve (AUCp) for 266 subjects with vaccine group types and serostatus groups (Fig 1A) . The placebo vaccine group is labeled green while the vaccinated group is labeled red. Among the serostatus groups, seropositive group (Immune) is labeled light blue while seronegative group (Na\u00efve) is labeled magenta. The neutralizing antibody titers area under the curve (AUCp) is labeled blue, with range of low to high fold change. Qualitative visual representation suggests that seropositive individuals (Immune) who received the vaccine showed more robust neutralizing antibody titers against all four serotypes compared to their Na\u00efve counterparts, or individuals who received the placebo. Interestingly, we observed large variability in the response amongst all vaccinated subjects suggesting that pre-vaccination environment and conditions could play a role in the response (Fig 1A) . To further understand these variations, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that clusters samples in groups based on their similarity ( Fig 1B) . As expected, placebo controls clustered to the left with minimal neutralizing antibody titers; whereas there is a clear distribution difference between Na\u00efve vaccinated (seronegative at pre-vaccination) and Dengue Immune (seropositive at pre-vaccination) vaccinated subjects, with most of the higher response observed in the Dengue Immune vaccinated subjects. In addition, we observed minor similarities between a) Dengue serotype 2 (DENV2) and serotype 3 (DENV3) specific responses and b) Dengue serotype 1 (DENV1) and serotype 4 (DENV4) (Fig 1B) .",

As shown in (Fig 1C, 1D , and 1E), presence of Dengue neutralizing antibody titers to any of the four serotypes at the baseline/pre-vaccination time point result with significant increase in DENV1 (p<0.0001), DENV2 (p<0.0001), and DENV3 (p<0.0001) when compared to individuals who are not positive for any of the Dengue serotypes. Notably, the presence of antibodies against any of the four serotypes at baseline/pre-vaccination time point did not correspond to the induction of significant neutralizing antibody titers against DENV4 post vaccination ( Fig 1F) . This could likely be due to the fact that this cohort has much less exposure to DENV4 due to the prevalence of other serotypes circulating this particular geographical locations. Further comparison of a sampling of the high titers of the seropositive (Immune) and seronegative (Na\u00efve) data show variability in neutralizing responses across all DENV serotypes (S5 Fig) . From this data, we can infer that immunization with this vaccine is capable of eliciting robust immune responses in seropositive individuals against majority of the serotypes. Overall, using unsupervised analysis, we observed qualitatively that seropositive (Immune) individuals seem to elicit more vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers as compared to their seronegative (Na\u00efve) counterparts (Fig 1A and 1B) . Therefore, we next investigated the Immune and Na\u00efve neutralizing response AUCp quantitatively",

Individuals who were seropositive for DENV1 before vaccination, showed significantly higher levels of DENV1-specific nAbs (p<0.0001) and DENV3-specific nAbs (p = 0.0436) post vaccination when compared to seronegative individuals (Fig 2A and 2C ). Interestingly, we did not observe any significant increase in DENV2 or DENV4-specific nAbs in those subjects post vaccination (Fig 2B and 2D ). Additionally, individuals who were seropositive for DENV3 before vaccination, showed significantly (p<0.0001) higher levels of DENV3 specific nAb ( Fig 2G) and no difference in DENV-1,2,4-specific nAbs post vaccination. Similarly, individuals who were seropositive for DENV4 before vaccination, showed significantly (p = 0.0061) higher levels of DENV4-specific nAbs ( Fig 2L) . However, we did not observe any increase in DENV1, 2, 3-specific nAbs in those subjects (Fig 2I, 2J and 2K ). This serotype-dependent response was not seen in individuals who were previously immune to DENV2 (S1 Fig). We suspect that this is due to the fact that there were fewer subjects in the seropositive cohort that are seropositive only to DENV2.",

We observed few interesting baseline cytokine/chemokine profiles with individual serotype specific neutralizing antibody titers that were statistically significant: i) FGF-23 correlated with AUCp of neutralizing antibody response to DENV1, ii) Granzyme B correlated with AUCp neutralizing antibody responses to DENV2, iii) there were many analytes such as Eotaxin, Eotaxin-2 and NT5E that correlated with AUCp neutralizing antibody responses to DENV3, and iv) IL-35 correlated with AUCp neutralizing antibody responses to DENV4.

It is documented that pre-existing Dengue virus specific immunity is known to have a much severe adverse outcome in patients that succumb to secondary infection by a different Dengue virus serotype [29] . Similarly, the preimmunization microenvironment of subjects is also known to influence vaccine efficacy, exemplified by observations from Sanofi Pasteur's CYD-TDV [13] . This licensed vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing severe disease in seropositive vaccinees but could also result in unfavorable outcomes in seronegative individuals [13] . As a result, CYD-TDV is only licensed for use in seropositive individuals. However, specific cell types and immune mechanisms that govern the differential outcome in Dengue virus seropositive versus seronegative subjects who receive the vaccine is incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of Dengue serostatus in a unique Phase II cohort immunized with the TV003 live-attenuated vaccine candidate utilizing both baseline/pre-vaccination and post-vaccination timepoints. Comparison between Immune and Na\u00efve individuals who received either the vaccine or a placebo demonstrated clear differences in AUCp of neutralizing antibodies (nAb), demonstrating the ability of the vaccine to elicit immune responses from Immune and Na\u00efve subjects, despite a predictable variability between the human donor samples by PCA analysis.",

As such, their frequency was compared between Immune and Na\u00efve subjects to better understand how seropositivity affects neutralizing antibody titers. Due to their function in affecting broadly neutralizing antibodies in response to antigenic stimulation, it was interesting to find that seropositive individuals had higher basal frequencies of cTfh cells in circulation than seronegative individuals. It implies that prior dengue infection boosts cTfh homeostasis as a whole, independent of their specificity. The skew in frequency towards cTfh1 cells in the seropositive cohort and towards cTfh2 in the seronegative cohort, while not significant, demonstrated a trend in the seropositive cohort towards an early antiviral immune response, which is crucial for the control of Dengue infection [21] . While a study showed that cTfh2 subset is considered to be a better helper to B cells in vitro [19] , other studies have independently shown that cTfh1 subset helps to expand and activate the memory B cell population that correlate to neutralizing antibody responses in influenza vaccinations [30, 31] .

These findings demonstrate that the frequency of total cTfh cells in subjects' PBMCs is predictive of vaccine outcome and correlates with a level of protection against all four Dengue serotypes when elicited by the vaccine.

Although we observed a trend in plasmablasts being higher in immune subjects, we do not see a statistically significant trend in this cell population. This highlights the fact that the presence of pre-existing memory B-cells specific to DENV (not total memory B-cell frequencies) is more likely an influencer of the difference in neutralizing antibodies induced post vaccination rather than the mere presence of different B-cell subsets. However, it was likely that plasmablasts were significantly altered at post vaccination time points. We found a significant positive correlation between cTfh frequencies at baseline (prevaccination) and plasmablasts frequencies post-vaccination day 12-15.",

Research in mice has demonstrated that the sheer number of IL-12 producing inflammatory monocytes in draining lymph nodes (dLN) makes them the most dominant IL-12 producers in the dLNs and that T cells reorganize preferentially within the microenvironment toward these signals [37] . Research in humans has shown that non-classical monocytes, which are mobile in nature and patrol the endothelium in search of antigen, also have pro-inflammatory behavior and participate in antigen-presentation and T cell stimulation [38] [39] [40] . This ability also extends to intermediate monocytes that have also been shown to stimulate T cell proliferation [41] [42] [43] [44] .",

The importance of innate immune cells in potentiating a pro-Tfh microenvironment is clear, and we predict that the role of circulating monocytes is only just coming to light. From these data, we conclude that monocytes play a key role in the Tfh microenvironment. This unique interplay between monocytes and cTfh cells will likely enable efficient B cell help within the GCs that ultimately results in the persistence of memory B and plasma cells (and a corresponding increase in high affinity, neutralizing antibodies). With seropositive subjects demonstrating increased baseline/pre-vaccination cTfh levels and neutralizing antibody titers, we have shown that the serostatus effect is likely the result of the discrepancies in cTfh levels between Immune and Na\u00efve subjects. Together, these studies will help delineate the mechanisms by which serostatus affects immune responses to dengue vaccine and how our unique signature of cTfh and CXCL13/BLC levels at baseline may be predictive of vaccine outcomes.",

In the context of subjects vaccinated with a hepatitis B virus vaccine, specific gene transcription profiles and pro-inflammatory status at the time of vaccination were correlative of poor vaccine outcome [50] . In SIV models, a cytokine signature was uncovered as predictive of vaccine efficacy and outcome [51] . Assessment of immune sub-population signatures in mRNA vaccine against COVID response showed a monocyte-specific role that correlated to neutralizing antibodies, while inflammatory response-based gene transcription correlated as a vaccine signature that overlapped with responses elicited by other vaccines [52] , giving a possible baseline candidate that could be used for predicting vaccine outcomes in multiple models.

The pre-vaccination micro-environmental changes in Tfh cells repertoire eventually favors the production of high affinity antibodies and antibodies that have virus neutralization functionality post-vaccination.
