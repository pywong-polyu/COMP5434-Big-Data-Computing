Practitioners feel telehealth provides better care overall than patients do. Patients felt telehealth may force a greater share of costs and burdens onto them and reduce equity. Both patients and practitioners felt telehealth can be more harmful than face-to-face service delivery when it creates new or increased risk of harms. Building sufficient trust and mutual understanding are equally important to patients as privacy and confidentiality.",

            "text": "Telehealth practice is the provision of health services to patients by clinicians who are not in the same physical location, through utilisation of information and communications technology. Telehealth, as a complement to face-to-face consultations, can provide benefits to patients, providers and the health system holistically, through improved access, availability and efficiency of quality health care. Ageing populations, technological advancements and the advantages of telehealth are predominant drivers for increasing investment and demand for telehealth services. The global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was a 'gamechanger' for telehealth practice, as clinicians and patients sought safe ways to access healthcare. There was a significant increase in the volume of telehealth services being delivered, which exposed many more practitioners and patients to telehealth as a mode of healthcare. The expansion of telehealth was driven by the 'Promise' of telehealthimproved access, efficiency and clinical outcomes. The potential 'Perils'the potentially negative, harmful or unethical implications of service delivery, also need also to be understood. 1 A recent systemic review identified a gap in the literature of how ethical considerations are experienced by telehealth patients and clinicians. 2 The authors reviewed 49 papers that discuss at least one or more ethical concepts in relation to telehealth practice, based on the Beauchamp and Childress framework, that is, autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, justice and the professional-patient relationship. 3 Autonomy was identified as the predominant ethical principle, and within this primary theme, several subthemes emerged, including consent, individual choice, independence, empowerment, control and self-determination. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Non-maleficence, or preventing harm, was raised in relation to telehealth's ability to actively promote safety and reduce risk in patient care due to of the lack of physical proximity of the clinician. The potential for harm is more prevalent, however, and include telehealth equipment such as videophones situated in the home causing shame or embarrassment; the possibility that professional carers may choose telehealth over delivering care in person in difficult or high needs cases may put clients at risk; or an 'undue burden' may be imposed on unwell or frail patients who find the technology intrusive or do not fully understand it's use. 6, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Beneficence is discussed in relation to telehealth having the potential to benefit people by providing assurance, increasing an individual's confidence in managing their health and reducing the dependence on professional carers or family. [13] [14] [15] 19, 22, 23, 25, 26, 29, 30 Justice is most discussed in relation to fairness concerning equal access to telehealth technology, balancing the needs of the individual with those of the wider community and ensuring not to disadvantage one group in favour of another. 10, [13] [14] [15] [16] 18, 20, 22, 25, 29, [31] [32] [33] Potential 'disruption' of the professional-patient relationship included sub-themes of confidentiality, privacy and fidelity and the lack of the 'human touch' in care. 13, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] 25, 26, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . While a small number of qualitative studies identify relevant ethical issues associated with telehealth practice, and subsequently discuss their potential impact on service quality from the perspective of patients, carers and clinicians, there is little research on how ethical principles are experienced by clinicians and patients, or recommendation on how ethical practice may be improved. 6, 8, 11, 22, 29, 38 This study reduces that gap.",

Selecting groups in this way described fits a criteria of 'structural circumstance' rather than that of 'theoretical purpose and relevance'. 42 Glaser and Strauss propose instead the 'ongoing inclusion of groups' whereby the 'fullest possible development' of categories and their properties 'is achieved by comparing any groups, irrespective of their difference or similarities'. The barriers to finding research participants in one single organisation, where practitioners and clients are experiencing essentially the same structural type of service, was one of 'pre-planned inclusion and exclusion', important if 'accurate evidence is the goal' but 'hinder the generation of theory', in which 'non-comparability of groups is irrelevant'. 42 The approach then became one of selecting groups from the same substantive 'class'that of telehealth practitioners or clientsregardless of whether they are found within a single service, or practice.",

Second, there was reduced vested interest compared to telehealth groups linked to suppliers of technology. The organisation chosen was the Telehealth Victoria Community of Practice (TVCP) which 'enables collaboration amongst members of the Victorian health workforce who are involved in implementing, supporting, managing and evaluating telehealth access to their health services'. 44 A further ethics modification was approved in August 2020 allowing recruitment to commence.",

A format regarding 'can you talk me through how\u2026' was used, which allowed participants to choose 'where they want to start' and 'which parts of the story they want to emphasise'. 45 A series of broad open-ended questions followed, to 'invite detailed discussion of the topic' and to encourage 'unanticipated statements and stories to emerge'. 46 The interview questions were aligned with the ethical principles; however, these exact terms were not used explicitly to avoid confusion due to the relative obscurity of terms like 'nonmaleficence', and to avoid leading questions. This allowed participants to bring their individual perspective and interpretation to the fore which then facilitated the uncovering of new elements or constructs of each principle. This approach may be perceived as 'forcing the data into a preconceived framework' and therefore counter to the fundamental principle of grounded theory that a researcher should be 'constructing analytic codes and categories from data, that are not from preconceived logically deduced hypotheses'. 42 However, Charmaz argues that while 'tensions between data collection strategies and what constitutes \"forcing\" are unresolved in grounded theory'. Grounded theorists often begin their studies with 'certain guiding empirical interests' and 'general concepts that give a loose frame to these interests'. 46 The interviews were conducted over Zoom, Skype or telephone and were audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim into text narratives providing suitable 'rich data' which is 'detailed, focused, and full' generating 'solid material for building a significant analysis'. 46 Transcripts were analysed during an iterative process of simultaneous data collection and analysis. 42 All interview transcripts were uploaded to NVivo and read alongside the audio recording of each interview to check for accuracy, and ensure they were written verbatim. Different interpretations between three analysts, one female higher degree student, and one male and one female academic, were triangulated to help gain a consensus for most themes, which added rigour to the methods. However, agreement did not always necessarily occur because of the different assumptions that are brought to the interpretation by different analysts. 47 Memos were written for each transcript, as to 'explicate and fill out categories' and define the key themes, concepts, thoughts and feelings for each participant. 46 The final version of each transcript was then coded in three separate steps, in order to shape an 'analytic frame' from which to build the analysis. 46 The three steps in the coding method were aligned with grounded theory methodology and comprised open coding, axial coding and selective coding.",

Being able to access a variety of technology rather than one preferred or mandated by a health provider was of value to one patient.

One patient reported feeling concerned about the potential for telehealth to lead to over-servicing, in the case of doctors who 'had lost 90% of their face-to-face consultations' during the pandemic. (Patient 5) Professional-patient relationships 1. Practitioners put their needs first and behave less professionally over telehealth included themes of not knowing where providers are, wasting patient's time and not being adequately prepared for a telehealth consultation. Not knowing where a health professional was during telehealth consultations was reported by patients as being a concern. This was linked to expectations that they gave patients their full attention, as well as issues concerning safety and security. (Patient 5) Patients expected that providers would 'explain where they are, whether they're at home or in their office, I think it's just good to have a sense of where they are'. (Patient 6) One found telephone sessions particularly difficult for that reason, as she 'didn't know if they're there or not, you don't know what they're doing'. (Patient 9) Health professionals should disclose where they are from a privacy perspective; often 'it's a conversation that just doesn't happen'. (Patient 8) Another patient wanted rules 'around where a doctor could consult.' While acknowledging that during a pandemic 'doctors were not going into their clinics for safety reasons', \u2026 you shouldn't be able to be stirring the pot in the kitchen or supervising your kids or in the car and doing something on your mobile phone with no video. (Patient 5) Patients also reported their time being wasted due to poor time keeping by doctors, exacerbated by a lack of technology infrastructure in clinics, and inadequate communication. Patients reported health professionals not being prepared for telehealth consults, including being 'hopeless' with the technology, allowing interruptions to sessions, or rushing conversations. (Patient 5) One patient reported that the lack of confidence by providers using telehealth caused her stress and anxiety, as her GP 'still has not been able to get it to work with me' after several months. Patients expect that clinicians are 'con\u00aedent in what they're doing or at least appear to be comfortable with it '. (Patient 6) Patients reported 'annoying' behaviour by providers such as 'leaving the room to go and let the dog out or close a window'. (Patient 6) Interruptions with GP consultations also caused frustration when 'you'll get a knock on the door and it's a receptionist assuming you're on a phone call. But it breaks the sequence. It breaks the flow'. (Patient  8) 2.

This was more prevalent in those who had commenced telehealth practice solely as a response to the pandemic. Patients experienced this lack of skill and preparedness as provision of a lower standard of clinical care than they required, but it also resulted in increased levels of stress for practitioners. Telehealth created new risks in practice, particularly for mental health clinicians, who felt they could not always adequately control environmental hazards. Mental health patients also reported feeling less psychologically safe when using telehealth, compared to being physically in a room, as the clinician was not physically present with them. Both groups reported that the use of the technology required to deliver telehealth could also cause harm through poor user experience, unfamiliarity with the functionality, adapting to different platforms and limited access to technological support when it failed. 4 This harm manifested itself as anxiety, stress and the avoidance of sessions where the clinician did not seem confident with the technology.",

However, only a third of patients articulated how telehealth provided 'good care' for them. This was predominantly reported in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where health professionals put additional protocols in place to ensure clinical standards were maintained. The majority of patients felt that reduced clinician preparedness, attention to detail and thoroughness of examinations did impact their perception of the level of clinical care.

While the rushed nature of pivoting to telehealth meant that services remained available, many clinicians were not well prepared, supported or even enthusiastic to use telehealth. As one physiotherapist said, 'there wasn't a part of starting telehealth that I wasn't worried about' (Practitioner 3). In some cases, it was 'the blind leading the blind\"' (Practitioner 4).

Limitations in scope, as mentioned above, coupled with the small number of participants who met the selection criteria for length of practice resulted in a somewhat narrow range of experiences since delivering telehealth services. Practitioners were either very new (6 months or less) to telehealth due to COVID-19 or had been practicing for a comparatively much longer time (greater than 2 years). While this disparity was useful in surfacing some of the systemic and longer-term issues for telehealth practice, it present challenges in transferring the finding more generally to populations. The same applied, although to a lesser degree, with the patient cohort Data collection. Data collection was limited to qualitative methods. It would have been beneficial to include a quantitative study of a larger group of both patients and practitioners to add further depth to the analysis and potentially form the basis of a broader longitudinal study.

We found that ethical principles are often experienced differently by telehealth practitioners and patients, and these differences can impact the quality and safety of care. Also, practitioners perceived telehealth provides better care overall than patients do, however, both reported similar levels of improved utility. Access to telehealth services may not be fair and equitable; increased utilisation may force a greater share of costs and burdens onto patients. Telehealth can be more harmful than face-to-face health service delivery as it creates new or increased risk of harms for both patients and practitioners. Finally, building sufficient trust and mutual understanding as part of the professional-patient relationship is equally or more important to patients as privacy and confidentiality. There remains a strong desire from both clinicians and patients, however, to realise the 'Promise' that telehealth represents, while minimising the 'Peril'. This study, and further research in ethical telehealth service delivery, can assist them to do so.",
