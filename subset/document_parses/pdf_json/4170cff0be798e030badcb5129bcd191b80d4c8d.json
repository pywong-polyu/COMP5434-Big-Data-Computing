Event attributes have been a topic of continued interest in research and practice. Due to COVID-19, however, event attendees' preferences and requirements related to personal values and satisfaction may be changing. Using a sequential mixed-method exploratory strategy with means-end chain theory and the Kano model as a research framework, this study identifies important event attributes, benefits, personal values, and specific satisfaction attributes. Key findings highlight pleasure and excitement and sense of safety as salient personal values. Respondents also found health/safety attributes particularly important, considering them must-be attributes. Providing health/safety services prior to the event would be effective in decreasing dissatisfaction. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed.",

Public health and safety concerns led to numerous domestic and international events being cancelled or rescheduled for 2021 (Event Marketer, 2020) . Industry statistics indicate that event businesses across industry sectors -meetings (MPI, 2020), live events (Lampert-Greaux, 2020) , and exhibitions (Shaw, 2020) -have suffered cancellations, economic hardship, and financial losses since March 2020.",

The U.S. state fair industry generates more than $4.7 billion in revenue each year and attracts as many as 150 million residents and tourists (International Association of Fairs and Expositions, 2019). State fairs contribute directly to urban and rural communities' economies. Their cultural and social significance are a celebration of a region's agricultural heritage and a driver of economic activity (Deliso, 2020) . According to Smith Travel Research (STR)'s trend reports, hotel performance for the months when state fairs were held in 2019 (e.g., Arizona State Fair, Iowa State Fair, Minnesota State Fair, and Ohio State Fair) showed year-over-year growth in occupancy, average daily rate, and revenue per available room. The increasing role of state fairs, however, has been put on hold during the pandemic. In an effort to minimize disruption and continue providing event services, many leading industry organizations such as the Events Industry Council (2020), International Festivals and Events Association (2020), and International Association of Exhibitions and Events (2020) advised event organizers to protect the health and safety of attendees through relevant policies, procedures, plans, and practices.",

As such, event organizers need to be able to examine event attributes in order to track and predict possible changes, find opportunities to improve services, and seek ways to offer services that can fulfill certain needs. Product and service attributes significantly influence customer perception and consumption experience (Mittal, Ross, & Baldasare, 1998; Xiang, Schwartz, Gerdes Jr., & Uysal, 2015; Xu, 2020) . In particular, customer requirements change rapidly with uncertainty (Chong & Chen, 2010; Reeves & Bedner, 1994) . From a business perspective, one way for firms to gather insight from customers in times of change or adjustment is to examine product/service attributes and customer benefits and values (Freeman & Perez, 1988; Kumar & Grisaffe, 2004) , then identify requirements/attributes that can lead to customer satisfaction (Kano, Seraku, Takahashi, & Tsuji, 1984) .",

            "text": "Scholars have been researching event attributes for decades. Numerous studies have shown that event attributes are associated with outcome variables such as event motivation and attendance (Crompton & McKay, 1997; Gursoy, Spangenberg, & Rutherfold, 2006; Nicholson & Pearce, 2001) , emotions (Grappi & Montanari, 2011; Lee, Lee, Lee, & Babin, 2008) , benefits (Chen, 2006; Fu, Zhang, Lehto, & Miao, 2018) , values (Lee, Lee, & Choi, 2011; Lee, Lee, & Yoon, 2009; Yoon, Lee, & Lee, 2010) , and satisfaction and behavioral intentions (Baker & Crompton, 2000; Gannon, Taheri, & Oly, 2019; Song, Lee, Kim, Bendle, & Shin, 2014; Tanford & Jung, 2017; Thrane, 2002; Velikova, Slevitch, & Mathe-Soulek, 2017; Yuan & Jang, 2008) . Little is known, however, about risk-related event attributes, and the impact of an attribute in a pandemic context is even less known. Past studies examined eventrelated risks and safety/security issues, providing meaningful implications for practice (Boo & Gu, 2010; Sohn, Lee, & Yoon, 2016; Swart, George, Cassar, & Sneyd, 2018; Toohey & Taylor, 2008) . Nonetheless, specific discussions regarding health/disease risks and relevant event products/services are scarce. Indeed, a dearth of empirical evidence in prior research leaves much to be learned about how people perceive or respond to a specific event attribute during a pandemic. Moreover, our review of recent and relevant research suggests that events as a product or service have not been adequately considered from the consumers' point of view. We argue that this knowledge is critical for event management approaches to potential attendees and event service/product development during and after the pandemic. It is the kind of empirical research we believe is now necessary.",

First, assuming current event products/services need to be adjusting to change, we will identify what event attributes customers consider more important than others during the pandemic. Grounded in the notion of the attributeconsequence-value sequence in means-end chain theory (Gutman, 1982) , this study seeks to understand why customers prefer certain event attributes, what benefits they perceive, and what personal values they ultimately obtain. Second, we seek to determine which event attributes are more likely to increase customer satisfaction. As COVID-19related risks emerge, we postulate that certain requirements or event attribute expectations exist. In turn, certain attributes contribute to event satisfaction more than others. Based on the traditional Kano model (Kano et al., 1984) , we will identify potential satisfaction attributes by measuring how people perceive the functional and dysfunctional form of a quality attribute. Accordingly, this study presents a framework for integrating the means-end chain theory and Kano model. This contextual framework has been validated in exploring customer experience to better understand customers' inner thinking toward product/service attributes in the context of tourism and hospitality (Lin, Fu, & Fu, 2021; Lin, Fu, & Li, 2018; Lin, Shiu, & Wu, 2012) . By integrating two theoretical models, we broaden our knowledge of links among event attributes, consequences/benefits, and personal values while gaining more insight on cognitive structure for achieving customer satisfaction through event attributes in a time of pandemic.",

Additionally, design elements (e.g., atmosphere) were found to contribute significantly to visitors' perceived value in these festivals (Axelsen & Swan, 2010; Fu et al., 2018; Yuan & Jang, 2008) , implying that certain attributes contribute to values more than others. Overall, the literature has firmly established that event attributes and customer values link to satisfaction. The impact of a health/safety-related attribute has been rarely considered.",

For example, Yolal et al. (2016) demonstrated that social benefits (i.e., community benefits and cultural/educational benefits) positively affect residents' subjective well-being. Ample discussion also exists on the personal benefits or positive personal impact of participating in events (Cole & Illum, 2006; Fu et al., 2017; Gitelson, Kerstetter, & Kiernan, 1995; Lee, Arcodia, & Lee, 2012; Meretse, Mykletun, & Einarsen, 2016) . Lee et al. (2012) found that the benefit visitors gain by attending a multicultural festival is a transformational one, namely a change in their attitude toward migrants/the dominant population. In a food festival context, Mertse et al. (2016) found that customers' three most important benefit factors were food, enjoyment and atmosphere, buying and tasting, and tradition and celebration. From a marketing perspective, motivation-based event benefits often are used for market segmentation by examining what people seek at events (Chang, 2006; Li, Huang, & Cai, 2009) . Many empirical studies have discussed event benefits in the broader context of event tourism or participation motivation, yet few have considered the benefits customers derive from observing or experiencing an individual attribute.",

Woosnam et al. (2009) used Kahle's nine-item List of Values scale to find that entertainment was the dominant value among festival attendees. With a theater event, Hede et al. (2005) identified three personal value domains including extrinsic (e.g., to have a sense of belonging), hedonistic (to have fun and enjoyment), and achievement-based (e.g., to be self-fulfilled). They argue that personal values (i.e., end states) appear related to attribute-specific satisfaction but not to overall satisfaction (Hede et al., 2005) . A recent study has found that event attributes (e.g., event design) are directly related to benefits (e.g., enjoyment) and value (e.g., emotional value) in terms of causal relationships among event attributes, benefits, and personal values. The results showed benefits as a mediating variable that increases the influence of event attributes on personal values . Taken together, prior studies exploring multiple event attributes have contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of customer experience dynamics that includes benefits, perceived values, personal values, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions.",

In another recent study, Yeh and Lin (2017) asked tourists to recall their nostalgic experiences at a cultural festival and identified 10 attributes (e.g., enjoy the battle array performance), eight consequences (e.g., learn and understand history and culture), and seven values (e.g., sense of beauty). In the realm of sporting event tourism, Chen (2006) interviewed members of a university sports fan club and explored MEC theory's A-C-V continuum using a laddering technique.

Because of its ability to assess attribute-level performance, this model has been widely used in a variety of contexts and industries (Gregory & Parsa, 2013) when developing a new product during the product's/service's design stage or when improving the product's life cycle (Mikuli\u0107 & Prebe\u017eac, 2016; Witell, L\u00f6fgren, & Dahlgaard, 2013 ). The Kano model considers the non-linear nature of the customer satisfaction function, meaning the relationship between attribute performance and customer satisfaction is asymmetric and non-linear. The model typically classifies product or service attributes into five categories. The first, must-be attributes, represents attributes that are expected to be implicitly present. These attributes cause dissatisfaction when not present because the customer takes them for granted but do not result in satisfaction when fulfilled, creating the nonlinear impact on satisfaction. One-dimensional attributes, the second category, result in satisfaction when fulfilled and in dissatisfaction when not fulfilled, thus they have a linear impact on satisfaction. Attractive attributes, the third category, provide satisfaction when fulfilled but do not cause dissatisfaction when unfulfilled because the customer does not expect them, resulting in a non-linear impact on satisfaction. The fourth and fifth categories are for indifferent attributes, which result in neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction regardless of fulfillment, and reverse attributes, which result in dissatisfaction when present (Kano et al., 1984) .",

Several empirical studies, however, do support the application of the Kano concept to event attendees, including those at wine festivals (Velikova et al., 2017) and an Oktoberfest beer tent (Harrington, Von Freyberg, Ottenbacher, & Schmidt, 2017) , as well as residents who attended a temple festival (Yeh, Lin, & Lu, 2019) . Using a penalty-reward-contrast analysis grounded in the Kano model, Velikova et al. (2017) identified five wine festival attributesfacilities, personnel, food, wine, and entertainmentattendees consider important. Specifically, personnel and entertainment were considered basic/must-be factors, while wine was considered a performance/one-dimensional factor (Velikova et al., 2017) . Harrington et al. (2017) classified Oktoberfest beer tent attributes into three delighters/attractive attributes (e.g., shopping, special souvenirs available in the tent), 11 satisfiers/one-dimensional attributes (e.g., staff friendliness and competence), and two dis-satisfiers/must-be attributes (e.g., party environment in the tent). Overall, some available empirical studies have shown the Kano approach is applicable in identifying event attributes that influence satisfaction.",

For the MEC analysis, we followed the three steps typical of the process: laddering interviews, content analysis, and construction of a hierarchical value map (HVM) based on an implication matrix (Reynolds & Gutman, 1988; Reynolds & Gutman, 2001) . The laddering interview is a semi-structured qualitative method in which respondents answer questions in their own words. To build a means-ends ladder, consequences and values are gathered using the typical question: \"Why is this important to you?\" (Reynolds & Gutman, 1988) . Responses are coded and analyzed, then frequencies of linkages are summarized in an implication matrix. Based on the implication matrix, we construct the HVM, an aggregate map of cognitive structure with abstraction (Reynolds & Gutman, 1988) . Given the challenges of indepth, one-on-one interviews during the pandemic, we employed a mixed-methods approach using the qualitative data and semi-structured online surveys. In the study's first phase, we gathered and analyzed text data to understand what specific attributes people talk about and to extract all concrete/abstract attributes. In addition to a literature review on event attributes, we sought to add new attributes to the list by analyzing several industry content sources with features regarding event planning under pandemic conditions.",

Typically, an MEC is ranked according to attributes' relative importance (Phillips & Reynolds, 2009 ). In the second survey, we asked participants to choose the five most important attributes among those selected in the first survey. Participants also were asked to respond to questions on benefits and personal values in their own words so we could better understand why they perceive certain event attributes as relevant to their needs. To improve participants' understanding of the meanings of consequences and values, we provided several examples of both terms. Participants who had not engaged in such prior thinking would not have been able to answer otherwise (Reynolds & Gutman, 1988) . Based on respondents' descriptions in the boxes, we first analyzed the content by classifying all responses into the three basic A-C-V levels then by organizing all responses under individual codes (Phillips & Reynolds, 2009 ). Among several possible event types, we chose state fairs for this research with pandemic considerations in mind. The state fair has a local legacy, a socioeconomic impact, and needs to be sustainable. Moreover, during the pandemic, \"staycations\" have become an attractive alternative for people who prefer a short trip within their state's borders. As a result, a community-based event like a state fair may be more attractive than outof-state travel options.",

An initial coding started with attributes from the existing literature, from which we identified key attributes as initial coding categories of analysis. Subsequently, we used an inductive approach to extract attributes from the data, engaging in a repetitive process of sorting and grouping attributes into categories by revising the categories and formulating new ones. Due to redundancy in the major categories, we merged some similar categories to create broader, more comprehensive categories. We also eliminated some categories with too few attributes. We discussed and reached consensus through a deliberative process, finally deriving 121 attributes.",

We conducted the subsequent coding process by classifying each response into four levels (i.e., attributes, functional consequences, psychological consequences, and values). Through the repetitive process of content analysis, the two independent coders aggregated all direct (e.g., A-C-V) or indirect (e.g. A-V) links based on respondent-provided content. The laddering process generated a chain with one or more links. Additional or missing linkages regarding coding categories were discussed and adjusted. Two coders performed the final coding of the ladders, with inter-coder reliability showing 72.1% of the Cohen's kappa values exceeded 0.61, placing it in the substantial agreement range (Cohen, 1960) .

The second core value, \"sense of safety,\" shows strong connections with one psychological consequence (\"feeling safe\") and two functional consequences (\"prevention,\" \"care/protection\"). Additionally, the results imply that a single consequence could serve multiple ends. For instance, the \"prevention\" consequence led to different personal values (\"trust\" and \"sense of safety\").

Another interesting finding is that pre-event COVID-19-related health/safety information is more important than relevant services during the event, suggesting proper pre-event communication may reduce concerns and increase trust in events. In summary, our findings enable us to understand how potential event attendees link event attributes with particular consequences/benefits, as well as how these consequences can satisfy their personal values. Testing of causality to validate the MEC relationships discussed in Study 1 remains for subsequent research.

A satisfaction coefficient close to 1 indicates the attribute is highly likely to impact customer satisfaction, whereas a dissatisfaction coefficient approaching \u2212 1 indicates dissatisfaction will increase if the attribute is not fulfilled (Berger et al., 1993) . Results show that event attributes with high satisfaction coefficientsincluding amusement (D13), uniqueness (D11), food (D14), healthy food options (D15), and food prices (D16) -can greatly increase satisfaction. By contrast, event attributes with high dissatisfaction coefficientsincluding waste management (D13), event implementation (D27), admission fee (D3), on-site ticket sales (D4), parking (D2), and restrooms (D18) -can strongly influence dissatisfaction. The sum of the coefficients implies indifferent attributes with positive-sum coefficients such as security screening (D6) and multiple exits (A1) are closer to attractive attributes. Other indifferent attributes with negative-sum coefficientsincluding contact information of local health authorities (B5), location (D1), information desk (D8), and way finding (D9) -are closer to must-be attributes. Fig. 3 shows the Kano classification in the satisfaction and dissatisfaction indexes plot. This plot sheds light on what attributes are associated with potential satisfaction in the case of being present/fulfilled, as well as potential dissatisfaction in the case of being absent/unfulfilled. As seen in the figure, entertainment (D12) in the must-be attribute quadrant can be considered a one-dimensional attribute, the fulfillment of which helps increase satisfaction. On the other hand, the onedimensional attribute, event implementation (D27), can be interpreted as a must-be attribute whose non-fulfillment can increase attendee dissatisfaction.",

Some must-be attributes (e.g., admission fee) and one-dimensional attributes (e.g., restrooms) in our study were classified as indifferent attributes in a previous study (Velikova et al., 2017) . While atmosphere and design are attractive attributes that greatly influenced satisfaction in our study, event environment was a dissatisfier/must-be attribute in prior work (Harrington et al., 2017) .

Overall, our results suggest that state fair organizers should pay attention to present/fulfill one-dimensional attributes and attractive attributes that drive increased influence satisfaction, allocating more resources for them during decision making.

This timely research was motived by the necessity of examining the product/ service-consumer relationship in an event context because of potential changes in customers' needs and preferences. Employing a sequential exploratory strategy of the mixed-method approach with an integration of MEC theory and the Kano model, we sought to identify opportunities to improve existing event products/services. A key implication of Study 1 is that hedonic value (i.e., pleasure and excitement) and self-protective value (i.e., sense of security) are core attendee values. In particular, event attendees may desire to achieve hedonic value more than other values, regardless of pandemic conditions. Findings in Study 2 imply that hedonic attributes either can greatly increase satisfaction (e.g., amusement) or greatly decrease it (e.g., entertainment). Must-be health/ safety attributes (e.g., health/safety services), meanwhile, do not increase satisfaction, but they do increase dissatisfaction if not presented/ fulfilled. To increase event attendees' satisfaction, delivering highperformance, attractive attributes and one-dimensional attributes is a strategic way to induce a pleasurable customer experience during and after a pandemic.",

Unlike previous studies, we identified event attributes by analyzing text data and gleaned satisfaction attributes from Kano's functional requirements perspective. By using a four-level means-end model with a laddering technique, we contributed to prior work that has examined personal values in a three-level A-C-V sequence (Chen, 2006; Yeh & Lin, 2017) . Because epidemic/pandemic-related event services were not well documented in the literature, the results of this study can be used to characterize future events during/after an epidemic or pandemic. Additionally, this study can serve as a foundation for future, larger studies that could produce empirical evidence. One possible extension of this work would involve incorporating perceived risks regarding epidemic/pandemic disease and behavioral intentions to be able to characterize segments by personal values and Kano attributes in a staycation or event tourism context. The effect of hospitality consumers' adoptive belief regarding COVID-19 on their positive/negative emotion is not just direct but is also moderated by perceived health risks (Foroudi, Tabaghdehi, & Marvi, 2021) . In that sense, perceived health risks may play a key role in lowering or enhancing satisfaction among attendees who experience health/safety-related event attributes. In addition to the practical implications discussed in studies 1 and 2, our overall findings offer additional marketing and managerial implications for event managers in their recovery preparedness efforts. Event mangers can benefit using the MEC and Kano approaches in examining existent and non-existent event attributes to expand or adjust their pandemic-related products/services. Managers should revisit their event products/services and prioritize attributes by importance and by what leads to achieving personal values and improving potential satisfaction.",

            "text": "From a product/service perspective, event attribute-based marketing may help increase attendee satisfaction. From a customer perspective, by contrast, value-based marketing may motivate their participation. Events are a phenomenon of human culture and have various impacts, including personal health and well-being (Getz, 2010; Getz & Page, 2016) . Because people increasingly value both, leisure activity providers have a significant business growth opportunity (Pyke, Hartwell, Blake, & Hemingway, 2016) . At the same time, providing appropriate programs/services is essential to creating a pleasurable and safe event environment. When customers perceive crowding, they are likely to prefer safety-oriented products (Maeng, Tanner, & Soman, 2013) . Thus, delivering a variety of health/safety-relevant programming in the form of entertainment may be a strategic way to stand out from competing events.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations that should be addressed. First, there may be various reasons causing attendees' attribute preferences regarding importance, including predispositions toward certain physical features or health. Future work needs to investigate whether associations exist between these characteristics and attendees' opinions regarding attributes, consequences, and values. Second, there is a need for some caution in assuming that means-end models are organized in a hierarchical A-C-V sequence. A future study could apply various forms of analysis, including MEC network analysis, to delineate asymmetric relationships among event attributes, consequences, and personal values. Regarding the Kano model, other asymmetric methods also could provide more specific information for the classification of event product/ service attributes, depending on their asymmetric influences on customer satisfaction. Third, our quantitative data do not rely upon onsite event experience, meaning findings are not free from hypothetical bias. Also, this study focused on one event type (i.e., state fair) and had mostly young respondents; our methods should be applied in a variety of event contexts with diverse groups. Further, perceived health/safety risks of an event in a time of pandemic may be different for different age groups and health statuses. Future empirical research can investigate the relationship between event attributes and perceived risk among attendees with varying profiles. Finally, due to the scope of this research, we did not attempt to segment event markets based on results. While an integrated MEC-Kano model approach enables us to understand potential event attendees' state fair-related needs, segmentation is necessary in subsequent research to provide an effective targeting strategy in the new, post-pandemic normal. 2.
