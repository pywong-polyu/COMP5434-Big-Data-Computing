She took 40 mg prednisone for 5 days and returned to normal activities 21 days later, after resolution of symptoms without sequelae or complaints. In the second episode, which was symptomatically more severe in terms of intensity and duration, the patient had headache, malaise, diarrhea, cough, and sore throat that evolved to myalgia and ageusia, muscle fatigue, insomnia, mild dyspnea on exertion, and shortness of breath. In both episodes, however, disease was classified as mild, and she was treated at home, not requiring hospitalization.",

Cycle threshold values of N, E, and RdRp targets were 25, 26, and 27 in the first episode and 21, 12, and 17 in the second episode, respectively. In the second episode, the patient had a high viral load (presumed because of low cycle threshold values detected). Four weeks after the patient tested positive by rRT-PCR in the second episode, an IgG test against S1 protein by chemiluminescence (VITROS, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, https://www.orthoclinicaldiagnostics.com) yielded a positive result. We then sequenced swab specimens by using PGM Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher, https://www.thermofisher.com), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 1,405,009 mapped reads for sample A (from the first episode) and 2,570,182 reads for sample B (from the second episode) were obtained, resulting in a sequencing mean depth >1,000\u00d7 for both samples and a coverage of >99%.",

In the first episode, the lineage B.1.1.33 was detected, whereas lineage P.2 (an alias for B.1.1.28.2) was detected in the second infection ( Figure, panel B) https://virological.org/t/genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-manauspreliminary-findings/586); and P.2, also described in Brazil (C.M.

Our report of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection with a E484K variant corroborates in vitro and in silico studies that estimated the potential of lineages carrying this mutation to escape from neutralizing antibodies (3; Z.

In the first infection, the retrieved genome had the S:G1219C mutation, whereas the mutation S:E484K was observed in the second infection.This reinfection case aligns with another reinfection recently described in Brazil in which a first infection with the B.1.1.33 lineage was followed by a second one with the P.2 lineage (P.C. Resende et al., unpub. data, https://virological.org/t/spike-e484k-mutationin-the-first-sars-cov-2-reinfection-case-confirmed-inbrazil-2020/584). The E484K mutation, located in the viral receptor binding domain, has been emerging independently in several SARS-CoV-2 variants, and its monitoring is of pivotal importance in the current stage of the pandemic. At least 3 main lineages harbor E484K: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa and widespread worldwide (H. Tegally et al.); P.1, recently described in Manaus, Brazil, which harbors a constellation of new mutations (including N501Y) (N.R. Faria et al., unpub. data,",
