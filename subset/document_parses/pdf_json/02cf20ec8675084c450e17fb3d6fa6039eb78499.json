Effective countermeasures require the rapid development of data and tools to monitor its spread and better understand immunogenic profile. However, limited information is available about the tools and target of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we excogitated a new approach for analyzing phylogenetic relationships by using the whole prototype proteome sequences. Phylogenetic analysis on the whole prototype proteome sequences showed that SARS-CoV-2 was a direct descendant of Bat-CoV and was closely related to Pangolin-CoV, Bat-SL-CoV, and SARS-CoV. The pairwise comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with Bat-CoV showed an unusual replacement of the motif consisting of seven amino acids (NNLDSKV) within the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The replaced motif in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was found in 12 other species, including a conserved surface protein of a malaria-causing pathogen, Plasmodium malariae. We further identified the T and B cell epitope sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with conserved surface protein of P. malariae using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB). The shared immunodominant epitopes may provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection to those previously infected with P. malariae.",

The genomes of CoVs consist of a single-stranded, positive RNA of 26,000-32,000 base pairs and a variable number (from 6 to 11) of open reading frames [2] . Because of their considerable size with the characteristics of the RNA genomes, CoVs can frequently mutate to escape their natural hosts, causing severe diseases in humans. Outbreaks of SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012 are well-known examples. Currently, another severe pathogenic novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has emerged and caused a global pandemic [3, 4] .",

A high degree of genetic diversity in CoVs makes it challenging to find the phylogenetic relationship of CoVs. Understanding the phylogenetic relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs is essential for identifying its host to prevent the next outbreak. Because of the ambiguous results by genome comparison approaches, an alignment-free method called natural vector was adopted to investigate the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 [5] . However, the frequency of the original sequence always predominates the mutated sequence if the genomes of individuals were compared within the same species. Therefore, it is possible to construct a prototype proteome of a species by identifying a prevalent amino acid (aa) at each position of proteome after multiple alignments of individual proteomes for the analysis of the phylogenetic relationships.",

The S protein first binds to the host receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit and then makes entry by fusing the viral and host membranes through the S2 subunit [7, 8] . Thus, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 becomes an attractive target for the development of virus attachment inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and vaccines [9] [10] [11] . However, there is limited information available on which parts of the SARS-CoV-2 are recognized by human immune responses. Thus, the knowledge of the potential immunogenic profile of SARS-CoV-2 is of immediate relevance and would assist in vaccine design and facilitate the evaluation of vaccine candidate immunogenicity, monitoring of mutational events, and the epitope escape during transmission.",

The maps of the T cell epitopes identified from P. malariae conserved surface protein were analyzed based on selected sequence identity to the given parent antigen (P. malariae conserved surface protein) and nonparental sequence (SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein) using ImmunomeBrowser tool available in IEDB [20] . The sequence seminaries within the T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 and P. malariae conserved surface protein were analyzed using the Epitope cluster analysis tool using the threshold of 70 available in IEDB analysis resource [21] . The degree of conservancy between T cell epitopes (peptide core sequence) of P. malariae conserved surface protein and T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 were calculated by the epitope conservancy analysis tool, and data were represented as identity of percentage (%) [22] . Four or five amino acid shared residues were considered significant [23] .",

To construct the whole prototype proteomes of viral species related to SARS-CoV-2, we first collected all the individual genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 as well as its related viral species by the BLAST sequence similarity search from all of the publicly available genome databases (Supplementary Table S1 ). The genome sequences of the individual viruses were converted into protein sequences. After in silico translation of the individual viruses, the proteomes of individual viruses of the same viral species were aligned through multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) followed by identifying the most prevalent aa in each position within the same species to determine the prototype proteome sequences for each viral species.",

            "text": "To investigate the sequence dissimilarities between SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV, we performed pairwise sequence analysis between the prototype aa sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV. The pairwise aa sequence analysis showed that both virus genomes encode 14 genes (Figure 2b) . The aa sequence mismatches were randomly distributed except for the consecutive 7-aa alteration ( 439 NNLDSKV 445 ) in the spike protein. Since genetic mutation is a random process, the mutated points are expected to be distributed randomly throughout the genome. Considering the general nature of mutations, the consecutive 7-aa sequence difference in the spike protein was peculiar enough for us to speculate that an unusual event happened during the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from Bat-CoV. 3D models of the spike proteins were made to analyze the consequence of the alteration to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein structure. The spike protein of CoV is the surface protein that binds to a receptor on the host cell surface. The spike protein consists of three large domains: a large ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane anchor, and a short intracellular tail [25] . The ectodomain is further divided into a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion subunit S2. Coronavirus first binds to a receptor on the host cell surface through its S1 subunit and then fuses the viral and the host membranes through its S2 subunit, meaning that the S1 domain plays the most critical role in the virus's invasion into its host [26, 27] . As shown in Figure 2c , altering the consecutive 7-aa on the outer layer of the spike protein's S1 domain did not affect the overall structural integrity of the spike protein. The 3D modeling also showed that the consecutive 7-aa alteration resulted in a new motif occupying more space in the S1 domain than its original structure by transforming a partial alpha-helical structure to a random coil. Since the S1 domain acts as the binding domain for the entry of the virus, enlargement of its space and adaptation of different conformation in the outermost layer surface of the S1 domain would endow SARS-CoV-2 to expand its host range. The unusual genetic alteration in the spike protein between SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV motivated us to investigate the unique nature of the 7-aa motif ( 439 NNLDSKV 445 ). To trace down its distribution, we overlappingly defragmented the aa sequence of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 into 7 aa units and performed a peptide sequence search in the publicly available protein databases. All of the aa sequences matched with the spike proteins of coronaviruses except for the 7-aa motif. Interestingly, the 7-aa motif ( 439 NNLDSKV 445 ) of SARS-CoV-2 was found in 12 other species, including P. malariae, which causes malaria to humans ( Table 1 ). As presented in Table 1 , the 7-aa motif is primarily present in the surface proteins of simple organisms. The motif's widespread in simple organisms as a surface protein suggests that the motif plays a significant role on the surface of the organisms. It is also worth noting that the NNLDSKV motif was located at aa 449-455 of a conserved membrane-bound surface protein of P. malariae (Figure 3 ). 3.3 The predicted T cell epitopes of the conserved surface protein of P. malariae contain the unique \"NNLDSKV\" peptide",

Surprisingly, two T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein ( 101 IRGWIFGTTLDSKTQSLL 118 and 440 NLDSKVGGNYNYLYR-LFR 457 ) shared sequence homology with P. malariae conserved surface protein T cell epitope by NNLDSKV motif. Conversely, all tested B cell epitopes share no significant homology with SARS-CoV-2 according to the reference sequences of the previous study [16] . In addition to sequence homology, we observed the binding affinity of three different T cell epitopes of P. malariae conserved surface protein to the 12 most frequent HLA class I alleles in the worldwide population and ranked based on the lowest percentile score, which has the higher binding ability ( Table 2 ).",

Because of the genetic variation between individual strains, it is natural to find that phylogenetic analyses generate different results if different kinds of individual genome sequences were used, explaining current discordant conclusions on the origin of SARS-CoV-2. Since genetic mutation or recombination occurs on an individual basis and these events cannot occur at the same position repeatedly, the prototype sequence of the genome within a species is always the most prevalent base among the members. Also, the degeneracy of codons is present in nucleotide sequences but not in protein aa sequences. Since degenerate codons are not affected by natural selection, there are more genetic variations present in degenerate codons. Considering these natural variabilities of nucleotide sequences in RNA genomes, we believe that our approach of the whole prototype proteome analysis using aa sequence could generate a much more precise result than current approaches in phylogenetic analysis.",

            "text": "The clinical presentation of COVID-19 significantly differs from that of other coronaviruses [31] . The acquisition of the P. malariae gene in the spike protein seems to explain why. The malaria-causing Plasmodium species infect liver cells and erythrocytes to promote blood clotting and damages in the heart, liver, or kidney. It is fascinating to note that, unlike other coronaviral infections, symptoms similar to the case of the P. malariae infection were reported in COVID-19 [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Red cell distribution width (RDW) of erythrocytes has been reported to be enlarged after the malarial invasion because the growth of the malaria parasite causes the cells to be enlarged [32, 33] . It was also observed in COVID-19 that elevated RDW is correlated with the increased mortality risk in COVID-19 [34] . The enlargement of erythrocytes in COVID-19 is not the only factor correlated with malaria infection. Clinical presentations such as blood clotting and damages in the heart, liver, or kidney also were observed in COVID-19 patients [35] [36] [37] . Considering that, the investigation of different kinds of antimalaria drugs for COVID-19 treatment needs to be pursued. Several studies have reported the relationship of the ABO blood group system to susceptibility and resistance of excessive Plasmodium parasite invasion in severe malaria [38, 39] . Individuals with A, B, or AB blood groups are more susceptible to the malarial parasite than O blood group. In agreement with our results, ABO blood group system is also associated with COVID-19, as in malaria. A recent meta-analysis showed that A, B, or AB blood groups are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than O blood group [40, 41] . Furthermore, comparative analysis between COVID-19 and malaria showed that malaria-free countries have much higher rates of infectivity and fatality to SARS-CoV-2 compared to malariaendemic countries [42] . The association between malaria and COVID-19 has suggested that low COVID-19 cases in malaria-endemic countries could be due to the antimalaria immunity, which provides heterogeneous protection against SARS-CoV-2 [40] . Despite the link between malaria and COVID-19, the reason has not been known. This work suggests that the NNLDSKV motif could be the missing link of malaria and COVID-19. The apparent immunodominant T cell epitope conservation between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and conserved surface protein of P. malariae may provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection to those previously infected with Plasmodium. With that in mind, the possible significance of said motif should be considered during the development of both COVID-19 and malaria vaccines.",

Contrary to the Western, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children was never reported, and the morbidity and mortality by COVID-19 are much milder in Eastern countries.
