Methods Review of the COVID-19 planning process and work products in preparation for a patient surge. Organizational and process changes, workflow redesign, and communication plans are presented. Results The planning process included widespread collaboration among leadership from many disciplines. The department of surgery played a leading role in establishing clinical protocols, guidelines, and policies in preparation for a surge of COVID-19 patients. A multidisciplinary approach with input from clinical and nonclinical stakeholders is critical to successful crisis planning. A clear communication plan should be implemented early and input from trainees, staff, and faculty should be solicited. Conclusion Major departmental and health system reorganization is required to adapt academic surgical practices to a widespread crisis. Surgical leadership, innovation, and flexibility are critical to successful planning and implementation.",

Normal hospital operations were significantly reduced by postponing all non-essential procedures. Statewide \"stay-at-home\" orders required radical changes triaging personnel to be present at hospital facilities and those who may work remotely from home. Simultaneously, enormous efforts were made to stockpile personal protective equipment (PPE) and to establish policies regarding its use. Within the department of surgery, these challenges required leadership to form new workgroups and reporting structures, establish clear communication strategies, redefine clinical activities for the faculty, and modify the workloads of trainees. As the pandemic continues, it will be imperative that initial plans and strategies presented here be continuously evaluated and modified to address the fluidity of the situation.",

Internal data will come from a variety of sources including the C-suite and University leadership, health system analysts, and a variety of workgroups established specifically for the hospital incident command. The workgroups that were established to prepare for the COVID-19 crisis at our institution are shown in Table 1 . Appropriate surgical representation is needed within these workgroups.

Anticipation of such a policy prompted the departmental leadership to define the type of cases that would continue early in the course of the crisis. Once the policy was implemented, each division had already decided on a finite list of procedures or indications to perform operations based on the more general guidelines provided by the medical center, state, and professional societies. The perioperative leadership for each hospital pavilion was responsible for reviewing the operative case lists 2 days prior and escalating any questionably non-essential cases to the attending surgeon and then to the surgeon-in-chief if needed. In general, the policy was implemented in a way that respected the faculty's clinical decision regarding the consequences of postponement. The surgical leadership across the health system established patient categories to prioritize procedures based on the urgency ( Table 2) . As the pandemic progresses, there are many factors that will impact the ability to perform surgery. Day-to-day, datadriven risk-benefit analyses must influence care delivery and case triage. Avoidance of blanket policies in lieu of careful and frequent analysis of the multiple factors is needed. These factors include operating room capacity, bed availability, equipment, supplies and PPE availability, ventilator availability, staffing, blood availability, and assessment of the national, regional, and local conditions and trends that may affect the magnitude of the surge. Two weeks after the initial policy was implemented, guidance was given to tighten the window for essential cases from 3 to 1 month based on modeling for the surge and limited resources. We also established different threat levels to the health system to guide our surgical case scheduling (Table 3) .",

A call for volunteers to cover the ICU, trauma, or acute care surgery services was sent to faculty members outside the division covering trauma and acute care surgery and the surgical intensive care units. Specifically, surgeons were asked about their comfort level and privileging to manage critically ill patients and take emergency general surgery or trauma call. When the surveys were returned, surgeons were placed into different tiers to be called upon when needed during the surge. Tier 1 represented those who were comfortable with these skills and were currently credentialed to perform them. Tier 2 represented a pool of surgeons who were reasonably comfortable with ventilator management and ICU care but were not currently credentialed to do so, and Tier 3 represented the pool of surgeon who were not comfortable with these skills and were not credentialed to perform them. Only those individuals with current ATLS certification were placed in the trauma call pool. Training was then initiated by the trauma and critical care staff to provide refresher training to those who would potentially be redeployed to the ICU. These training sessions were conducted via videoconference and included presentations on ventilator management, critical care for the non-intensivist, pharmacotherapy, and modules from the society of critical care medicine's \"ICU Care for the Non-ICU Physician\". 4 It was important to communicate to the faculty, to alleviate anxiety and provide the safest care, that if they are to be deployed to the intensive care unit that there would always be an intensivist available to provide oversight and assistance throughout their assignment.",

With normal work activities and assignments being altered during the OSU and DOS response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that there will be opportunities for faculty to further their professional and personal development. We share this list for all faculty, recognizing that each faculty member has different professional, family and personal realities during this time Consider taking advantage of some of the following personal, academic, educational, research, and scholarly opportunities for yourself and the department of Surgery We ask that you commit to at least one of these activities in the personal row, and customize, based on your at-hospital work schedule, and plan to undertake activities in rows 2-5 in the weeks ahead 1. Personal A. Make time for family/friends (virtually if necessary) B. Remember to exercise-move in a way that makes you happy! C. Work on good nutrition choices D. Consider or develop your Mindfulness practices: Headspace is now offering free subscription to all health care professionals (https://www.headspace.com/health-covid-19)-a great time to explore and try. Calm is another meditation and mindfulness resource that has developed free resources for this time. https://www.calm.com/blogtake-a-deep-breath E. Expand your knowledge/skills-pick up a book you have always wanted to read; catch up on your journal reading; consider ways to enhance your work as a master clinician F. Give yourself 15 min a day (at least) to do something that brings you joy G. Reach out to your colleagues-both here and remotely-and find out how they are doing; whether there is anything you can do to help them. Sometimes that is as listening to them! 2. Professional/Academic A. Update your OSU Find-a-Doctor profile information (your 'front office'-https://onesource.osumc. edu/sites/Audience/Physicians/Pages/FindAdoctor.aspx) B. Review you CV and refine its formatting and completeness. Also, consider updating your NIH Biosketch C. Review the Department of Surgery P&T document relevant to your track and career stage; the center for FAME will be hosting an upcoming virtual session on P&T (https://oaa.osu. edu/sites/default/files/updloads/governance-documents/college-of-medicine/surgery/Suergery APT 2017-10-28.pdf). The COM APT toolbox can be found here https://medicine.osu.edu/faculty/promotion-and-tenure/apt-toolbox. Please contact Suzanne Knott with questions D. Methods to document talks and posters presented at conferences that have been moved to online only, been postponed or that are being held but the faculty member cannot attend (apastyle.apa.org/blog/canceled-conferences) E. Complete required training in Buckeye Learn (https//:buckeyelearn.osu.edu) F. Complete OSU FD4ME (very relevant online faculty development modules) free to all OSU faculty-https://fd4me.osu.edu/ G.

            "text": "One of the issues that has created the most stress among the faculty and trainees leading up to the surge was the availability of PPE. Policies were established early to help preserve PPE, particularly N95 masks, and to avoid overuse or waste when use was not warranted. Aerosolizing and high-risk procedures were identified and included oral-maxillofacial surgery, thoracic, surgery, and head/neck and dental interventions with the intent to disrupt or break the mucosal membrane in the oral cavity, airway, and/or pulmonary tract, and cause prolonged exposure to aerosolization and/or droplets. It was recommended that N95 masks only be used for these aerosolizing procedures. At the point of care, the default was for clinicians to proceed with an abundance of caution. Continuous messaging and reinforcement are needed to avoid excessive use of PPE early in the \"curve.\" Part of preparations for the surge was to include updates from the medical director of supply chain (SB) to provide real time data regarding our PPE inventory, especially N95 masks. Part of that messaging included the projections for PPE use through the surge that emphasized the need for conservation prior to the surge. While it is still fairly unique for a health system to have a medical director for their supply chain, it proved to be an important part of the messaging plan to clinicians and helped alleviate faculty stress regarding the PPE planning. For systems without a supply chain medical director, we strongly encourage some engagement from a supply chain representative to directly answer questions and address faculty around PPE issues.",

            "text": "Once non-essential surgical procedures were postponed, operative cases were placed in a \"depot\" to be rescheduled after normal operations resumed. New teleconsults that would eventually require surgery were similarly placed in a depot for the schedulers. This process has led to hundreds of cases accruing that will need to be scheduled when the operating room schedule returns to normal. This \"second surge\" of elective cases will present its own set of logistic challenges and requires early planning to facilitate care of surgical patients once the COVID-19 surge has passed. Adding operating room staff and extending operating room hours will likely be required to accommodate the large volume of cases that will be rescheduled after the crisis. Additionally, the supply chain must ensure that the necessary equipment and supplies will be available for elective cases after the crisis is over. Planning with perioperative leadership is needed to prepare for these cases. A key facet of this plan is reassuring current personnel of their worth and value when their specialized services may not be needed during the crisis planning and surge. These personnel, who performed admirably during \"normal\" times, will be called upon greatly in the \"back to business\" phase after the crisis. Our institution has developed redeployment and volunteer opportunities for several employees, as well as a disaster leave policy to retain key members of our team. ",
