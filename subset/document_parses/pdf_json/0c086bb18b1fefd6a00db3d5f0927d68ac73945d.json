            "text": "Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic was superimposed upon an ongoing epidemic of opioid use disorder and overdose deaths. Although the trend of opioid prescription patterns (OPP) had decreased in response to public health efforts before the pandemic, little is known about the OPP from emergency department (ED) clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a pre-post study of adult patients who were discharged from 13 EDs and one urgent care within our academic medical system between 01/01/2019 and 09/30/2020 using an interrupted time series (ITS) approach. Patient characteristics and prescription data were extracted from the single unified electronic medical record across all study sites. Prescriptions of opioids were converted into morphine equivalent dose (MED). We compared the \"Covid-19 Pandemic\" period (C19, 03/29/2020-9/30/2020) and the \"Pre-Pandemic\" period (PP, 1/ 19/2020-03/28/2020). We used a multivariate logistic regression to assess clinical factors associated with opioid prescriptions. Results: We analyzed 361,794 ED visits by adult patients, including 259,242 (72%) PP and 102,552 (28%) C19 visits. Demographic information and percentages of patients receiving opioid prescriptions were similar in both groups. The median [IQR] MED per prescription was higher for C19 patients (70 [56-90]) than for PP patients (60 [60-90], P < 0.001). ITS demonstrated a significant trend toward higher MED prescription per ED visit during the pandemic (coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.05-0.16, P = 0.002). A few factors, that were associated with lower likelihood of opioid prescriptions before the pandemic, became non-significant during the pandemic. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that emergency clinicians increased the prescribed amount of opioids per prescription during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. Etiologies for this finding could include lack of access to primary care and other specialties during the pandemic, or lower volumes allowing for emergency clinicians to identify who is safe to be prescribed opioids.",

To address this issue on a national level, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published guidelines for prescribing opioids for patients with chronic non-cancer pain in 2016 [5] . Similarly, individual states created prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to assist physicians in prescribing opioids appropriately by tracking patients' opioid prescriptions across multiple providers. While PDMPs have been shown to decrease opioid prescribing in individual states such as Iowa [6] or Florida [7] , among multiple states [8] , and indeed nationally [9] , their effectiveness in reducing opioid-related harms has been called into question [10] , as the rise in synthetic and non-pharmaceutical opioids may have rendered these programs inconsequential. To combat factors outside of physician prescribing, the state of Maryland passed the Heroin and Opioid Prevention Effort (HOPE) Act in 2017, which mandated hospitals create discharge plans for patients with opioid use disorders (OUD) and increase access to treatment through the funding of outpatient substance use disorder programs [11] .",

            "text": "The reasons for a change in emergency clinicians' pattern of opioid prescribing are multifactorial. Due to \"stay-at-home\" orders and social distancing mandates in many states, independent physician practices were drastically reduced [18] , causing patients to seek continuation of therapy or acute pain treatment in EDs more often. Furthermore, emergency clinicians, when faced with the uncertainty of independent physician practices, may have opted to prescribe a higher number of opioid tablets so patients can stay at home longer. Additionally, the overall decline of ED visits during the early pandemic of up to 42% [2] might have allowed clinicians more time to scour patients' records in our state's health information exchange, which included the PDMP, to provide more personalized treatment regimens. Overall, our findings provided further evidence to support other authors' assertions [19] that emergency clinicians may need more training to treat patients with chronic pain, acute pain, or substance use disorder more effectively during the current COVID-19 pandemic and any future crisis. It is unclear whether a pattern of increasing ED opioid prescriptions during the pandemic would be a direct cause of increased opioid overdose presentations. While there is evidence that opioids prescribed in the ED carry a moderate risk for development of long-term opioid use [20] , ED opioid prescriptions were 46% less likely to progress to longterm use than non-ED opioid prescriptions (eg. inpatient, outpatient, ambulatory surgery, dentistry) [21] . In the state of Maryland, 93% of opioid-related deaths involved fentanyl [22] , which may suggest illicit opioids play a larger role in overdose presentations and deaths than prescribed opioids. Further, a study of 7 EDs in the Washington D.C./Baltimore region [23] saw an increase in presentations for substance use disorder in general, but the proportion of presentations for opioids specifically remained statistically the same. This implies substance use disorders worsened in general during the pandemic, likely owed to a combination of psychosocial and economic stressors, and it is less likely that an increase in ED opioid prescriptions is the primary driving factor in increased presentations for opioid overdoses and fatalities.",

Previous studies suggested that men and women have similar prevalence of opioid use disorder [24, 25] . However, men were more likely to receive opioid prescriptions in our population. Furthermore, compared to white patients, Black and African American patients were less likely to receive opioid prescriptions in our study, which agreed with recent reports [26, 27] . This represents a physician bias and is possibly explained by a higher prevalence of substance use disorder screening in Baltimore/Washington EDs among Black and African Americans when compared to white patients [23] . Emergency clinicians should recognize this bias and carefully review which patients are appropriate for opioid prescriptions from the ED.",

Additionally, it is assumed that the orders given at the onset of the pandemic are driving the measured changes. We were not able to control for other interventions occurring simultaneously to the \"stay-at-home\" order. We only examined patients' index ED visits, as such, we were not able to examine the effect of high ED utilization and the opioid prescriptions or prescription refills. However, the effects and association of high ED utilizers and prescriptions had been described previously [13, 14] . Further, it was beyond the scope of this review to include individual diagnoses and their relation to receiving opioids, so the population level data may not be applicable on an individual basis. One final limitation was our study period was during a period of \"stay-at-home\" orders and limited opening for businesses and physicians' offices. If we examined for a longer period of time, the effect might have changed as patients may have more access to their primary care physicians or other substance use disorder clinics.",
