To investigate the regional health systems performance, we refer to the OECD Health Care Quality Indicators project to construct of a set of five composite indexes. The composite indexes are built on the basis of the non-compensatory Adjusted Mazziotta-Pareto Index, that allows comparability of the data across units and over time. We propose three indexes of health system performance, namely Quality Index, Accessibility Index and Cost-Expenditure Index, along with a Health Status Index and a Lifestyles Index. Our framework highlights that regional disparities still persist. Consistently with the evidence at the institutional level, there are regions, particularly in Southern Italy, which record lower levels of performance with high levels of expenditure. Continuous research is needed to provide policy makers with appropriate data and tools to build a cohesive health care system for the benefit of the whole population. Even if future research is needed to integrate our framework with new indicators for the calculation of the indexes and with the identification of new indexes, the study shows that a scientific reflection on decentralisation of health systems is necessary in order to reduce inequalities.",

International institutions, like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), had and still have a central role in encouraging performance measurement at the national level. The OECD, given the proliferation of health indicators and the need to build conceptual frameworks, started the Health Quality Indicator (HCQI) project in 2004, with the aim of developing a set of indicators to investigate the quality of health performance at national levels. Since the OECD mission is the promotion of policies that improve the economic and social well-being of all citizens in the light of the disparities which persist at the national level, it seems necessary to maintain a high level of attention to the national experiences.",

Adopted by all members of the European Union during the European session of the WHO Regional Committee, in September 2008 (resolution EUR/RC58/R4), the charter has the aim of giving the health system a prominent place on the political agenda of the Member States. One of the central messages of the Charter is that a well-functioning health system, both in terms of health and efficiency, is essential for every society. To this end, Member States committed to promote transparency and accountability. This process enhanced the prominence of accurate and up-to-date information on performance in order to improve health systems. Without performance information it is impossible to identify strengths and weaknesses of a health system, and consequently it is impossible to promote its improvement (Smith et al., 2009) .",

A process of inter-regional sharing has led to the selection of about 300 indicators aimed at describing and comparing, through a benchmarking process, the different dimensions of the performance of the health systems. 10 The use of a large number of indicators leads to a precise and exhaustive description of the phenomenon in its components, but not to an overall view of the health system in its complexity. Starting from the observed variables, it is therefore necessary to extract latent concepts that can subdivide the phenomenon into several more easily measurable components. As argued by Jacobs et al., (2007, p. 384 ) \"There is now a plethora of information available for the measurement of relative performance, and interpreting such data is therefore becoming increasingly complex. One widely adopted approach to summarizing the information contained in disparate indicators of health care performance is to create a single composite measure. The rationale for developing such a composite measure is that no single indicator can hope to capture the complexity of system performance\".",

Effectiveness is the degree to which the desired results are achieved, so the variables we include in the construction of this index are the 5-year net survival rate after diagnosis of neoplasia and the suicide mortality rate. The Safety dimension should capture the extent to which the system is able to prevent damage to the users, therefore it is calculated using the rate of sepsis-related mortality, the percentage of short hospital stays and the percentage of caesarean sections. The dimension of Responsiveness / Patient-Centeredness, according to Arah et al.

            "text": "A fundamental issue, concerning composite index construction, is the degree of compensability or substitutability of the individual indicators. The components of a composite index are called 'substitutable' if a deficit in one component may be compensated by a surplus in another (e.g., a low value of \"Life expectancy\" can be offset by a high value of \"Standardized mortality ratio\" and vice versa). Similarly, the components of a composite index are called 'non-substitutable' if a compensation among them is not allowed (e.g., a low value of \"Life expectancy\" cannot be offset by a high value of \"Physical status index\" and vice versa). Therefore, we can define an aggregation approach as 'compensatory' or 'non-compensatory' depending on whether it permits compensability or not (Tarabusi & Guarini, 2013) . In any composite index each dimension is introduced to represent a relevant aspect of the phenomenon considered, therefore a measure of unbalance among dimensions may help the overall understanding of the phenomenon. In a non-compensatory or partially compensatory approach, all the dimensions of the phenomenon must be balanced and an aggregation function that takes unbalance into account, in terms of penalization, is often used (Mazziotta & Pareto, 2017 , 2019 . Due to the nature of the variables used, we opted for a non-compensatory approach: the Adjusted Mazziotta-Pareto Index (AMPI). The AMPI is a partially compensatory index that allows comparability of the data across units and over time (Mazziotta & Pareto, 2018) . It is a variant of the Mazziotta-Pareto Index (MPI), based on a re-scaling of the individual indicators by a Min-Max transformation, in contrast with the classic MPI where all the indicators are normalized by a linear combination of z-scores (De Muro et al., 2011) .",

Individual indicators are normalized by a re-scaling according to two 'goalposts', i.e. a minimum and a maximum value which represent the possible range of each variable for all time periods and for all units.

In this scenario, health status and lifestyle indices are two sides of the same coin and represent an important tool for policy makers. In fact, inequalities in lifestyle behaviours-such as physical activity and diet quality-reflect inequalities related to fields other than health, such as geography, race, but also income and education levels (Whitsel, 2017) .

Since the 90's the National Healthcare Service has been the subject of an important reform of regionalisation that assigned to the Regions the responsibility to provide health services and to guarantee regional economic sustainability. In Italy-a country historically characterized by a strong North-South economic and social dualism still persisting in the 1990s-the main risk recognised at the time was that regionalisation could lead to different regional systems and so accentuate disparities among Regions, in contrast to the Italian Constitution principles.",

For the construction of the indexes and for the choice of the dimensions to be evaluated, we drew inspiration from the framework developed by the OECD in the Health Care Quality Indicator project. The objective of the HCQI Project is to develop a set of indicators to investigate the quality of health services in different OECD member countries and to investigate the differences between countries; for this reason, we consider this framework well suitable for our comparison.",

The number of indicators used to calculate composite indexes should be increased. Moreover, further analysis concerning the valid application of the indicators in Italy is needed. We refer in particular to the Cost/Expenditure Index. A high level of public health expenditure can be considered a proxy for inclusion and cohesion, but, as highlighted in Sect. 2.1, one of the objectives of the reform of the Italian health system, which is based on solidarity principles, is the rationalisation of expenditure. Our Cost/Expenditure Index, however, captures only the first of these two aspects. Therefore, it should be integrated with indicators that also capture efficiency and economic sustainability.",
