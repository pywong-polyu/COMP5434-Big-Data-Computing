According to a recent review, the psychological effects of quarantine in the general population include post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, anger, frustration, boredom, financial loss and stigma (Brooks et al. 2020) . The psychological impacts of COVID-19 on children and youth are still unfolding; however, evidence from a study conducted on a sample of 1143 Spanish and Italian parents of children between 3 and 18 years old suggest negative effects of quarantine on youth (Orgil\u00e9s et al. 2020) . Nearly all (85.7%) parents reported changes in their child's emotional state during school closures and lockdown, with the most common symptoms reported being difficulty concentrating, boredom, irritability, restlessness and nervousness. In turn, parenting stress was positively associated with increased reporting of child emotional symptoms (Orgil\u00e9s et al. 2020) . These findings are consistent with evidence suggesting transactional parent-child effects and interdependence in parent and child adjustment following major negative world events (e.g. natural disasters, Juth et al. 2015) .",

Fontanesi et al.'s (2020) data suggest that parents of children with mental or physical disabilities reported higher levels of parental burnout and perceived less social support than did parents of children without disabilities. Further, parents of children with mental and physical disabilities were more likely to report changes in their child's behaviour, such as distractibility, inability to concentrate, irritability and general discomfort.

For parents raising children with IDD, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), quarantine means not only serving as their child's teacher, but also serving as their child's special educator, social skills coach, speech-language pathologist or behavioural/mental health therapist, sometimes with little support from professional helpers (Eshraghi et al. 2020) . Children with IDD often require more intensive services and supports than children with typical development, which may intensify parental strain during the pandemic. Examples of these intensive services and supports include specialised instruction in the form of special education, behavioural programming based on applied behaviour analysis, speech therapy, occupational and physical therapy and social skills instruction, to name a few (National Research Council 2001) .",

Recent prevalence estimates suggest that Hispanics represent the fastest growing population in ASD (Maenner et al. 2020) . Unfortunately, several studies document that US service systems may not meet the needs of Hispanic/Latinx children with IDD and report disparities in identification, diagnosis and treatment (Liptak et al. 2008; Nguyen et al. 2016; Zuckerman et al. 2017) , in part due to language proficiency (Stahmer et al. 2019; Zuckerman et al. 2017) , socioeconomic status (Escarce and Kapur 2006) and other factors such as mental health literacy, stigma and discrimination (e.g. DeFreitas et al. 2018) .

The lead author and a research assistant reviewed the interviewer notes for each participant and analysed all responses using standard qualitative data analysis procedures: briefly, all notes were coded and organised into categories with subcodes. This allowed systematic review of themes in the responses (Berg 2009 ) for summary (Corbin and Strauss 2008) . The lead author and research assistant then independently coded participants' responses to each question. The reliability between the two independent coders was good (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from .78 to .95), and, where there was disagreement in the ratings, the coders discussed and reached a consensus rating. Data from these responses are reported descriptively and are based on the consensus codes. Table 1 depicts the demographics of the current sample. Of the 77 parent participants, the majority were married and identified as Latinx and monolingual Spanish speaking. The sample was economically diverse, with a significant portion of our sample receiving some sort of government financial assistance. The majority were male children. All children had a developmental delay or intellectual disability diagnosis, and 62.34% had a comorbid diagnosis of ASD.",

Importantly, the main concerns expressed by these caregivers focused on their children's needs and the challenges of being at home, losing services and anxiety about the future. That being said, many parents reported unexpected 'silver linings' or positive aspects of 8 staying at home including spending more time with family and improved family relationships. Almost all families reported positive coping strategies, such as establishing routines at home, using behavioural strategies to support their children's development or engaging in exercise, meditation or social support. Although our findings are similar to other recent reports on the impact of COVID-19 on families, there is consistent evidence that the burden on parents who have children with disabilities, or educational or social vulnerabilities, is greater than in the general population (Coyne et al. 2020; Fontanesi et al. 2020; Masters et al. 2020 ). Because we do not have a comparison sample of ethnically, linguistically and socioeconomically diverse families of young children without IDD/ASD in the USA, it is difficult to say with certainty that our families parenting young children with developmental disabilities are experiencing the pandemic differently. However, there is ample pre-pandemic evidence supporting heightened parenting stress, increased caregiving burden and heightened challenges with child behaviour in families of children with IDD/ASD in comparison with counterparts with typical development (e.g. Hayes and Watson 2013) . Given the transactional relationship between parenting stress and child challenging behaviour (e.g. Neece et al. 2012; Woodman et al. 2015) , increases in child difficulties during the pandemic (Fontanesi et al. 2020 ) are likely to adversely affect parents' stress and ability to cope. Further, decreases in services for young children with IDD/ASD as a result of COVID-19 are likely to have detrimental short-term and long-term consequences given that the early childhood years represent a critical window for intervention due to brain plasticity and the potential for rapid developmental gains (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 2017; National Research Council 2001; Reichow and Wolery 2009).",

Past studies suggest that the Latino cultural value of 'familismo' is associated with improved well-being and adjustment, especially under difficult circumstances (Ay\u00f3n et al. 2010) . These strong family ties may be associated with improved coping (Perez and Cruess 2014) and may be partially responsible for parents' reports of improved family relationships and more family time as unexpected positive aspects of the pandemic. Resilient perspectives are particularly notable given the health and socioeconomic disparities disproportionately affecting individuals from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds during the COVID-19 crisis in the USA (Webb Hooper et al. 2020) .

At best, services moved to telehealth and remote platforms, and at worst, services were simply eliminated. More research needs to be done on the short-term and long-term impacts of COVID-19 on children with IDD and their families.
