            "text": "Immunotherapy is now established as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment, along with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Genetically modified T cells are a novel form of immunotherapy, characterized by highly efficient and specific targeting of tumor cells when compared with checkpoint inhibitors. At the time of writing this article, three autologous T cell products engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, and brexucabtagene autoleucel, [1] [2] [3] have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and multiple international health authorities, based on demonstrated durable and sustained remissions in a significant number of patients with relapsed and refractory hematological cancers that formerly had a dismal prognosis. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] All three products target CD19 and are indicated for the treatment of certain relapsed or refractory (RR) B cell derived hematological malignancies, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and young adults (tisagenlecleucel) and certain types of aggressive B cell lymphomas in adults (tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, and brexucabtagene autoleucel). Studies are ongoing for CD19-targeted CAR T therapies in additional hematological malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and follicular lymphoma. [12] [13] [14] CAR T cell therapies targeting antigens other than CD19 are also rapidly progressing through clinical trials. The most advanced at the time of publication are bb2121 (idecabtagene vicleucel) 15 16 and JNJ-4528, 17 both of which target B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and both of which were granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA. At the time of manuscript publication, more than 500 active clinical trials investigating CAR T cell therapies for Open access cancer were registered with the United States National Library of Medicine.",

            "text": "As 'living drugs', however, the adverse events associated with CAR T cell therapy differ markedly from those seen with other anticancer regimens. Some of the most commonly reported toxicities include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and persistent cytopenias and resultant infections, among others. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] During the pivotal phase II ELIANA trial of tisagenlecleucel in children and young adults with RR ALL, 73% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and CRS occurred in 77% of patients. 23 Similarly, in the ZUMA-1 trial, which was foundational for the approval of axicabtagene ciloleucel in adults with RR large cell lymphoma, 95% of patients experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events, with neurological events occurring in 64% of patients. 24 Although the adverse events associated with CAR T cells and other immune effector cell (IEC) therapies are generally manageable with proper supportive care, the toxicities that do occur may have rapid onset and can progress to life-threatening events. Therefore, timely recognition and appropriate management of these toxicities are vital for safe use of IEC therapies.",

For the approved CAR T cell therapies, tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, and brexucabtagene autoleucel, structural differences in the costimulatory domains used to promote T cell activation have been implicated in the distinct risk profiles reported in trials to date. Both tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel are based on identical antigen recognition domains (the anti-CD19 short-chain variable fragment FMC63), and both are constructed with identical CD3\u03b6 T cell signaling domains. Tisagenlecleucel deploys a CD8\u03b1 transmembrane region and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, while axicabtagene ciloleucel and brexucabtagene autoleucel use a CD28 transmembrane region and a CD28 costimulatory domain. 1 2 CD28-based CARs have been shown to induce rapid early expansion of T cells with boosted effector functions, whereas 4-1BB-based CARs cause a more gradual expansion of T cells, shifted toward a central memory-like phenotype, with a potential for longer persistence. 33 34 The different signaling and expansion characteristics may explain the earlier timing of onset of adverse events that has been reported with CD28-containing CAR T cell therapies. 35 In the pivotal ZUMA-1 trial, which led to the approval of axicabtagene ciloleucel, patients who had undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) were excluded, as were patients who had previously been treated with CAR T cells. Other exclusion criteria included central nervous system (CNS) involvement or a history of or active CNS disorder, such as seizure, cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement. 24 36 In the ZUMA-2 trial that led to approval for brexucabtagene autoleucel for RR MCL, durable remissions were attained in the majority of patients, and the toxicities were similar to those observed with other CD28 costimulated products. 14 37 The JULIET trial, which was pivotal for the approval of tisagenlecleucel for the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), used similar criteria, with the addition of excluding patients with class III/IV cardiovascular disability according to the New York Heart Association Classification and patients in complete remission-although a history of prior CNS disease was allowed as long as no active involvement was present at the time of treatment. 38 Subsequent trials have observed acceptable safety profiles for CAR T cell therapy in patients with active CNS disease-the phase I TRAN-SCEND NHL (Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma) 001 study, which evaluated lisocabtagene maraleucel, a CD19 CAR T cell product with defined CD4 + /CD8 + composition, reported only one neurological event among the nine treated patients with secondary CNS lymphoma. 39 40 Current approvals only permit the use of CAR T cell therapies in patients with more advanced disease. However, relapse after complete remission is relatively common in both leukemia and lymphoma, and outcomes for these patients are generally poor. Based on the known mechanisms of CAR T cell therapies, patients with very low disease burden or in complete remission can likely be treated, potentially with greater safety, given the importance of disease burden as a risk factor for CRS. [41] [42] [43] Panel recommendations \u25ba Treatment decisions should be risk-adapted to take into account characteristics of individual patients and products, with earlier and more aggressive intervention warranted with higher risk. \u25ba Patients who have previously undergone allo-HSCT, bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) therapy, anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, and mAbs against other targets (eg, rituximab) may be treated with CAR T cells, provided the patient's disease still expresses the target antigen (LE: 4 5 ). \u25ba Consideration should be given to the fact that toxicity and timing of toxicities may differ, depending on the CAR T cell costimulatory domains or other structural components (LE: 4 28 ). \u25ba Patients with higher pretreatment disease burden are at increased risk of severe toxicity. \u25ba Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status should be taken into account before proceeding with CAR T cell therapy, given the high risk of treatment-associated toxicity. \u25ba If patients are treated with CAR T cell products in the outpatient setting, admission should be strongly considered at the first signs of toxicity, including fever, hypotension or altered mental status.",

As additional targets and indications expand the available repertoire of IEC therapies, the management of the toxicities associated with new products may require further modification. Regardless, establishing baseline values for markers of CRS and neurotoxicity is important so that the caregiving team can quickly recognize and respond to adverse events at the earliest possible onset. Several scoring systems have been developed to monitor baseline mental state, with the Immune Effector Cell-Associated Encephalopathy (ICE) score (a modified version of the CARTOX-10 criteria 25 ) being the most widely used for adult patients. 45 For pediatric patients, the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD), 46 has been validated for evaluating mental state after CAR T cell therapy. 47 Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin levels of >10,000 ng/mL have been observed in almost every patient who developed severe CRS across public trials. It is important to note, however, that elevated levels of these markers are associated with, but not predictive of, toxicity. 23 48-52 Panel recommendations \u25ba Prior to CAR T cell therapy, treating physicians should order CRP, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), complete blood counts, comprehensive metabolic panel (including Mg/Pho), and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan. Required levels of these clinical parameters should be established by institutional standard operating parameters and are often similar to those required for a patient undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) (LE: 4 50 53 ). \u25ba All patients should receive baseline neurological evaluations, including ICE scores (for adults) or CAPD scores (for children<12 years) prior to CAR T cell therapy (LE: 4 51 ). \u25ba Disease burden should be assessed via imaging and bone marrow evaluation and/or lumbar puncture, as appropriate, before initiating CAR T cell therapy. \u25ba In the case of significant delay between lymphodepletion and infusion, repeating lymphodepleting chemotherapy should be considered after 4 weeks after initial lymphodepletion.",

In the ELIANA registration trial of tisagenlecleucel for children and young adults with RR ALL, infections occurred in 43% of patients, with 21% experiencing grade 3 and 3% grade 4 infections. In this trial, some patients with prolonged grade 3 or 4 neutropenia before and after tisagenlecleucel infusion experienced severe or fatal infections, including grade 3 human herpesvirus 6 encephalitis. 23 58 In the ZUMA-2 trial, infections of grade 3 or higher occurred in 32% of the patients, with the most common being pneumonia (9%). 14 Protocols vary from center to center for the routine administration of prophylactic antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents for patients undergoing CAR T cell therapy. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), together with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and ASTCT, has published guidelines for preventing infections in patients undergoing allo-HSCT, [61] [62] [63] which apply to all myeloablative transplants regardless of recipient (adult or child). The published guidelines do not make a definitive statement on antibacterial prophylaxis, although the prospect of septicemia is a significant concern for patients undergoing CAR T cell therapy. A review of 31 centers with experience from approximately 3400 stem cell transplants found substantial heterogeneity in adherence to published guidelines, yet a majority of institutions use some form of antiviral prophylaxis, most often reflecting concern for latent CMV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. 64 Additional considerations for infection prevention in patients undergoing CAR T cell therapy may be found in a 2020 perspective from Hill and Seo. 65 Patients with cancer are also at high risk of severe influenza-related complications, with a mortality rate 10 times higher than the general population. A Cochrane review of six studies with a total of 2275 participants found evidence, although weak, that the benefits of influenza vaccination outweigh potential risks in patients with cancer. 45 66-68 However, patients with hematological malignancies frequently present with profound immunosuppression and cytopenias, both due to disease and prior therapies, which may limit the efficacy of Open access seasonal influenza vaccines, especially in younger populations. 69 70 Reports have emerged of two patients with HIV and RR DLBCL successfully being treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. One patient was non-adherent to antiretroviral drugs prior to initiating therapy and underwent lymphodepletion with CD4 + cell counts of 53 cells/mm 3 and detectable viral load. After CAR T cell infusion, the patient developed grade 2 CRS and grade 3 ICANS, both of which resolved after tocilizumab and dexamethasone. The other patient was adherent with antiretroviral therapy (bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide) with an undetectable HIV viral load and a CD4 count of 127 cells/mm 3 . Both patients achieved complete remissions of their lymphoma after CAR T cell therapy. 71 More experience is needed, however, to determine if HIV-positive patients are at increased risk of infections compared with other patients undergoing CAR T cell therapy.",

            "text": "Special considerations for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has disrupted almost all aspects of the healthcare system, including cancer care. Treatment plans for patients undergoing CAR T cell therapies must take into account potential limitations in hospital resources during the ongoing pandemic, as well as an utmost concern for the safety of everyone involved. Because cellular therapy offers a potentially curative option for patients with otherwise extremely poor prognoses, delaying treatment may not be an option in many cases. However, adequate staff and supportive care resources are an absolute prerequisite for proceeding with CAR T cell therapy, and it is important to ensure that tocilizumab-which, along with other interleukin (IL)-6-modulating agents, was used as an investigational intervention for COVID-19-is available for the management of CRS. To assist in clinical decision making during the pandemic, the panel recommends referring to the interim guidelines published by the CAR T cell consortium investigators, which discuss necessary resources, determinants of cell therapy use, patient selection for B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B cell ALL, supportive care measures during cell therapy administration, availability of tocilizumab doses for each patient during the CRS risk period, and collaborative care with referring physicians. 72 Grading adverse events Some of the most frequently seen adverse events associated with the FDA-approved CAR T cell therapies are CRS, with rates of occurrence ranging from 37%-93% in patients with lymphoma 24 38 71 and 77%-93% in leukemia, 23 73 74 and neurological toxicities, now referred to as ICANS, 75 which have been reported in every trial involving CD19 targeted CAR T cells. 76 Early trials frequently deployed different assessment and grading criteria, making it difficult to compare the incidence and severity of CRS and other adverse events across studies. For example, in the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.03, which was in effect when most CAR T trials began, fever was not included as a prerequisite for CRS and grading largely depended on whether infusion was interrupted, 77 which is not applicable for CAR T cells that are normally given as a single dose over less than 30 min. Several grading systems, including the Lee Criteria, Penn Criteria, and CARTOX Criteria, were developed, defining severity by the requirement for supplemental oxygen and the need for intravenous fluids and vasopressors. 28 59 78-80 Until recently, neurological events were considered to be a component of CRS. However, although severe neurotoxicity seems to exclusively affect patients who develop CRS, the timing can vary greatly, occurring concomitantly or days after CRS resolves. 51 56 In 2019, the ASTCT published consensus recommendations for separate grading systems for CRS and ICANS (tables 2-4). 75 Advantages to the ASTCT system are its ease of use, objectivity, solid basis on criteria that may be immediately assessed by all members ",

That study developed a three-cytokine signature, based on samples drawn in the first 72 hours, using IFN-\u03b3, soluble gp130, and soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist, which enabled accurate prediction of which patients with ALL developed grade 4-5 CRS with 86% sensitivity (95% CI 57% to 98%) and 89% specificity (95% CI 73% to 97%).

Although fever defines the onset, if patients are treated with antipyretics or anticytokine therapy, elevated temperature is not required for subsequent grading, and hypotension and hypoxia are used to assess severity. At grade 2 CRS, patients present with hypotension not requiring vasopressors and/or hypoxia requiring low-flow nasal cannula (\u22646 L/min) or blow-by oxygen. Hypotension requiring a vasopressor (with or without vasopressin) and/or hypoxia necessitating highflow (>6 L/min) nasal cannula, face mask, non-rebreather or venturi mask defines grade 3 CRS. At grade 4, patients need multiple vasopressors (again, excluding vasopressin) and/or positive pressure ventilation up to and including intubation. Grade 5 CRS is defined as death in which another cause is not the principle factor. Resolution is defined by the normalization of all signs and symptoms that led to the diagnosis of CRS. In patients treated with anticytokine therapy whose temperatures have come down, CRS may be downgraded as hypotension and hypoxia improves. 75 Beyond fever, hypotension and hypoxia, symptomology varies widely. CRS symptoms may resemble tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), 90 92 or at higher grades, the clinical presentation can mimic infection, with malaise, fatigue, anorexia, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, headache, and mental status changes. 20 21 27 59 75 78 80 87 90 Myalgias and headaches are extremely common. 93 94 Since CRS and sepsis can coexist, it is very important to presume patients are infected and managed accordingly while investigating underlying infections in patients undergoing IEC therapies.",

            "text": "Management of CRS often involves direct targeting of elevated cytokines, especially IL-6. The IL-6 receptorblocking antibody tocilizumab was approved by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment of severe or life-threatening CAR T-induced CRS. 98 However, some protocols advise administering tocilizumab at earlier onset. A treatment algorithm developed from experience with the axicabtagene ciloleucel clinical trials advised considering 8 mg/ kg intravenous tocilizumab for persistent (lasting >3 days) and refractory fever in grade 1 CRS, and anti-IL-6 therapy is recommended for managing hypotension, hypoxia, and organ toxicity at all grade 2 and higher cases. 28 CRS management for brexucabtagene autoleucel in ZUMA-2 was similar to previous experience from anti-CD19 CAR T cells that have CD28 and CD3 \u03b6 costimulatory domains. 14 During the tisagenlecleucel clinical trials, early CRS symptoms were managed with tocilizumab, and corticosteroids were only used as secondline therapy, in case of refractory hypotension or other severe CRS symptoms not responsive to the first dose of tocilizumab. 80 Methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) and dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg; maximum, 10 mg/dose) are both commonly used corticosteroids. Some protocols, in particular those with CD19-directed CAR T cell therapies with CD28 signaling domains, recommend using dexamethasone for patients with neurological symptoms due to more efficient penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Many patients, especially those with ALL or multiple myeloma, have received corticosteroids as part of their treatment regimen, and therefore some patients who experience CRS may have a relative corticosteroid deficiency due to suppression of their hypothalamic-pituitary axis. 59 High-dose steroids are not recommended as a first steroid therapy, as >100 mg daily of prednisone equivalent may reverse symptoms but risks concurrently ablating 19-28z CAR T cells. 79 Consideration has been given to using tocilizumab preemptively or as prophylaxis. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle group reported early administration of tocilizumab with and without dexamethasone after treatment with a 4-1BB secondgeneration CAR T cell product with encouraging data of a modest decrease in severe CRS. 99 A similar clinical trial at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia prospectively tested a preemptive approach in pediatric ALL patients with high disease burden (>40% marrow blasts), giving tocilizumab at the time of fever. This preemptive trial met the endpoint for grade 4 CRS reduction (by one-third) in these high-risk patients. 100 Other cytokine-directed therapies, such as siltuximab, a chimeric anti-IL-6 mAb, have occasionally been used in the management of CRS. 24 85 Based on preclinical models and known cytokine profiles, anti-IL-1 therapies, such as anakinra, have been proposed for CRS treatment, but data are lacking regarding their efficacies in humans. 9 83 Reports have emerged of patients presenting with atypical, tocilizumab-refractory CRS, characterized by early increases in GM-CSF and IL-2, 101 highlighting a need for alternate approaches. In cases of CRS that do not respond to 2 to 3 doses of tocilizumab, benefit with additional doses is unclear. Additionally, a retrospective analysis of 100 patients with RR large B cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel found a trend for shorter progression-free survival (PFS) among patients receiving corticosteroids for a prolonged time. 102 Open access 9 96 ). \u25ba If CRS does not improve after tocilizumab and steroids, infections should be considered again in the differential diagnosis and managed appropriately. \u25ba If steroids are used in the management of CRS, a rapid taper should be used once symptoms begin to improve.",

            "text": "The spectrum of clinical features and laboratory abnormalities seen in CRS overlap substantially with HLH and MAS. 50 In these cases, the MAS features usually respond to CRS therapy. In addition, reports have emerged of patients developing fulminant inflammatory coagulopathies with clinical features similar to grade 3 or 4 CRS characterized by high fevers, elevated ferritin levels, increased liver enzymes, and persistent pancytopenias later, even weeks, after CAR T cell infusion. 103 Because of the atypical timing of onset and observations that these late CRS events may not respond to tocilizumab, in these later events MAS may predominate. 50 85 HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening dysfunctional immune response characterized by hyperactive macrophages and lymphocytes, proinflammatory cytokine hypersecretion, tissue infiltration, hemophagocytosis, and organ damage. Primary HLH is an autosomal recessive genetic disease with an incidence of roughly 1 in 100,000 live births, and a median survival of less than 2 months without treatment. The more common, though still rare, presentation is secondary, or reactive, HLH or MAS, which may be triggered by infections (especially EBV, CMV, and HIV), autoimmune diseases, and cancers. HLH is believed to occur in as many as 1% of patients with hematological malignancies, and mortality rates associated with HLH secondary to cancer approach 80%. 103 Most patients with moderate to severe CRS have laboratory results that meet the classic criteria for HLH/MAS, including elevated serum levels of IFN\u03b3, IL-10, sIL-2R\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF, 28 50 85 but may or may not have hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or overt evidence of hemophagocytosis. CRS and HLH/MAS substantially overlap clinically; therefore, using clinical management guidelines for CRS initially when HLH/MAS is suspected is warranted. The management of late-onset severe CRS may be challenging, especially if tocilizumab does not resolve symptoms. Treatment of bona fide HLH/MAS typically involves cytotoxic chemotherapy, such as etoposide. 104 This approach is not recommended for patients undergoing CAR T cell therapy, due to etoposide's documented toxicity to T lymphocytes 105 106 and lack of data in this setting. 103 Anecdotal reports have surfaced of successful resolution of symptoms after anakinra administration 107 ; however, no prospective studies document the efficacy of any one specific intervention.",

            "text": "IMMUNE EFFECTOR CELL-ASSOCIATED NEUROTOXICITY SYNDROME Transient neurological complications have been reported in nearly every trial targeting T cells to CD19, including studies involving CAR T cells and BiTEs. 76 The likelihood of neurological toxicity may vary depending on the product and disease state. For example, the reported incidence of neurological toxicities is 87% for axicabtagene ciloleucel. 1 For tisagenlecleucel, neurological toxicity was reported in 72% of patients with RR ALL and 58% of patients with RR DLBCL. 2 Although fewer patients have been treated with the BCMA-targeting CAR T product bb2121, the rate of neurotoxicity in a phase I trial was 42%, with only one patient experiencing toxicity \u2265 grade 3. 16 The frequency of neurological events has been rare in trials for the treatment of solid tumors, such as in a phase I/II clinical study of a HER2-specific CAR T therapy, where no neurotoxicity was reported among all 19 patients. 109 However, efficacy of IEC in solid tumors has been more limited, and it is possible that the incidence of ICANS may increase with the development of more efficacious products. Although the ASTCT consensus guidelines include elevated intracranial pressure and edema as domains Open access for ICANS grading (see and tables 3 and 4), it is unclear whether cerebral edema arises from a distinct pathophysiology. 75 Reports have emerged of lethal cerebral edema after treatment with CD19-directed CAR T cells in six patients across two different studies, 11 36 another fatal case in the standard of care setting, 110 as well as one case of reversible cerebral edema in a patient receiving BCMAtargeting CAR T cells. 111 The pathophysiology behind ICANS is an active area of investigation. Current hypotheses hold that systemic inflammation and cytokine production after CAR T cell infusion drives a cascade of endothelial cell activation and blood-brain barrier disruption, leading to elevated cytokine levels in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and, in severe cases, hemorrhage and cerebral edema. 27 48 51 56 Across multiple studies, patients who developed severe ICANS exhibited higher serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-15 as well as cytokines known to activate endothelial cells, including IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. 9 23 24 27 48 51 56 Importantly, IL-6 receptor blockade is generally considered not effective for resolving neurological symptoms. 22 75 95 Severe ICANS is often associated with a consumptive coagulopathy and patients display elevated serum levels of laboratory markers of endothelial dysregulation including von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is released on endothelial cell activation, and angiopoietin 2 (ANG2), which is a TIE2 antagonist that shifts the balance of endothelial cells in the blood-brain barrier away from quiescence. 48 56 57 The elevated levels of cytokines, including IL-6, seen in the CSF of patients with severe ICANS likely arise due to both blood-brain barrier permeability and local production by activated microglia, astrocytes, and macrophages, and the relative contribution of each cell type remains unclear. 27 48 51 52 56 Trafficking of T cells into the CNS may play some role in the neuropathology, as indicated by the detection of CAR T cells in CSF from patients with neurotoxicity in the absence of malignant CNS disease. Yet CAR T cells have also been detected in CSF of patients with no detectable neurological pathology, demonstrating that infiltration alone is not sufficient to cause toxicity. 7 9 112 113 Laboratory parameters, baseline tests for ICANS Several of the cytokine profiles and serum markers associated with ICANS overlap with CRS. During the ZUMA-1 study, severe neurotoxicity was associated with elevated levels of IL-1R\u03b1, IL-2R\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IFN-\u03b3, CCL-2, granzyme B, GM-CSF, and ferritin. 114 Similarly, elevated levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IFN-\u03b3, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and MCP1 were observed in the 33 of 53 adult patients with RR B-ALL who developed neurotoxicity during phase I trials of 19-28z CAR T cells. 51 A study encompassing 133 patients with relapsed B cell malignancies reported elevated CRP, ferritin, IL-6, IL-8, MCP1, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 in the 53 patients who developed ICANS. 57 Markers of diffuse intravascular coagulation have also been correlated with high-grade neurotoxicity, with two studies reporting elevated vWF and high ANG2:ANG1 ratios in patients with severe ICANS. 51 56 Prior to infusion, patients should be evaluated for baseline neurological and mental status. The ASTCT consensus grading system for ICANS (see tables 2 and 3) deploys a 10-point scoring metric called the ICE tool 75 for ICANS-associated encephalopathy in adults, which builds and simplifies the assessment items developed in the CARTOX criteria. 28 Points are assigned for orientation to year, month, city, and hospital, ability to name three objects, ability to follow simple commands, ability to write a standard sentence, and ability to count backwards from 100 by 10. For pediatric patients, the CAPD is used. 75 Panel recommendations \u25ba To monitor neurological function in patients treated with CAR T cell therapy, the ASTCT ICANS grading system and criteria should be used. \u25ba For patients who develop ICANS, the work-up should include CRP, CBC, CMP, fibrinogen, prothrombin time test, and international normalized ratio (PT/ INR). A head CT should also be considered. In addition, careful consideration of electroencephalogram (EEG) and neuroimaging by brain MRI may be necessary (LE: 4 51 ).",

Because the neurological symptoms and timing of onset associated with fludarabine are distinct from those seen with CD19 CAR T neurotoxicity, the agent has now come to be broadly recognized as not a primary driver for ICANS. 97 More likely, the addition of fludarabine may",

The axicabtagene ciloleucel package insert advises 10 mg IV dexamethasone every 6 hours for neurological toxicity of \u2264grade 3 and 1000 mg IV methylprednisone daily for 3 days with grade 4 ICANS. 1 Although corticosteroids may reduce circulating CAR T cell counts, evidence is emerging that even longer courses of steroids (>7 days) do not alter efficacy of cancer treatment. 118 However, a trend towards shorter PFS has been observed in patients with lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel who received longer and earlier intervention with steroids. 102 Seizure prophylaxis has been implemented in a few studies, but the ideal dose and duration have not yet been determined. 28 48 51 Levetiracetam has a better drugdrug interaction profile and lower risk of cardiotoxicity compared with other antiepileptic agents, can be administered safely to patients with hepatic dysfunction, and does not affect cytokine levels. 28 In the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center trial, 14 patients developed seizure despite levetiracetam prophylaxis, but all resolved with standard management with benzodiazepines and antiepileptic agents. 51 Panel recommendations \u25ba Based on the expected neurotoxicities seen with different CAR T cell therapies, the management of ICANS should be risk-adjusted based on productspecific and patient-specific characteristics. \u25ba Patients with CNS involvement of their disease may need earlier intervention for ICANS. \u25ba Patients with history of inflammatory neurological conditions or current CNS disease involvement should be referred for additional neurological consultation prior to initiating CAR T cell therapy. \u25ba For brain imaging in patients deemed high risk, MRI is preferred. If a patient is too unstable to transport, or fast-brain MRI is unavailable for pediatric patients (thus necessitating sedation), CT imaging may be used (LE: 4 79 ). \u25ba Because of the possibility that tocilizumab may worsen neurotoxicity, the management of neurotoxicity may take precedence over the management of low-grade CRS (LE: 5 56 123 23 117 124 ). \u25ba For patients with grade 2 ICANS after being treated with CD28 costimulated CAR T cell products such as axicabtagene ciloleucel and brexucabtagen autoleucel, steroids should be used to mitigate the duration and severity of ICANS (LE: 3 24 125 ). \u25ba To manage seizures in patients treated with CAR T cell therapies, levetiracetam is recommended (LE: 4 24 30 ). \u25ba There is insufficient evidence to recommend prophylactic antiseizure medications to all patients undergoing CAR T cell therapies. However, in patients deemed to be at high-risk of developing neurotoxicity based on history, disease characteristics, or the product being administered, prophylactic levetiracetam may be considered (LE: 4 51 ).",

However, subsequent fatalities, in addition to the distinct manifestation and timing of symptoms for adoptive T cell transferassociated neurotoxicity, led to the conclusion that fludarabine may not be the primary cause for cerebral edema and that the agent may continue to be safely used for lymphodepletion. 97 All five patients who died in the ROCKET trial experienced rapid, early expansion of the modified CAR-bearing T cells within a week of being infused. Additionally, high levels of CD8 + T cells and a concurrent sharp spike in IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly correlated with fatal brain swelling. 115 Postmortem analyses of patients from both the ROCKET and ZUMA studies revealed bloodbrain barrier disruptions in patients who succumbed to cerebral edema subsequent to CAR T treatment. 56 119 In the ZUMA-2 trial, one case of grade 4 cerebral edema occurred; the patient had a full recovery and was in complete remission at 24 months of follow-up with no unresolved neurological sequela. 14 Blood-brain barrier pathology was also reported in a patient who developed edema as a feature of CRS after CD19-directed CAR T therapy. 126 Disruption of the blood-brain barrier may allow systemic cytokines including IFN-\u03b3 to leak into the CSF, thus inducing vascular pericyte stress and the secretion of endothelial cell-activating cytokines. Therefore, there is speculation that patients with evidence of endothelial cell activation before lymphodepletion may be at increased risk of ICANS. 56 A report has also surfaced of severe neurotoxicity consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a phase I trial of CART-BCMA for multiple myeloma (NCT02546167), which resolved after high-dose methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. 111 Panel recommendation \u25ba If cerebral edema is suspected based on clinical signs and symptoms, patients should be immediately referred to intensive care where rapid imaging and management of intracranial hypertension should be performed (LE: 4 119 ).",

Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias persisting more than 30 days after CAR T cell infusion were observed in roughly 30% of patients receiving both axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel. 24 36 38 Additionally, cytopenias were among the most common grade 3 or higher adverse events reported in the JULIET, ZUMA-1, ZUMA-2, and ELIANA trials. 14 23 24 38 121 For newer products, such as BCMAtargeting bb2121, cytopenias were the most common events of grade 3 or higher, including neutropenia (in 85% of the patients), leukopenia (in 58%), anemia (in 45%), and thrombocytopenia (in 45%). 16 Short-lived cytopenias are to be expected after the standard lymphodepletion regimen that is recommended with approved CAR T products, 1 2 but prolonged cytopenias, even in the absence of lymphodepletion, may occur more frequently after CD19 CAR T cell therapy. 5 7 8 Cytopenias may also be a hallmark of myelodysplastic syndromes, 128 which is important to consider in the differential diagnosis. Risk factors for prolonged cytopenias observed in the ELIANA trial included prior HSCT, high disease burden, and highgrade CRS. Notably, no persistent cytopenias of grade 3 or higher were reported in trials of EGFRvIII-and HER2directed CAR T cell therapies for the treatment of glioblastoma. 129 130 Timing of cytopenias In roughly one-third of patients treated with CD19directed CAR T cells, cytopenias persisting for >1 month have been reported. 7 23 57 58 One report has described prolonged cytopenias persisting for 15.2-21.7 months after CD19 CAR T cell treatment 122 and another reported that 10% of adult lymphoma patients that remain in remission after axicabtagene ciloleucel may continue to experience grade 3-4 neutropenia 1 year after the therapy. 131 Of note, the latter study of 85 patients in the standard of care setting noted that while CD8 + counts rapidly recovered, CD4 + T cells decreased from baseline and were persistently low with a median CD4 count of 155 cells/\u00b5L for those remaining in remission 1 year after axicabtagene ciloluecel. 131 For other therapies, hematological recovery following lymphodepletion generally occurs more rapidly. For example, 97% of patients receiving BCMA-targeting bb2121 CAR T cells who experienced grade 3 or higher cytopenias recovered to an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of at least 1000 cells/\u00b5L within 1 month. In that trial, the median time from infusion to recovery of an ANC of at least 1000 cells/\u00b5L was 1.3 weeks (95% CI 1.0 to 1.4) and recovery to a platelet count of at least 50,000/\u00b5L occurred in a median of 2.0 weeks (95% CI 1.4 to 8.4). 16 132 One study identified a biphasic pattern to cytopenias following CD19 CAR T cell therapy. In the trial, 27 of 29 responding patients experienced cytopenias later than 21 days postinfusion. Of the 22 patients who experienced late neutropenia, 15 showed two distinct nadirs in absolute neutrophil counts with one trough shortly after lymphodepletion and a second occurring more than 40 days after infusion. A similar biphasic pattern occurred Open access in the 22 patients who experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia, with 10 patients displaying an initial recovery of platelet counts before a second nadir between 20 and 40 days after infusion. 133 In another analysis, baseline platelet counts of <75,000 and the early onset of CRS on day 0 or day +1 following infusion were associated with a higher likelihood of development of severe and prolonged cytopenias, which in some cases required therapy as for graft failure following allo-HSCT. 132 Panel recommendations \u25ba For cytopenias occurring within the first 28 days after IEC infusion, a bone marrow biopsy may not be indicated-complete blood counts with differential may be adequate for follow-up (LE: 4 133 134 ). \u25ba Clinically stable, afebrile pediatric patients may be discharged from the hospital before blood counts recover, though antimicrobial and antifungal prophylaxis should be considered. \u25ba For cytopenias persisting >28 days after IEC infusion, bone marrow biopsy and bone marrow aspiration should be performed in addition to the standard work-up to assess response and cellularity, including assessment of viral pathogens (LE: 4 133 134 ).",

A common definition of cardiac toxicity includes symptoms of heart failure and/or a decline of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): symptomatic fall in LVEF from \u22655 to <55% or an asymptomatic reduction of LVEF from \u226510 to <55%. However, additional definitions include an increase in serum troponin, a greater decline in LVEF, and a >15% reduction in global longitudinal strain. 135 The CTCAE grades cardiotoxicity based on symptomology, imaging abnormalities, and biomarker measurements, including troponins. 136 Common cardiovascular and cardiac toxicities reported with CAR T cell therapies have included hypotension, new heart failure, worsening of pre-existing heart failure, and new arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation/flutter are common). Other cardiac events that have been observed are the following: non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) with and without QTc prolonging medications or electrolyte abnormalities, other wide and narrow complex tachycardias, pericarditis, and myocarditis. 42 While cardiac toxicities have generally resolved there have been a small number of cases that have led to mortality. A retrospective analysis of Open access 98 children with RR ALL treated at a single center with 4-1BB-costimulated anti-CD19 CAR T cells observed hypotension requiring inotropic support in 24 patients with a mean onset 4.6 days after CAR T cell infusion (range 1-9), including six patients receiving milrinone. Worsened systolic function occurred in 10 patients. 137 In a retrospective study of 137 adult patients treated with CAR T cells, cardiac injury (defined as an increase in serum troponin) was documented in at least 21% of patients and the cardiovascular event rate was 12%. 91 An elevated serum troponin was noted prior to the occurrence of a cardiac event after CAR T cell infusion and was exclusively noted in those with CRS. No trials have directly addressed cardiac risk factors in the context of CAR T cell therapy; however, an observational study aiming to prospectively define the rate of occurrence, natural history, and progression of cardiac dysfunction after CD19 CAR T cell therapy in adults and to identify the patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular events is ongoing at the time of publication (NCT04026737).",

Echocardiography is the principal technique for evaluating cardiac toxicity in patients with cancer and threedimensional echocardiography-derived LVEF correlates excellently with MRI findings, while two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography-derived strain can detect changes in myocardial mechanics before changes in LVEF occur. [138] [139] [140] Historically, equilibrium radionuclide angiography/MUGA has been a preferred method for serial assessment of LVEF in adult patients undergoing cardiotoxic chemotherapy due to high reproducibility, low interobserver and intraobserver variability, and extensive validation literature. Routine use of MUGA has markedly diminished in recent years because of the relative ease of use and low cost of echocardiogram. 141 Additionally, MUGA exposes patients to radiation through the use of 99m-technetium labeled red blood cells, making echocardiogram the preferred modality for monitoring adult and pediatric patients. 142 Several cardiac biomarkers have established utility in the detection of cardiac injury with cancer therapies and have also been validated for their prognostic value both in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients free of cancer. For example, the N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) investigation of dyspnea in the emergency department study of 600 patients who presented in the emergency department with dyspnea found that increased serum NT-proBNP was the strongest independent predictor of a final diagnosis of acute congestive heart failure (OR 44; 95% CI 21.0 to 91.0, p<0.0001) and NT-proBNP testing alone was superior to clinical judgment alone (p=0.006). 143 Cardiac troponins are the gold standard biomarker for myocardial injury, and high-sensitivity assays allow for the improved detection of heart tissue damage even in the absence of overt signs and symptoms. 144 145 However, an elevated troponin may occur independently of acute myocardial infarction, and myriad etiologies have been linked to troponin release, including pulmonary embolism, heart failure, myocarditis, end-stage renal disease, tachycardia, strenuous exercise, septic shock, and treatment with cardiotoxic chemotherapy such as doxorubicin and with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 140 146-149 Panel recommendations \u25ba In adults, baseline cardiac testing prior to CAR T cell therapy should include TTE, a serum troponin, and NT-proBNP/BNP (LE: 4 91 137 ",

According to some estimates, 57%-70% of elderly lymphoma patients and 50%-60% of childhood cancer survivors are treated with an anthracycline-containing regimen. 149 Anthracyclines, especially doxorubicin, can cause irreversible, dose-dependent cardiac injury, and the risk for future complications increases with cumulative doses. The onset of a decreased LVEF may occur while a patient is on treatment with anthracyclines or several years later. [149] [150] [151] Serial serum troponin measurement in 78 patients with hematological malignancies undergoing 142 treatment cycles, including various anthracyclines, revealed delayed subclinical myocardial damage even after minor anthracycline exposure, with peak levels observed on median day +21.5 (range day +6 to day +35) after initiation of anthracycline therapy. Follow-up echocardiography in 28 patients showed a greater decrease in LVEF in troponinpositive patients compared with the troponin-negative group (10% vs 2%; p=0.017). 124 Elevated troponins and BNP/NT-proBNP have been associated with increased all-cause mortality and have been shown to predict heart failure in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. 152 153 Increased troponin levels correlated with decreased LVEF in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing induction chemotherapy with anthracycline-containing regimens. 154 Among patients undergoing CAR T cell therapy, elevated serum troponins have been observed prior to cardiac events and post-CAR T cell infusion. 53 In addition to prior therapies, the risk factors for cardiac toxicity with treatment are likely similar to those for the development of severe CRS, specifically, disease burden and peak CAR T cell expansion. 27 28 137 155 156 The pathophysiology responsible for cardiac toxicity in the context of CAR T cell therapy has not been extensively studied; however, the inflammatory cytokine profile seen Open access with CRS, specifically elevated levels of IL-6, has also been implicated in causing myocardial dysfunction in cases of septic shock. 157 One of the hallmarks of CRS is hypotension, 28 29 31 85 90 155 156 which may lead to distributive shock, myocardial injury, and arrhythmias.

Specifically, many adult patients receiving CAR T cells may be elderly and have underlying cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus and may have established cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure and coronary artery disease. There are limited data specific to CAR T, but in a single retrospective study of 137 subjects, the rates of these cardiovascular risks were higher in those that subsequently developed cardiac injury. 91 Patients with high preinfusion disease burden are also at risk of developing TLS, 7 8 10 which may cause cardiac complications secondary to the flood of metabolites and electrolytes, including uric acid released into circulation. 92 In particular, elevated serum uric acid has been implicated as a risk factor for cardiovascular events, including acute myocardial infarction, angina, and heart failure. [158] [159] [160] Panel recommendations \u25ba Patients with an increased burden of cardiovascular risk factors, with a prior cardiac insult (ie, prior myocardial infarct and prior coronary revascularization), significant valvular disease, a low ejection fraction or a cardiomyopathy, a history of heart failure or significant cardiac, arrhythmias, and a history of cardiac toxicity from prior therapies should receive an additional cardiac evaluation prior to CAR T cell therapy. Patients with significant cardiac disease may not be candidates for CAR T cell therapy, depending on the balance between disease and treatmentassociated risks (LE: 4 91 137 ). \u25ba Patients with pre-existing heart failure, arrhythmias, or other significant cardiac history may warrant consideration of inpatient CAR T cell therapy. \u25ba Based on the expected toxicities seen with different CAR T cell therapies and disease states, the management of cardiac adverse events should be risk-adjusted based on product-specific and patient-specific characteristics. Patients deemed to be at high cardiac risk at baseline might need earlier intervention with tocilizumab and/or steroids at the onset of CRS. \u25ba The measurement of a serum troponin and LVEF should be considered in patients with any grade CRS when additional risk stratification is needed (LE:1 153 ).",

In particular, warfarin (Coumadin) has a serum half-life of, on average, roughly 40 hours and the duration of effect is 2-5 days. 164 165 Current major guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology, the National Comprehensive Care Network and International Clinical Practice recommend low molecular weight heparin over warfarin for thrombosis prophylaxis in patients with cancer. [166] [167] [168] [169] The risk for bleeding complications in patients treated with anticoagulants is considerable. A meta-analysis of 33 studies involving 4374 patient-years of oral anticoagulant therapy found that the case-fatality rate of major bleeding was 13.4% (95% CI 9.4% to 17.4%), and the rate of intracranial bleeding was 1.15 per 100 patient-years (95% CI 1.14 to 1.16 per 100 patient-years). 170 Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of malignant disease significantly increases risk of major bleeding after anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. 171 172 Antiplatelet blood thinners such as aspirin also increase bleeding risks. Additionally, aspirin, and other cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, have been demonstrated to suppress T cell activation by inhibiting T cell receptor signaling to p38 Mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase, 173 174 though no large controlled trials have assessed whether COX-inhibition negatively affects the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy.",

In the phase I study of CD19 CAR T cells with a CD28 costimulatory domain in children and young adults with RR leukemia in the pediatric oncology branch, B cells became detectable by 60 days in all responding patients. 113 In the ZUMA-1 trial of adults with large B cell lymphomas treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel, 6 (17%) of 35 assessable patients with ongoing responses had detectable B cells in their blood by 3 months after infusion; 20 (61%) of 33 assessable patients had detectable B cells at 9 months; and 24 (75%) of 32 assessable patients had detectable B cells at 24 months. 36 In ZUMA-2, grade 1 or 2 hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 12 (15%) subjects, and grade \u22653 was observed in one subject. 14 In 16 adults with DLBCL who achieved CR after being treated with tisagenlecleucel, polyclonal B cell recovery was sustained in 8 (50%), and the median time to onset of sustained recovery was 6.7 months. 121 Increased risk factors for hypogammaglobulinemia upon assessment Hypogammaglobulinemia has been reported across trials, although the rates have varied, likely due to inconsistent definitions, follow-up times, patient ages and disease states. Further complicating matters, many patients who undergo CAR T cell therapy have undergone prior HSCT without revaccination and are thus beginning treatment with a limited antibody repertoire. Younger patients may be more susceptible to hypogammaglobulinemia, as total serum IgG levels gradually increase at early ages, with adult levels of IgG 1 and IgG 3 subtypes seen between ages 5 and 10 years and IgG 2 not reaching maximum levels until adulthood, 176 reflecting increasing plasma cell mass. The direct link between B cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia is difficult to establish because long-lived plasma cells are CD19 negative 175 177 178 and therefore should not be direct targets for elimination by CD19 CAR T cells. Plasma cells persisting for at least 746 days in the absence of B cells has been reported in one patient treated with tisagenlecleucel, and the same study observed stable levels of pathogen-specific IgG despite prolonged B cell aplasia and decreasing total serum IgG in two adult patients. 54 Panel recommendation \u25ba Following CAR T cell therapy, B cell counts and serum immunoglobulins should be measured monthly (LE: 4 54 ).",

Although longterm B cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia can persist for several years after CAR T cell infusion, 55 181 no controlled studies have demonstrated definitive benefits for IgG supplementation. In trials where patients did receive IgG supplementation, no serious infections were reported after the initiation of replacement therapy. 9 10 55 One study of 28 patients with persistent B cell aplasia and agammaglobulinemia following CD19 CAR T cell therapy, where patients were transitioned from intravenous to subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement at a median of 11.5 months (range [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , found that increasing serum IgG level was significantly associated with a lower rate of sinopulmonary infection (p=0.0072). 182 All IgG preparations available in the USA are made from 10,000 to 50,000 units of plasma pooled from 3000 to 10,000 healthy blood donors. Donors are carefully screened for blood-borne pathogens, including HIV, hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, and parvovirus B19, and at least two distinct viral inactivation steps are used by all manufacturers. The adverse events associated with IgG infusions are typically transient, infusion-related reactions. Intravenous and subcutaneous formulations have been developed, and typical starting doses are in the range of 400-800 mg/kg every 3-4 weeks intravenously or 100-200 mg/kg/week subcutaneously. 183 The decision",

It is important to consider potential effects on patient satisfaction and quality of life for a planned course of treatment. Additionally, all members of a caregiving team, as well as patients themselves, must undergo sufficient education in order to rapidly respond to any toxicities that do occur. Due to the relative infancy of the field, few large-scale quality of life assessments for IEC therapies have been performed. In the short term, quality of life generally increases if patients experience clinically meaningful responses to therapy. An analysis of self-reported outcomes from the ELIANA trial encompassing 39 patients older than 8 years of age found mean changes from baseline for the PedsQL total and EQ-5D visual analog scale of 13.9 and 13.7 at month 3 and 12.8 and 10.9 at month 6, respectively, supporting clinically meaningful improvements. Additionally, the proportions of patients reporting problems with mobility, self-care, usual activities, anxiety/depression, or pain/ discomfort were notably decreased at months 3 and 6. 191 The long-term effects of CAR T cell therapy on quality of life remain understudied. One study of self-reported outcomes among 40 patients who completed a questionnaire containing the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Scale V.1.2 Global Health and the PROMIS-29 Profile V.2.1, as well as 30 additional questions at a median of 3 years after CAR T cell treatment revealed that nearly 50% of patients in the cohort experienced at least Open access one clinically meaningful negative neuropsychiatric outcome, including anxiety, depression, and cognitive difficulty. 192 In that study, there was a trend toward significance (p=0.08) for an association between acute neurotoxicity and long-term neuropsychiatric problems. Overall, however, no difference was observed in mean mental health scores for patients treated with CAR T cells and the general population.",

            "text": "Financial distress may cause substantial detrimental effects on quality of life for patients with cancer, 193 and IEC therapies are among the most expensive interventions in the healthcare system. The cost of a onetime infusion of tisagenlecleucel for pediatric ALL is US$475,000, while the cost of tisagenlecleucel for adult NHL, axicabtagene ciloleucel for adult NHL, and brexucabtagene autoleucel for MCL is US$373,000. Patients may also incur additional expenses for transportation to and from the hospital and accommodations nearby during treatment. Despite these prices, CAR T cell therapies have been demonstrated to be cost-effective in terms of life-years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. A study of CAR T cell therapy versus standard of care for pediatric patients with RR B-ALL found that tisagenlecleucel treatment led to 10.34 discounted life-years gained and 9.28 QALYs gained, amounting to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately US$42,000 per life-year gained and approximately US$46,000 per QALY gained compared with clofarabine. 194 An economic framework for therapy valuation found that CAR T cell therapy for patients with pediatric RR ALL and DLBCL generated as much as US$6.5 billion and US$35.8 billion in social value. 195 Panel recommendations \u25ba Prior to initiating therapy, patient education should include an in-person nursing 'teach' visit and a meeting with a social worker. \u25ba Patient education prior to therapy should include the difference between approved products and clinical trials, lymphodepletion chemotherapy, timing of infusion visits, expected side effects, strategies to manage side effects, expectations for hospital admission, infection precautions, CRS, neurological events, financial considerations, screening studies, outpatient follow-up requirements, intravenous access on admission, timeline to produce cells, and potential need for interim therapy. \u25ba Call parameters for patients undergoing outpatient CAR T cell therapy should include fever, chills, difficulty breathing, changes in mental status, difficulty with mobility, and vision changes. \u25ba Prior to CAR T cell therapy, patients should be asked about family support. \u25ba Prior to initiating therapy, patients should be asked about what type of financial/housing/transportation support they will require if they need to relocate for a period of time.",

A collaborative effort of different specialties including intensive care, neurology, cardiology, emergency medicine, and infectious disease, in addition to the cell therapy team, is critical for the successful management of toxicities. At this time, IEC therapies should be delivered with direct involvement by cell therapists at centers with transplant programs, accreditation by FACT or the Joint Accreditation Committee ISCT-Europe (JACIE), and experienced ICUs. Future studies to add insight into the underlying pathogenesis and pathogenomic features of IEC-related toxicities have the potential to further improve outcomes for patients undergoing these potentially lifesaving therapies. As more and more patients are treated with approved and emerging immunotherapies, additional research will be necessary to understand how immune-modulating agents may potentially interact or synergize with cellbased treatments.",
