This article aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of serologic methods for COVID-19 based on assay design and post-symptom-onset intervals. Two authors independently searched PubMed, Cochrane library, Ovid, EBSCO for case-control, longitudinal and cohort studies that determined the diagnostic accuracy of serology tests in comparison with NAATs in COVID-19 cases and used QUADAS-2 for quality assessment. Pooled accuracy was analysed using INLA method. A total of 27 studies were included in this meta-analysis, with 4 cohort, 16 case-control and 7 longitudinal studies and 4565 participants. Serology tests had the lowest sensitivity at 0-7 days after symptom onset and the highest at >14 days. TAB had a better sensitivity than IgG or IgM only. Using combined nucleocapsid (N) and spike(S) protein had a better sensitivity compared to N or S protein only. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) had a lower sensitivity than enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). Serology tests will play an important role in the clinical diagnosis for later stage COVID-19 patients. ELISA tests, detecting TAB or targeting combined N and S proteins had a higher diagnostic sensitivity compared to other methods.",

In addition, the blood samples are less likely to contain infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus than respiratory specimens, decreasing the potential risk of infection to laboratory staff 12 . However, there are questions remaining to be answered concerning the serological diagnosis of COVID-19. First, studies have reported that the seroconversion happened at 3-14 days post symptom onsets 13, 14 , which may not facilitate the early diagnosis of the disease. What's more, the window periods of the different serological tests have not been directly assessed. Second, the specificity and sensitivity of serological methods can vary over the infection time course, and need to be further analysed 15 . Finally, the impact of assay design on the performance of serological tests has yet to be determined.",

However, significant variation was observed in the forest plots of the sensitivity of serology tests (Figure 3(B-D) ), with a range of 16%-93% in IgG, 42%-92% in IgM and 45%-92% in TAB. We attributed this mostly likely to different seroconversion times for different antibody classes, and further divided included articles according to symptom onset-specimen collection interval 48 . Our analysis suggested that serology tests had the lowest sensitivity at 0-7 days post symptom onset and the highest sensitivity at >14 days. Our findings and those of others suggest that 14 days post symptom onset is a point when the sensitivity serology tests is sufficiently high to replace NAATs for the optimal diagnosis of COVID-19 13, [49] [50] [51] [52] . During the early acute phase of infection, antibody detection might cause numerous false negatives cases. Nonetheless, there have been rare detectable antibody responses during the early phase of COVID-19 concurrent with high virus load and a high risk of transmission 53 . In the late phase of disease, on the contrary, seroconversion occurs when virus load begins to decline, and serological tests might play a more important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Overall, our pooled analysis suggests a preferred diagnostic algorithm based on days post symptom onset: NAAT alone at 0-14 days, NAAT combined with a serology test at over 14 days, when virus shedding might drop below the detection limit of most NAATs 54 .",

The choice of serology test methodology should be based on testing environment and patient population. LFIA tests could prove useful in the emergency room, ambulatory and outpatient settings rather than simply abandoned for its relatively poor performance. We didn't pool our analysis based on assays from different companies, but other headto-head studies had shown a variable accordance between different assays within only a small group of participants 28, 38, 46, 55 .

We attributed this phenomenon due to the following reasons. First, studies with high risk of bias in the domain 2-4 were excluded. The detailed exclusion reasons included no prespecified threshold for serology test, not using NAATs as reference tests, not all participants receiving the NAATs, etc. All of these problems were considered to bring high risk of concerns while the first domain, with a non-cohort study design or unclear consecutive enrolment were considered to bring less effect to the analysis. Second, COVID-19 was a global public health problem broke out within less than one year and thus studies on serology test accuracy of COVID-19 had some similar features: (1) Participant enrolment was confined to a short time and the criterion was usually not complex, with no clear exclusion criterion. (2) NAATs is the only method suggested by WHO to diagnose COVID-19. (3) Most casecontrol studies used preserved serum or blood before 2020 as the control group for determining the accuracy for serology test. These features also led to a high agreement between enrolled articles in the assessment of risk of bias and application concern using QUADAS-2 tool.",

At present, antibody detection was only suggested for epidemiological research or disease surveillance 5, 9, 59, 60 . This is the first study that meta-analysed the sensitivity of serology tests across different time windows. It also provides a general review of different serology test methods.

This was limited by data extraction, where most qualified articles did not provide specificity data. Previous studies had reported that the serological cross-reactivity between COVID-19 and other coronavirus disease like SARS-CoV seemed to be high, suggesting that serology tests might bring more false negativities and should only be applied as a supplementary tool for clinical diagnosis 61 . Second, 23/27 (85.2%) of enrolled articles were present with high risks of bias for case-control or longitudinal design. Specificity in our study might be overestimated because most of the control group used samples from healthy donors before 2020, which avoid possible cross-reactivities as mentioned above. Another limitation was that we did not analyse the combined diagnostic performance of NAATs and serology tests, because clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases without positive RNA or serology test results were not enrolled into this meta-analysis. According to our study, the combination of these two tests was preferred during the late phase of disease progression. However, the actual sensitivity remains to be evaluated in the future.",
