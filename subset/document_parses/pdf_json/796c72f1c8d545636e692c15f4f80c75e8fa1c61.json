Detailed clinical data obtained through this approach would complement findings from large epidemiological studies by identifying preventable causes that may be amenable to targeted interventions and/ or future research. Such an approach has been successfully adopted in countries such as the UK, through the development of obstetric networks conducting periodic targeted surveys focused on specific SMM types. The UK's Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS)-through a nationwide, anonymised, online, monthly, case-collection scheme-has been an effective surveillance tool for selected types of SMM and other rare disorders in pregnancy, since its inception in 2005, 6 and published their first report on eclampsia. Here, nationwide data were gathered to identify important and under-appreciated facts about this preventable condition, 7 followed by effective dissemination of their findings. 8-10 Although UKOSS has not repeated a study on eclampsia, indirect evidence from the most recent Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK report indicates a reduction in preeclampsia and eclampsia related mortality, from 18 maternal deaths (0.85 per 100 000 maternities) in the 2003-2005 triennium to 6 (0.28 per 100 000 maternities) in the 2017-2019 triennium. 11 Since then, the publication of key findings on 61 rare pregnancy conditions has influenced clinical practice and health policy (online supplemental appendix A). Importantly, UKOSS was able to rapidly implement surveillance of impacts of pandemic illness in pregnant women, both during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic 12 13 and during SARS-CoV-2. 14 The success of UKOSS has prompted other countries to develop obstetric survey systems (OSS), which are part of the International Network of OSS (INOSS). 15 A recent publication has demonstrated that the implementation of mandatory training and modifications to treatment protocols for hypertension by the Netherlands Obstetrics Surveillance System resulted in a reduction in the incidence of eclampsia in the Netherlands from 6.2/10 000 births in 2004-2006 to 1.8/10 000 births (relative risk (RR) 0.28, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.36) and accompanying perinatal mortality, that corresponded with an increase in the use of antihypertensive medications (RR 18.4, 59% CI 9.74 to 34.70) and magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis (RR 1.08, 95% CI 10.4 to 1.12). 16 Canada does not have a national OSS for gathering detailed event-centred data on SMM. Prior to developing a nationwide OSS, it is important to explore the preferred and most feasible methods for gathering SMM data on a national scale, and the challenges to collecting data posed by disparate systems of maternity care delivery across and within Canadian provinces and territories. In addition, obtaining local perspectives on leading causes of SMM will help to inform a list of priority conditions for targeted surveillance using the OSS as well as the type of data elements to be collected and harmonised across jurisdictions.",

For example, a survey response stating unwillingness/ uncertainty about sharing data may be modified on clarification of the study intent; a negative survey response to whether there is a system within the unit for reviewing SMM may change to a positive response on appreciating that the unit's informal review process qualifies. The identification of these contradictions between survey and interview findings will be important to structure outstanding interviews, and to generate new research questions. 28 29 The results obtained through the overall analysis will enable us to estimate resource allocation for establishing and sustaining CanOSS.",

Analysis for outcome 4 is described as part of step 4 above. For outcome 5, we will descriptively present variations in the definitions of SMM and graphically present the perceived leading causes of SMM across the country. For outcome 6, we will attempt to map out the outcomes of greatest concern, based on region/ province and setting (rural vs urban). For outcome 7, based on analysis of data gathered through the survey and interviews, we will estimate resources required (personnel, information technology and other support) and their associated costs, by region and province. This will be a simple cost analysis and not a formal economic evaluation. For example, for units with no SMM review system in place, we will estimate the cost for establishing an SMM review system, and costs for data entry on prespecified SMM types using a web-based system on a monthly basis depending on unit volume. In addition, for units with an SMM review system in place and with an existing infrastructure to enter data directly into a web-based system, resources would be estimated for costs related to centralised data analysis. Estimates would similarly be made for time and resources needed for research ethics applications and data-sharing agreements. This will enable us to estimate initial costs and ongoing costs for the establishment and implementation of CanOSS on an ongoing basis.",

This study aims to understand variations in definitions of SMM held by leads of maternity units and the nature of SMM review systems across Canada, to determine barriers and challenges for gathering granular data on SMM in Canada, and to describe perceived definitions and leading causes of SMM. By using a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach, this research will enable us to estimate resource implications and costs involved in gathering national data on SMM on an ongoing basis. We will use the successful UKOSS methodology for SMM surveillance, tailored to the Canadian context. This study may unravel unforeseen barriers which may need to be resolved through consultation with research ethics boards, legal teams, maternity unit administrators, provincial and federal organisations, and patient-advocacy groups. Notwithstanding these challenges, this study which engages stakeholders at the grassroots level will lay the foundations for a CanOSS to complement ongoing efforts aimed at improving health and outcomes for pregnant women and people in Canada.",
