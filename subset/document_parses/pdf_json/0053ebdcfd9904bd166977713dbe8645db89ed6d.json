In 139 of 170 nations, the best subsets regression was used to investigate all potential models of COVID-19 variations among countries. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to explore the predictive capacity of these variables. The same analysis was applied to the number of deaths per hundred thousand due to tuberculosis, a quite different infectious disease, to validate and control the differences with the proposed models for COVID- 19 . results In the model for the COVID-19 cases (R 2 =0. 45 IntrODuCtIOn COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread over countries worldwide. On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the condition as a public health emergency. With new variants emerging, experts now assume that SARS-CoV-2 would not only remain an endemic virus but would also continue to circulate in communities and would make a massive burden of disease and death for years. 1 The cumulative incidence (total number of cases per million) of COVID-19 (Total-Case-COV19) and mortality (total number of deaths per million) of COVID-19 (Total-Death-COV19) vary significantly among countries. Besides, old age, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, pregnancy, immunosuppression, cancer, and cardiovascular, respiratory (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc), and chronic kidney disease are all well-known healthrelated factors that contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. 2 3 Aside from these clinical factors and comorbidities affecting infection progression, there might be additional demographic, social, economic and environmental factors at the macro-level Open access differentiating countries in terms of TotalCase-COV19 and TotalDeath-COV19. The term 'macro-level data' (eg, Human Development Index (HDI) 2020 by United Nations (UN)) could be defined as periodical (eg, weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual) and long-term data that were gathered, summarised, and published by the government, private, public, national and international organisations about a specific subject (eg, health, energy, society, economy, politics) in the world, continents, regions, countries, cities or territories. This kind of data shows the current position and trend of any subject in a comparable manner and guides the policymakers in countries and organisations for setting or updating their strategies and helps them take an action around that subject. Although healthcare executives and regulatory authorities have implemented regulations and recommendations such as wearing masks, social distancing, staying at home, isolation and lockdowns to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, considering these macro indicators will help steer national and international health policymakers to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In particular, the elderly ratio, the prevalence of comorbidities, population size, and health expenditure were shown to have been associated with the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 at various levels according to the aforementioned studies. However, these findings have been based on the early phase of the outbreak. The current study has been based on data (the cumulative number of cases and deaths) just before starting vaccinations around the world. Additionally, the findings might provide more consistent details about the progression of the disease because of covering data for a longer period. Therefore, the current study aims to identify health-related and socioeconomic macroscale indicators that could explain some of the substantial variations in TotalCase-COV19 and TotalDeath-COV19 worldwide.",

For eliminating the variance inflation and suppressing potential interactions among predictors, we have transformed all variables into the standardised form [(x\u2212mean(x))/SD(x)], so that we could get a more acceptable VIF (VIF=1/(1\u2212R 2 )<2.0) values where R 2 is obtained by regression analysis in that the inspecting variable is regarded as a dependent variable and others are regarded as its predictor. We have applied Durbin-Watson statistics to test the autocorrelation in consequent error terms in the model and we have found all error terms are independent in all models since test statistics were between lower critical value and 4-lower critical value. 10 After having inspected the plot diagrams and histograms, it could be said that all assumptions of multiple linear regression were almost met with the help of using standardised values of all predictors and target variables in all models. The exception for slight violation was observed as variances in error terms in P-P plots and predicted values against observed values scatter plot for homoscedasticity that could be questionable if other test results were unsatisfactory.",

After having tested the dataset against the assumptions of multiple linear regression, we investigate the dataset using some considerations for each scenario/ model through a best subset approach that analyses data in terms of a predictor's subset that could create applicable models that illuminate the next step for finding the best one. We could decide the better one by inspecting each model in terms of cost-benefit ratios such as R 2 , SE or Mallows' Cp (min is preferred), Akaike Information Criterion (min is preferred) and Bayesian Information Criterion (min is preferred). 11 After determining the incorporated variables in a model, we applied a hierarchical regression model with forward selection and stepwise methods. There is no constant in our models because they were all insignificant statistically. Therefore, they were discarded. Using the information from best subset, literature and best practices, we tried a variety of models by evaluating the usage of intercept, handling missing values, handling outliers, applying the best technique for regression analysis (eg, enter, stepwise, forward/backward selection), determining thresholds for alpha to enter (0.05 through 0.15) and remove (0.05 through 0.15), and for accepting or rejecting the next variable to the incorporated model. We used the SPSS V.24 and Minitab V.19 trial version for analysing the data.",

[13] [14] [15] In this study, the TotalCase-COV19 and TotalDeath-COV19 were greater in countries with a higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension. Global analyses of the variability of COVID-19 mortality among countries, as in our study, revealed that TotalDeath-COV19 was positively correlated with deaths due to comorbidities, including cardiovascular, chronic respiratory and kidney diseases, obesity and cancer. 5 7 16 The association between sunshine and COVID-19 is arguable in the literature. Studies revealing sunshine hours positively linked to COVID-19 growth claimed that on sunny days, outdoor activities increased along with a decline in adherence to lockdown rules, resulting in increased virus exposure and transmission. [17] [18] [19] Other studies, on the other hand, suggested that sunny weather could help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by minimising air pollution and increasing vitamin D production. [20] [21] [22] Those studies revealed that ultraviolet light from the sun can inactivate SARS-CoV-2, reduce outdoor transmission or increase immune resistance through vitamin D production. These results are supported by our research, which found a high TotalCase-COV19 in countries with low sunshine.",

Thus, not only socioeconomic indicators but also political indicators could play a critical role in the COVID-19 outbreak. Lack of access Open access to reliable sources of information, as well as misinformation and inadequate communication, might lead to people disregarding government health alerts. Policies that promote the effective distribution of government budgets in public goods and services like healthcare and education, as well as policies that encourage transparency and information flow, could serve information accuracy about COVID-19's spread. 23 25 There is no country-level analysis demonstrating an association between alcohol consumption and the TotalCase-COV19 and TotalDeath-COV19 in the literature. Recent studies have emphasised that increasing alcohol consumption is linked to excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines by hepatic cells, resulting in higher levels of inflammatory markers (interleukin-8 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1), which has also been observed in patients with COVID-19. [26] [27] [28] As a result, it was hypothesised that acute and chronic alcohol consumption might suppress the immune system, leading to reduced resistance to acute respiratory disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as facilitating the progression of COVID-19. 29 30 The present study supports these findings, demonstrating that TotalDeath-COV19 is higher in countries with high alcohol consumption.",

One explanation for this may be the difficulty of identifying infected people in countries with low socioeconomic status due to inadequate test conditions for COVID-19. Therefore, the effect of urbanisation on the TotalCase-COV19 can be hard to observe. Besides that, developed countries with a larger urban population and advanced healthcare systems have longer life expectancies and a higher percentage of the population over 65 years, which could lead to higher mortality rates in high-income countries. 8 Moreover, as tougher restriction policies for elderly people have been implemented, urbanisation might be a significant factor in TotalDeath-COV19 rather than TotalCaseCOV-19. Our study thus showed that countries with higher urban populations have higher TotalDeath-COV19 in line with other global COVID-19 studies. 6 33 Best subset regression analyses show that heterogeneity in the TotalCase-COV19 and the TotalDeathCOV-19 across countries may be attributed to variations in macro indicators including obesity and hypertension, urbanisation, schooling, transparency, democracy and HDI, as well as alcohol consumption and sunshine. Additionally, while the elderly population, GINI and undernourishment were related to the TotalDeathCOV-19, hypercholesterolaemia was related to the TotalCase-COV19. While the elderly population was a major parameter in nearly all TotalDeath-COV19 models in our analysis, it was left out of the proposed models because it suppresses other estimators.",

Socioeconomic inequalities like low socioeconomic status, inadequate schooling, limited access to healthcare, and income inequality induce difficulty in accessing and affording healthy food, use of tobacco and alcohol, low physical activity, and lower use of preventive medicine. This situation might increase the prevalence of comorbidities by altering the gut microbiome, increasing local inflammation and compromising immunity.

            "text": "There are certain limitations of the present study. First, not all health-related, socioeconomic, climatic and political indicators were up to date like COVID-19 deaths and cases in 2020. At that point, it is reasonable to expect that macro-scale indicators would not change significantly over the few years. Second, just 139 countries out of 170 were involved in the best subset regression analyses since only these countries had complete data. Third, definitions of COVID-19 cases and illness of people based on symptoms and diagnosis varied by country over a certain time that led some country data on the number of cases to be biased, and so it increases the residual in the model. Additionally, some interruptions on data flow about COVID-19 deaths and cases from countries could lead the model to be biased. To some extent, these error impacts (ie, bias) were minimised by standardising the data's relative position to other countries' data by considering overall mean and SD as well. In deciding the cause of death, a similar condition occurred in that some deaths could be recorded such as due to respiratory problems, other infections or multiple organ failure. Finally, the reliability of the PCR test that is used for diagnosing COVID-19 cases as the most preferred procedure across the world could also be regarded as an important limitation of the Open access study since false positive and false negative results of PCR test might cause deviations both in the COVID-19 cases and models.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this original study reveals that healthrelated, as well as social, economic, climatic and political macro indicators, have been noteworthy in the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings of this study do not claim that these macro indicators cause disease or death directly because it does not conduct any clinical or laboratory research. Essentially, the present study, demonstrating that these macro indicators explain the variation in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths across 170 countries, may serve as a basis for future clinical trials. Additionally, if it is assumed that COVID-19 would have a lasting effect in the world for an extended period, this study might assist policymakers in developing short-term and long-term health and social strategies to enhance these factors associated with COVID-19. Following the complete vaccination in nations, further research can be done to show how the vaccine affects these models.",
