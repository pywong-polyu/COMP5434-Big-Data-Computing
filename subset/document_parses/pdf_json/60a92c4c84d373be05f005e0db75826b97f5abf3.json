Increases in plasma von Willebrand Factor (vWF) with concurrent decreases in ADAMTS13 are associated with renal microvascular thrombosis in other disease states, but similar findings have not been shown in trauma. We hypothesized that molecular changes in circulating vWF and ADAMTS13 promote AKI following traumatic injury. VWF antigen, vWF multimer composition and ADAMTS13 levels were compared in plasma samples from 16 trauma patients with and without trauma-induced AKI, obtained from the Prehospital Air Medical Plasma (PAMPer) biorepository. Renal histopathology and function, vWF and ADAMTS13 levels were assessed in parallel in a murine model of polytrauma and haemorrhage. VWF antigen was higher in trauma patients when compared with healthy controls [314% (253-349) vs. 100% (87-117)] [median (IQR)], while ADAMTS13 activity was lower [36.0% (30.1-44.7) vs. 100.0% (83.1-121.0)]. Patients who developed AKI showed significantly higher levels of high molecular weight multimeric vWF at 72-h when compared with non-AKI counterparts [32.9% (30.4-35.3) vs. 27.8% (24.6-30.8)].",

Furthermore, specific effects of unregulated vWF activity are emphasized by the pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), wherein vWF-dependent protease, ADAMTS13 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with Thrombospondin Type 1 Motif 13), activity is drastically inhibited, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) due to microvascular depositions of pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic UL-vWF [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Interestingly, AKI is also common following traumatic injury, as it is reported to develop in up to 50% of traumatic injury patients [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, although renal injury secondary to TTP is thought to be due to UL-vWF induced vascular damage, it is commonly accepted that the primary cause of trauma induced AKI is renal hypoperfusion due to shock [11] [12] [13] [14] . We hypothesize that there is overlap between these two causes of AKI, and that the systemic endotheliopathy of trauma leads to microvascular depositions of UL-vWF.",

A recent study highlights the protective nature of recombinant human ADAMTS13 (rhADAMTS13) when given in a murine renal ischemia reperfusion model [20] . However, it is unclear whether there is a direct effect of vWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 that contributes to renal injury prevention, or whether there is simply a primary anti-inflammatory effect due to ADAMTS13. In essence, the effects of vWF that may lead to the renal injury following trauma are unexplored. Here, we seek to provide a preliminary assessment regarding changes in vWF form, antigen levels and collagen binding activity (CBA), along with renal histology, following traumatic injury in both humans and a murine model. These studies demonstrate downstream effects of vWF on the renal microvasculature and its potential contribution to renal injury.",

Briefly, patients enrolled in the PAMPer trial had at least one episode of hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg) as well as tachycardia (heart rate >108 beats per minute) or a single episode of severe hypotension (SBP <70 mmHg) prior to their arrival to a trauma centre. Plasma samples from the PAMPer trial were obtained from eight traumatic injury patients who developed AKI at time points, including 0 (upon admission), 24 and 72 h following severe traumatic injury. AKI was defined by at least 0.3 mg/dl increase in creatinine within 48 h of admission. The plasma samples from patients who developed AKI were well matched with trauma patients who did not develop AKI based upon age, injury severity score and lactate concentrations ( Table 1) .",

Of note, the median murine Histologic evaluation of renal architecture Analysis of the cortical region of 20 mm PFA fixed kidney sections by haematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) showed marked differences between healthy mice and those that underwent a polytrauma model. Major variations between these samples may be seen at both 20x and 40x optics (Fig. 4a) . Notably, the traumatic injury sections showed loss of tubular lumen structure with dilation of tubules and denudation of tubular cells in the cortical region (black arrows). These effects became most prominent in mice demonstrating more than 200 ng/ml increase in cystatin C following traumatic injury (Fig. 4a, right) .",

Microvascular depositions of vWF appeared in mice that developed AKI, but these depositions were not seen in those that did not develop AKI. These findings suggested that vWF was not only acting as an acute phase reactant, but also as a direct contributor to renal injury. Given these data, we posit that the environment that is generated following traumatic injury, when paired with increased HMWM-vWF forms and an increased vWF:ADAMTS13 ratio, exacerbates renal injury through the demonstrated deposition of proinflammatory vWF-containing small vessel plugs [10, 16, [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

Notably, of the samples that were obtained for our study, we were unable to control for the administration of prehospital plasma. Only four of the 16 patients in this cohort received prehospital plasma (three who developed AKI, one who did not). Although this may have minimally affected the 0-h time point, the number of transfused units of blood products between both patient groups were equivalent by the 24-h time point (Table 1 ).

Unfortunately, in-depth analyses that define a relationship between AKI and cystatin C levels in mice are lacking. However, Leelahavanichkul et al.

Although serum creatinine levels would have circumvented the need for cystatin C measurements, low circulating serum levels were undetectable by our ELISAs.

These studies were performed in order to understand if the mice compensated for the decreases in circulating ADAMTS13 antigen by means of upregulating production of ADAMTS13 gene expression. ADAMTS13 RNA expression levels were inhibited by 60% at the 24-h time point following traumatic injury (Supplemental Fig 3A, http://links.lww.com/BCF/A115). We hypothesized that the lack of ADAMTS13 mRNA production may be a consequence of the ischemic insult, due to shock, following traumatic injury (Supplemental 3B, http://links.lww.com/BCF/A115) [35] , along with cytokine release as previously demonstrated [36] . To fully understand the effects traumatic injury on the production of ADAMTS13, it would be necessary to evaluate other sources of ADAMTS13, such as the vascular endothelium [37] . Given the highly vascularized nature of the liver, we were limited in our analysis, as we were unable to identify if the ADAMTS13 mRNA that we detected in total liver RNA was sourced from hepatic stellate cells or from vasculature. However, the in-vitro, hypoxic LX-2 hepatic stellate cell exposure model (Supplemental Fig 3B, http://links.lww.com/BCF/A115) suggested a potential role for hypoxic inhibition of stellate cell ADAMTS13 RNA production, which was previously unrecognized.",

Diffuse staining of endothelial vWF, was present in kidneys of both healthy and traumatically injured mice. Importantly, the kidneys in the traumatically injured mice showed evidence of vWF and fibrinogen containing microvascular plugs, measuring from 8 to 16 mm in size, which were unapparent in uninjured mice (Fig. 4c) . The structure of these plugs showed a weaker vWF staining center with a strong fibrinogen staining overlap, which is conducive with typical clot structure (Fig. 4c) [39] . Notably, the form of circulating vWF and the environment it is exposed to are likely primary predictors of the rate at which these vWF-containing microvascular plugs form, as vWF binding to either the sub-endothelium or the endothelium is the driver of platelet adherence in thrombus formation [40, 41] . Future studies would benefit from contrasting the molecular structure of thrombi seen in our traumatic injury mouse model to those generated in a murine TTP model [42] [43] [44] . The demonstration of similarly structured vWF rich thrombi in both mouse models would further support the primary role of vWF in the production of these thrombi.",

These shortcomings were rectified by the functional demonstration of the prothrombotic high molecular weight vWF forms that may have led to the microvascular deposits that were seen on renal microscopy. However, future studies are warranted to evaluate for the ability to clear vWF from the renal microvasculature, by means of recombinant ADAMTS13 administration, in an attempt to prevent the development of AKI. Recent evidence suggested that rhADAMTS13 may reduce the burden of shock and organ injury in a rat transfusion model [45] . Aspects such as route and timing of administration of ADAMTS13 will require extensive calibrations. Furthermore, either recombinant murine ADAMTS13 or extensive characterization of recombinant human ADAMTS13 on mice will be needed in order to evaluate specificity and mechanisms of its effects. These further studies were not within the scope of our current project, which sought to demonstrate the fate of an increasingly pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory population of vWF on the renal circulation.",

Concomitantly, ADAMTS13 levels plummet, perhaps becoming unable to control the circulating vWF population. The pathological state of trauma leads to conditions that can exacerbate renal injury, not only including hypoperfusion due to shock, but also deposition of microvascular plugs due to variations in vWF and ADAMTS13. We conclude that trauma shifts the vWF-ADAMTS13 axis towards a prothrombotic state by means of alterations in circulating factors such as an elevated vWF:A-DAMTS13 ratio and increased prothrombotic HMWM-vWF. Ultimately, we believe these changes may contribute to trauma induced renal injury by increasing the risk for microvascular thrombotic events.",
