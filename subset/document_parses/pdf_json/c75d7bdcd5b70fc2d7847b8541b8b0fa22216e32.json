Recently, an observational study demonstrated that in-hospital use of statins was associated with substantial improvement in survival among patients hospitalised with COVID-19. 2 Specifically, the authors reported a relative risk reduction of 42% in in-hospital mortality with statin therapy. This finding may be biased by patient selection, treatment indication and residual confounding and therefore merits further investigation. 2 In addition, a computer-based study suggested that rosuvastatin may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19 infection. 3 However, other observational studies, including a metaanalysis, did not find any association between statins and improved outcomes in patients with COVID-19. [4] [5] [6] Several mechanisms by which statins may exert their potential beneficial effects have been proposed. First, the case fatality rate Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The study was based on high-quality and complete data from nationwide administrative registries. \u25ba The Danish healthcare system provides equal access to healthcare services for all residents regardless of socioeconomic or insurance status. \u25ba The observational nature of this study precludes the assessment of cause-effect relationships. \u25ba Residual confounding and confounding by indication cannot be excluded.",

[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Given their potential cardioprotective effects, statins may possibly prevent myocardial injury and adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with established cardiovascular disease. 18 Second, beyond their lipid-lowering properties, statins exert various beneficial pleiotropic effects, including modulating the immune response at different levels, improving endothelial function, and decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation. [18] [19] [20] [21] Third, some randomised clinical trials and observational studies-but not all-have indicated that statins may be associated with less severe infection and improved outcomes in patients with viral infections. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] On the other hand, experimental studies have suggested that statins, among other drugs, may increase the expression of ACE2, 32-34 a membrane-bound aminopeptidase expressed in the lungs, heart and other tissues that is thought to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells. [35] [36] [37] Also, case series have reported hypercholesterolaemia to be one of the most common comorbidities in patients with COVID-19. 38 These considerations have led to the concern that statins may confer a predisposition to more severe infection and adverse outcomes during COVID-19 infection. Taken together, the effect of statins on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection remains unclear.",

In a recent observational study using data from 21 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, Zhang et al 2 demonstrated that in-hospital use of statins was associated with improved survival among patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Specifically, the authors found a 28-day mortality risk of 5.2% and 9.4% in the statin and nonstatin user groups, respectively, and that in-hospital use of statins was associated with a 42% decrease in in-hospital mortality. 2 Although the data may be biased by patient selection, treatment indication and residual confounding, including lack of adjustment for socioeconomic status and prehospital medication, this controversial finding merits further investigation. In addition, Farag et al 3 performed a computer-based study and used a structure-based drug design to screen more than 2000 Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme substrate-binding pocket. Other than antiviral drugs, the authors also identified rosuvastatin as a drug that may be useful against SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, other observational studies, including a meta-analysis, did not find an association between statin therapy and improved outcomes in patients with COVID-19. [4] [5] [6] In our nationwide cohort study including all patients with COVID-19, irrespective of hospitalisation status, we did not find any association between statin use prior to diagnosis and the risk of allcause mortality or severe COVID-19 infection, individually and as a composite. These results were consistent across clinically relevant subgroups, including age, sex and presumed indication for statin therapy. In addition, among patients using statins, type of statin drug did not significantly modify the risk of outcomes, although there was a trend towards a lower risk of all-cause mortality with rosuvastatin. Further studies are warranted to establish whether rosuvastatin may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection. Taken together, our study does not provide evidence of a beneficial effect of statin exposure prior to COVID-19 diagnosis.",

It has been proposed that statins may improve the clinical course in patients with COVID-19, and several mechanisms by which statins exert their potential beneficial effects have been proposed. For example, reports of cardiac involvement during the course of the infection, particularly in severe cases, have emerged, 7-17 and it has been hypothesised that statins, at least to some extent, may prevent or decrease the likelihood of myocardial injury and cardiovascular events. 18 Further, statins may modulate the immune response, improve endothelial function, and decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and thereby predispose to less severe infection and better outcomes. [18] [19] [20] [21] Data on such effects of statins in humans, however, are conflicting. While some randomised trials Reference group: no statin exposure. Adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, comorbidity (ie, history of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease) and concomitant medical treatment (ie, aspirin, oral anticoagulants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, renin-angiotensinaldosterone system inhibitors).",

            "text": "and observational studies have demonstrated possible benefits of statins in reducing mortality and improving the clinical course of patients with severe infections, particularly viral infections, others have not found any beneficial effects of statins in this setting. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] On the other hand, preclinical studies have suggested that statins upregulate the expression of ACE2, an enzyme thought to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells, although this hypothesis has not been proven in humans. [32] [33] [34] Moreover, hypercholesterolaemia has been reported to be one of the most common comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, although the majority of these case series did not report data on medication, including statins. 38 These considerations had led to the hypothesis that statins confer a greater risk of more severe infection and adverse outcomes during COVID-19 infection. In light of these concerns, it is reassuring that statins were not associated with a deterioration in the clinical course of these patients in our study. Taken together, our findings do not support discontinuation of statin therapy in patients with an indication for statins. However, it is important to emphasise the inherent limitations of observational studies, including residual confounding, confounding by indication and inadequate assessment of causal inference. There is, therefore, a need for further studies to establish the role of statins in patients with COVID-19 with and without an indication for statin therapy. Several randomised clinical trials have been initiated to assess this clinically relevant issue, and the results from these trials are anticipated. [50] [51] [52] [53] Another potential concern with statins during COVID-19 infection is liver injury. Reports of liver injury during the course of the infection, particularly in severe cases, have emerged. [54] [55] [56] Although statins are generally considered to be safe and well tolerated, in rare cases, these medications may also induce liver injury. 57 Consequently, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic recommend withholding statin therapy temporarily in patients with COVID-19 with increased liver enzymes. 58 Whether statin therapy confers an increased risk of liver injury and subsequent adverse outcomes during COVID-19 infection has not been established. Our study did not allow for a direct assessment of this issue due to lack of data on in-hospital medication and laboratory findings. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that statin exposure prior to diagnosis was not associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Further studies, preferably randomised controlled trials, are needed to clarify the association between statin therapy and liver injury on subsequent outcomes during COVID-19 infection.",

            "text": "The main strength of this study is the completeness of data from nationwide administrative registries. The Danish healthcare system, funded by taxes, provides equal access to healthcare services for all residents regardless of socioeconomic or insurance status. In Denmark, statins can be purchased only through prescription. Due to partial reimbursement of drug expenses by the Danish healthcare system, pharmacies are required to register all redeemed prescriptions ensuring complete and accurate registration. The findings of this study should be viewed in the context of a number of limitations. The observational nature of this study precludes the assessment of cause-effect relationships; thus, only associations are reported. Residual confounding cannot be excluded despite adjustment for potential confounders, and it is likely that these adjustments were not sufficient to even out the differences between the groups. For example, mounting evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 may develop clinically significant coagulopathy with fatal thromboembolic complications, 59-61 and more statin users were treated with aspirin and oral anticoagulants compared with non-statin users. Although we attempted to minimise the impact of these differences by adjusting for concomitant medication, including aspirin and oral anticoagulants, in the fully adjusted analyses, we cannot exclude the possibility that these differences may have had an impact on the association between statin use and outcomes. In addition, confounding by indication cannot be omitted in pharmacoepidemiological studies despite our attempt to minimise the impact of this limitation by performing several subgroup analyses (eg, patients with or without a presumed indication for statin therapy). We did not have laboratory data to confirm a positive swab test for COVID-19. However, coding of both tested individuals with tentative diagnosis codes and those with positive swabs with definite diagnosis codes have been and are systematically performed in Denmark, and the Danish Ministry of Health have indicated a positive predictive value of 99% of these codes. Compared with the official COVID-19 case numbers in Denmark, this study included fewer cases because ICD-10 codes capture only those patients who were diagnosed in the hospital system (inpatient, outpatient or emergency department visits) and not in dedicated COVID-19 diagnostic kiosks. It is therefore possible that some patients with no or few symptoms may not have been captured by our ICD-10 codes. The outcomes examined in this study were clinically relevant 'hard' endpoints. Although it would have been interesting to examine the association between recent statin exposure and symptom improvement in patients with COVID-19, data on symptoms were not available. In addition, due to lack of data on in-hospital medication, we were not able to investigate the impact of in-hospital statin therapy on outcomes. Likewise, data on statin treatment (dis)continuation after the COVID-19 diagnosis were not available, although it was encouraged to continue statin treatment at the Danish hospitals. Exposure to statins was defined by redeemed prescriptions in the 6 months prior to diagnosis, although similar results were yielded when restricting this definition from 6 months to 3 months. It is possible that some patients may discontinue statin treatment prior to diagnosis due to early symptoms of COVID-19 infection.",
