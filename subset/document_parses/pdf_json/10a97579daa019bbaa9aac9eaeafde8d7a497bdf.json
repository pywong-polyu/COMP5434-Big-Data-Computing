Environmental conditions including air conditioning, ventilation, moisture, CO 2 , particulate matters, and total number of users were also recorded. In addition, fungal and bacterial load were assessed and disinfection on sports equipment surface was also examined. Background bacteria and fungi densities in bioaerosols were in the range of 249 \u00b1 65 to 812 \u00b1 111 CFU/m 3 and 226 \u00b1 39 to 837 \u00b1 838 CFU/m 3 in the exercise room of the fitness center and 370 \u00b1 86 to 953 \u00b1 136 CFU/m 3 and 465 \u00b1 108 to 1734 \u00b1 580 CFU/m 3 in the outdoor air, respectively. Chlorine dioxide and weak acid hypochlorous water aerosols could remove both bacteria and fungi much better than water scrubbing. Contact time of 15 min was sufficient to control both bacteria and fungi to comply with the official air quality standards. User density and carbon dioxide deteriorated both bacteria and fungi disinfection performance whereas temperature was only statistically significant on fungi disinfection. Other factors including relative humidity, airflow velocity, and particulate matters did not have any statistically significant effect on microbial inactivation. Apart from bioaerosol disinfection, inactivation of microorganisms on surfaces of sports equipment was also conducted using chlorine dioxide, zinc oxide, weak acid hypochlorous water, and commercial disinfectant. The surfaces of bicycle handle, dumbbell, and sit-up bench were found to be contaminated with bacteria. Overall bacterial load was 390 to 3720 CFU/cm 2 with Escherichia coli specifically 550 to 1080 CFU/cm 2 . Chlorine dioxide and zinc oxide were noticeably better than weak acid hypochlorous water and commercial disinfectant in terms of bacteria inactivation whereas all tested disinfectants had comparable effectiveness on E. coli disinfection. Targeted microorganisms on the sports equipment surface were sufficiently inactivated within 2 min after the application of disinfectant.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least 150 min of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week (Ramos et al. 2015; WHO 2018) for improving health benefits and overall well-being, such as walking, cycling, or sports. However, urban parks or indoor public spaces particularly in large cities usually have poor air quality due to traffic-related pollution. As a result, people who are living in urban areas prefer to work out in an indoor fitness center to avoid air pollution. Nonetheless, despite new recommendations of indoor air quality expanded to indoor public spaces, adoption has been slow. It largely depends on building construction, building materials, and type of ventilation together with environmental factors such as natural ventilation, humidity, and temperature (Saini et al. 2020 ). In addition, number of users and fitness activities also play an important role in the air quality inside the fitness center.",

Water was also used to serve as a control for scrubbing effect. The evaluation covers indoor air quality and sports equipment. The air inside the studied rooms of the fitness center was disinfected in a patron concentration manner, i.e., 0, 5, and 10 patrons. Environmental factors including temperature, relative humidity, and airflow velocity were measured and maintained steadily. In all aerosol disinfection scenarios, the solution was applied using EP606 aerosol devices (GAO-SHUO Corporation, Taiwan) for 60 min after the exercise period. Bacteria and fungi remaining in the aerosols were periodically monitored and compared. For sports equipment study, three equipment with different surface characteristics were tested including bicycle handle with soft and foam-like surface, dumbbell with rough steel surface, and sit-up bench with smooth leather surface. Disinfectant solution of either ClO 2 , WAHW, ZnO, or commercial disinfectant was used to clean all contact surfaces of each equipment after each of the exercise session. Total bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli) remaining on the surface were periodically monitored and compared. E. coli, a common gram-negative bacterium, was chosen as a representative species since several researchers have already investigated the gram-positive bacterium as a metric of microbial contamination in a fitness center and gymnasium (Ryan et al. 2011; Markley et al. 2012; Mukherjee et al. 2016; Dalman et al. 2019) .

            "text": "The initial concentrations of bacteria and fungi before the disinfection treatment are shown in Table 1 . Average temperature, relative humidity, airflow velocity, carbon dioxide, PM1, PM2.5, PM7, and PM10 during the experimental periods were 18.9 to 24.9\u00b0C, 62.0 to 80.6%, 0.3 to 1.2 m/min, 398 to 1298 ppm, 0 to 1.12 mg/m 3 , 0.001 to 1.170 mg/m 3 , 0.002 to 1.175 mg/m 3 , and 0.002 to 1.179 mg/m 3 , respectively. The magnitude of these environmental factors represents the typical conditions of the indoor air in the fitness center. It is necessary to note that the experiments were conducted at existing conditions and different times; hence, the initial concentrations of bacteria and fungi in each experiment were different. Therefore, the determination of whether an indoor environment is polluted or not is often based on a comparison of bioaerosol concentration in the indoor air with that of outdoors (Zhu et al. 2003) . It can be seen that the indoor air tended to contain less bacteria and fungi than the outdoor air (outside the sport center); nonetheless, there was no specific correlation. This is possibly due to the bioaerosol filtration effect via air conditioning system of the fitness center and the activities happened prior to the tested session. Table 2 shows the correlations between the bacteria and fungi colony counts and the environmental factors after the disinfection treatment process. Significant positive correlations were found between the effectiveness of bacteria disinfection and the effectiveness of fungi disinfection (r = 0.610, p < 0.01). By contrast, significant negative correlations were obtained between the effectiveness of bacteria disinfection and the number of users (r = \u22120.584, p < 0.05) and carbon dioxide concentration (r = \u22120.581, p < 0.05). Significant negative correlations also existed between the effectiveness of fungi disinfection and the number of users (r = \u22120.690, p < 0.01), temperature (r = \u22120.517, p < 0.05), and carbon dioxide concentration (r = \u22120.680, p < 0.01). In other words, the effectiveness of bacteria disinfection increased along with the effectiveness of fungi disinfection but decreased with an increasing number of users and carbon dioxide concentration. Similarly, the effectiveness of fungi disinfection decreased with an increasing number of users, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration. Carbon dioxide level highly correlated to the user density with the p value of less than 0.01 which was expected because the major source of carbon dioxide in the fitness center was from human respiration. Other factors including relative humidity, airflow velocity, and particulate matters had no statistically significant impact on both bacteria and fungi inactivation. Nonetheless, it was found that air velocity and particulate matters (PM1, PM2.5, PM7, PM10) were related to one another at the 0.05 level. This should be primarily due to the particle filtration by air conditioning system. In addition, Table 2 also suggested that all particulate matters present in the air inside this fitness center are likely derived from the same source since all of them are highly correlated to one another at the significant level of 0.01.",

The results showed that all the methods had the ability to reduce bacteria and fungi present in the aerosols in the indoor air although water which served as a control had the lowest capability in both bacteria and fungi removals. Hence, it implies that the removal of bacteria and fungi in the presence of ClO 2 and WAHW was mainly derived from chemical interaction rather than physical phenomenon. The inactivation potential decreased as the number of users increased. It is interesting to observe that fungi can be inactivated in all treatment scenarios at 15 min of contact time but ClO 2 had the highest efficiency. However, the number of fungi noticeably rebounded in the WAHW and water scrubbing treatments at 60 min. This regrowth behavior of fungi might be due to the ability of fungi to form spores to protect themselves from inactivation. Another factor might be due to an increase in relative humidity after prolonged aerosolization which could promote the enumeration of fungi (Rajasekar and Balasubramanian 2011). Figures 2 and 3 also illustrate that ClO 2 seemed to be a better fungicide whereas WAHW seemed to be a slightly better bactericide than ClO 2 for long time exposure.",

This is because ClO 2 is a very powerful oxidizer that effectively eliminates pathogenic microorganisms including fungi, bacteria, and viruses (Lenntech B.V. 2020) . Findings from this study are in agreement with several other studies using ClO 2 to control the amount of bioaerosols in indoor air including student cafeterias (Hsu et al. 2014) , library (Hsu et al. 2015) , and pet shop . These studies recommended that treatment with ClO 2 is an efficient way of compliance with the Taiwan EPA guidelines for indoor air quality. Nonetheless, this study found that airflow velocity had no significant effect on both bacteria and fungi removal which contrasts with the observations from Hsu et al. (2014) and Lu et al. (2018) who found that a higher air velocity was helpful for spreading the disinfectants through indoor space as well as to enhance disinfection efficiency accordingly. This might be because the minimum airflow rate of 0.3 m/min detected in this study was already sufficient enough to thoroughly spread the disinfectant solution in the room space. The results confirmed that ClO 2 disinfection could sufficiently suppress the numbers of bacteria and fungi present in the bioaerosols to comply with the Taiwan EPA guidelines for the indoor air quality.",

The initial concentrations of bacteria and E. coli were different among each experiment because it is based on the number of people who exercised with the specific equipment namely bicycle handle (rubber surface), dumbbell (rough steel surface), and sit-up bench (synthetic leather surface) in the fitness center prior to Factors affecting microbial inactivation on sports equipment Table 4 shows the correlations between the bacteria and E. coli disinfection and the related factors. Significant positive correlations were found between the effectiveness of bacteria disinfection and the effectiveness of E. coli disinfection (r = 0.437, p < 0.01) and types of equipment (r = 0.446, p < 0.01). Significant positive correlations also existed between the effectiveness of E. coli disinfection and types of equipment (r = 0.396, p < 0.01). In other words, the effectiveness of bacteria and E. coli disinfection depends on the surface characteristics of sports equipment. Sports equipment selected in this study had different surface characteristics: (1) the handles of bicycle is soft with foam-like surface, (2) the dumbbell is steel and has a rough surface, and (3) the sit-up bench is covered with leather and has smooth surface. Other factors including time and types of the disinfectants had no statistically significant impact on both bacteria and E. coli inactivation. Figures 4(a) and 5(a) show that chlorine dioxide is highly effective in reducing bacteria and E. coli present on sports equipment (81.0-93.9%). It can be seen that ClO 2 could remove bacteria and E. coli immediately after 2 min of application. Therefore, users can use this equipment straightaway after disinfection without a long-waiting period. According to Cho et al. (2017) , chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 ) has emerged as an alternative because it has better antimicrobial effectiveness with a higher solubility, shorter response time, and wider pH range. Moreover, the inactivation effectiveness of ClO 2 on both bacteria and E. coli was not significantly affected by surface characteristic variation among the sports equipment. Hence, it can be used as a common disinfectant for all equipment in the fitness center. WAHW appeared to be less slightly effective in bacteria and E. coli inactivation than ClO 2 as illustrated in Figs. 4(b) and 5(b). Required contact time for WAHW seemed to be 10 min which was much longer than those of ClO 2 . This observation is in agreement with the studies of Block and Rowan (2020) and Quan et al. (2017) who stated that hypochlorous acid required at least 10 min of contact time to be effective for antimicrobials.",

Coupled with the findings from bioaerosol disinfection as reported earlier, ClO 2 seems to be a better choice for sanitizing the sports equipment since it was also found to be highly efficient for bioaerosol disinfection as well. Although ZnO and commercial disinfectant were effective for surface disinfection, they are not appropriate nor recommended to apply aerially for bioaerosol disinfection since the former are nano-powders which can cause irritation and toxicity to the respiratory system whereas the latter is primarily produced for surface antiseptic.",

(2005) , the most important source of airborne bacteria is the presence of people who come to exercise. Particular activities like talking, sneezing, coughing, walking, washing, and toilet flushing can generate airborne biological particulate matter. Therefore, the initial concentrations of bacteria detected in this study were not as high as it should be under normal condition. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of each disinfectant on targeted microorganisms is still valid and can be further applied for normal condition with certain modifications.",

Our results indicate that ClO 2 was more effective on fungi inactivation whereas WAHW was better for bacteria disinfection. Water had the least efficiency in removing bioaerosols from the air as expected via physical scrubbing, not disinfection. Number of users statistically diminished the bacteria and fungi removal efficiencies during the experimental period of 60 min for all tested schemes. According to the outcomes, disinfecting the air in the fitness room by ClO 2 aerosolization for 15 min after usage seems to be the most appropriate option for both bacteria and fungi control in bioaerosols in order to improve the air quality in the indoor environment and human health. For microorganisms on sports equipment control, it was found that ClO 2 and ZnO were noticeably better disinfectants than WAHW and commercial disinfectant in terms of bacteria inactivation whereas all chemicals had comparable effectiveness on E. coli disinfection. Targeted microorganisms were effectively inactivated in 2 min after application. Concerning on overall disinfection performance of both bioaerosols and surface of sports equipment, ClO 2 was found to be the most appropriate and effective disinfectant.",
