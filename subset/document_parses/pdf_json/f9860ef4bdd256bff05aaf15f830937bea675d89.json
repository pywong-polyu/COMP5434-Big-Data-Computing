To investigate the association between statins and COVID-19 outcomes and, if possible, identify the subgroup population that benefits most from statin use. Materials and methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that included statin users and described COVID-19 outcomes through 10 November 2020. This study used the generic inverse variance method to perform meta-analyses with random-effects modelling. The main outcomes were evaluation of the need for invasive mechanical ventilator (IMV) support, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care and death. All outcomes were measured as dichotomous variables. Results: A total of 28 observational studies, covering data from 63,537 individuals with COVID-19, were included. The use of statins was significantly associated with decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR] \u00bc 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-0.92, I 2 \u00bc72%) and the need for IMV (OR \u00bc 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.95, I 2 \u00bc0%) but was not linked to the need for ICU care (OR \u00bc 0.91, 95% CI: 0.55-1.51, I 2 \u00bc66%). Subgroup analysis further identified five types of studies in which statin users had even lower odds of death. Conclusions: The use of statins was significantly associated with a reduced need for IMV and decreased mortality among individuals with COVID-19. Statins may not need to be discontinued because of concern for COVID-19 on admission. Further randomized controlled trial (RCTs) are needed to clarify the causal effect between statin use and severe COVID-19 outcomes.",

People at high risk of unfavourable outcomes caused by COVID-19 include elderly persons and individuals who have chronic metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities [1, 2] . Statins are a class of medications that are widely used to manage metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. A nationwide report showed that up to 30% of the population aged !45 years took statins [3] . Whether the use of statins will affect the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 is gaining increasing attention [4, 5] . Statins are primarily used to lower serum lipids by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. In addition, statins are also known to have pleiotropic effects, including (1) anti-inflammation, (2) immunomodulation, (3) upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expression, (4) antithrombosis and (5) antioxidation [4, [6] [7] [8] . Some of the effects may have complicated interactions with COVID-19. For example, ACE2 is the main entry receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Chronic use of statins may theoretically increase susceptibility to COVID-19. On the other hand, ACE2 mediated conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7) peptide, which can protect the lung from acute injury [6, 9, 10] . The overall influence of statin use on COVID-19 remains unclear.",

Currently, these studies are all observational, and there are no published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To date, most studies agree that statins do not have to be discontinued after the onset of COVID-19 [11, 13, 15] . However, there is still no concrete conclusion about the impact of statins on the prognosis of COVID- 19. This study aims to explore the relationship between statins and COVID-19. Through a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, we expect to answer two clinical questions: (1) will the use of statins lead to a favourable/poor outcome of COVID- 19, and (2) can statins decrease the mortality of COVID-19 in a subgroup of statin users? The study results will provide valuable information to health care workers and guide the choice of potential participants in future RCTs.",

This study used the odds ratio to present the overall effect estimates in forest plots and subgroup analysis. The results of the meta-analysis are shown as forest plots with heterogeneity tested by I 2 analysis. An I 2 > 50% indicated the existence of substantial heterogeneity, and subgroup analysis was further performed.

Compared with nonstatin users, statin users are usually older and have more comorbidities, which both lead to an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality [11, 12] . Thus, when the meta-analysis pooled the adjusted and unadjusted results, the association between statin use and mortality might not be obvious because the protective effect of statins might be countered by increased risks from host factors.

Therefore, one essential goal of our study was to find out the subgroups that had lower heterogeneity. After the subgroup analysis, this study identified five subgroups in which statins were associated with an even lower COVID-19 mortality. The five subgroups also had a lower heterogeneity than overall participants. Our results may be helpful for participant selection in future RCTs. [11, 12, 20, 23, 29, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44] The measure of mortality outcome is provided for each subgroup, and the interaction p value and I 2 are provided for subgroup differences. All analyses were conducted using inverse variance and a random-effects model.",

            "text": "One of our subgroup analyses showed that statins had survival benefits in studies with an overall CFR of less than 20% but not in those with a CFR above 20%. There are three possible explanations. First, the beneficial effect of statins was mild. When an individual bears a high risk of COVID-19 mortality, the statins' impact might be overwhelmed by the host factor and turn out to be statistically nonsignificant. Second, the effect of statins was influenced by competing medical issues. A high overall mortality rate often reflects a more severe epidemic in the community because only individuals with serious conditions can be admitted for treatment. Under such circumstances, medical resources may be insufficient. The health care system may sort medical help to those who had a better prognosis than to those who had the most severe illness. Statin users, often with more comorbidities, may have poorer outcomes than those with sufficient medical resources. Third, all confirmed COVID-19 individuals' average mortality rate in the USA was 1.82% by 6 March 2021 [48] . The higher the overall mortality rate is in a study, the lower the generalizability of the result is. As more people acquire immunity against SARS-CoV-2, either by vaccination or infection, and the health care system gains more experience in treating COVID-19, we can expect a lower overall mortality rate in the future. We believe that the analysis results focussing on low CFR studies may better apply to future conditions. According to the study results, statins were associated with a reduced need for mechanical ventilators but did not influence the possibility of ICU admission. Both of the above results had low heterogeneity. Two possible reasons may explain that. First, the criteria for the use of mechanical ventilators or ICU care might vary among different areas, hospitals and even physicians. Insufficient medical resources could also play a role in some cohorts. Second, statins provide lung protection and thus decrease the need for IMV. However, statins could not reduce other nonpulmonary events, such as cardiovascular complications or sepsis. The mechanism of lung protection is most likely via upregulation of ACE2 expression, leading to increased angiotensin (1-7) production.",

According to clinical experiences, most in-hospital statin users were already taking statins before contracting COVID-19. Besides, the majority of articles included in our study emphasized the use of statin was prior to COVID-19 infection, and the results showed statin had a trend of protective effect from getting COVID-19. Retrospective observational studies had an intrinsic limitation in recording clear-cut timing of statin use among a large group of participants. However, our results at least confirmed that statin users can continue taking the medication during COVID-19 infection.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to the study. First, all articles included in our meta-analyses were observational study designs. The baseline demographics of statin users vs. nonusers exhibited substantial differences. Furthermore, some studies reported only crude odds ratios, which might lead to an even more significant bias. Second, the type, dose and duration of statins were by no means identical across studies. The majority of the studies did not detail the prescriptions of statins. Thus, even though the current evidence showed that statins might be beneficial for patients with COVID-19, it was almost impossible to provide a clear suggestion about the drug name, dose and duration. Third, a substantial portion of participants in this study had comorbidities of diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, and might have taken other concomitant medication, such as metformin, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). Metformin has shown to be associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality [49] , and ACEI/ARB also had close relationship with COVID-19 [50] . The influence of interaction between statins and co-medications on COVID-19 remains unclear and might impact the estimate of statins' effect. Future RCTs are needed to solve the limitations mentioned above.",
