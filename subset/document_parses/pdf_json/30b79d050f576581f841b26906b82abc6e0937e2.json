The study is based on a method developed by the authors for assessing the current organizational potential in accordance with the requirements and characteristics of the digitalization process. The method includes an extended classification of management problems in conditions of increasing uncertainty and the rate of change in the business environment, a methodology for assessing (calculating quantitative values) the main parameters of the Digital Transformation Snake model (DTS model), a graphical representation of a digital transformation model based on improving the organization's personnel structure. The DTS model includes the identification of two zones of organizational impact on the workforce of the organization: the zone of restructuring of the workforce and the zone of personnel development. The conclusion is made about the use of various technologies for improving the organization's personnel to achieve a successful digital transformation. Technologies are distributed across the designated areas of organizational impact.",

Bain & Company survey showed that only 5% of the companies involved in the digital transformation have reached or surpassed planned expectations (for comparison, it is 12% for conventional changes). 75% of companies experienced a decrease in value and mediocre results [2] .

However, these companies find it difficult to translate these initiatives into complete solutions and opportunities that could have a significant impact on the economy of the entire company. More mature companies are better at clustering digital initiatives around shared strategic goals and are starting to focus on improving individual support processes, primarily IT. However, these initiatives are also localized and not distributed throughout the company without broad organizational impact. As the researchers explain there are many organizations that are responding to digital change in certain ways, but the overall digital transformation is being held back by legacy systems [2, 18] .",

Digital leaders link their strategic ambitions to the innate abilities and behaviors they will need to achieve their ambitions.

Then they invest heavily in fundamental changes in their way of working, communication, organizational culture. This allows them to take digital initiatives both faster and on a larger scale. The conclusion that many researchers draw is that digital transformation implies changes at all levels of the organization [2] . Ronald Heifetz and Marty Linsky highlighted technical and adaptive problems [19, 20] . Technical challenges require the use of honed skills to solve well-defined problems. Adaptive problems are confusing, timeless and unclear. In many cases the question is difficult to formulate and the answer is even more difficult to find. Chris Ertel and Lisa Kay Solomon point out that the most important strategic challenges organizations face today are adaptive challenges [21] .",
