While there is often a reasonably good fit to an exponential function in the early phase in epidemic data, such fits rapidly lose any predictive power. Exponential growth is simply too explosive to be sustainable. Figures 94 and 95 show the Gompertz Function fit and the best exponential function fit (using the same nonlinear regression algorithm) for Covid-19 hospitalisations in Portugal from 5 March to 9 April 2020. It's (just) possible to see from the graphs that the Gompertz Function fit is closer to the data. But in fact the Gompertz Function fit is much better: the mean squared error of the exponential fit is 1.8 times as large as it is for the Gompertz Function over the sample period.",

The date of T 1 given by the 9 April fit was 29 May. A week later the 16 April fit gave a T 1 of 1 April-well in the past-and N had dropped below 82, 000. It's easy to see from the Gompertz Function dynamics why very large values of N will occur in the initial phase of very rapid growth. These dynamics are, as we've already discussed, completely determined by those of the Gumbel distribution. We can think of the parameters a and b obtained in a fit of data up to day D as defining a map from the time interval of days Given any positive integer k, there's a number B(k) < 0 such that whenever x < B(k) the first k derivatives of G are positive. When epidemic data is increasing very rapidly (say with growth like a polynomial of degree k), the nonlinear fit routine will find a Gompertz Function such that b + aD < B(k).

Ours is to use a probabilistic approach to estimate, based on recent observed daily admissions what future peaks will look like on average. This has proved very effective both in detecting the onset of the Gompertz Function growth phase and in providing useful bounds for growth of admissions until the predictive power of the Gompertz Function fits becomes sufficient. We will discuss this approach in a separate publication.",
