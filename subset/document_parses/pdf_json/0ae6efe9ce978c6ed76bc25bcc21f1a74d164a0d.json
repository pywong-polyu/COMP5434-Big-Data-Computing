            "text": "Although clinicians typically acknowledge the importance of insecure attachment as one factor that can contribute to children's psychopathology, translating attachment theory into clinical practice has proved a challenge. By specifying some of the mechanisms through which the child's attachment develops and changes, learning theory can enhance attachment based approaches to therapy. Specifically, interventions building on operant (parent management training) and classical (exposure therapy) learning can be used to stimulate new learning that increases the child's security and confidence in the parent's availability and responsiveness. To explore the clinical application and utility of a Learning Theory of Attachment (LTA), we focus on two attachment-focused interventions: Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD) and Middle Childhood Attachment-based Family Therapy (MCAT). VIPP-SD is an evidence-based parent management training designed to promote sensitive parenting and secure attachment in early childhood. MCAT is a recently developed intervention that uses exposure to stimulate secure attachment in middle childhood. LTA sheds light on the mechanisms set in train by VIPP-SD and MCAT facilitating the induction of professionals in clinical applications.",

            "text": "In the current contribution, we review how the basic principles of our Learning Theory of Attachment (LTA) might inform and be applied to clinical practice. We demonstrate that LTA can help understanding how early attachment relationships become incorporated in children's minds. Beginning in infancy, children experience major developmental shifts in how they maintain attachments to their caregivers that may contribute to fluctuations in their attachment security (Groh et al., 2014) . The LTA identifies opportunities to stimulate shifts toward more secure attachment as children grow older. Therefore, we will illustrate the clinical utility of the LTA by considering two interventions that were designed to stimulate and/or repair secure attachment bonds in young children and in middle childhood (the age period that typically starts when children are 6-7 years old and ends around 12-13 years). Understanding this process will illuminate what goes on in attachment and parenting interventions and may also help us sharpen our interventions to make them more effective. To set the foundation of this argument, we first review the basic premises of attachment and then present and discuss LTA. Finally, we will examine how LTA shows up in the two attachment-focused therapy models. It should be emphasized that the LTA itself is not a therapy or intervention but a theory that seeks to elucidate the mechanisms that may be targeted by clinicians and other professionals to increase children's attachment security.",

Unfortunately, there are few manualized and empirically supported interventions to increase children's trust in their parents or caregivers. Designing such interventions has proved challenging given attachment researchers' struggles with clearly specifying and measuring the processes through which children develop and maintain secure attachment relationships (e.g., Verhage et al., 2016) . Bosmans et al. (2020) began to address this problem by proposing that attachment development can at least in part be explained with principles of safety learning. This is a specific type of conditioning, also called conditioned inhibition, whereby stimuli become predictors of relief from stress after repeated learning trials during which these stimuli precede the experience of relief (Craske et al., 2018) . Applied to attachment theory, Bosmans et al. (2020) argued that children's trust in parents reflects in part a conditioned level of certainty or confidence that parents will provide support when the child encounters distressing situations.",

Newborns cannot survive without the protection, stress-and thermoregulation and nurturing by caregivers whose 'inclusive fitness' through transfer of their genes into next generations depends on the survival of offspring into procreative age. On this species-wide foundation of preparedness to become attached, individual differences in type of attachment relationships emerge during the first few years of life. When children experience that attachment figures consistently provide sensitive support to (di)stress, they tend to become securely attached (Bowlby, 1969) . These experiences are stored in what Bowlby (1969) labeled Internal Working Models (IWM) to emphasize their dynamic nature, and their core of cognitive representations of past experiences reflecting the degree of confidence in future support from significant others (Bretherton et al., 2005) . Securely attached children are suggested to strike a balance between exploring their environment and seeking proximity to and support from attachment figures during (di)stress (Dujardin et al., 2016) . Attachment figures can be any caregiver with whom the child interacts on a regular basis and who might provide protection, nurturance and emotional support (Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2021) . In this contribution, we will focus on parents as primary attachment figures. However, what follows can be applied to any attachment figure.",

On the one hand, children may become more ambivalent in their attachment relationships and keep their attention focused on the attachment figure instead of balancing it with exploring the wider social or physical environment. This means that their attention and behavior express anxiety for rejection, and that they continue to seek support even in the absence of distress (Cassidy, 2016; Kobak et al., 1993) . On the other hand, children may develop more avoidant behavior in an attachment relationship with parents who are consistently ignoring or even rejecting the child's bids for care and protection in times of distress. Insecure-avoidantly attached children try to keep their attention focused on the environment, away from the attachment figure. They minimize the overt signaling of attachment needs during distress presumably in an attempt to avoid potential parental rejection and to keep optimal proximity to a less than optimally protective caregiver (Cassidy, 2016; Kobak et al., 1993) .",

The effect sizes suggest that insecure attachment is not psychopathology itself. Instead, research shows that insecure attachment provides a context in which risk factors develop that are linked to elevated chances of developing psychopathology. These include, among others, less adequate emotion regulation (Verhees et al., 2021) , social skills , and maladaptive cognitive schemas about the self and others (Simard et al., 2011) . As a result, children may divert their attention away from their caregivers and wait longer to seek their support during distress, or they keep focused on the attachment figure at the cost of exploring the environment, both attentional strategies resulting in higher chances of developing psychopathology (e.g., Dujardin et al., 2016) . Insecure attachment has been proposed as a robust, transdiagnostic risk factor, rendering it a valuable target for therapy or intervention.",

Classical conditioning (see Fig. 1 ) occurs when an initially neutral stimulus (the Conditional Stimulus; CS) is presented in association with a meaningful stimulus (typically food or a pain-inducing stimulus like an electro-shock; this is named the Unconditional Stimulus; UCS). The UCS gets its meaning because it is by default linked to several positive or negative reactions (e.g., reduction of hunger or increase of stress, the Unconditional Reaction; UCR). When the CS and UCS are repeatedly presented together, the CS becomes the predictor of the UCS/UCR and elicits a Conditional Response (CR). Once the CS elicits a CR, conditioning is said to have occurred. For example, the CS can elicit the expectation (CR) that the rewarding or unpleasant experience of a parent's (un-)availability during distress will follow.",

Examples of a more automatic kind are biases in the cognitive processing of the CS such that information about the CS is more easily recalled, attentionally encoded, or interpreted in congruence with learned expectations about the CS.

According to the LTA, each interaction with the parent when the child is distressed can be considered a single learning trial (see Fig. 2 ). When the parent provides support (the UCS), children will automatically experience decreased distress (e.g., relief) and increased positive feelings of being cared for and reassured of their parents' availability and responsiveness . The reduction of distress combined with positive feelings of security can be considered the UCR. Through a process of classical conditioning, over learning trials, the parent becomes a safety cue (CS\u2212) that, for the child, predicts support, comfort and relief (UCS/UCR) during distress due to which children develop trust in the availability and support of the parent (CR). After repeated learning trials, securely attached childrens' confident expectancies in their parents' availability and support become organized in a secure base script to be considered part of a secure IWM of attachment (Waters & Waters, 2006) . A secure base script reflects a child's knowledge of the interactions during which the child experiences that parents successfully provide support during distress (also described as secure base interactions). Because these interactions always follow the same scenario, the secure base script refers to the expectation that upon exposure to distress, care-related interactions will follow this predictable scenario. Specifically, when children encounter a threat or challenge, distress is communicated to the parent directly (the child shows distress, turns toward the parent and signals the need for comfort). The parent reads the child's behavior and understands that the child needs comfort and support. Subsequently, the parent responds with emotional support and may provide practical support. This open communication and the parental responses to this communication help the child get back on track and return attention to exploring and engaging the environment.",

As a result of repeated experiences with an insensitive caregiver, the child not only anticipates the parent's failure to provide safety and protection, but also anticipates painful feelings of rejection (CR). Instead of developing a secure base script of how to signal and rely on others at times of distress, insecure children develop cognitive schemas about others as being unavailable (CR) and about themself as being unworthy or incompetent (Simard et al., 2011) . Examples are Young's early maladaptive schema's (Young et al., 2003 ; see Supplementary File 1) that are adaptive to the (less than optimal) environment in which they were developed (Hochberg & Belsky, 2013) but put individuals at elevated risk to develop relational problems and even psychopathology at a later stage.

State attachment refers to the sense of being loved and comforted during distress or lack thereof and of the associated sense of relief or rejection (Gillath et al., 2009) . Specifically, state attachment can be considered equivalent to the UCR. Hence, state attachment is dynamic and responsive to fluctuations in interactions with caregivers. If the CS parent \u2212 UCS support contingency increases, children will more frequently experience state secure attachment and high levels of state trust. When the CS parent \u2212 UCS support contingency decreases, children will more frequently experience state insecure attachment. State attachment is not only affected by ongoing care-related interactions with parents (Vandevivere et al., 2018) , but also by cues that activate memories of past experiences of support or lack thereof (Bosmans et al., 2014) . Over learning trials, more frequent experiences of state (in)secure attachment will eventually be reflected at the trait attachment level. Trait attachment can be situated more at the level of the CR and refers to a generalized expectation that the caregiver is mostly available and responsive for support during distress or mostly unavailable and unresponsive.

Consequently, restoring or promoting secure attachment in children, adolescents and adults ('from cradle to grave', Bowlby, 1969) is feasible and a relevant target for clinical intervention. Although this is a hopeful message for clinicians, there are two important limitations to take into account. First, old knowledge never gets unlearned (Bouton et al., 2021; Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) . So, it is always possible that old CRs to CSs get reactivated. If the CS-UCS contingency gets reversed again, or if old memories get primed by contextual cues, old CRs and related behaviors are likely to re-emerge. Because CS-UCS contingency is never 100% or 0%, each individual is likely to be confronted with a composite of positive and negative attachment experiences, and even though these memories might not immediately manifest at trait attachment level they can still be reactivated and influence the cognitive processing of ongoing interactions and influence subsequent interpersonal behavior. Second, attachment (in)security becomes more resistant to change with increasing age (Waters et al., 2020) . Experiences get increasingly stored as prototypes that form a blueprint, negatively affecting the likelihood that new information updates expectations (Waters, Facompre, et al., 2019; Waters, Facompr\u00e9, et al., 2019; Waters et al., in press ). This implies that restoring or stimulating secure attachment development will be easier at younger ages.",

To alter the CS-UCS contingency, multiple learning trials will be needed during which the quality of the parent-child interactions is improved. For younger children it is likely sufficient to merely train parents to respond in a more supportive way to their child during distress. The LTA predicts that this will increase the CS parent \u2212 UCS support contingency, thus increasing children's trait attachment security. Older children have developed more explicit insecure schemas (Rijkeboer & de Boo, 2010) , with increasingly stronger information processing biases (e.g., Dudeney et al., 2015) . Because such biases reduce the likelihood that children will notice and interpret parents as being more supportive than expected (Bosmans, Sanchez-Lopez, et al., 2019; , merely exposing children to corrective information during care-related interactions with parents will not result in corrective learning experiences (Baert et al., 2011) . One way to overcome this, is to make the corrective experience emotionally more salient. This can be done by explicitly activating negative expectations during care-related interactions. If negative expectations and fear are more strongly activated, rule-violations get better encoded and more likely result in changed expectations and new behavioral strategies (Craske et al., 2014) .",

The model of the insecure cycle (Kobak & Bosmans, 2019; see Fig. 4 ) helps capturing the family dynamics that explain how the interactions between children and parents (CS) unfold up to the point that children no longer experience their parents as support figures (UCS-UCR). The insecure cycle model builds on the basic assumption that infants' inborn tendency to form attachments continues into later developmental periods as a need to rely on parents in difficult situations (need for care) and in parents' need to protect and encourage their children's competence and well being (need to care). Successful pursuit of the child's attachment needs and the parent's caregiving needs is repeatedly threatened by cycles of mistuned communication. Mistuned communication can prime children's negative memories of past interactions with parents that were experienced as unsupportive. Mistuned communication can reinforce children's negative expectancies of parents availability and responsiveness. The child's fear that parents will be unavailable in situations of danger or distress activates defensive attentional and behavioral strategies aimed at reducing distress. These affect regulation strategies either reflect amplified approach motivated by the hope Fig. 4 The Insecure Cycle of mistuned communication between parent and child. This figure shows how mistuned communication between children and parents sets off a negative interaction that feeds into the development of insecure attachment-related expectations, anxious and avoidant defensive strategies that lead to children's distorted signaling of attachment needs to which parents respond in a non-supportive way that further confirms children's insecure attachment expectations of receiving care, or more common shifts of attention away from attachment figures motivated by a search for independence and control (Kobak et al., 1993; Main, 1990) . These two defensive strategies translate into behavior that either exaggerates the display of attachment needs as clingy or demanding and frustrated, or that seems to minimize needs through quasi-autonomous behaviors.",

This can activate anxious or avoidant defensive strategies in the parents' approach to the therapist and can set off an insecure cycle between the therapist and the parents. This may decrease therapy alliance and increase drop-out risk. Hence, working with families' insecure cycles requires therapists to acknowledge the parents' competence (they know their child best) and their desire to be a good parent. Therapists may prevent getting drawn too deeply into insecure cycles by always keeping their focus on the parents' underlying attachment needs and related fears.

A coercive cycle is an interactional pattern that is typically observed in children with behavior problems (Reid et al., 2002) . The coercive cycle has been described as an operant conditioning process during which children show increasingly demanding behavior to achieve their immediate goals (e.g., receiving toys or candy) and during which parents increasingly concede to the child's demands to escape from the conflict and stress raised by the child (see left half of Table 2 ). However, these reinforcers disregard possible underlying attachment-related relational meanings or functions.

Hence, although at first sight the fact that children get what they want seems like a mere positive reinforcement of their unwanted behavior, these parental behaviors are a discriminative stimulus for children (Sd) which activates insecure schemas and fears in children about not being loved and being a failure in the eyes of their parents. This is actually a CR that reflects children's past classical learning experiences during which their parents (CS parent ) got paired with negative care-related experiences (UCS rejection ). These fears elicit more distorted signaling of attachment needs (e.g., oppositional behavior, R child ). This behavior gets reinforced because it shifts the focus away from feelings of loneliness and abandonment (\u2212Sr\u2212), because it prevents those feelings to be activated (\u00b0Sr\u2212), or because it elicits parental attention (+Sr+) and the hope that parents might respond more sensitively after this new attempt (+Sr+). However, this in turn becomes a Sd for the parents due to which the insecure cycle continues. We propose that the reinforcers identified in the coercive cycle (reduction of stress in the parent, achieving desired goals in the child) have a stronger immediate impact than the reinforcers identified in the insecure cycle. The latter, however, shape the relational environment for coercive cycles to reoccur as the resulting negative appraisals of each other increase the likelihood for new coercive cycles to set off.",

When families get caught up in insecure cycles, CS parent \u2212 UCS support contingency decreases and children learn that they cannot trust in their parents' availability and support. Hence, to stimulate or restore attachment development, interventions are needed that prevent, interrupt, and/or restructure insecure cycles. This can be done by altering the context (Sd-oriented interventions), by altering the consequences of parent and child behaviors (Sr-oriented interventions), and by altering the meaning that children attribute to parents and that parents attribute to children (CS-oriented interventions). This way, the LTA also suggests that improving parent-child attachment relationships requires bridging family and behavior therapy. Behavior therapists may benefit from being more attachment-emotion-focused and relational therapists may benefit from being more mindful of classical and operant learning processes.",

Preliminary work on Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) for example shows that integrating an attachment perspective in parent management training may stimulate attachment-relevant parenting practices (Allen et al., 2014) but the impact on children's attachment development may be limited (Kohlhoff et al., 2020; O'Conner et al., 2013; Timmer et al., 2011) .

Successful consequent control training helps parents to no longer reward unwanted child behavior and to reward and stimulate instead wanted or neutral behavior.

An example could be a situation where a sibling gets more attention from the parents (e.g., during his birthday party). Second, parents can then help the child understand the situation, acknowledging that children typically feel jealous and ignored in such situations and that this is tough to deal with, but at the same time setting clear rules about what behavior is acceptable and what behavior is unacceptable. Third, parents can also explain to the child that during the birthday party they will be busy accommodating guests, but that during the party, the child can always ask for help and that after the party they will spend some time together.

By acknowledging that it is normal for children to feel like that (meaning that the child is not \"bad\") and by providing comfort for the sadness and disappointment renders parents more responsive to children's genuine attachment needs.

On the one hand, authoritative parents enforce consistent limits and rules that are clearly articulated to children. On the other hand, they sensitively acknowledge children's stress and attachment needs. Authoritative parenting requires parents to become aware which child behaviors signal the child's distress and to express empathy for their child's efforts to comply even if the child's attempts fail. For example, in response to sibling aggression, a parent could say: \"I see that you feel hurt and I understand that is hard to bear, but you know you cannot hit your brother\". This is secure base support. Specifically, the parent provides acknowledgement and support for the stress the child felt during the interaction with the brother. This elicits relief (e.g., my parent does not think I am a bad boy, \u2212Sr\u2212) and gives comfort (+Sr+). If parents' alternative approach improves parent-child interactions, these new parental behaviors are reinforced by the child to become a stable part of the parenting repertoire. However, if parents struggle to provide that support, it becomes important to explore the reinforcers that maintain their initial parenting behavior and focus more on parents' own psychopathology, or own attachment learning history.

Due to these biases, older children might fail to pick up changes in their parents' attempts to respond to their attachment needs. As a result, insecure cycles can endure even if parents manage to respond more sensitively to children's underlying needs. Moreover, with passing time, parents' processing of their child's behavior will get more biased, making it harder to respond to their child's attachment needs more sensitively. To bypass these information processing biases and related therapeutic blocks, it is necessary to create an emotionally intense learning experience that violates both parents' and children's expectations about feared outcomes (Tryon, 2005) . One therapeutic strategy that could prove useful here is Exposure Therapy, a classical learning technique. This is a therapy during which patients are exposed to feared stimuli (CS). During exposure, the CS-UCS association will get disrupted by creating an inhibitory association. This occurs by abstaining from relying on avoidance behavior. This enables corrective learning experiences whereby patients learn that feared outcomes do not occur (Abramowitz et al., 2019) .",

Once this information is collected, and the function analysis is sufficiently completed, exposure therapy will require participants to confront the fear eliciting stimuli or situations. During exposure excercises, therapists ensure the maximal activation of the fears and negative expectations by helping participants to abstain from avoidance behaviors and to rely on behaviors that further activate fear and negative expectations. The more all relevant fears and negative expectations are activated during exposure, the more such an exercise increases the likelihood that corrective learning occurs (Craske et al., 2014) .

Children fear and avoid the emotional pain linked to being ignored, misunderstood, left alone, or rejected by the parent. The fact that exposure therapy targets avoidance behaviors which underlie attachments could lead one to expect that exposure therapy is only a useful intervention for avoidant attachment-related behaviors. However, the repertoire of behaviors that serve to avoid a feared outcome is much broader than merely avoiding proximity. For exampe, ambivalent attachment behaviors such as protest and persuasion can help avoid feeling unseen (\u00b0Sr\u2212 or \u2212Sr), or they can stimulate parents to try harder to accommodate the child (+Sr+). This may reduce children's fear that their parents are unavailable (\u2212Sr\u2212).

Although the precise form of the fear eliciting care-related interactions will be different from family to family, the LTA suggests that, at the most abstract level, these interactions consist of the ingredients of the insecure cycle. Thus, function analysis requires to clearly map the elements of the insecure cycle and then design exposure excercises that elicit children's (distorted) attachment signaling which elicits parents' non-supportive responses that feed into the insecure cycle. For corrective learning to occur during exposure, parents are stimulated to abstain from their typical responses and to attend to children's underlying attachment needs in spite of the fears the interaction with their care-seeking child elicit.

We do not propose to expose the child to a negative parent until they no longer feel scared. Instead we expose the child to a newly trained, attachment promoting parent until this exposure challenges and revises the child's internal negative expectation. We have shown that it is hard for insecurely attached children to process information that is incongruent with mistrust . Specifically, we found in a set of cognitive bias modification experiments that attention and interpretation biases need to be bypassed before exposure to incongruent attachment information can change attachment-related expectations about the parent. To achieve this during an exposure session, therapists need to help parents and children to focus on the evidence of the secure base script during the session to support consolidating the corrective learning experience. Research on parental reminiscence suggests that discussing with the child what occurred during an interaction with parents is one promising avenue to help organizing supportrelated experiences in a secure base script like fashion (e.g., Apetroaia & Waters, 2018) . So, clinically, it is important that the therapist explicitly points parents and children to the secure base-congruent elements of the interactions that unfolded during exposure excercises. Finally, to further stimulate secure base script learning, it is important to repeat the exposure exercises in different situations. This can include expanding the number of relevant topics that require parent-child interaction, or expanding the locations where exposure is practiced.",

Typically, families of young children who display signs of externalizing problems participate in prevention programs that build on social learning theory and that target parenting skills to disrupt or prevent coercive cycles (e.g., Patterson et al., 2004; WebsterStratton & Hammond, 1997) . These programs prove effective with moderate effect sizes (e.g., Gardner et al., 2019; Piquero et al., 2016) . VIPP-SD adds attachment theory to Patterson's model of social learning to break coercive cycles. It was the first intervention that was developed with the explicit aim to integrate learning principles in an attachment-focused coaching program. The program supports parents struggling with the terrible twos, threes and older children with conduct problems (O'Farrelly et al., 2021) . The program was developed with the aim to break coercive cycles and promote sensitive parenting to enhance parent-child attachment relationships (Euser et al., 2021) . Given the overlap between coercive and insecure cycles, the program aligns with the abovementioned LTA-goal to interrupt insecure cycles as a mechanism to enhance the quality of parent-child interactions and attachment relationships. As we will demonstrate, to achieve this goal VIPP-SD relies partly on principles of antecedent and consequent control.",

Whereas in the first year of life infants frequently need physical contact to feel safe and secure, in the early childhood years the balance shifts in the direction of emotional availability of the parent in addition to moments of close physical contact when the child is tired or (di)stressed. Exploring the world is a central developmental task for the child, and this is not without the inclination to explore things such as the remote control, a precious china vase, or a road with busy traffic that the parent would rather not seeing explored by the child. In other words, parents need to balance support of their child's explorative behavior with protection of the child and their own and others' material possessions. Moreover, lovely babies turn into terrible twos and threes that are strong-willed and test the effects of their \"No\" in response to parental requests. In a secure relationship, toddlers will be non-compliant; they even have to be non-compliant to explore what they can achieve and what response will follow their 'daring' behavior. One can see the toddler check with the parent while doing something that they know they are not supposed to do. In addition, their limited behavioral control and executive functioning abilities account for little success in inhibiting themselves when doing something that they know is prohibited.",

The attachment component is related to one of the basic goals of the VIPP-SD which is to stimulate parents' sensitive responsiveness to the child's signals of (di)stress and the need for physical or mental proximity to cope with distressing or threatening situations. According to attachment theory, the core of sensitive responsiveness is the parent's ability to see the child's attachment signals, to interpret them accurately, and to respond promptly and effectively to these signals (Ainsworth et al., 1978) . Social learning is central to the second component of VIPP-SD which is to promote sensitive discipline or limit setting when the child tends to misbehave. Attachment-based interventions have focused mostly on the 'sensitiviy' dimension of parenting, neglecting the limit setting or discipline dimension and thus leaving parents with empty hands for example when they are faced with a toddler throwing a tantrum to have its way.",

The child throws a fit in the public space, and after a while the parent gives in, out of despair or shame. VIPP-SD aims to help parents look beyond those distorted signaling of attachment needs, set sensitive limits and at the same time provide the needed support for children's actually experienced attachment needs. During VIPP-SD, parents learn to no longer give in, the typical and powerful immediate reinforcer of children's unwanted behavior. Instead, they learn to approach the child's misbehavior in such a way that it is either prevented or no longer immediately rewarded, while recognizing the child's wishes and emotions. At the same time, parents learn to shape wanted behavior through sensitive support as a reinforcer that has both immediate rewarding effects (decrease of distress and increase of feeling connected) and long-term rewarding effects (building a more secure attachment relationship). This way, VIPP-SD fosters corrective learning experiences and the increase of CS parent \u2212 UCS support contingency. During VIPP-SD children learn to trust in parental support (CR) thanks to which they can start develop new behaviors to seek for parental support (R).",

The emphasis in selecting video-taped fragments is on interaction sequences that were at least partially successful. Parents watch their own steps toward adequate limit setting at some (perhaps rare) occasion and see how effective their behavior can be.

In keeping with the social learning perspective, interrupting a coercive cycle means that the immediate reinforcers (see Table 2 ) are either removed (\u2212Sr+) or avoided (\u00b0Sr+). This is typically achieved by having parents gently but firmly reject the child's demand, offering an alternative or explaining why the demand cannot be fulfilled, keeping the communication open. This acts as a reinforcer of the child ending the demanding behavior (+Sr+) and shapes new interaction patterns between parents and children. VIPP-SD integrates these typical strategies with an attachment-focused approach to the coercive cycle. Specifically, VIPP-SD adds three attachment-focused elements to regular antecedent and consequent control training. These elements relate to discipline strategies, the parents' support of children's attachment needs, and the therapist's positive approach to the parent, modeling the desired parent-child interactions.",

Regarding a sensitive pause, parents learn to keep its duration short and to stay in visual contact with the child. It serves the function of downregulating stress levels more of the parents than of the children. Induction is providing reasons for the limits set by the parent, making clear that the misbehaving child remains considered a valued interaction partner with the attachment relationship intact (+Sr+). Moreover, parents are encouraged to compliment the child for any tiny effort they show to comply with a parental demand. All this maximizes parent-child engagement and allows repair of momentary ruptures in the relationship resulting from limit setting. This serves as a positive reinforcement for the attachment relationship and promotes future adequate authoritative limit setting.

With young children, parents learn to speak for the child, to let the child know that they are seen and heard, even if a wish of the child cannot be immediately fulfilled. The parent is encouraged to share the child's positive emotions as a way of compensating for more difficult moments. Lastly, the coach highlights socalled chains of sensitivity. Such chains of sensitivity can be made visible in the videotaped interaction when a parent responds adequately to a child signal and the child shows it is satisfied or happy with that response. For instance, this happens when the child reaches for something it is not allowed to have, the parent comments: \"I see that you want another cookie but you cannot have that now, but I can make you a fruit salad if you are hungry?\" and the child complies with the alternative and happily follows the mother to the kitchen. This awareness of child signals and chains of sensitivity contribute to preventing coercive cycles and ensures that positive attachment-related interactions remain a more powerful immediate reinforcer than the stimuli children gain by their demanding behavior. This way, the vicious coercive cycles are transformed into rewarding spirals of sustained interactions.",

In the first two sessions only positive interaction sequences are emphasized and the parents are affirmed in their role as having expert knowledge of their own child. The coach always maintains a non-judgmental attitude and acts as an empathic guide for the parents to reflect on specific rewarding parts of the videotape.

It is critical in the first session to establish a non-evaluative rapport with the parents and create an atmosphere of open communication. The coach strives for empathy and sensitive responsiveness toward the parents similar to what (s)he wants to attain in the parent-child relationship. This sensitive coaching becomes then a safety cue and the discriminative stimulus on which parents can rely to seek the coach's help and support (R) while trying to learn from VIPP-SD.

For care-related interactions to be experienced as helpful during middle childhood, the care scenario looks slightly different compared to previous developmental stages. On the one hand, middle childhood comes with novel or challenging developmental tasks that activate the attachment system and the need for care (Vandevivere et al., 2015) . First, acquiring new academic skills becomes a challenge. For example, acquiring math or reading skills can be distressing and may elicit a need for parental support (Bosmans & De Smedt, 2015) . Second, social interactions become a more explicit source of distress. Children struggle, for example, with peer conflicts and challenging playground interactions (Vandevivere et al., 2015) .",

Specifically, the supervisor role that parents already take on in certain occasions during early childhood further evolves into a a supervisor partnership. Parents now also help the child to explore and understand their daily hassles and their associated feelings and needs. Children no longer desire their parent to take over, instead they want their parents to help them gain insight in the issues they are faced with. Further, they find it helpful if parents propose possible solutions, allowing them to autonomously apply or improve the suggested solutions (Koehn & Kerns, 2016) . However, because many of these problems and daily hassles are difficult to solve by themselves, children's solution oriented attempts are not always successful and this activates feelings of failure in the child. At those times, it is important for children to experience supported failure. This refers to parents' ability to comfort the child and show that they understand that the child did what it could do and that they do not think about the child as a failing person (Bosmans, 2016) .",

This is clearly different from ABFT, due to which it was impossible to merely apply ABFT to the middle childhood population. The fact that this is a challenging age for children to participate in family therapy is illustrated by many family therapists' hesitation to involve children in family treatment sessions (Klop, 2017; Rober, 2008) . To account for these challenges, MCAT acknowledges that younger children have not yet developed the verbal skills to fully participate in complex conversations that are part of ABFT. Instead, therapy in middle childhood requires more play and action (Klop, 2017; Rober, 2008) . Therefore, MCAT is built around activities that serve as a leverage to facilitate exchange about attachment needs, emotions and unfolding interactions. For example, Lego Duplo\u00ae dolls are used to let parents and children visualize their family relationships (Diekmann-Schoemaker & van der Veer, 2003) and the emotion figures from Disney's\u00ae movie Inside Out are used to visualize and deepen the emotional layers that drive the child's and the parents' behavior during insecure cycles (see Fig. 5 for an example). MCAT makes use of mental imagery exercises and various types of games, and creative techniques.",

These skills are necessary for ABFT, but in middle childhood, children have not yet integrated the negative experiences with their parents into abstract (insecure) attachment narratives which they can share with parents so parents can help rebuild trust. They more concretely experience and describe interactions with their parents as positive (e.g., 'fun', 'nice', or 'good') or negative (e.g., 'not fun', 'not nice', or 'not helpful'). However, when currently experiencing a specific situation and when probed in a developmentally appropriate way, most children this age are able to talk more extensively and detailed about their in-the-moment thoughts, feelings and behavior, and even make links with previous situations that felt alike. Therefore, in MCAT, the therapist selects activities that elicit care-related interactions, which activates the child's care script and then allows for a discussion of the child's in-the-moment appraisals, expectations and fears regarding this type of interactions with their parents.\"",

For function analysis, MCAT identifies parents' and children's insecure attachment-related expectations and their defensive strategies(avoidance behaviors: the child's distorted attachment signals and the parents' unsupportive responses) that are set in motion or perpetuate insecure cycles. To visualize this information for participating families, MCAT adjusted the infinity sign drawing developed in Emotionally Focused Therapy (Johnson, 2020; see Fig. 6 ). Figure 6a shows the basis of the figure. It shows the infinity Switch the focus from the child as problem towards strengthening or repairing the parent-child relationship to reduce both the child's and the parent's suffering 2. Alliance building 2-6 (1) Build a strong working alliance with the parents and the child (2) Initiate the identification of the family specific insecure cycle 3. Interrupting the insecure cycle 7-9 (1) Start the communication about the child's sources of distress and needs for parental support, (2) Further unravel the hypothesized insecure cycle as identified in Phase 2, (3) Empower the parents in staying out of insecure cycles with their child by (4) strengthening parents' already available skills to provide secure base support to their child when distressed (5) and train parents' emotion coaching skills 4. Creating secure base learning experiences 10-16 Create corrective attachment learning experiences and consolidate secure base script development sign, symbol of the ongoing interaction between parent and child. The upper side of the infinity sign (above the blue line), reflects the observable behavior and secondary emotions (e.g., anger and frustration) of both the parents and the child. In conversations with the parents on this topic, the metaphor of an iceberg is used: the upper side of the infinity sign is the part of the interaction that occurs above the waterline and that is visible. The lower side of the infinity sign (the blue line) reflects the invisible primary and vulnerable attachment-related emotions: the attachment needs and fears of both the parents and the child. The child's primary emotions activate avoidance behavior (above the blue line), which activates the parents' primary emotions to which they in turn respond with their own avoidance behavior. This again activates children's primary emotions (and so on). The information gathered during Phases 1-3 serves to fill in the drawing for the family (see Fig. 6b ). This drawing is used throughout the therapy to provide insight to the parents about the therapy targets. The drawing gets constantly updated if new information emerges during Phase 4 sessions. This drawing is mainly used as a metaphor to help families understand their ongoing interactions and to look together with the therapist for alternative behavior that helps interrupt the insecure cycle. However, at the learning theoretical level, the drawing reflects past classical and operant learning processes. Specifically, the child and the child's expression of secondary emotions are a CS for the parents (CS parent ), which activates their insecure schemas of rejection by the child, that they will fail as a parent or that they will be considered inadequate (UCS parent ), and the fear associated with those schemas (CR/UCR parent ). This situation functions as a discriminative stimulus (Sd parent ) and elicits parental avoidance behavior (e.g., aimed at convincing the child that it must not or should not feel distressed or aimed at stopping the child's unwanted behavior; R parent ), that gets reinforced by preventing those feared outcomes and associated negative emotions (e.g., the child stops sending signals that elicit the feeling of rejection, \u2212Sr\u2212 parent , in the hope that the child will never express those signals again, \u00b0Sr\u2212 parent ). However, as discussed in the coercive cycle section, when parents let children cross their boundaries like this, they will also feel anger and frustration about their child which more likely translates in criticism, and explicit or implicit rejection. This Sd child comes with fear that they risk losing the parents' love, which again elicits children's missignals (R child ) that get reinforced because they shift the Fig. 6 Function analysis of the Insecure Cycle focus away from feelings of loneliness and abandonment (\u2212Sr\u2212 child ), because they prevent those feelings to be activated (\u00b0Sr\u2212 child ), or because they elicit parental attention (+Sr+ child ). Thus, this behavior can increase the child's hope that parents might respond more sensitively after this new attempt (+Sr+ child ). However, this in turn becomes a Sd for the parents due to which the insecure cycle continues.",

This way, the therapist acknowledges the parents' good intentions and their love for the child, which helps to forge a constructive therapist-parent alliance due to which the parent can experience the therapist as a sensitive ad hoc figure and a model of a sensitive caregiver. Subsequently, the therapist explores transgenerational attachment themes, because these themes feed into the parents' primary emotions elicited by the child's unwanted behavior. This additionally helps the therapist to identify parents' motivation to give their child a better childhood than what they themselves experienced as a child (if their past attachment experiences reflect substantial insecurity) or to give their child the quality of care they themselves experienced during their own childhood (if they experienced substantial security as a child).",

These activities typically elicit the child's carerelated script and the child behavior (R child ) that activates the insecure cycle. Afterwards, experiences during these games that reflect confidence and uncertainty are discussed giving children ample space to discuss their attachment-related appraisals and defensive responses related to anxiety and avoidance. Hereby, the therapist works constantly on deepening emotions by activating all vulnerable emotions such that the insecure cycle is experienced by all family members during the function analysis sessions. These emotions are subsequently used and maximally activated during the exposure exercises. The exposure excercises need to expose parents to the relevant Sd parent that activate past painful experiences during which they felt that children (CS) rejected them or that they failed as a parent (US parent ) and that activate the fear that this experience will be repeated (CR parent ). At the same time, these exercises need to expose children to the relevant Sd child that have been linked in the past to the painful experience that the parents (CS) did not support or rejected them (US hild ) and that activate the fear that this experience will be repeated (CR hild ).",

The therapist guides the conversation between parents and children to the content that seems emotionally most relevant to the child. Such discussions will activate the child's fear that parents will not acknowledge or understand their needs and will not provide emotional support (CR child ). Discussing such topics will also be threatening for parents as the child might react with distorted signaling of needs, might say that have felt alone, frustrated, unheard, or misunderstood by the parents, or might tell things that trigger intense parental concerns about the child's future development. All these responses will activate the parents' fear to feel an unloved, incompetent, or bad parent (CR parent ). If, during such exposure exercises, parents manage to let go of the defensive strategies (R parent ) they typically use to protect themselves against those fears, their anxiety will increase, but it will also create the possibility for new learning experiences. Specifically, if parents manage to respond in a supportive way (distress decreases, \u2212Sr\u2212 child , secure states increase, +Sr+ child ), this contradicts the child's expectations which can result in a corrective learning experience for the child. It increases the likelihood that children let go of their self-defensive strategies (R child ), thanks to which parents can experience that these interactions do not result in the feared rejection (\u2212Sr\u2212 parent ), that they get back into touch with the child (+Sr+ parent ) and that they are still loved by the child. Thus, these exposure excercises allow to disrupt the CS-UCS association due to which new experiences and expectations can be learned which facilitates relying on the desired behavior (for both the parents and the child).",

            "text": "Thus, the biggest challenge of attachment-focused exposure therapy in middle childhood is to help parents abstain from their typical avoidance behaviors. To achieve this goal, the MCAT therapist forges a strong collaborative therapist alliance with the parent by acknowledging their efforts, their love for their child, and (often) their desire to compensate for the care they missed as a child. Moreover, the therapist helps parents to use emotion coaching skills to replace their typical avoidant reactions. Some parents tend to reassure their children when they express distress. They try to ignore children's distress, or they try to convince them that there is no need to feel distressed, that they should be grateful for what they have, or that they should focus on the positive. Other parents tend to emphasize how their child should try better or try to solve the problem for the child. These are only some examples of parental responses that suppress children's attempts to share their distress. In MCAT, the therapist does not discuss with parents which of their responses are helpful or not. Instead, the therapist explains how parents can employ emotion coaching skills that facilitate a secure base discourse with their child. This means that parents do not immediately give their opinion or do not immediately try to solve the distress in response to what the child is sharing. Instead, MCAT helps parents to deepen the narrative of the child by asking questions like \"can you tell me more about that\" and by trying to help the child label negative emotions. This approach is taken from ABFT. Using video feedback, the therapist shows parents fragments of past sessions during which they already employ these emotion coaching skills intuitively and during which their child responds positively to open, emotion-focused discourses about the child's distress.

Once these fears and negative emotions are maximally activated, the therapist subsequently helps the parents to use emotion coaching to prompt for children's underlying need for care. This need contradicts parents' fear that the child does not love them or does not appreciate them as caregivers. This is often a very emotional moment for parents on which MCAT builds to strengthen the attachment relationship. Children who feel that their parents respond in such a more emotion coaching way, more easily share their pain and fears with their parents. They seem to be in a developmental stage where their needs for care continue to drive them towards proximity seeking (see also Dujardin et al., 2019) . So, if they feel that their parents are listening in an open and curious manner, without judgement, they oftentimes start sharing more suppressed negative primary emotions and cognitions. This in turn helps the parents understand their child's distress better and often immediately softens their felt urge to employ their typical avoidance behavior. As a result the probability increases that the child feels acknowledged and supported which interrupts insecure cycles and which is a corrective attachment-related learning experience.",

Thus, the most threatening topics are touched upon once some trust has been rebuilt. Each exposure session ends when the parents are able to sustain emotion coaching until the child feels understood and supported. To consolidate the learning experience, the therapist uses \"in-the-moment\" verbalization (Caron et al., 2018) each time the interchange between the parents and the child reflects elements of the secure base script. To further maximize generalization of the learning experiences, the therapist ensures that parents and children practice these new communication skills about different topics. To ensure generalization, exposure occurs with the family at different locations (e.g., at the family's home or at the child's school during meetings with the teacher). This way, the therapist helps parents to become more atuned when children express their distress, which prevents future mistuned communication and reduces the risk that novel insecure cycles are set off. At the same time, the in-themoment verbalisations and the generalization sessions aim to stimulate the consolidation of the learning experiences and children's secure base script development.",

We discussed how these therapeutic strategies might be adapted to fit with attachment-focused treatment targets and described two interventions that are convergent with these ideas.",

Obviously, much work still needs to be done into clinically relevant translations. At the level of the interventions, support for the effectivity of VIPP-SD is robust, but MCAT has only recently been developed. Moreover, for both interventions more fine-grained work on the mechanisms of change is needed. The LTA may be functional to delineate testable questions about these mechanisms.",

The evidence base for VIPP-SD is substantial with 25 randomized control trials in families struggling with a wide range of clinical issues showing that antecedent and consequent control training using video-feedback can raise parenting in the service of attachment security (see Van IJzendoorn et al., 2021) . In older children, programs like MCAT suggest that attachment relationships can be strengthened or repaired by attachment-focused exposure therapy. MCAT is a novel program, so only limited pilot data are available, but MCAT seems to significantly increase children's secure base script knowledge and decreases children's presenting problems using exposure therapy.",
