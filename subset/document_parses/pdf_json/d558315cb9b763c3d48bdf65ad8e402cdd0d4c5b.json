Study design: Oro-nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples were collected from all patients simultaneously in the early stage of COVID-19. Viral loads were determined by extracting viral RNAs from saliva samples of patients whose ONP swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. The demographic information, comorbidities, cycle threshold values, and one-month clinical courses were recorded and compared. Results: The patients' clinical course was evaluated for one month; 56 % of patients had mild disease, 26.4 % had moderate disease, 9.6 % had severe disease, and 8% had a critical/mortal disease. The average cycle threshold values of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and ONP samples were measured as 22.28 and 24.19, respectively. Cycle threshold value of saliva was found to be significant in predicting disease severity (Eta coefficient 0.979). A statistically significant relationship was found between the disease's severity and the mean of ONP samples' Ctvalues (p < 0.05). Gender, age, body mass index, and co-morbidities were compared with the severity of the disease; no statistically significant difference was found. Conclusion: Viral load detected in saliva in the early period of COVID-19 infection may have a prognostic value in showing the disease's course in patients over 45-year-old. Saliva is an easily obtainable, reliable material for COVID-19 screening.",

            "text": "Saliva contains particularly high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 in the early period of infection; however, the high amount of virus's origin and prognostic significance in this period has not been adequately clarified. High viral load in the saliva can be explained by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 infects target cells in the oro-nasopharyngeal tissues in the early period and interferes with the salivary secretion by replication in the target cells (Xu et al., 2020b) . Although the disease's pathobiology is not fully understood, it seems that in the early period of infection, oropharyngeal target cells are the ductal epithelium of minor salivary glands rich in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and ACE2 receptor-rich epithelial cells of the oral mucosa (Liu et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2020a, b) . SARS-CoV-2 enters target cells with its spike protein that has a strong affinity to human ACE2, and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is needed to entry and viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . After reaching the lungs, the virus can cause morbidity and mortality by affecting type-II alveolar epithelium in the lung that causing viral pneumonia. The occurrence of viral pneumonia could be explained by the fact that the type-II alveolar epithelium lining the alveoli is rich from ACE2 receptors, which are the targets of SARS-CoV-2; by the way, the lung loses an essential protective mechanism after the blockage of the ACE2 receptor pathway (Imai et al., 2005) . Viral spread can also reach endothelial cells, kidney tissue cells, intestinal cells and increase morbidity and mortality (Crackower et al., 2002; Danilczyk et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2005; Hamming et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2020) .",

When the comorbidities were analyzed, HT was most common as 43.2 %, followed by DM 30.4 %, CVD 19.2 %, asthma 10.4 %, and COPD, malignancy, and immune deficiency with a frequency of 4% (Table 1) The patients' average Ct-value/saliva was measured as 22.28 (min: 7.90, max: 33.74, SD: 5). The patients' average Ct-value/ONP was measured as 24.19 (min: 10.22, max:33.98, SD: 0.43). The clinical course of the patients was evaluated as the result of a one-month followup. Seventy of the patients had a disease at home, and dyspnea complaints did not develop during the follow-up period (mild disease), 33 patients complained of shortness of breath or dyspnea; but hospitalization or oxygen requirement did not occur (moderate disease), 12 patients were hospitalized and/or needed oxygen support (severe disease), ten patients required intensive care and showed a fatal course (critical/ mortal disease). The clinical course of the patients with a Ct-value over 38 was followed up, the patients had the disease at home and dyspnea complaints did not develop. (Table 2 ). There is a moderately significant positive correlation between Ct-value/ONP and Ct-value/saliva (r = 0.402, p < 0.0001). The Ct-value/saliva was found to be significant in predicting disease severity (Eta coefficient 0.979). A statistically significant relationship was found in the ANOVA test between the disease's severity and the Ct-value/saliva (p < 0.05, ANOVA's F value: 45.055). Post-Hoc tests were performed with Tukey and Tamhane T2; it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the Ct-value/saliva means of severe disease and critical/mortal disease groups (p > 0.05); however, when all other paired groups were compared, it was observed that the Ct-value/saliva means were significantly different from each other (p < 0.05).

A minimum 45-year-old limiting for our study was based on the fact that the median ages of hospitalized patients varied between 47 and 73 in most of the studies (Docherty et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020) . Thus, most of our patients were in the age range at risk of hospitalization.
