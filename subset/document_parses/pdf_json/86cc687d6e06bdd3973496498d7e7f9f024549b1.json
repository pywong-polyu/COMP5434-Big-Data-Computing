Despite the vast research about the adult population, there has been little data collected on acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology, associated risk factors, treatments, and mortality in pediatric COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. AKI is a severe complication of COVID-19 among children and adolescents. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Center Trials to find all published literature related to AKI in COVID-19 patients, including incidence and outcomes.",

Across all studies, the overall sample size of COVID positive children was 1,247 and the median age of this population was 9.1 years old. Among COVID positive pediatric patients, there was an AKI incidence of 30.51%, with only 0.56% of these patients receiving KRT. The mortality was 2.55% among all COVID positive pediatric patients. The incidence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) among COVID positive patients was 74.29%. Conclusion AKI has shown to be a negative prognostic factor in adult patients with COVID-19 and now also in the pediatric cohort with high incidence and mortality rates. Additionally, our findings show a strong comparison in epidemiology between adult and pediatric COVID-19 patients; however, they need to be confirmed with additional data and studies.",

COVID-19 has infected more than 103 million people of all ages and has a mortality of 2.3 million people globally as of February 2020 (John Hopkins Coronavirus Tracker). We have extensively developed our knowledge on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and post infection complications of COVID-19 in the past year; however, this knowledge continues to evolve. While the majority (approximately 80%) of adult patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, the virus may produce severe illness, multiorgan failure, and death in a small portion of the population [2] . Kidney manifestations of COVID-19, such as acute kidney injury (AKI), are typically considered negative prognostic factors and may appear in up Rupesh Raina and Ronith Chakraborty are Co-first author to 25% of adult patients.

Although the virus is known to particularly target the lungs, it is not uncommon for the disease to manifest in other organ systems, especially in severe cases. More specifically, various pathological studies have particularly highlighted the kidneys as a target of COVID-19 with the development of AKI in critically ill COVID-19 adult patients. There have also been instances of AKI occurrence in pediatric COVID-19 patients. However, there has been no consensus regarding the accurate incidence, outcomes, and associated mortality among this population. Therefore, our systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to specifically address the incidence, mortality, outcomes, and various treatment modalities utilized in COVIDpositive pediatric patients with AKI.

The higher incidence among pediatric patients was higher than we expected, however, in the multicenter cohort study (the Critical Coronavirus and Kids Epidemiologic [CAKE] study) of critically ill children with COVID-19, the incidence of AKI was reported to be 18% [13] . Additionally, in a multicenter AKI study among critically ill children with COVID-19 by Bjornstad et al. (n = 106), AKI was found to occur in 44% (n = 47) of patients [14] . We also found a mortality of 2.55% (1.67-3.73%) in COVID AKI patients with 0.56% of patients requiring KRT (0.16-1.43%). This is similar to the data reported by the Virtual Pediatric Systems (VPS) from North American pediatric ICUs as of February 2020. Based on the 2,030 COVID-19 positive patients reported by VPS, there was a mortality rate of 3.3% (Fig. 6c) . Additionally, in the 281 (13.8%) of COVID-19 patients with kidney systems involved, there was a mortality rate of 10.3% (n = 29) with 13.9% (n = 39) requiring organ support via KRT. Lastly, it had been reported by various studies that some pediatric patients uniquely exhibited MIS-C. A recent systematic review by Abrams et al. analyzing the clinical features of 440 children with MIS-C revealed that the proportion of patients who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test ranged from 13 to 60% while the proportion of positive serology tests ranged from 75 to 100% [36] . Additionally, Feldstein et al. reported that out of 186 children with MIS-C, 70% were COVID-positive by RT-PCR or antibody testing [10] . Based on our review, we found that the pooled incidence (95% CI) of MIS-C among COVID-positive patients was 74.29% (41.24-96.43%) [p < 0.0001; random effect; 12 studies; n = 1,206]. This is much higher than reported by VPS, which reported a total of 23.9% of pediatric patients with MIS-C (485 out of 2,030 patients). These differences may potentially be attributed to variations in the definition and clinical knowledge of the syndrome due to its novelty [7] . To bring our pediatric data into comparison with adult data regarding AKI in COVID-positive patients, a sub-analysis was performed with our systematic review which assessed AKI incidence in the majority of adult COVID patients. The parameters of our adult systematic review are highlighted in Appendix C. Our comparison analysis was performed by calculating medians and utilizing the Mann-Whitney U-test with a p value \u2264 0.05 considered for statistical significance (Fig.  6a) . The pooled median age of children was 9.1 years (ranging from median of 6.5-14.5 years across all studies) and adults was 61 years (median of 45.6-73 years). The proportion of males was almost equal for children (56.2%) and adult (60.9%) studies. However, there was a lower proportion of children (26.7%) with at least 1 pre-existing co-morbidity than that of adults (40.9%).",

            "text": "Overall, this suggests that children may have less severe symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 as compared to adults. The observed outcomes among children may be attributed to a more active innate immune response, generally being overprotected by parents, engaging in fewer outdoor activities, undertaking less international [37] [38] [39] [40] . Despite these reasons providing a case why children are less likely to progress to severe disease, increasing pediatric cases and newer reports are starting to show the opposite. In the study by Bjornstad et al., the investigators reported a mortality of 6% and suggested the possibility of severe disease within the pediatric population [14] . Furthermore, there is a significant difference among the outcomes of children with COVID-19 receiving care in high-income countries versus low-and middle-income countries. In comparison to high-income countries, low-and middleincome countries report lower proportions of admissions to the ICU (9.9% vs. 26.0%), yet higher numbers of deaths (relative risk 2.14, 95% CI: 1.43 to 3.20) [9] . This suggests that more large-scale global studies are required to fully assess the extent of AKI in pediatric COVID patients. Although our study was able to accurately determine outcomes in COVID patients, one of the main limitations in our study was the sample size, as COVID and AKI incidence reports are still new. Due to a paucity of literature, it restricted us from doing a detailed analysis. Additionally, some studies presented insufficient data, forcing us to exclude them from our analysis despite meeting our inclusion criteria. It is also important to note that in our analysis, only studies with a sample size greater than 10 were included to remove the influence on outcome by studies with small sample sizes. ",
