The cumulative numbers of both infections and deaths quickly cross over from exponential growth at early times to a longer period of power law growth, before eventually slowing. In agreement with a recent statistical forecasting model by the IHME, we show that this dynamics is well described by the erf function. Using this functional form, we perform a data collapse across countries and US states with very different population characteristics and social distancing policies, confirming the universal behavior of the COVID-19 outbreak. We show that the predictive power of statistical models is limited until a few days before curves flatten, forecast deaths and infections assuming current policies continue and compare our predictions to the IHME models. We present simulations showing this universal dynamics is consistent with disease transmission on scale-free networks and random networks with non-Markovian transmission dynamics.",

The first approach is based on fitting this data to classical models from mathematical epidemiology such as SIR models, with various level of detail and complexity [2, 3] . A major advantage of this approach is that the dynamics of SIR models can be parameterized using only a few parameters, most notably R 0 , the average number of individuals that will be infected by an individual who has the disease [4, 5] . This allows for concrete predictions [6] and assessment of how mechanistic processes such as seasonal variation [7, 8] and social policies [9] affect disease dynamics. However, such mathematical models approaches also suffer from a number of drawbacks. Many of these models often assume well-mixed populations (with or without population structure), implicitly ignoring the effect of network and spatial structure [10, 11] . While many of these difficulties can be overcome by considering more refined models [12] [13] [14] , this requires access to detailed data that is often unavailable.",

A particularly prominent example of this are recent forecasts by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, made by fitting the number of deaths as a function of time using the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution (we will use the shorthand \"erf function\" for this functional form through out the manuscript) [15] . This approach has yielded tangible and sensible predictions and has been used to guide policy by state and national governments. However, unlike the mathematical models discussed above, it remains unclear why and when the erf function gives a good fit to disease dynamics. In particular, there is no mechanistic understanding of what epidemiological processes give rise to this fitting form or how to incorporate the effect of various interventions on disease propagation. Understanding the answers to these pressing questions is especially important given the significant role that these models are playing in guiding public policy.",

We show that this entire dynamics is well fit by the erf function, allowing us to perform a data collapse on dynamics across countries and US states. Surprisingly, this single functional form can capture the dynamics of disease progression in regions/countries with extremely different pop-ulation characteristics and social policies. Nevertheless, we show that it is difficult to make accurate predictions until a few days before infections peak. We compare and contrast our predictions to the IHME model and present plots integrating our predictions with the country-specific social stringency index compiled by Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker [16] . We show that the erf model follows naturally from considering transmission on social networks. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our results.",

Understanding this existing data is an essential prerequisite for adequately answering the urgent practical question about the expected results of relaxing current policies. The main contribution of the present analysis is to provide a unified framework for summarizing the characteristics of these dynamics in each country and showing that each timeseries can be represented by just two parameters. This provides a foundation for further analysis of how social policies, population characteristics and other factors affect the values of these parameters.",

These intervals are calculated under the assumption that the data is accurately described by the fitting function given in Eq. (1) below, with no changes in parameter values, and with all deviations from this function due to random multiplicative noise. The confidence intervals do not account for possible future changes in social policy, or for systematic deviations from the fitting function that may arise at late times. In particular, unlike prominent models such as those from the IHME, we make no attempt to model the effects of social policy on infections and deaths. Instead, we seek to understand the differences and similarities of disease spreading dynamics across countries given their current social policies. For this reason, these models are unable to answer questions about what would happen if a country adopted social policies that were dramatically different from those that are currently being pursued in our dataset.",

This is especially true of the test result data which depends on the availability of testing in each region as well as on government policies for administration of the tests. For this reason, we focus on fatality data in the main text, which is commonly taken to be more reliable. Nevertheless, the standards for attributing a fatality to COVID-19 vary significantly from region to region and over time, complicating the interpretation of these data sets as well. Despite this variation, the observed universal curves for both fatalities and cases indicate that meaningful information on the intrinsic disease dynamics can still be extracted from these reports for many countries.",

Since we were interested in universal dynamics, we only used times after the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the region exceeded 500 for infection data, or the cumulative number of fatalities exceeded 50 for death data (see Materials and Methods). We use these cutoffs to minimize the effects of stochastic fluctuations arising from small numbers of infected individuals at early times. We required at least 6 data points to remain in the time series after truncation in order to proceed with model fitting. This limited our analysis to 79 out of 322 total regions and countries in the global data, including 30 out of fifty US states. Since the data is updated daily, in all our analysis we limit ourselves to data up to April 15 (though the scripts can be rerun easily for the most current data set).

The left hand panels of Figure 1 show semi-log plots of cumulative deaths as a function of time for China, Italy, and Spain (see left panel of Fig. 10 for analogous panels for the number of confirmed cases). As expected, at early times the dynamics follow an exponential growth curve and are well fit by a straight line on the log-log plot.

The uncertainty estimation does not account for possible future changes in social policy, or for systematic deviations from the fitting function that may arise at late times. namics is well fit by the erf function (more precisely the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution) [15] . Surprisingly, the IHME found that the erf function yields much better fits to the data than a sigmoid (another saturating function) even though the sigmoid function is thought to be the natural \"mean-field\" description of disease propagation of homogenous social interaction networks [11, 17, 18] . Our initial data exploration confirmed this observation (data not shown) and for this reason we focused on fitting our full curves using the erf function suggested in [15] .",

Note that t h is also the time at which the rate of new fatalities/cases reaches its peak. In general, these parameters must be inferred directly from the data in each region or country one wants to make predictions about. Once the parameters are inferred, the disease dynamics under current social and policy conditions are fully specified, allowing for forecasting predictions under the assumption that conditions remain the same and there are no dramatic changes in social policy. Uncertainty in the values of the parameters naturally translates to uncertainty in predictions since small changes in these parameters can often result in very different final dynamics. A detailed description to the fitting procedure can be found in the Materials and Methods. In brief, the FIG. 3: Rescaling time and fatalities using fit parameters yields universal curve.

First, the IHME used a Generalized Linear Model with linking functions on the whole global dataset, while we directly fit each region independently. We make this choice because of the very different reporting strategies and criteria used by different governments and regions. Secondly, the IHME incorporates prior expectations about the disease dynamics into their model, by assuming (1) that the infection time scale \u03c3 of all countries and regions should be similar to that of Wuhan, China, and (2) that either the total number of fatalities N max or the interval t h \u2212 t 0 between the beginning of the infection and the peak time depend on the timing of social distancing. In contrast, our model makes no assumptions about the infection time scale and is agnostic about the effects of social distancing. It assumes as a given the spectrum of social policies adopted by various regions and countries whose time series we fit. Finally, to estimate error bars we make use of the fact that the Fisher Information (inverse Hessian of the cost function) for our cost functions are effectively onedimensional (see Material and Methods and Figure 5 ). This simplifies our calculations of confidence intervals.",

For this reason, it is extremely important to also provide uncertainty estimates when fitting the data. Figure 2 shows fits to the erf function with corresponding uncertainty intervals for countries with over 500 fatalities and the ten US states with the most deaths. Notice, that while the uncertainty for states and countries that are clearly deviating from the power-law growth behavior like Switzerland, and New York is small, the uncertainty is extremely high for countries and states like Sweden and Pennsylvania that are still showing power law growth in dynamics.

One powerful method for detecting universal dynamics that has its origin in the analysis of physical systems is the idea of a \"data collapse\" [19, 20] . Namely, by rescaling the y-axis (cumulative number of deaths or confirmed cases N ) and the x-axis (the time t in days) it should be possible to make the curves for all regions and countries lie on each other, indicating the existence of a universal curve that describes infection dynamics.",

This scaling results in a striking collapse of the data with all the curves lying on top of each other. This is true for all regions regardless of numerous details that differ be-tween regions including population density, population size, social distancing prescriptions, the start time, duration, and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak -though we emphasize that all countries shown in the top row had adopted some form of social distancing by the time of their fifth fatality.

Second, the collapse suggests that the primary effect of variations in policy and population characteristics is likely to modify these two parameters, especially N max . Finally, it implies that if we can fit these two parameters directly we should be able to make reasonable forecasts for how many cases we expect and how long it will take the disease to spread assuming current policies (or something similar) continue.

To gain a better understanding of when prediction becomes possible, we studied the model predictions for fatality dynamics in Italy, whose initial course of infection was nearly complete by April 15.

In contrast, our model is agnostic to any social distancing procedures or population characteristics and fits each region and country independently. For this reason, it reflects a more \"data-oriented\" approach that make no prior assumptions about COVID-19 disease dynamics, though it does assume that current social policies will continue until the fitting function saturates.

This surprising behavior is incompatible with many epidemiological models based on differential equations (e.g. SIR type models with or without population structure, compartments, etc.), and also with a variety of individual-based network models in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous networks [11, 12, 12, 25, 26] (see [27] for notable exception).

Consistent with this idea, recent evidence suggests that SARS2-COVID19 may exhibit considerable inter-individual heterogeneity [21] [22] [23] . To test this hypothesis, we performed simulations of disease spreading on social networks on scale free networks where the degree distribution p(k) take the form p(k) = 1 k \u03b3 .

An infected node infects a susceptible neighbor node at a time T g after being infected, where T g is edge-specific random variable drawn from a Gamma distribution with mean \u00b5 G and standard deviation \u03c3 G . This procedure is iterated until no new nodes can be infected (see Materials and Methods and corresponding Jupyter notebooks on our Github repository for details). Note that when \u00b5 G = \u03c3 G the Gamma distribution reduces to the exponential distribution and the dynamics is Markovian (i.e. memoryless). However, if \u00b5 G = \u03c3 G then the dynamics is Non-Markovian. Non-Markovian dynamics introduces additional time-scales into the problem and hence is much less studied than its Markovian counterpart [12] . Figure 8 shows the cumulative number of infected nodes as a function of time for simulated graphs with N = 5, 000 nodes. Simulations were performed for scale-free networks with \u03b3 = 2.5, 3.1 and Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi random networks with mean degree k = 2, 6, with both Markovian (\u00b5 G = \u03c3 G = 50) and non-Markovian (\u00b5 G = 50, \u03c3 G = 25) dynamics.

We find that the COVID-19 pandemic in all regions with sufficient data can be described by a universal curve where the cumula-tive numbers of both infections and deaths quickly cross over from exponential growth at early times to a longer period of power law growth, before eventually slowing. In agreement with a recent statistical forecasting model by the IHME, we show that this dynamics is well described by the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. Surprisingly, we find that the despite the enormous variation in region/state/country characteristics and social policy, the infection dynamics across all regions/countries analyzed can be characterized by two FIG. 8: Scale-free and Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi random networks can reproduce observed dynamics. Simulations of virus spreading on scale-free and Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi random networks with 5,000 nodes were performed as described in the main text and methods. Scale-free networks were sampled with degree distribution p(k) \u221d 1/k \u03b3 , while Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi networks were sampled with mean degree k , shown in each panel title. The time required for a node to infect its neighbor is sampled from a Gamma distribution with mean \u00b5G = 50. Non-Markovian dynamics were generated by choosing standard deviation \u03c3G = \u00b5G/2 = 25, while Markovian dynamics were generated by choosing \u03c3G = \u00b5G = 50 (because the Gamma distribution reduces to the exponential distribution when \u00b5G = \u03c3G). Left column is log-linear plot while right is log-log. Black line is a straight line to guide the eye. Orange line is fit to the cumulative normal given in Eq. (1).

In contrast, our model predicts 1,993 deaths (with confidence intervals between 1,302 and 5,366), with a peak time of April 14th.

We observed this basic phenomena in regions with extremely different population characteristics and social policies.

We simulated a generalized SIR model on a social interaction network G with both Markovian and non-Markovian waiting times for infection. Initially, N 0 nodes (usually 5 in our simulation) are designated infected. An infected node infects a susceptible neighbor node at a time T g after being infected, where T g is an edge-specific random variable chosen from the distribution governing generation times for infections. This procedure is iterated over multiple generations until no new nodes can be infected (i.e. all the nodes in the connected components of infected nodes are also infected). In our simulation, once a node is infected it cannot be reinfected either because the node joins the recovered population and is no longer susceptible or because the node dies. Our simulation makes no distinction between these possibilities and simply counts cumulative number of infected nodes as a function of time. We choose T g to be a Gamma distributed random variable with mean \u00b5 G and standard deviation \u03c3 G . This assures that T g > 0. This differs from most simulations where generation times are assumed to be memoryless and follow an exponential distribution. Memoryless dynamics can also be implemented in this framework by choosing \u03c3 G = \u00b5 G , since this parameter choice makes the Gamma distribution identical to the exponential distribution.",

Cumulative fatalities (blue points) versus time for three countries that passed their peak rate of new deaths before April 1, 2020. First two columns show the dynamics for 30 days after the day t0 when the number of cumulative fatalities first exceeded 5. The time axis in the first column is on a linear scale, while in the second it is logarithmic. Fatalities are shown on a logarithmic scale for both columns. Straight lines are included for reference, indicating an initial phase of exponential growth (straight line on log-linear plot) followed by a phase of power-law growth (straight line on log-log plot). Third column shows cumulative normal distribution, Eq. (1), fit to the entire timeseries (through April 15, 2020), on log-log axes.

Center: Same for all US states with more than 500 fatalities. Right: Same for all regions that qualified for fitting (including US states). The ends of the error bars in all panels lie at the joint upper and lower confidence bounds for the pair of parameters (Nmax and \u03c3 or Nmax and t h \u2212 t0). Parameter combinations compatible with the data should fall close to this line, as explained inFig. 9of the Methods. Note that most regions with fewer than 500 fatalities have extremely large error bars, in agreement with the discussion inFig. 4about the difficulty of inferring parameters until late in the epidemic progression. These large error bars do not always pass through the best-fit point since for these very poor fits the second dimension of the Fisher Information is no longer negligible.",
