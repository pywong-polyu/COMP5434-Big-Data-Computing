This paper contributes to fill this research gap by drawing on a multi-site case study in the Yucat\u00e1n region in Mexico. By applying regression analysis, the significance of the association between home garden diversity and food security is confirmed. Plant diversity is found to have a positive association with food consumption scores and the frequency of vegetable intakes. The number of animals used for food purposes is also found to have positive and significant associations with food consumption scores and frequency of meat intakes. However, the dimension and the significance of these positive associations were found to vary among communities and quantiles of the distribution of food security measures. In the households studied, younger individuals and better-educated people, males and Spanish speakers were more likely to engage in jobs in urban areas. Engagement in urban jobs was found to involve complementarities with the overall plant diversity of home gardens, but also trade-offs with the diversity of vegetables and other herbs used for food purposes and with the abundance of animals raised for food purposes.",

A later study on a similar programme in this country also identified positive effects on the production of leafy vegetables and diversity of vegetable consumption (Schreinemachers et al. 2015) . In rural Nepal, household production diversity, measured through the number of food groups produced, was positively associated with maternal dietary diversity, children's dietary diversity (aged 6-59 months) and children's weight-for-height z-scores (Malapit et al. 2015) . Additional evidence was found in the Philippines, where children from households with home gardens were (Cabalda et al. 2011 ). The patterns described above have also emerged in several studies in Latin America. In rural Guatemala, crop and animal species richness, from milpas, home gardens and coffee plantations, was found to be associated with higher dietary diversity (Luna-Gonz\u00e1lez and S\u00f8rensen 2018). In rural Mexico, positive associations were found between crop diversity and children dietary diversity (aged 24-58 months) (Dewey 1981) .",

Most of the studies that have found positive results also conclude that the relationship between planned agrobiodiversity and food security is complex and dependent on household and context characteristics (c.f. Jones et al. 2014; Luna-Gonz\u00e1lez and S\u00f8rensen 2018; Sibhatu and Qaim 2018; Zanello et al. 2019) . Additionally, a significant number of studies have found null or negative associations. From a review of 45 studies, Sibhatu and Qaim (2018) find that over 20% reported non-significant associations, while over 60% reported non-significant or negative results for sub-samples of the observations or after controlling the analysis for household and community characteristics. Sibhatu et al. (2015) also suggest that contributions of farm diversity to food security may diminish or even become negative when production diversity is already high.

These two regions represent different modes of engagement in agriculture and distinct urbanisation transitions. The sisal region takes its name from the former commercial production and processing of sisal (Agave sisalana Perrin\u00e9, henequ\u00e9n in Spanish and ki in Mayan), a type of agave used for textile purposes, an industry that saw its boom during the first decades of the twentieth century. This is the more urbanised region, with its heart located in M\u00e9rida, the capital city of Yucat\u00e1n. In contrast, the milpa, or maize-growing region, has been more isolated, and its residents' livelihoods are still highly attached to traditional agriculture. Within each region, the research sites studied represent different levels of urbanisation: Hocab\u00e1 (peri-urban, sisal region), Sahcab\u00e1 (semi-rural, sisal region), Yaxcab\u00e1 (semi-rural, milpa region) and Kancabdzonot (rural, milpa region).",

Hocab\u00e1 (peri-urban, sisal region) showed the highest proportion of households with borderline and acceptable food consumption, while Sahcab\u00e1 (semi-rural, sisal region) showed the lowest proportion of households in these categories (p value<0.10) ( Table 2) . Table 3 shows key characteristics of the households studied while Table 4 presents the results of the regression analysis between household food security measures (FCS and food intakes) and home garden diversity, as measured through plant species diversity and the abundance (number) of animals raised for food purposes. From the pooled regressions including the four communities the coefficient estimates suggest a positive association between plant species diversity and FCS, particularly at higher quantiles of the distribution and these quantiles overlap with the higher quantiles of the distribution of the wealth index. A positive association is also found between the number of animals raised for food purposes and FCS, but in this case in the lowest quantile, which represents the most vulnerable households. Regarding the frequency in the intake of vegetables, positive associations were found with plant diversity, but only from the probit regression. Positive associations were also identified between the abundance of animals and meat intake, from the probit regression and in the lowest quantile of the distribution. Table 5 shows the results from the regressions at the community level. The dimension and significance of the association between home garden diversity and food security measures vary across communities. In the peri-urban community positive associations are only found with plant species diversity, both for food consumption scores (across the whole distribution) and the frequency of vegetables intake. In the semirural communities, positive associations are found with both plant species diversity and abundance of animals, particularly in the lowest half of the distribution of food consumption scores. Finally, in the rural community, significant positive associations are only identified with plant diversity in the second quantile of the distribution of food consumption scores and between frequency of meat intake and abundance of animals.",

Larger effects were identified at the highest quantiles of the FCS distribution which grouped households that also tended to be wealthier. In contrast, the abundance of animals was more relevant in the lowest quantiles of the distribution of both FCS and the frequency of meat intake. These findings are relevant for the design and targeting of home garden interventions; while most of the households may benefit from increased access to inputs and training to grow vegetables, increased access to poultry and small livestock components are likely to result in greater impacts among the poorest households.",

This research identified that closer interactions with urban areas tend to increase the adoption of ornamental plants but also favour overall plant diversity levels in the most urbanised communities. Wiersum (2006) arrives at similar conclusions on the relationship between ornamental plants and off-farm jobs in a review of studies on Indonesian home gardens; he finds that, when alternative income opportunities emerged, households tended to increase the production of ornamental plants in their home gardens. However, this pattern is likely to reduce the resilience of the household in case of job loss as well as undermine the role of the home garden as a biocultural repository.",

            "text": "One of the main limitations of this study is its reliance on self-reporting measures of food security which are subject to recall errors. Nonetheless, the quality of the data collected was ensured through following international standards, such as those that the World Food Programme has established for the collection and analysis of the data to construct food consumption scores. In consideration of the high incidence of malnutrition in the region, both in form of undernutrition and overweight and obesity, future research could explore the role of home gardening interventions on nutrition status and the incidence of chronic diseases. The relevance of studying this topic has become apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected populations who suffer from obesity and chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension (Hernandez, 2020). Other areas for future research include the study of the contribution of home gardening to food security across different seasons and intrahousehold dynamics of food consumption, as well as the provision of non-tangible services, such as those social and cultural.",
