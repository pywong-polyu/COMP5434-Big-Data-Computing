However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 host receptors with the exception of ACE2. Furthermore, ACE2 alone cannot explain the multi-organ tropism of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting the involvement of other receptor(s). Here, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen 5054 human membrane proteins individually for interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein. Twelve proteins, including ACE2, ASGR1, and KREMEN1, were identified with diverse S-binding affinities and patterns. ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes distinct ACE2/ASGR1/KREMEN1 (ASK) receptor combinations to enter different cell types, and the expression of ASK together displays a markedly stronger correlation with virus susceptibility than that of any individual receptor at both the cell and tissue levels. The cocktail of ASK-related neutralizing antibodies provides the most substantial blockage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung organoids when compared to individual antibodies. Our study revealed an interacting host receptome of SARS-CoV-2, and identified ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as alternative functional receptors that play essential roles in ACE2-independent virus entry, providing insight into SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathogenesis, as well as a community resource and potential therapeutic strategies for further COVID-19 investigations.",

[3] [4] [5] SARS-CoV-2 is more than a respiratory virus, causing a complex array of symptoms and exhibiting multiorgan tropism. 2, 6, 7 Host cellular receptors play key roles in determining viral tropism and pathogenesis. Some viruses can bind to multiple host receptors for viral attachment, cell entry, and diverse specific host responses, including inducing cytokine secretion, stimulation of the immune responses, and alteration of virus budding and release. [8] [9] [10] [11] However, apart from ACE2, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Growing evidence suggest the involvement of other receptor(s) in SARS-CoV-2 host interactions. Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both share ACE2 as an entry receptor, the primary infection sites and clinical manifestations of these viruses exhibit significant differences. 1, 2, [12] [13] [14] [15] Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in tissues with little ACE2 expression, including the liver, brain, and blood, and even the lung, where only a small subset of cells express ACE2. 16, 17 Moreover, several large-scale single-cell transcriptome analyses of patients with COVID-19 revealed many virus-positive cells without ACE2 expression, 18, 19 suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might infect cells in an ACE2-independent manner. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of SARS-CoV-2interacting host receptome is needed.",

A total of 5054 human membrane protein-encoding genes (91.6% of the predicted human membrane proteins) were expressed individually on human HEK293E cells, and their binding with the extracellular domain of S protein (S-ECD) was measured ( Fig. 1a; Supplementary information, Table. S1). Twelve membrane proteins were identified that specifically interact with the S-ECD (Fig. 1b, c; Supplementary information, Fig. S1a ), including the previously reported ACE2 4,5 and SARS-CoV-specific CLEC4M (L-SIGN). 23 The dissociation constants (Kd) of these interactions ranged from 12.4 to 525.4 nM ( Fig. 1d ; Supplementary information, Fig. S1b ). ACE2 bound to S-ECD with a Kd of 12.4 nM, similar to the previously reported Kd of 15.3 nM, 24 and ACE2, CD207, CLEC4M, and KREMEN1 all showed high-affinity with the S protein, with comparable Kd values. The binding domains on the S protein, including the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 domain, were also examined. The RBD and NTD are the major binding sites for these membrane proteins. ACE2 only binds to the RBD, while CD207 and ERGIC3 bind exclusively with the NTD. The other proteins can bind to at least two domains, with CLEC4M, KREMEN1, and LILRB2 binding to all three domains, showing the highest binding with NTD, RBD, and RBD, respectively ( Fig. 1d; Supplementary information, Fig. S2 ). Overall, these receptor-like host factors showed diverse S-binding patterns, and they have a diverse range of biological functions and signaling properties (Supplementary information, Fig. S3 ).",

KREMEN1-expressing cells showed clear infection of SARS-CoV-2, as did ASGR1, although to a lower extent (Fig. 2a) . ACE2 did not bind with ASGR1 or KREMEN1 (Supplementary information, Fig. S4c ), further excluding the possibility that these two factors function through ACE2. Both KREMEN1 and ASGR1 are specific to SARS-CoV-2, whereas ACE2 mediates the entry of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 2a) . KREMEN1 and ASGR1 enabled efficient attachment of S-pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 particles to the cell surface (Fig. 2b) , and S protein was found to be co-localized with these two proteins after infection (Fig. 2c) . ASGR1-and KREMEN1-dependent virus entry was confirmed with patient-derived authentic SARS-CoV-2, with ASGR1 promoting higher levels of viral infection and progeny release (Fig. 2d-f; Supplementary information, Fig. S4d ). Thus, these results indicated that ASGR1 and KREMEN1 facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro.",

Compared to control mice, luciferase activity was significantly higher in the lungs of ASGR1-, KREMEN1-and ACE2-transduced mice, and S protein was observed to be co-localized with ASGR1, KREMEN1 and ACE2, separately (Fig. 2h, i) . Given that mouse Ace2 exhibits low S-binding activity to support efficient SARS-CoV-2 entry, 5, 25, 26 and similar findings were observed with mouse Kremen1 and Asgr1 (Supplementary information, Fig. S5 ), the above results indicated that human ASGR1 and KREMEN1 can mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry in vivo. For further confirmation, we challenged the transduced mice with authentic SARS-CoV-2. Although no significant difference in body weight was observed in hACE2-transgenic or Ad5-hACE2-transduced mice, 27,28 which might be due to the short time of infection and limited number of cells being transduced (Supplementary information, Fig. S4e , f), immuno-fluorescence results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was clearly detected in the lungs of ACE2-expressing mice, and also in ASGR1-and KREMEN1expressing mice, while low in control mice (Fig. 2j) . Consistently, the virus titers in the lungs of ASGR1-and KREMEN1-expressing mice were significantly higher than in control mice (Fig. 2k) . Taken together, these results demonstrated that ASGR1 and KREMEN1 are able to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry both in vitro and in vivo.",

Evidence indicates that the NTD is involved in the entry of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, [29] [30] [31] [32] suggesting that ASGR1 and KREMEN1 may play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We determined which domain(s) on KREMEN1 and ASGR1 are essential for S binding. KREMEN1 has three domains on its extracellular part, including Kringle, WSC and CUB domains, while there is one C-type lectin domain on that of ASGR1. Deletion of Kringle and WSC domains did not affect the S-binding activity of KREMEN1, which was abrogated by further deletion of the CUB domain, indicating that CUB domain is important for KREMEN1 to bind S protein (Fig. 3e) . C-type lectin domain is important for ASGR1 to bind S protein, and deletion of C-type lectin domain abolished the interaction of ASGR1 with S-ECD (Fig. 3f) . Because mouse Kremen1 and Asgr1 displayed low S-binding activities ( Fig. 3g; Supplementary information, Fig. S5 ), chimeric human KREMEN1 or ASGR1 was then constructed. Consistently, substitution of CUB domain, but not Kringle or WSC domain, to that of mouse homolog substantially reduced the binding of human KREMEN1 to S-ECD, so did the C-type lectin domain for ASGR1 (Fig. 3h, i) , further confirming that CUB domain on KREMEN1 and C-type lectin domain on ASGR1 are essential for these receptors to bind S protein.",

To verify this result, we treated the cells with two potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, Ab-414 and Ab-515, that we isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients 39 and that selectively interrupted the interaction of ACE2 with the S protein but had little effect on that of KREMEN1 or ASGR1 (Supplementary information, Fig. S7c ). The blocking patterns of Ab-414 and Ab-515 on SARS-CoV-2 entry are highly consistent with that of the ACE2 neutralizing antibody Y. Gu et al. (Fig. 4c ).

Six cell lines (including Calu-3, Calu-1, and Huh-7) were included in the ACE2-dependent group. The KREMEN1 and ASGR1 groups included HTB-182 and Li-7, respectively. NCI-H1944 and NCI-H661 belonged to the multiple receptor-dependent group, in which both ACE2 and KREMEN1 contribute significantly. Four lung cell lines that showed low sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 formed the undefined dependency group (Fig. 4a ). Among the 14 sensitive cell lines tested, high ACE2 or ASGR1 expression did not correlate with either of the receptors being needed for SARS-CoV-2 entry, whereas KREMEN1 expression and KREMEN1 dependence for viral entry were highly correlated ( Fig. 4e; Supplementary information, Fig. S7g ).

In virus-positive tissues, such as the brain, liver, peripheral blood (PB), and even lung, ACE2 expression is low or only detected in a small subset of cells [15] [16] [17] (Supplementary information, Fig. S10a, b) . To gain insights into the SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism, we modeled a systemic host-SARS-CoV-2 interaction based on the tissue distribution of ASK entry receptors. ACE2 and ASGR1 are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and liver, respectively, while KREMEN1 is broadly expressed throughout the body. In virus-positive tissues, we found that at least one of the entry receptors was expressed (Supplementary information, Fig. S10b ). ASK receptor expression levels were correlated with virus infection rates in different tissues identified in a recent biopsy study, 6 and the three receptors KREMEN1 and ASGR1 play essential roles in ACE2-independent SARS-CoV-2 entry. a, b Twenty-nine lung cancer cell lines and ten liver cancer cell lines were infected with or without S-pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. a Luciferase activities were measured 60 h post-infection (means \u00b1 SEM, n = 3). b Correlations of virus sensitivities with the combined ASK expression levels in the tested lung and/or liver cell lines (two-sided Pearson correlation analysis). c High SARS-CoV-2-sensitive cell lines (labeled red or purple in a) were infected with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of different ACE2-S-blocking antibodies (at a final concentration of 2 \u00b5g/mL). Luciferase activity relative to control antibody treatment was measured 60 h post-infection (means \u00b1 SEM, n = 3). d, e KD of ACE2, ASGR1 or KREMEN1 in the indicated cell lines followed by infection with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. Luciferase activity relative to control was measured 60 h post-infection and shown as a heatmap (d) (means \u00b1 SEM, n = 3). The logarithm of the effect of receptor shRNA-mediated KD on virus entry was correlated with the expression level of corresponding receptors (e) (two-sided Pearson correlation analysis). f KD of ACE2, ASGR1 or KREMEN1 in HTB-182 and Li7 cells followed by infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 1. Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene was examined in the cells 72 h post-infection by RT-qPCR (means \u00b1 SEM, n = 3). The statistical significance was evaluated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. together showed a markedly stronger correlation with virus susceptibility than any individual receptor (Supplementary information, Fig. S10c) , suggesting that the ASK receptors underlie SARS-CoV-2 tropism and can therefore better explain the multiorgan tropism of this virus.",

To this end, we developed monoclonal antibodies against ASGR1 and KREMEN1 and screened for their ability to block the interaction of the relevant receptor with the S protein. S23, an ASGR1 monoclonal antibody with a Kd of 0.12 \u00b5g/mL, and K33, a KREMEN1 monoclonal antibody with a Kd of 0.02 \u00b5g/mL, effectively blocked the binding of S-ECD to ASGR1 and KREMEN1, respectively (Fig. 6a, b; Supplementary information, Fig. S11a, b) . The ability of these antibodies to block SARS-CoV-2 was then evaluated. S23 and K33 selectively blocked the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into ASGR1-293T and KREMEN1-293T cells, respectively, and had no effect on irrelevant ASK receptorexpressing cells (Fig. 6c) . We also tested their efficacies in KREMEN1-dependent HTB-182 cells and ASGR1-dependent Li7 cells. S23 effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 entry into Li-7 cells, with an IC 50 of 4.25 \u00b5g/mL, K33 blocked virus entry into HTB-182 cells, with an IC 50 of 2.43 \u00b5g/mL, and both antibodies had no effect on ACE2-dependent virus entry (Fig. 6d, e; Supplementary information, Fig. S11c ). These results further confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 sensitivities of HTB-182 cells and Li-7 cells are dependent on KREMEN1 and ASGR1, respectively, and demonstrate that the neutralizing antibodies K33 and A23 can be used to selectively block KREMEN1-and ASGR1-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry.",

Overall,~0.1-0.8% of cells were infected, as indicated by the GFP + cells (Fig. 6g; Supplementary information, Fig. S11f ), comparable to the percentage of~0.1% observed in the upper respiratory tract of patients with COVID-19 (Fig. 5b) . Immunofluorescence data revealed that both ACE2-expressing and non-expressing cells could be observed simultaneously among the infected GFP + cells, and KREMEN1 or ASGR1 was detected in GFP + ACE2 \u2212 cells (Fig. 6f) . To verify these results, we infected lung organoids with authentic SARS-CoV-2, and observed both ACE2expressing and non-expressing cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, and detected KREMEN1 or ASGR1 in SARS-CoV-2 + ACE2 \u2212 cells (Fig. 6g) .

Ab-414 was the most effective, followed by K33 and S23 (Fig. 6h, i) , indicating that in human lung organoid, the ACE2 pathway is the major route for viral entry, and KREMEN1 and ASGR1 play important but more subsidiary roles. This finding is consistent with the results from our cell-line experiments and the scRNA-seq analysis of the airways of patients with COVID- 19 (Figs. 4, 5) . Compared with individual ASK antibodies, the ASK cocktail exerted a significantly higher inhibitory effect, providing the most substantial blockage of infection with either pseudotyped or authentic SARS-CoV-2, and the results were also observed in a second human lung organoid (Fig. 6h, i) .

The statistical significance was evaluated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. and Li7 cell lines to SARS-CoV-2 are ACE2 independent, being unaffected by neither ACE2 KD, ACE2 neutralizing antibody nor ACE2-S-specific blocking antibodies. Furthermore, cells without apparent ACE2 expression can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in lung organoids, and single-cell transcriptional analysis of COVID-19 patient airways revealed many virus-positive cells not expressing ACE2, 18 a phenomenon that also observed in a large-scale singlecell transcriptome atlas of COVID-19 patients. 19 Thus, the ACE2independent SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs in multiple conditions. KREMEN1 mediates virus entry into HTB-182 cells and ASGR1 into Li7 cells. Blocking KREMEN1 and ASGR1 both significantly reduce virus entry into either cell line or into lung organoids. When KREMEN1 and ASGR blocking antibodies are combined with ACE2targeting antibodies, the antibody cocktail displays a more potent blocking effect. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells via ACE2dependent and independent routes, and ASGR1 and KREMEN1 play important roles in ACE2-independent SARS-CoV-2 entry.",

In our functional screening of lung and liver cell lines, SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity was generally dependent on individual ASK entry receptors. In those cell lines that showed multiple receptor-dependent sensitivity, viral entry was found to principally require either ACE2 or KREMEN1. Together with virus susceptibility in COVID-19 airway epithelial and immune cells correlating with specific ASK receptors, it suggests that ASK entry receptors generally function independently of one another, and SARS-CoV-2 utilizes distinct ASK receptors to enter different cell types. The combined pattern of ASK expression displays a better correlation with viral sensitivity than any individual receptor in both cells and tissues. Indeed, the antibody cocktail blocking viral S protein interaction with ASK receptors blocked SARS-CoV-2 entry more effectively than individual antibodies in either cell lines or lung organoids, suggesting that the ASK receptors underlie SARS-CoV-2 multiorgan/cell tropism. Targeting ASK receptors simultaneously may offer a promising strategy to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

[46] [47] [48] The cells used in the assays, Huh-7.5 and A549-ACE2, depend on ACE2 for viral entry. It is therefore not surprising that ASGR1 and KREMEN1 were not identified as candidates in these screens. However, the host factors identified in these screens do raise questions as to whether they are involved in ASGR1-and KREMEN1-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry, and whether TMPRSS2, the protease essential for ACE2-dependent entry pathway, 3 is also required. AXL, CD147 and NRP1 were recently identified as receptors or receptor-like host factors that bind specifically to S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to facilitate or promote viral entry. [49] [50] [51] [52] Although they showed low S-ECD binding activities in our screen, which might be due to the differences between cell-based and Co-IP-based methods in detecting ligand-receptor interactions, the proved functions of these proteins indeed reflect the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the host receptome. Given the many entry-related host cell receptors involved, whether and how they cooperate to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the COVID19 pandemic need further study.",

Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is critical in taste bud cell renewal and behavioral taste perception, 58, 59 and KREMEN1/2 plus FUT8 are all negative regulators of this pathway. 33, 60 Loss of smell and taste has frequently been observed in COVID-19 patients, 61, 62 suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may act through these factors to affect Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and, therefore, promote taste loss.",

For scRNA-seq profiling of the upper airway tract of patients with COVID-19, the count, viral load and metadata were obtained from Magellan COVID-19 Data Explorer at https:// digital.bihealth.org. \u03c7 2 tests and Student's t-tests were performed to compare the receptor percentages and receptor expression values among different cell populations, respectively. The correlation analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software. All tests were two-sided, and a P value < 0.05 was designated to indicate significance.",
