            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly spread around the globe since December 2019. Due to the high transmission rate of this virus, it can affect vast number of people in a short time; and to this fact, there is an urgent need for a safe vaccine or therapeutic option for this viral infection. According to the pathological aspects and clinical stages of the disease, different classes of drugs have been used. They include antiviral agents, inflammation inhibitors, plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulins (Stasi et al., 2020; Bartoli et al., 2021) . The antiviral agents mainly focus on virus replication inhibition either by protease inhibition -preventing the Gag/Pol polyprotein cleavage-or by interfering with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase reaction; and they include Ritonavir-lopinavir, darunavir, Remdesivir, favipiravir, and ribavirin. Another possible approach is to block the virus entry path. The possible drugs that are capable of doing this are Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol. As the virus infection, in many cases, resulted in a severe inflammatory response, another option could be immunomodulatory agents. The other alternative is plasma-injected antibody therapy (Stasi et al., 2020; Bartoli et al., 2021; Wang and Guan, 2021) . Besides, the nucleic acid-based treatments can be offered as a potential co-treatment for coronaviruses due to their high target specificity. In this regard, siRNA inhibitors can act as powerful therapeutic agents to combat the ongoing outbreak. Unique sequences that target the virus genome and do not interfere with the human genome can be used for the design of siRNAs to target the virus (de Fougerolles et al., 2007) . These pre-designed siRNAs will target the viral RNA genome and its replication and terminate the proliferation of the virus (Dykxhoorn and Lieberman, 2006; Whitehead et al., 2009) . Wu et al. and Li et al. used a similar siRNA approach with the SARS-CoV-1 virus RNA and inhibited the expression of viral proteins in infected cells (Li et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2005) . They reported that upon the entry of the viral particles, direct interaction of viral RNA with introduced siRNAs within the upper airway epithelial cells resulted in degradation of viral RNA and blocked viral replication and the spread of SARS-CoV-1 particles (Li et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "For better therapeutic effects of potent siRNA-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors and to minimize the effect of any probable mutation in the virus genome, we designed six selective siRNAs by the Oligo.7 software (Molecular Biology Insights, Colorado, USA) (Rychlik, 2007) for most of the virus mRNAs to ensure better efficiency (Table 1 ). The siRNAs were then used as a mixture consisting of an equal amount of each siRNA duplex. These siRNAs were designed to be highly specific for the virus mRNAs and to have the least interaction with human RNAs, especially mRNAs. This specificity was evaluated using the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). The RNA sequence of the virus (\"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome\" (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2) was aligned with human RNAs and similar sequences were excluded to ensure that no human mRNA would be affected. To minimize the off-target possibility of the siRNAs these sequences were re-checked with the human mRNAs by the BLAST to ensure there were no possible similarities between the designed siRNAs and the human-based mRNAs. Finally, each siRNA was checked by the BLAST to find which strains of the virus could be targeted by each siRNA. Before testing the effect of the siRNAs on the proliferation of the virus, the effect of the siRNAs was tested on the normal unaffected Vero cells, obtained from the cell bank of the Pasteur Institute (Tehran, Iran), and their cell viability was compared with an untreated group. The cells To test the efficacy of the siRNAs, the Vero cells were cultured in two main groups: an untreated SARS-CoV-2 infected group (I), and a siRNAtreated infected group (T). The I group was infected by a mixture of serum of the affected patients at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 (Kim, 2020; Sheahan et al., 2020) . (All the individuals who donated serum signed consent forms.) Finally, the T group was infected in a similar condition; the only difference was that the siRNAs were added to the culture medium after infection, as a mixture with 10 mg/mL dosage (Kondratowicz et al., 2011) . Forty-eight hours after the infection, the cells were harvested and entered the RNA extraction process for further investigations. Finally, the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis was measured by qRT-PCR, which is one of the most accurate methods for this infection according to Carter et al. (2020) . The equal number of cells was counted before RNA extraction. Total RNA of each group was extracted and purified by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) respectively according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNase treatment was applied before the purification process to ensure the elimination of unwanted DNA contamination. An equal concentration of RNA (measured by Nano-Drop) was taken to the qRT-PCR reaction. As qRT-PCR is a promising method for detecting the quantity of this virus (Yan et al., 2020) , a TaqMan-based PCR set was performed using commercial primers and probes for SARS-CoV-2 by StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system. The sequence of the forward and reverse primers and the probe is as follows respectively. Forward 5 \u2032 -AAATTTTGGGGACCAGGAAC-3 \u2032 , reverse 5 \u2032 -TGGCAGCTGTGTAGGT-CAAC-3 \u2032 , and probe 5 \u2032 -FAM-ATGTCGCGCATTGGCATGGA-BHQ-3 \u2032 . Since there is no acceptable reference gene yet to normalize the Ct of the qRT-PCR for this virus, we decided to report the Ct values themselves according to Shen et al. (2020) .",

Therefore, it appears that siRNAs may in fact inhibit the prolifration of the virus.. Similar Ct values have recently been reported for patients with COVID. (Carter et al., 2020) . Additionally, since the siRNAs did not affect the normal proliferation of the Vero cells, using these molecules in the airway system could be a sensible option as a co-treatment for the SARS-CoV-2. In other words, siRNAs appear to inhibit virus replication likely by degradation of siRNA-associated mRNA.",

Furthermore, in this method, the exacerbation of symptoms and lung damage can be avoided as it provides a minimal induction of a proinflammatory antiviral cytokine response (Li et al., 2005) . Besides, the current drugs for COVID-19 are phase-dependent and they should be carefully prescribed (Stasi et al., 2020; Bartoli et al., 2021) ; however, due to the nature of the disease and the unstoppable replication process of the virus, siRNAs can be administered in any phase of the disease.",
