Although pulse oximeters are tested extensively in healthy volunteers under controlled settings, the 'working accuracy', that is, the real-world accuracy in patients in clinical settings can, at times, be suboptimal. Previous studies have suggested suboptimal accuracy of pulse oximetry in critically unwell intensive care unit patients, 4 and people with conditions such as sickle cell disease during vaso-occlusive crises, 5 which may be relevant given the high incidence of thrombotic disease in people with COVID-19. 6 The accuracy of pulse oximetry in these patients has also been identified as a potential contributing factor to apparent 'silent hypoxia' seen in COVID-19. 7 Cautions and potential limitations of pulse oximetry in COVID-19 have been highlighted, 3 8 and one study of 17 patients with COVID-19 on intensive care unit (ICU) suggested that SpO 2 does not reliably predict SaO 2 . 9 However, specific data on people with COVID-19 being stepped down to a non-ICU setting, or being transferred to another ICU, are lacking. Furthermore, anecdotal experience from our ICU, and others, suggests that pulse oximetry measurements (SpO 2 ) may not accurately reflect SaO 2 in patients with severe COVID-19, potentially bringing into question the appropriateness of the NHS guidance referenced above in our setting. This is particularly relevant for our patients who are being stepped down from our ICU onto non-ICU level wards, or during transfers of our patients to other ICUs, because in both of these situations, pulse oximetryderived SpO 2 would be used to monitor oxygen saturation and guide management.",

We included non-hypoxic adults with COVID-19 deemed clinically suitable to be managed in a non-ICU setting, or for ICU to ICU transfer. None of the patients stepping down to a non-ICU setting required ongoing cardiovascular support, or had a clinical indication to still have an arterial line, such as for cardiovascular or gas exchange monitoring purposes. However, in patients being transferred to another ICU, clinical indications for arterial lines remained, as such, a sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding this group. Four patients were excluded as they died on the ward, all other patients on the ward during this time were included. We extracted the final three paired SpO 2 and arterial blood gas SaO 2 measurements from the electronic patient record (Intellispace Critical Care & Anaesthesia, Phillips Healthcare) prior to stepping down to a less intensive ward, or before being transferred to another ICU. The sample size resulted from the time frame on which we were the clinical team on the ward. The use of three paired samples per patient aimed to increase the number of samples included, given that the total number of patients was relatively small, and to give us some indication of the variation in measures in individual patients. An adjustment was made in the analysis regarding having multiple samples from each patient.",

The manufacturer recommendations from Masimo indicate that under normal operation, no internal adjustment or recalibration of the pulse oximeter is required for this model.

Of note, mean pH of blood gas samples was 7.46 (SD 0.05); mean temperature at time of sample 36.88\u00b0C (SD 0.63); mean methaemoglobin 1.00% (SD 0.50); and carboxyhaemoglobin 1.50% (SD, 0.42). Of note, the accuracy value, where accuracy = \u221a (bias 2 + precision 2 ) for our measurements is 2.44%, which lies outside of the manufacturers' reported laboratory testing accuracy value of 1.79% for SpO 2 between 70% and 100%. 14 However, some difference between our study and the laboratory testing values is to be expected, given the higher levels of control possible in a laboratory setting, differences in study population characteristics, and for their assessment, paired measurements are likely to have been completely simultaneous. Importantly, this value lies within the acceptable range for FDA approval of \u22643.0%. 3 Samples from the same patient have the same marker. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted, considering only people stepped down to a non-ICU ward (excluding those transferred to another ICU), for which the results were materially unchanged, with a bias of 0.8%, limits of agreement of 5.3% (upper limit) to \u22123.7% (lower limit).",

Additionally, having allowed up to 15 min between SpO2 and SaO2 is likely to have contributed, as even in the absence of changes to other parameters (probe position, FiO2, ventilation parameters), fluctuations to oxygen saturation occur. 3 However, it is probable that in certain situations, pulse oximetry-derived SpO 2 will not be deemed sufficient to guide clinical management and that SaO 2 assessment may be required.",

            "text": "Certain limitations and considerations are important to mention. First, although we applied stringent criteria to the selection of paired SpO 2 and SaO 2 recordings, we allowed up to 15 min between measurements, as such, paired measurements were not all taken precisely the same time. Oxygen levels can fluctuate over time, 3 hence these natural fluctuations are likely to be one of the factors contributing to differences seen between measurements. However, as the purpose of this study is to identify the levels of agreement between SpO 2 and SaO 2 as assessed in clinical practice, accepting up to 15 min between the two assessments is representative of 'real world' clinical practice, in which these measures are unlikely to be taken at precisely the same time. Even so, further research comparing simultaneous SaO 2 and SpO 2 values is required before firm conclusions regarding accuracy of oximetry can be made. Second, the SpO 2 and SaO 2 measurements evaluated here were all \u226591%. Commercially available pulse oximeters are calibrated using healthy volunteers across a range of arterial saturations, some as low as 60%, but it is recognised that accuracy reduces at lower saturations. In these patients, it is likely that blood gas sampling would be required anyway. Peripheral vasoconstriction, due to hypothermia or vasopressor use, may also impair the pulse oximeter, but our sensitivity analysis in patients who were deemed well enough to leave ICU (and so were unlikely to be suffering from this issue) reveals the same result. Central temperature recording from patients at the time of sampling were not excessively abnormal. Additionally, given that Masimo have reported comparable accuracy data even in poorly perfused and moving patients at SpO 2 values far lower than those demonstrated on our own ward, 14 this likely mitigates many of these concerns.",

However, such questions would be of interest for future research, including studies comparing patients with other (non-COVID-19) diagnoses stepping down from ICU. Fourth, given our study population, extrapolation of these findings to patients with COVID-19 in other settings requires extreme caution. The data included in this evaluation came from patients who had been extremely unwell, many requiring ECMO, with a high burden of thromboembolic complications.

Of note, these concerns have arisen with the use of a market-leading pulse oximeter, further drawing into question the accuracy of older or lower quality devices. Consequently, these findings should prompt research into the accuracy of pulse oximetry in different subgroups of patients with COVID-19 and using different models of pulse oximeter, particularly given the current NHS England advice 2 and the widespread use of pulse oximetry for the purposes of monitoring patients in the community, assessment of disease severity and requirement for hospital admission.",

In such patients, SpO 2 remains a valuable tool for clinical assessment but should be interpreted with caution. Arterial blood gas assessment of SaO 2 may still be required depending on the clinical context. Future research studies should assess the accuracy of pulse oximetry in other groups of patients with COVID-19, and patients stepping down from ICU with other (non-COVID-19) conditions to assess what factors are responsible of any differences found between methods of assessment.",
