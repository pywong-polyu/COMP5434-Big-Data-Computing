Hygieia and Panacea are goddesses of hygiene and panacea (i.e. cure-all), respectively.",

Just because Zeus's mistress name and country name are the same, in the form of plague, the curse of the goddess Hera spread throughout the country, Aegina. Symptoms of the patients suffering from the disease were as follows [2] : 'At first the cheek was flushed, and the breath drawn with difficulty. The tongue grew rough and swelled, and the dry mouth stood open with its veins enlarged and gasped for the air. Men could not bear the heat of their clothes or their beds, but preferred to lie on the bare ground, and the ground did not cool them, but on the contrary, they heated the spot where they lay' (Figure 1 ). It reveals the pain of patients suffering from high fever, and this figure overlaps with those of patients currently suffering from COVID-19. The following phrase, inter alia, describes the sacrifice of physicians in the story about plague of Aegina, is mournful and moving [3] : 'Nor could the physicians help, for the disease attacked them also, and the contact of the sick gave them infection, so that the most faithful were the first victims'. It also overlaps with front-line doctors who are struggling against COVID-19.",
