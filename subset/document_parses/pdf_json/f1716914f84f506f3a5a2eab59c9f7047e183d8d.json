            "text": "COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, China on the late December 19 with fever, cough, and myalgia as the most common symptoms. 1 The disease manifests in varying degrees from mild to severe and may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2 In current cases, the fatality rate of COVID-19 varies between countries, although the exact number of mortality rate remains unknown, due to the number of asymptomatic cases. 3 Within only a few months, the pathogen had spread all over the world and contributed to a 3-5% of mortality. 4 By the end of March 2020, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of COVID-19 in Indonesia was 8.9%. This is higher than the mean CFR all over the world. 5 Radiological examination is reported to play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. A systematic review of case series with a total of 919 patients in China and Korea suggested that chest X-ray (CXR) may not be reliable for diagnosing COVID-19 in its early stage. Only in its intermediate and severe stages is when COVID-19's feature of the lungs is seen on CXR. The British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) suggested chest radiography to all seriously ill patients (oxygen saturation <94%, National early warning score (NEWS) >3) and if \"clinically required\". 6 On the other hand, chest computed tomography (CT) could provide a more accurate identification of severe lung diseases in COVID-19 with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 94%. 7 Although chest-CT is more sensitive and specific than CXR, interpreting CXRs had always been a routine practice for clinicians to rule out other causes of respiratory disease. 8 The lack of CT-scans and radiologists, especially in developing countries such as Indonesia, makes CXR a great substitute to diagnose and determine the severity and progression of lung abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. 9 The currently established CXR scoring systems are Brixia and Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scoring systems. Brixia scoring system has been widely used as a tool to monitor the severity and progression of COVID-19 pneumonia in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan and Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale, Spedali Civili of Brescia, Italy. 10 [11] [12] [13] One of the important differences between the two scorings is that RALE can be done by a general practitioner due to its simplicity, while Brixia is designed to be used by a trained radiologist. The RALE scoring system only divides the lung into two regions, making it not specific to smaller lesions. 14 Seeing the current conditions regarding the lack of distribution of trained radiographers and radiologists in Indonesia, we proposed a CXR scoring system for evaluating the severity of COVID-19 patients in Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia. A modified scoring system has been adopted from Brixia and RALE scoring systems, and has been made to adjust to the needs and resources of Dr. Soetomo General Hospital Surabaya, Indonesia. This scoring system is aimed to be applicable to mild pneumonia cases and provide a faster and more accurate analysis. This study aims to determine the value of scoring systems through CXR imaging in evaluating the severity of COVID-19.",

Each lung is scored from 0 to 4 each; score 0 for no involvement, 1 for less than 25% involvement, 2 for 25%-50% involvement, 3 for 50-75% involvement, and score 4 for more than 75% involvement. The maximum score for RALE scoring is 8. 14 The Modified Chest X-ray Scoring System calculated the score or severity from the posteroanterior and anterior projection of CXR by dividing the lungs into 6 regions. Two lines divided the lung horizontally, resulting in each lung into having 3 regions, as shown in (Figure 1 ). Each region was rated 0 to 2 based on the lesions; score 0 if there is no involvement, 1 if infiltrates or consolidations are less than 50%, and 2 if infiltrates or consolidations are more than 50%. The maximum score for the Modified Chest X-ray scoring system is 12. The final scores were then classified further into mild (score 1-4), moderate (score 5-8) and severe (score 9-12).

CXR may not be as sensitive as CT, but it still plays a major role in developing countries that lack more sophisticated modalities. Moreover, CXR can be brought to the patient's bedside, minimizing the risk of crossinfections. 15 Although CXR has a low sensitivity to earlystage disease of COVID-19, it can be used for monitoring the advancement and preceding stages of COVID-19 especially in critical care. 16 Signorino et al stated that Brixia score system to be a good scoring system that provided detailed presentation and distribution of the lung (6 regions) and a sensibility (4 levels). 17 Borghesi et al also stated that Brixia scoring is a very useful method for ranking the stratification risk of patients with COVID-19 infection based on the severity of cases. 10 However, Brixia scoring requires a trained radiologist to interpret a CXR, due to its more complex indicators and nature for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia. This could be an obstacle for primary healthcare physicians who require an accurate and simple technique for early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, but lack the knowledge and experience to do so. Meanwhile, RALE scoring can predict supplemental oxygen requirements and the need for ICU admission for mechanical ventilation. 15, 18 Compared to Brixia, RALE scoring lacks a detailed and more complex indicator in scoring chest x-rays to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. We introduced the use of the Modified Chest X-ray Scoring System at Dr. Soetomo Academic General Hospital and compared it with the established Brixia and RALE scoring systems.",
