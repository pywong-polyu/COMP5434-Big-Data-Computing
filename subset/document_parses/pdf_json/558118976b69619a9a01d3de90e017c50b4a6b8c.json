Care and different types of nursing positions are potential sources of stress for nurses because not only do they have to cope with an ever-expanding workload, but they also must follow pandemic-related health and safety protocols while protecting themselves and their families. In the COVID-19 period, like any other pandemics, nurses are concerned about their own and their families' health because they are at high risk of contracting deadly viruses. They also face stress, anxiety, fear and dilemmas because they are ethically responsible for providing quality care, no matter the circumstances (Cai et al., 2020; Kim & Choi, 2016) . Lin et al.

Furthermore, far too many nurses have contracted the virus. Therefore, operating room nurses have been assigned to units outside their primary service lines and have performed tasks outside their scope of practice since the onset of the pandemic. Most studies on pandemics are epidemiological studies that focus on prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment.

Participants working with patients who did not take a COVID-19 test reported 1.86 times as much anxiety as those working with patients who took a COVID-19 test because the former were more afraid of transmitting the virus to their families (p < .05).

Research shows that nurses do not pay much attention to self-care and that managers do not address it or try to promote it(Halcomb et al., 2020;Hofmeyer & Taylor, 2021;Hofmeyer et al., 2020). Nurses who have difficulty maintaining self-care are more likely to experience stress, anxiety and burnout(Hossain & Clatty, 2020; Liu et al., 2020a Liu et al.,  ,2020b. Nurses have been assigned to units outside their primary service lines and have had longer shifts since the onset of the pandemic. On the one hand, they have to treat an increasing number of patients with COVID-19, and on the other hand, they have to protect themselves and their families from the virus. This adversely affects their well-being and, therefore, the quality of the care they provide to patients. However, nurses alone cannot always maintain physical and psychological well-being.",
