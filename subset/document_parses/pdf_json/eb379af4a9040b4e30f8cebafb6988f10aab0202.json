Autoptic findings usually reveal variable degrees of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD): Acute-phase DAD (during the first week after the pulmonary injury) usually shows exudative features with interstitial widening, formation of intra-alveolar edema, thickened alveolar septa, and perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, while in late-phase (one to several weeks) DAD proliferative features prevail with pneumocyte hyperplasia inducing interstitial thickening and collapsed alveoli, which may finally develop into organizing patterns (weeks to months), with marked fibroblastic proliferation and fibrosis, sometimes even leading to squamous metaplasia [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Even though the DAD pattern is not found exclusively in COVID-19, exudative or proliferative DAD development is a key pathophysiological mechanism in lung injury induced by SARS-CoV-2.",

Endothelialitis, due to direct damage by SARS-CoV-2 and to multiple factors such as local/systemic inflammatory response and hypoxia, also leads to switching to a procoagulant phenotype of injured endothelial cells. Hence, it promotes the so-called immunothrombosis, leading to macrothrombosis (e.g., pulmonary embolism) and microthrombosis, often detected in autoptic samples [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .

            "text": "Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a marked hyperinflammatory response resulting in a cytokine storm, with dysregulated production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), resulting in significant lymphopenia, C-reactive protein increase, and a profound vascular dysfunction. Both direct and immunemediated endothelial injury may act as procoagulant triggers, resulting in hypercoagulability and thromboinflammation, which lead to intra-alveolar activation of coagulation and thrombin generation [26] . The extensive endothelial damage is marked by increased D-dimer levels and increased incidence of venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism [27] . In fact, postmortem findings of COVID-19 patients revealed diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion, thrombosis of pulmonary capillaries, small arteries < 1 mm, midsized arteries, and pulmonary thromboembolism suggesting systemic endothelial dysfunction [4, 28] . These features may explain the peculiar mechanoelastic properties of Fig. 3 Heatmap of histopathologic patterns of the studied subjects. Patients on the right (n = 27) had no full clinical data: 18 came from other hospitals, three came directly from home, and six were emergency department patients. They differed from patients on the left in the extension of early proliferative DAD, AFOP, interstitial pneumonia, late proliferative DAD, bronchopneumonia, thrombi, megakaryocytes, and normal lung areas (see Additional file 1: Table S2 ). Only nine patients in the group on the right were admitted to ICU; the remaining died in medical wards or ED. Although in the group on the right clinical data are missing, the exposure to PPV and PEEP is presumptively different from the patients considered in the analysis (group on the left) on which 43 out of 48 subjects underwent to mechanical ventilation. The column on the right shows the histopathologic score (see methods in the text) Overall, patients with no clinical data (n = 27) had a short LOS in hospital because three died at home and six shortly after emergency department access. Moreover, only nine of them (33.3%) were admitted to ICU and underwent mechanical ventilation. Cluster labels are indicated by the circled numbers the respiratory system in COVID-19 ARDS, which at presentation is characterized by higher compliance than other kinds of ARDS [29] . Interestingly, we did not find any significant correlation between peak airway pressure or elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels and specific histopathologic findings in our series. However, cumulative PEEP during the hospital stay was positively correlated with late proliferative DAD and it was higher in cluster 3, which was characterized by prevailing early and late proliferative DAD. These findings could be explained by the relevance not only of the inflammatory (and procoagulant) macro-and microenvironment per se at baseline, but also of the prolonged interplay of such inflammatory factors with protracted exposure to positive pressures and mechanical ventilation (the latter carrying benefits but also potentially harmful effects on lung tissues). 6 Clinical (left) and histopathologic (right) characteristics of the clusters. Continuous variables were z-transformed (each distribution has mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1) and then plotted to a common axis. Values are shown as means and SD. LOS-H, length of stay in hospital; PPV days , days on positive-pressure ventilation (CPAP and/or mechanical ventilation); mPEEP TOT , mean positive end-expiratory pressure during PPV; cPEEP PPV , cumulative PEEP, during PPV; symptoms-to-H, interval between symptoms onset and hospital admission; N/L ratio, ratio between neutrophils and lymphocytes at specialized ward admission It is intriguing that patients who died soon after the onset of respiratory failure showed a trend to more diffuse areas of normal lung, probably due to less prolonged exposure to the cytokine storm and therapeutic interventions such as positive-pressure and mechanical ventilation. The significantly lower representation of proliferative DAD in these rapidly worsening patients is consistent with results obtained from antemortem lung biopsies [30] . Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between steroid use and cluster 3 at the univariate analysis. This result is unexpected and elicits several considerations and hypotheses: A selection bias cannot be excluded. During the first pandemic wave, this treatment did not still represent the \"standard of care\" and was often administered as rescue therapy in very compromised patients. Moreover, the low fraction of patients who received steroids (29.2%) and a non-standardized use of such therapy (as regards timing and dose) during the first COVID-19 outbreak should be taken into consideration when interpreting these correlations. Therefore, these results require further confirmation.",

Our findings derive from autopsies conducted during the first pandemic wave in Italy, when steroid use was inconstant and probably delayed in the course of the disease. However, the proportion of patients undergoing such a treatment strategy is not-negligible, and some patients (25%) who were not administered steroid treatment received tocilizumab, a therapeutic strategy that has been a matter of debate in severe COVID-19 and whose impact on lung tissues is still only partially understood.
