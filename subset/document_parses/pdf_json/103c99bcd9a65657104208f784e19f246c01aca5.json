Given the heterogeneous patient population coursing through any radiology department, definitions of how to categorize patients into non-suspect, suspect, and confirmed COVID-19 cases allow ground staff to understand which patients they can use standard precautions on versus those that require enhanced measures and additional personal protective equipment. In the earlier days of the outbreak, it was much easier to risk stratify patients; symptomatic patients with recent travel to Hubei Province or with occupational exposure to Chinese tourists were deemed at risk for COVID-19. With the recent global explosion of cases in Europe and America with known community spread, it is becoming more challenging to categorize patients into different risk categories and there may be a time in the near future when anybody coming into the radiology division may well be a possible COVID-19 case, and sustainable enhanced universal precautions are likely to become the \"new normal.\"",

We ultimately made the difficult decision of indefinitely postponing selected staffs' leave to ensure there was adequate manpower on the ground. Further, we segregated into 2 to 3 functional teams, so in the case of a quarantine situation disabling 1 functional subunit, the other team could independently carry on the needs of the radiology division [5] . Splitting into smaller subunits admittedly has taken a toll on some of staff. Even prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we were generally short staffed of radiographers, and their longer 12-h shifts during this outbreak has been a challenge. Fig. 1 a Total radiology workload, 2019 vs 2020. We have made a conscious effort to reduce our workload to deal with the increased operational demands and potential surges in patient load during this outbreak period. Since our first COVID-19 case, our workload has decreased by approximately 25% compared to last year. b COVID-19-related chest x-ray workload, 20 January to 15 March 2020. Our COVID-19 suspect chest x-ray workload has dramatically increased, largely related to an interim change in suspect case definition from recent travel from China to any recent travel from abroad How have our daily radiology operations been affected? For non-suspect COVID-19 patients, we continue to use our pre-pandemic standard precautions, ensuring surface cleaning of patient contact points with standard anti-microbial wipes, such as the x-ray buckys, ultrasound probes, and CT couches after each patient. Strict hand hygiene practices are already part of our normal pre-pandemic routine; our only additional measure is that all our patient-fronting staff wear surgical masks. Our daily throughput for this group of patients have not been affected.",

However, PCR testing may not be sensitive enough to exclude COVID-19, and many patients may need radiological investigations prior to disease confirmation [6, 7] . To image these patients, we have taken additional safety measures at the expense of patient throughput. For general radiography and ultrasound, we have leveraged upon the use of portable examinations to minimize patient movement. For examinations, we lack portable capability for, including MRI and CT, carefully planned routes of transportation ensure minimal spread of pathogen and contact with personnel [4] . Simulation of these transfers have helped identify gaps in the process and should be carefully rehearsed. Further, as far as possible, we have performed examinations for all suspect or confirmed cases in negative pressure CT and MRI rooms, installed in response to our previous 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic, and use full personal protective equipment [8] . Meticulous vetting of examinations is being made to ensure examinations are being done appropriately and add value to patient care [4] . Decontamination for portable x-ray machines includes surface cleaning to the entire machine with standard anti-microbial wipes. Our CT procedure for COVID-19 patients includes wrapping potential contact areas (gantry, couch, injector controls) with plastic covering; after the plastic is removed, we use standard anti-microbial wipes to clean the machine, and then proceed with terminal cleaning and UV-C irradiation to the scan room. The decontamination process for portable x-ray and CT takes 20 min and 90 min, respectively.",
