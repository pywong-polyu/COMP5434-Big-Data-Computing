Therefore, we divide the state of infected into states of medical care of increasing intensity, which depend on the severity of symptoms. These additional states include hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU), ventilation and intubation. Our analysis of COVID-19 infections in Ontario is based on daily records of 18,722 individuals who were diagnosed with COVID-19 over the period of 104 days between January 23 and May 5, 2020, and reported in the Public Health Ontario (PHO) database of combined records from integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) and Toronto Public Health Coronavirus Rapid Entry System (CORES).",

The aggregated data do not allow us to disentangle the possibly multiple sources of this non-stationarity, such as the nonstationary propagation of the pandemic with an exponential increase in the early phase, the effect of disease detection that depends on the reliability and availability of tests and the efficiency of treatment for COVID-19. The latter one can improve over time as a result of advancement of knowledge about the disease or worsen as a result of shortages of medical staff and equipment. Figure 3 shows the daily counts of patients under medical care and can be compared with figure 1 (ICU, hospitalization) in Public Health Ontario (2020a, p. 3), which is based on a shorter sampling period ending on April 22 (or with figure 2 in Public Health Ontario 2020c). We observe that the peak of the curve depends on the sampling period. The timing of that peak seems to be, approximately, April 1 in figure 1 of Public Health Ontario (2020a) and April 11 in figure 3. This difference is likely due to a truncation bias. This bias is discussed in section 2.3 and adjusted for by considering the state transitions instead of \"crude\" counts. Figure 4 presents changes in daily counts displayed in figure 3 . These patterns can be compared with figure 3 in Aguerragibiria et al. (2020) , which illustrates observations recorded over a period ending on April 22. The difference between the patterns displayed in the two figures seemingly confirms a misleading effect of truncation. Nevertheless, both figures reveal daily fluctuations due to the fact that the counts of individuals under medical care are determined by both the entry and exit effects.",

Depending on the severity level, 25% of individuals spend more than 8.5 days in level v 1 , 16.5 days in level v 2 and 14.5 days in level v 3 (see online appendix B2, 6). We observe a similar pattern in the mean duration with 6.6 days in level v 1 , 11.8 days in level v 2 and 9.1 days in level v 3 . The decrease of the number of days between levels v 2 and v 3 reveals that a higher effort in medical care increases the probability of survival. The conditional sojourn time distributions are valid state by state and have to be used with caution for inference on joint transitions. It is unlikely that an individual transitioning through states of H, ICU and T has an expected time of medical care equal to the sum of average times in H, ICU and T. There may exist a complicated negative or positive dependence between the sojourn times in the successive states. A patient with a severe condition may stay for a short time in ICU and a long time in T. Such complicated dependencies are better captured by means of a duration dependent transitions model (see section 4) than by an analysis of the joint distribution of sojourn times. Nevertheless, the correlation between the duration in H before exit to ICU and the duration in ICU before exit to Intubation is \u22120.128, the correlation between duration in ICU before exit to Intubation and duration in Intubation before Death is \u22120.233.

In Toronto, patients are more likely to receive more intense care sooner and the intensity of medical care keeps increasing at a faster pace until the death or recovery. This could be because of a higher rate of beds equipped for tracheal intubation procedures in Toronto (see Gourieroux et al. 2021 for endogenous patient assignments). More specifically, in Toronto, a patient spends on average one day less under ventilation and moves sooner to state T of Intubation, compared with the rest of the GTA (tables 3 and 4). Moreover, in Toronto, patients are more likely to die in states T of Intubation than in the rest of the GTA (figure A5), where patients die more frequently from states ICU and V of Ventilation. The probability of dying while in state T increases over sojourn time and is higher in Toronto on each day, compared with the rest of the GTA (figure A5).

Figure B1 documents the good fit of the duration dependent transition model to the data and the satisfactory predictive power of the model. The model predicts, as expected from figure 3, higher than recorded medical state counts over the last part of the sampling period until May 5. Online appendix figure B2 plots the fitted and the observed number of cumulative deaths. The figure shows that the total cumulative death count is accurately predicted. The figures confirm that the model provides an adjustment for right truncation and reporting lag. As mentioned earlier, the data suffer from a right truncation bias and a lag in reporting that start around day 80 (April 11) of the observational period and generate decreasing patterns of daily counts, found ex post incompatible with the publicly available counts provided later by the PHO.
