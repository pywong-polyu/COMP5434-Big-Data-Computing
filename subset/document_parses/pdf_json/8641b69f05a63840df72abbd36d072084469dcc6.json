This study was undertaken using Straussian grounded theory to address the question: \"What are healthcare providers' perspectives on training current and future HCPs in compassion?\" Methods: Fifty-seven HCPs working in palliative care participated in this study, beginning with focus groups with frontline HCPs (n = 35), followed by one-on-one interviews with HCPs who were considered by their peers to be skilled in providing compassion (n = 15, three of whom also participated in the initial focus groups), and end of study focus groups with study participants (n = 5) and knowledge users (n = 10). Results: Study participants largely agreed that compassionate behaviours can be taught, and these behaviours are distinct from the emotional response of compassion. They noted that while learners can develop greater compassion through training, their ability to do so varies depending on the innate qualities they possess prior to training. Participants identified three facets of an effective compassion training program: self-awareness, experiential learning and effective and affective communication skills. Participants also noted that healthcare faculties, facilities and organizations play an important role in creating compassionate practice settings and sustaining HCPs in their delivery of compassion. Conclusions: Providing compassion has become a core expectation of healthcare and a hallmark of quality palliative care. This study provides guidance on the importance, core components and teaching methods of compassion training from the perspectives of those who aim to provide it-Healthcare Providers-serving as a foundation for future evidence based educational interventions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The ability to provide compassion has become an expected core competency for healthcare providers (HCPs), mandating the need to understand, develop and evaluate training opportunities for the provision of compassion [1] [2] [3] [4] . While the topic and feasibility of how to train HCPs to provide compassion is contentious, patients feel it is not only possible, but necessary [5] . Despite this endorsement, there are challenges to developing compassion training programs-including a lack of conceptual clarity, a lack of clinical research measuring the impact on patient care, and limited training on skills and behaviours associated with compassion. Recent research has shown that compassion is a dynamic, individualized and complex construct that stems from innate virtues of the healthcare provider. It is conveyed through relational communication, an in-depth understanding of the person and a range of clinical behaviours that are not conducive to a strict didactic approach or rote learning [6, 7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 219, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 220, "end": 223, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 224, "end": 227, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 228, "end": 231, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 378, "end": 381, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1003, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1006, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Compassion has been simply defined as a response to the suffering of others that motivates the desire to alleviate it [8] ; however, the provision of compassion is complex, involving a broad range of qualities, skills and behaviours which together focus on the alleviation of suffering [1] . These include: acting with warmth and understanding [1, 6, 7] , providing personalized care [1, 6, 7, 9] , acting toward a patient the way you would want them to act toward you [1] , providing encouragement [1, 6, 7, 9] , communicating effectively [9] , and acknowledging a patient's emotional issues [1, 6, 7, 10] . Importantly, compassion requires HCPs to engage suffering on both a personal and professional level, using interpersonal skills to care for patients and intrapersonal skills to care for themselves as caregivers [6, 7] . While patients and HCPs agree that compassion involves a multitude of skills and behaviours, they need to be coalesced with virtues such as love, genuineness, acceptance and kindness to be considered compassionate, suggesting that the cultivation of virtues is a key, albeit challenging, component of compassion training [5, 6, 9] . The complexity and multiple domains of compassion are embedded within the following definition of compassion, which will be used herein-a virtuous and intentional response to know a person, to discern their needs, and ameliorate their suffering, through relational understanding and action [7] .

In part, this was due to a recognition that compassion training was dependent on the innate qualities, life experience and interpersonal skills that individuals possess prior to training. In relation to the HCP compassion model (Fig. 1) , this suggests that the themes of virtues, presence and intent within the Virtuous Intent domain, which function as motivators of compassion and distinguish it from routine care, are best cultivated through contemplative practices-whether in terms of a personal practice or by reflecting intentionally on HCPs clinical practice. As such, participants in this study felt that while baseline compassion aptitude varies, learners can enhance the innate qualities and the affective and relational components of compassion through three areas of training: selfawareness, experiential learning and effective and affective communication skills. Action aimed at alleviating the suffering of an individual is a central and distinguishing aspect of compassion in comparison to sympathy or empathy [33] . In recognizing the inherent challenges in training aimed at cultivating the requisite qualities and affective and relational domains of compassion, study participants suggested that one way learners can cultivate the internal virtues associated with compassion is by providing them with opportunities to engage in compassionate action within their clinical training and practice. Accordingly, while changing learner attitudes can lead to behavioural change, recent research within the field of social psychology suggests that the opportunity to integrate them into practice is not only imperative to sustaining attitudinal change but may change the innate qualities of learners in the process [34] [35] [36] . Exposing learners to clinical case scenarios or experiences requiring compassionate action illustrated within the categories and themes within the relational space domain of the HCP compassion model, may in turn function as a positive feedback loop that develops the innate qualities within the virtuous intent domain-cultivating virtues through action. In support of this, functional neural plasticity studies show that compassion training using techniques based on Eastern contemplative traditions activates neuro regions in the brain associated with the positive affective states of reward, love, affiliation and concern for another [37] . Finally, these findings on HCPs perspectives of compassion training and the multidimensional nature of compassion as illustrated in the compassion model ( Fig. 1) suggest that compassion training needs to focus on equipping learners with the behaviours, skills, knowledge and qualities spanning the entirety of the HCP Compassion Model and not simply a single dimension, which while developing the virtues associated with compassion through meditation, for example, is void of behavioural or clinical communication training.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1248, "end": 1252, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1952, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1957, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1962, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2601, "end": 2605, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 451, "end": 459, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2763, "end": 2770, "text": "Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although participants provided many specific suggestions for compassion training based on their own education and practice experience, they were unified in their view that compassion training is currently lacking and needed in healthcare education-affirming the findings of previous studies [1, 6] .

One report revealed that the actions that underlie the provision of compassion should be grounded in an understanding of a patient's values, beliefs and needs [38] . This suggests that teaching compassion using simple statements such as \"do what is right\" limits a learner's understanding of what is required of a compassionate care provider, and that compassion mandates caring for patients as they would wish to be cared for, not as a provider would wish to be cared for [38] .

All these training programs include meditation interventions that intend to engender compassion to others and self. A key limitation of these training programs is that none of the approaches have been evaluated in healthcare providers and their patients, despite this being an essential primary outcome of any compassion training program to be used within the healthcare setting. Furthermore, they are all based on differing definitions of compassion and target a variety of competencies [39] . A second review of interventions for compassionate nursing care identified 25 interventions based on staff training, staff support or introducing a new care model to practice [45] . However, none of the interventions were fully described or rigorously investigated. Several interventions evaluated patient-based outcomes, including patient anxiety and satisfaction, but only showed a moderate effect [46, 47] .

In addition to rolemodeling compassion in practice, participants indicated that mentors are essential for debriefing and serving as an emotional buffer that allows healthcare students to engage in compassion while they explore how best to sustain themselves in the process. Studies in healthcare fields have found that mentoring improved medical student satisfaction with their training programs, increased mentee knowledge and skills, enhanced mentee personal and professional development and improved organizational outcomes [5, 48, 49] .

Accordingly, personal and professional self-care is increasingly accepted as critical in sustaining the satisfaction and longevity of HCPs [50] [51] [52] [53] . Personal self-care recognizes that an individual's inner-life, family, work, community and spirituality contribute to their personal and professional life [50, 54] and involves strategies that include tending to close relationships such as those with family; following a healthy lifestyle (regular sleep, exercise, vacations); prioritizing time for recreational activities and hobbies; contemplative practices; and engaging in spiritual development [50, [55] [56] [57] . Professional self-care strategies may be individual or team-based. Individual professional self-care strategies involve regular evaluation of work life; establishing a network of peers and mentors; improving communication and management skills; setting limits; and reflective writing [50, 58] . Team self-care strategies recognize that team structure and the team processes contribute to a team's well-being and include empowering team members to empathize with others; developing formal structures, policies and procedures to guide team meetings; and sharing personal and professional opinions on meaning [50, 59, 60] . Selfawareness is a vital aspect of self-care. In HCPs, selfawareness has been defined as the ability to combine self-knowledge with an understanding of the needs of the patient [50] .

example of when you felt you provided or witnessed care that was compassionate? [What do you feel were the key aspects of these interactions?] 3 What do you feel are the major influencers of compassion in your practice? 4 What do you feel inhibits your ability to provide compassion? 5 Do you think patients and/or family members influence the provision of compassion? [How or how not?], [If yes, what characteristics of patients and/or families, do you feel facilitate or inhibit compassion?] 6 What advice would you give other healthcare providers on providing compassion? 7 Do you think we can train people to be compassionate? [If so, how]? 8 Based on your experience what role, if any, do you feel compassion has in alleviating end of life distress? [What happens when compassion is lacking?] 9 What impact does providing compassion have on your personally and professionally? 10 Is there anything related to compassion that we have not talked about today that you think is important or were hoping to talk about? Stage 2 Interview Guiding Questions 1 You have been identified by your peers as possessing great skill in providing compassion. What do you feel might be some of the reasons for this recognition? [Why do you think others identify you as a compassionate healthcare provider]? 2 In your own terms, how would you define compassion? [What does compassion mean to you?] 3 How did you become a compassionate caregiver? [What beliefs, situations, individuals and/or life experiences in your life and practice do you feel have informed your understanding and provision of compassion? Have you always been that way? [Were you always like that? How did you learn it? Can it be learned?]4 If you reflect back on your current position, can you walk me through the best example of when you provided compassion? Please guide me through the process of this encounter in a sequential fashion, highlighting the key components of this interaction from the initial approach to the consequences of this interaction?] 5 Based on your professional and personal experiences, what shapes your compassion? 6 If you were responsible for training students in compassion, how would you go about it? [What would you teach them?] 7 Is there anything that gets in the way of your ability to provide compassion? 8 How do patients and/or families influence your ability to provide compassion? [What characteristics of patients and/or families, do you feel facilitate or inhibit compassion?] 9 A number of participants have identified the healthcare system as being a significant factor in delivering compassion? From your perspective, how does/can the healthcare system facilitate or inhibit compassion? 10 In light of the things you've just identified as facilitators and barriers, what suggestions would you have for enhancing compassion at a systems level? [Where and what would you focus your efforts on in order to enhance compassion at a systems level]? 11 From what you've told me so far, it sounds like compassion is important. So what happens [to patients, families or HCPs] when compassion is lacking?12 What impact does providing compassion have on you personally and professionally? 13 Our focus group participants, previous studies and review of the literature have reported how critical and fundamental compassion is to providing quality patient care, but we also know that compassion varies. So given all that we know about the importance of compassion, why aren't healthcare providers more compassionate?14 Before we end, given all we've talked about, I just want to revisit one of the first questions I asked, which is how do you personally define compassion? [In light of our discussion, what does compassion mean to you?] 15 Is there anything related to compassion that we have not talked about today that you think is important or were hoping to talk about? Stage 3 Focus Group Questions 1 Does the healthcare provider model of compassion make sense to you? [Does it resonate with you]? [Why or Why not]? 2 Do you feel there is anything missing from the model? 3 How do you feel this model might be relevant to you and your work? 4 How do you suggest the model might be integrated into healthcare practice and education? 5 Is there anything related to the model that we have not talked about today that you think is important or were hoping to talk about Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (#REB", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Participants' characteristics", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Teachable Moments: Teach the Behaviours and Cultivate the Qualities; The Learner: The Role of Innate Qualities and Experience; and Compassion Competency: An Educational Priority and Practice Requirement.
