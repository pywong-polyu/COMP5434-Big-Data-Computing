HZ infection in COVID-19 vaccinated individuals who are immunocompetent can be attributed to vaccine-induced immunomodulation allowing the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) to escape from the dorsal root ganglia. Another theory is similar to immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS). HZ infection in a young immunocompetent individual is a rare entity. As per our literature review, only four cases have been reported thus far. We are reporting two cases of two young individuals with no known risk factors who developed ipsilateral HZO after receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. The increasing incidence of HZ cases post COVID-19 vaccine indicates that this is not a mere coincidence. Awareness must be created among physicians, as well as the general population, for early recognition and early antiviral usage, which can halt the progression of the disease and thus prevent debilitating complications.",

            "text": "VZV is a DNA virus from the family herpesvirus, also known as HHV3. It causes two clinical conditions. The primary infection causes chickenpox. The secondary infection causes varicella zoster, which is due to the reactivation of latent VZV. VZV reactivation occurs when there is downregulation of major histocompatibility complex class 1 resulting in inhibition of interferon response which acts as an antiviral, thus triggering the viral replication [1] . Examples of risk factors that are associated with this downregulation of immune response are stress, trauma, advanced age, HIV, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease. Typically, VZV infection presents with a rash and acute neuropathic pain [2] . The rash is usually confined to the ipsilateral dermatome. However, a disseminated presentation involving more than one dermatome has been seen, especially in severely immunosuppressed patients. The characteristic lesions are grouped vesicles or bullae, which become pustules in several days. The most common dermatomes involved are thoracic and lumbar. Life-threatening involvement of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve has also been identified, causing HZO. The incidence rate of HZO is approximately 10%-20% of HZ infections [2] . Common presenting symptoms of HZO are headache, rash, conjunctivitis, scleritis, keratitis, retinal necrosis, and meningoencephalitis [2] . Early recognition and treatment with an antiviral is the mainstay of management and can prevent vision loss and life-threatening complications. It is recommended individuals greater than 50 years of age who are immunocompetent be vaccinated against HZ.",
