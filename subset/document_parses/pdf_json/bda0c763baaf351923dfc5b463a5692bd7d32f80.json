It is expressed by the level of systematic risk in the economy and part of the expected return on investment. It only exists because it is impossible to estimate the future values of a selected investment and it expresses a certain degree of uncertainty. The aim of the paper is to compare the calculation methods used for the risk premium of the Czech Republic. The methodology provides an analysis of calculation methods, in particular the basic CAPM method and modified Tax-CAPM, or the relative standard deviation method, government bond default spreads and the risk-adjusted discount rates according to Damodaran. The modified concept of the CAPM model according to Damodaran seems to be most appropriate for the Czech Republic. The model includes a country risk premium. However, the size of a company must be taken into account and the recommended market volatility coefficient of 1.5 may have to be adjusted to a higher value. However, no exact rules of procedure are available to clearly determine which models would be most appropriate for use. These are only speculations and approximate estimates in the calculation.",

It is expressed by the level of systematic risk in the economy [11] . Damodaran looks very closely at the topic and development of risk premium, mainly in the US stock market, in his research [4] . He modified the CAPM model and included a country's risk premium in the calculation. This model is considered to be the most accurate picture of reality. The Damodaran's approach is not appropriate for the Czech Republic as some calculations and indicators need to be adjusted and this model does not consider a company's risk profile in regard to its size. It is based on the difference in the government bond yields of the given country and countries with AAA rating. The US capital market data are primarily used to calculate the beta coefficient and the market risk premium. Each investment and the related capital cost reflect the environment where they are located and this premium obtained in the best global markets must be adjusted for the given country [9] .",

This evaluation is provided by independent credit rating agencies. They determine the level of risk of non-compliance arising from the issue of bonds or other fixed-income investments. The country's risk premium increases as the country risk increases. These agencies help to improve the efficiency of financial markets because the information failure and costs are reduced. The creditworthiness and credit quality of the issuer are also assessed. Following the analyses, the entity will be assigned a rating from the specified rating scale. Nevertheless, this rating is only considered an independent risk assessment [27] . The bond quality classification is divided into two grades: investment grade (AAA-BBB ratings) and speculative grade (BB rating and beyond). Credit rating agencies do not have a lot of ability to predict developments. It was confirmed in the global crisis 2007 and it was obvious that credit rating agencies only responded to market developments [1] . Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch are amongst the largest credit rating agencies on the market. The country rating helps to, for example, attract foreign investors or issue securities on foreign markets. It also allows better access of the country to the international capital market. The agencies can assess a country risk, for example, on request of a government, central bank or provide this service to their investors [7] .",

The investment in government bonds issued for 10 or more years of repayment would be longer-term and more appropriate. The risk-free interest rate on return of these government bonds is even called for in practice. The risk premium consists of the return above the risk-free rate level. It is primarily the profit for the risk taken by the investor [21] .

Beta coefficient is another important aspect. Here the level of risk and sensitivity of the return rate is derived from the difference between the risk-free rate and the return rate of investment. This market risk called beta is estimated based on the individual market risk factors, each of which has its own price. In the calculation of the risk premium, Damodaran uses 5 essential estimation methods by Othieno and Biekpe [25] . These mainly include the estimated demand, the method of supply, the historical estimate, the implied ERP estimate and the approach-based survey. For the calculation of the risk premium, the level of risk of the asset against other assets must be determined. The CAPM model based on the capital market will be most appropriate. Qin suggests to build a conceptual framework to understand the aggregate risk effects [26] . It also means that risk aversion is a potential reason for settlement of the securities market and a high risk premium. The standard CAPM model does not consider the risk premium. Modifications and adjustments are required to include the risk premium in the calculation [1] .",

The highest sovereign ratings are obtained by the most developed countries in the world that offer the investors a stable and growing economy with low inflation and unemployment rates, and good quality infrastructure and an educated population [10] . At the other end, there are countries with high debt ratios and an overall insolvency. In the history, for example, the sovereign rating downgrade of Greece temporarily weakened the euro due to concerns about the spread of the crisis across the euro zone. In the calculation of a rating, the credit rating agency works together with the national institutions such as the central bank, the ministry, and government agencies, or trade unions. The country is then assigned a rating A to D corresponding to the country's sovereign credit risk. The investment grade includes ratings from A to Baa3. The speculative grade ranges from Ba1 to D according to the Moody's rating. As shown in Appendix 1, the Czech Republic is assigned the same investment grade rating -Aa3 according to Moody's and AA-according to Fitch and S&Pfrom all the three credit rating agencies. The Czech Republic achieved this rating in 2019 after 17 years when the rating was upgraded from A1. This value warrants the high credit reliability of the Czech Republic and advantageous financing on the domestic and foreign markets even with regard to the current situation affected by the corona virus pandemic [20] . According to Moody's, this pandemic will have an adverse impact on the Czech economy, causing an increase in public debt to 36.9% of GDP [31] .",

This remuneration corresponds in value to the risk premium of the company's equity costs. Along with the cost of liability, it is possible to set the discount rate using WACC. Expected return is a determinant of the cost of capital. There are several financial risk models that share some views on risk. They all define the risk in terms of variance from expected return and the investment is not safe if the actual return equals the expected return. Risk should also be measured from the perspective of a marginal investor who is diversified [5] . This premium exists only due to the impossibility of estimating the future values of the selected investment and expresses a certain degree of uncertainty. This risk is already included in the discount rate, so its quantification is secret and no such attention is paid to it.

Another problem is that the model deals only with expected returns and not the actual return on investment and assesses only systematic risk.

The beta coefficient plays an important role here. It expresses the degree of systematic risk to the market and draws data from the past [19] .

The way in which the CAPM model is derived is far from reality and needs to be modified. There are two ways to calculate the CAPM.

However, it is not mandatory, but is indispensable for investors in bond issues [24] . This rating takes into account the risk that investors would take if they invested in a riskier country than countries rated by Moody's Aaa. The first rating agency, CRA rating agency, a. s., was established in the Czech Republic in 1988. In 2006, Moody's agency became the owner [29] . Rating performance is a complex and lengthy process, where a credit rating agency cooperates with state institutions. From the information obtained, the state is awarded an appropriate mark from A to D indicating the riskiness of the country. These analyses are performed mostly once a year, so it is not possible to react so quickly to turbulent changes in the financial market. Agencies also do not have much ability to anticipate developments and rather only react to them. It is necessary for each investor to choose the credit rating agency at his discretion, as each agency uses a different methodology for risk assessment. Moody's focuses on the country's anticipated future development. S&P and Fitch compare the current problems of the state and its public finances [30] . The rating divides individual countries of the world into marks that determine investment-grade and speculative grade of investment. Rating of the Czech Republic falls into the rating of the investment grade according to Moody's on Aa3, it was stated in the rating from April this year [23]. The outlook for long-term liabilities is stable despite the current development of the corona virus pandemic and the expected economic slowdown. Countries such as Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Chile and Hong Kong are also included in this rating level. In comparison with these advanced capital markets, the market of the Czech Republic has a shorter history and therefore does not reach such qualities as other world markets. However, it is worth considering whether it would be more appropriate to break down these country rating marks into further rating levels so as not to distort the results when calculating the country risk premium and also to take into account the company's riskiness in relation to its size.",

Above all, the basis was Damodaran's models and the evaluation of credit rating agencies to determine the appropriate process of calculating the risk premium for the Czech Republic. It was established from a literature search that credit rating agencies and their ratings improve the efficiency of the financial market by reducing the information failure and transaction costs. They also help countries to attract foreign investors and ratings also provide better access to the capital market. The assigned country's sovereign rating summarizes the risk of insolvency. Adopting a rating from a pre-selected credit rating agency becomes the simplest and most widespread way how the risk premium is determined. The differences between the ratings of the global agencies are very similar, with a few exceptions. It depends on the investor which credit rating agency they will choose. The current rating of the Czech Republic falls within the investment grade according to Moody's Aa3 rating. The countries such as Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Chile and Hong Kong are also included in this investment grade. In comparison to these advanced capital markets, the market of the Czech Republic has a shorter history and the capital market is still under development, so it does not achieve the quality of the other world's markets.

In the discussion of the results, these methods are described and compared in more detail. The basic CAPM model only reviews the systematic risk. The model is criticized for not truly reflecting on reality and is being abandoned because it builds on historical data and it does not seem applicable for the future development of investment. It must be modified for further use of the calculations. For example, Germany has modified this model as Tax-CAPM where the taxes of those who receive income from a given asset are explicitly considered. It would be useful to produce a customized and tailored design that would fit the conditions of the Czech Republic.",

This model is also the most commonly used. The country's sovereign risk premium is also included in the calculation. However, note that this model does not consider the level of risk of a company in relation to its size. The result of this model is general without regard to the situation and conditions in given country. The challenge of the calculation is to determine a beta coefficient value which is related to stock price volatility. Another challenge is to determine volatility, therefore a universal coefficient of 1.5 is recommended. The drawback of the model is that it does not consider the individual companies in the country and their characteristics, but only the country as a whole. It would be adequate to use a higher than a coefficient of 1.5. Results will then be distorted and based on the review of historical data, the values for the Czech Republic were higher than the specified coefficient of 1.5. In the calculation you also have to make sure the standard deviation is not confused with the variance.",
