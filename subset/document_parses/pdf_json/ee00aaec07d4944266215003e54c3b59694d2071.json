Community members mentioned the potential uses of verbal autopsy data in addressing immediate public health problems for the local population while research staff emphasized the benefits of verbal autopsy to research and the wider public. The most prominent burden associated with the verbal autopsy was emotional distress for verbal autopsy interviewers and respondents. Moral events linked to the interview, such as being unsure of the right thing to do (moral uncertainty) or knowing the right thing to do and being constrained from acting (moral constraint), emerged as key causes of emotional distress for verbal autopsy interviewers.",

The principal benefit of verbal autopsy is considered to be the provision of mortality data that can be used to support research and public health, including responding to disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19 [15] . However, many countries in low-resource settings have limited capacity for using data, such as global health estimates, and translating research evidence into public health benefits [16] [17] [18] . At the same time, researchers have described potential burdens of verbal autopsy for individuals and communities, including emotional distress for verbal autopsy interview respondents and stigmatization of bereaved families [19] [20] [21] . Some have argued that adhering to local bereavement practices, engaging community members throughout the verbal autopsy process and using data locally is crucial for minimizing burdens, enhancing benefits and showing respect in verbal autopsy [22] [23] [24] . Nevertheless, there has been little empirical research on the experiences of verbal autopsy stakeholders in HDSS within Africa.",

However, some have argued that moral distress is not an entirely negative phenomenon; the experience of moral distress can reflect favorably on the character of an individual, provide opportunities for moral lessons and highlight systemic weaknesses [35, 36] .",

The community representatives groups in NUHDSS, referred to as community advisory committees, had 10 members each. We invited all 20 members to participate in FGDs within their respective areas and 15 attended. In addition, we held an FGD with a group of NUHDSS census interviewers with experience of working in the two study areas. Overall, we facilitated five focus group discussions in NUHDSS involving 40 participants. Operationally, the Kilifi HDSS area is divided into three zones; northern, central and southern zone. We held an FGD with community representatives in each of the three zones and with HDSS residents in the northern and southern zones. In addition, we had separate FGDs for census and verbal autopsy interviewers. Overall, we facilitated seven FGDs in KHDSS involving 46 participants. The FGDs started with an open discussion to build mutual understanding of the research institutions (KWTRP in Kilifi and APHRC in Nairobi), health research, HDSS and the verbal autopsy (See Additional file 1). This was followed by discussion of ethically relevant ethical issues in verbal autopsy within HDSS with a focus of the views and experiences of participants.

This framework was applied to the rest of the data and charts developed, using NVivo 10 Framework Matrices, to highlight patterns across sites, themes and participant groups.

Across all sites, most verbal autopsy interviewers saw condolence fees as a way of respecting local mourning norms, including showing solidarity with bereaved families, rather than reimbursing or influencing respondents.

For example, while the INDEPTH Network requires verbal autopsy procedures for all deaths in affiliated HDSS sites, some of these data may be available from other sources. In this study, cause-of-death data related to shooting, road traffic accidents or suicide are likely to be available from community leaders, community health volunteers and medical records from health facilities affiliated to HDSS. Collecting such data from alternative verbal autopsy respondents seems particularly important since many of these sudden and traumatic causes of death generate high risks of emotional distress. Emotional burdens for interviewees could also be reduced by expanding the pool of potential respondents for verbal autopsies to avoid involving particularly vulnerable individuals. Studies have shown that home-based birth attendants and health care workers can substitute for bereaved mothers as verbal autopsy respondents and provide credible information about stillbirths and neonatal deaths [58] . Given the risks involved, a call for verbal autopsy for all deaths in HDSS, which often involves interviews with close relatives of the deceased, needs reassessment in each site.",

Verbal autopsy contributes to global health estimates, but these estimates might not be useful at the local level [16] . Furthermore, public health policies based on global health estimates that exclude HDSS verbal autopsy data might not be significantly different from policies drawn using estimates that include these data [61] . The additional value of verbal autopsy data to global health estimates and the benefits of these estimates to countries that contribute the data is unclear. Nevertheless, most of the standardization of verbal autopsy processes seeks to generate data that are comparable across sites and countries. Also, the barriers of translating research evidence into policy and practice are well acknowledged [16, 62] . Based on the empirical data in this study on burdens of verbal autopsy, we join others in recommending integration of VA with CRVS [9, 13, 63, 64] and engagement of community members throughout the verbal autopsy process [22, 65] , to minimize burdens and enhance benefits. Besides supporting research and contributing to global health estimates, it seems that there should be greater emphasis on the importance of verbal autopsy data being used to benefit individuals, local communities and health systems directly, including by facilitating issuance of death certificates and informing responses to local public health problems.",

For example, some have proposed a classification of mortality data based on quality of cause-of-death assignement [66] , which could be useful in informing appropriate uses of verbal autopsy data. The wider sharing of verbal autopsy data could enhance benefits for individuals and local communities and the efficient use of resources.

Also, most of the emotional distress for verbal autopsy respondents, such as grief, was not related to experience of moral events.

The verbal autopsy in HDSS presents a wide range of practical and ethical challenges. These include uncertainty around the appropriate timing of verbal autopsy interviews, the necessity and impact of reporting findings to individual respondents and the appropriate ethics guidelines for verbal autopsy in HDSS contexts. Also, the verbal autopsy generates ethical dilemmas for interviewers in situations where their personal values and responsibilities are in conflict or tension with local cultural practices or institutional ethics policies [22] . Interviewers acknowledged the potential social value of verbal autopsy data and at the same time felt that they were contributing to burdens for respondents by collecting the data. Some questioned the social value of verbal autopsy. These challenges may contribute to moral distress for verbal autopsy interviewers in HDSS.",

Training in ethics, bereavement counseling and project management with certification could support interviewers to fulfill the responsibilities of their complex roles and to advance their careers. In addition, the regular revision of verbal autopsy tools should be accompanied by consideration of the impact of these revisions on interviewers and respondents. For example, a brief interview, despite reducing time costs, might appear unsympathetic to the bereaved, hence contributing to emotional and moral distress.",

Finally, interviewers need ongoing support to address emotional and moral distress. This could include establishing permanent platforms that enable interviewers to discuss ethical challenges they encounter, and to recommend changes to institutional policies and practices. While we recommend further research to assess the impact of moral distress on verbal autopsy interviewers' health and careers and acknowledge that moral distress is an unpleasant experience for individuals, we also recognize the potential value of moral distress [36] , including in identifying and addressing ethical issues in verbal autopsy. Interventions such as regular ethics reflection sessions [73, 74] and moral distress consultation [34] for verbal autopsy interviewers can contribute to addressing emotional distress and strengthening ethical practice.",

In addition, we propose that verbal autopsy respondents in HDSS should be compensated, including condolence fees, not only to reduce burdens for stakeholders but also to demonstrate respect and solidarity. Finally, there is a need for institutional platforms and policies to respond to interviewers' moral distress and to promote the greater use of verbal autopsy data at the local community level.",
