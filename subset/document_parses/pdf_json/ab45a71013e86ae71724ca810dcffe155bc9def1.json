Subjects The study included 217 patients. The eligible were men and non-pregnant women aged 18 years or older, hospitalized for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Treatment 206 subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive single subcutaneous administration of LVL 324 mg or placebo, both in combination with standard of care (SOC). 204 patients received allocated therapy. After the LVL/placebo administration in case of deterioration of symptoms, the investigator could perform a single open-label LVL 324 mg administration as the rescue therapy. Methods The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained clinical improvement on the 7-category ordinal scale on Day 14. All efficacy data obtained after rescue therapy administration were considered missing. For primary efficacy analysis, all subjects with missing data were considered non-responders. Results 63.1% and 42.7% of patients in the LVL and in the placebo groups, respectively, achieved sustained clinical improvement on Day 14 (P = .0017). The frequency of adverse drug reactions was comparable between the groups. Conclusion In patients with radiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, requiring or not oxygen therapy (but not ventilation) with no signs of other active infection administration of LVL + SOC results in an increase of sustained clinical improvement rate.",

However, in approximately 20% of cases COVID-19 may progress to severe disease caused by the exaggerated immune response to the virus, diffuse alveolar damage, poorly controlled release of proinflammatory cytokines, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and coagulation abnormalities [2, 3] . Increased level of proinflammatory cytokines is associated with high viral load, lung injury, disease severity and poor outcome [3] [4] [5] . Assuming that subjects with severe infection can benefit from suppression of cytokine release syndrome, a large number of clinical trials aimed to investigate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapy including anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6 agents and steroids in patients with COVID-19 were started [6] .",

It is worth mentioning that the rescue therapy was prescribed more than 3 times less frequently in the LVL group than in the placebo group illustrating the benefit of early LVL administration.",

As early as the first week after the IP administration the LVL and placebo groups were significantly different in the distribution of patients according to the ordinal scale categories.

After 2 weeks of therapy (IP combined with SOC) more patients were discharged in the LVL group than in the placebo group without need of rescue therapy.
