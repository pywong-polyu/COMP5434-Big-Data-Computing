Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess the reduction in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission in patients treated with IFN-\u03b2 versus control group within 28 days of randomization 2) To assess the reduction in number of deaths in IFN-\u03b2 compared to control group (day 28) 3) To evaluate the increase in proportion of participants returning to negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in IFN-\u03b2 -treated versus control group at Day 14 and Day 28 4) To assess the increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific binding antibody titers in IFN-\u03b2 compared to control group (day 28) 5) To assess the safety of IFN-\u03b2 -treated patients versus control group Trial design: Randomized, Open-Label, Controlled, Superiority Phase II Study. Patients, who satisfy all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups in a ratio 2:1 (IFNtreated versus control patients). Randomization will be stratified by gender. Stratified randomization will balance the presence of male and female in both study arms.",

Treatment arm: 11\u03bcg (3MIU) of IFN-\u03b21a will be injected subcutaneously at day 1, 3, 7, and 10 in addition to standard of care. The drug solution, contained in a pre-filled cartridge, will be injected by means of the RebiSmart\u00ae electronic injection device. Interferon \u03b21a (Rebif\u00ae, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The dose selected for this study is expected to exploit the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of the cytokine without causing relevant toxicity or inducing refractoriness phenomena sometimes observed after high-dose and/or chronic IFN\u03b2 treatments. Main outcomes: Primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients experiencing a disease progression, during at least 5 days, according to the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2). The NEWS2 score is a standardized approach aimed at promptly detecting signs of clinical deterioration in acutely ill patients and establishing the potential need for higher level of care. It is based on the evaluation of vital signs, including respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, blood pressure, pulse/heart rate, AVPU response. The resulting observations, compared to a normal range, are combined in a single composite \"alarm\" score. Any other clinical sign clearly indicating a disease worsening will be considered as disease progression.",
