We evaluated the performance of two commercially available lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIC; Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test and the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV Ab test) in comparison with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization pseudotyped assay for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in hospitalized patients and investigate whether the intensity of the test band in LFIC associates with neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titers. Ninety sera were included from 51 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based pseudotyped neutralization assay (vesicular stomatitis virus coated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) was used. Test line intensity was scored using a 4-level scale (0 to 3+). The overall sensitivity of LFIC assays was 91.1% for the Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, 72.2% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG, 85.6% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgM, and 92.2%",

Several studies have evaluated the performance of LFIC in comparison with NtAb assays in subjects with past or ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection. [9] [10] [11] [12] Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, only one has attempted to quantitatively correlate results yielded by the two assay types by analyzing the strength of test line reactivity in LFIC devices and NtAb 50 titers. 9 Here, we sought to evaluate the performance of two commercially available LFIC, widely used in our country, compared with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization pseudotype assay for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitalized patients, and determine whether the intensity of the test band in LFIC was associated with the levels of NtAb, recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein.",

(China), which detects SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM) in a single test band, and INNOVITA 2019-nCoV Ab Test (Beijing Innovita Biological Technology, China), which detects IgG and IgM separately. The antigenic specificity of antibodies detected by these assays was not disclosed (to our knowledge). Both assays were performed according to the protocol provided by the respective manufacturer. Test line intensity scoring was done using a 4-level scale (Figure 1), in which 0 corresponded to F I G U R E 1 Test line intensity was scored using a 4-level scale. From left to right: 0, negative result; 1+, weak positive result (intensity of test band lower than the control band); 2+, positive result (intensity of test band equal to the control line); 3+, strong positive result (intensity of test band greater than the control line) result (intensity of test band equal to control line), and 3+ a strong positive result (intensity of test band greater than control line). Four readers independently scored each test and the average of the scores was recorded as the final LFIC result. Ten sera exhibiting different strengths of reactivities (from 1+ to 3+) were tested in two different batches of each LFIC assay, these displaying identical results.",

Of note, there were no sera exhibiting the T A B L E 1 Clinical sensitivity of an antibody neutralization method using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based pseudotype (vesicular stomatitis virus-VSV-backbone coated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) and two commercial SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow immunochromatographic antibody tests for COVID-19 diagnosis",

Out of a total of 90 sera, 83 tested positive by the NtAb assay, 82 by Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, 65 by INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG, and 74 by INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgM.Taking RT-PCR-positive results as the reference, the data showed that the Wondfo SARS-COV-2 Antibody test had higher overall sensitivity than the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG and IgM,considered either separately or in combination, and approached that of NtAb, the most sensitive assay (92.2%) (Table 1). As expected, the sensitivity of LFIC assays increased when testing sera collected at relatively late times (\u226515 days) after symptoms onset compared with sera collected earlier ( < 15 days). Notably, the Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgM, and NtAb assay showed similar sensitivity for late sera. Considering the entire data set, the degree of agreement between qualitative results yielded by the commercial immunoassays and the NtAb assay was \u03ba = 0.64 (p \u2264 .001) for Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, \u03ba = 0.29 (p \u2264 .001) for INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG, \u03ba = 0.46 (p \u2264 .001) for INNOVITA 2019-nCov IgM, and \u03ba = 0.56 (p \u2264 .001) for the combination of INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG and IgM testing. As for the specificity of the LFIC assays, 20 control sera, including 10 from patients with previous endemic coronavirus infections, were tested. Only one serum returned positive results by the Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG and IgM assays (from a patient with a previous HCoV OC229infection). Thus, the specificity of LFIC assays was 95% (95% CI, 76.4%-99.1%). In addition, all control sera tested negative by the NtAb assay (specificity; 100%; 95% CI, 83.9%-100%).",
