While a low LVEF was not associated with a higher mortality, this study did re-demonstrate that elevated troponin is associated with a higher mortality rate. 2, 3, 11 Patients with increased WT were more likely to have elevated troponin, but degree of elevation was higher with normal WT; albeit neither of these findings reached statistical significance.
