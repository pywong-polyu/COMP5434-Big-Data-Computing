The Capripox virus P32 immunogenic protein is homologous of the vaccinia virus H3L gene displayed PapMV CP.

And these modelled immunogenic peptide could be used to develop a viral like particles. Epitope based Antibody developed against immunogenic epitopic regions can contribute to a novel and robust protection from infection. As well might be used for developing cost effective detection kits for Transboundary animal disease viruses.",

In biomedical applications of viral like particles shown more effective and safety a novel subunit vaccine, gene therapy vectors and diagnostic kits constructions. Plant viruses are emerging as promising vectors for use in innovative vaccination and development of diagnostic kits. Formation and production of viral like particles of immunogenic recombinant proteins in numerous plant systems have been deeply investigated and improved. In Vaccinology plant derived microbicides, vaccines and antibodies shown great attention and implemented. For the development of safety and effective mucosal and orally delivered plant created or produced viral like particles need a nominal process of the plant tissue (Santi et al. 2006) . To develop a viral like particles and viral-based vectors, Papaya Mosaic Virus based viral nanoparticles are the competent vaccine platform. The immunogenic protein like epitopes or peptide antigens are fused with the capsid protein of mosaic virus at N-terminal side and C-terminal side of resulting in nanoparticles presenting surface-displays the epitopes.

Capripoxviruses have the threats to become potential emerging disease because of global climatic change and due to porous international boundaries which facilitate for immigration of animals and their animal products from neighboring countries. These diseases are endemic in Africa, Middle East, Europe and Asia. The disease is transmitted through the infected animal direct contact or by contaminated objects (Tuppurainen et al. 2015) .

These VLPs are the appearance to the native form virus purified from infected source plants as well noninfectious. VLPs are being used by the polyvalent foreign epitope peptide display on their viral capsid protein surface to improve their presentation, immunogenicity as well host immune reaction (Kumar et al. 2009 ). Plant viral capsid proteins put forward the benefit of uniformity with respect to size, shape and have capability to self assembling into highly repeating nano-VLPs structures. Plant-based VLPS have a capable to exhibit tolerance to against pH and high temperature, structurally particular chemical attachment sites and resist intracellular environment like resist towards proteases and nucleases as well as these VLPs have a cargo capacity like they may suitable intended for transporting drugs to the affected area. Due to nonpathogenic nature of plant based viral nanoparticles may ideal selection for therapeutic applications. These structures are lack of viral genomic material, hence they are non-replicative or causing any type of infection (Shoeb and Hefferon 2019) .",

The PMV vaccine platform have a ability to provoke a enduring memory response (Denis et al. 2007 ). The discovery of B-cell immunogenic epitopes is a crucial primary step for the advance of epitope peptide-based vaccines, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic antibodies. Immunogenic Epitope peptides can be displayed on the surface capsid protein subsequently those peptides assembled like virus particles act as vehicles for epitope display. Expression of immunogenic epitope peptides as fusions with surface loops of plant viral Capsid proteins has been used for the generation of several candidate animal vaccines (Hefferon 2018) .",

And demonstrated by taking CTL-epitope attained from the NP (NucleoCapsid) of the influenza virus, fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of the PMV CP, leading to nanoparticles presenting surface-Displayed epitope.
