            "text": "Medical nutrition therapy is a cornerstone of diabetes management and includes education on carbohydrate estimation as part of an overall eating pattern to improve health outcomes [1] . Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control [2] . Nevertheless, it has been shown that the dietary intake of young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the community generally fails to meet recommended nutrient intakes as outlined in the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) dietary guidelines for T1D [3, 4] . In a large cohort of young people with T1D, the overall intake of total and saturated fats was high, while intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains was low [5] . Cross-sectional studies on children with T1D have suggested that diets characterized by lower fat [6] , lower added sugar [7] , higher carbohydrates [8] , higher fiber, and higher fruit and vegetable consumption [6] [7] [8] are associated with lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Nutrition analysis in patients with T1D is relevant, because both overall diet quality and macronutrient distribution are associated with improved glycemic control [9] . Measurement of HbA1c is currently the most important method used to evaluate glycemic control, but continuous glucose monitor (CGM)-based percentage of time spent in the target range 70-180 mg/dL (TIR) has been considered an emerging measure of glycemic control because it is positively associated with reduced micro and macrovascular complications [10, 11] . The use of both non-automated [12] and automated diabetes technologies such as closed loop control systems (CLC) have been shown to improve TIR [13] . The aim of this study was to analyze the association between clinical factors and macronutrient intake with CGM-based TIR in children and adolescents aged 2-17 years in the real-world community setting.",

To avoid potential discrepancies due to different accuracies of various CGMs, only patients using a Dexcom G6 were recruited. Exclusion criteria were unwillingness to use the CGM, use of a CGM other than Dexcom G6, unwillingness to share glucose data with the center, unavailability or inability of the parents to collect nutritional data, diagnosis of celiac disease, use of predictive low glucose management or CLC system, and HbA1c > 10% before the study.

Parents' ability to measure nutrient intake was verified by the dietitian by way of a practical test before the study. They were asked to collect data in the food diary for three days (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday) of the two weeks following recruitment. Through the food diary, they provided information about type and brand names of food items, time and location of eating, and recipes. For commercial food items, the packages or the food labels were collected and the product information was added to the dietary record using Winfood \u00ae software (Medimatica, Teramo, Italy).

This is consistent with American Diabetes Association recommendations indicating that glycemic goals may need to be modified to consider the fact that younger children may have a form of \"hypoglycemic unawareness\", in that they lack the cognitive capacity to recognize and respond to hypoglycemic symptoms and may be at greater risk of sequelae from hypoglycemia. In addition, children below the age of 5 years may be at risk of permanent cognitive impairment after episodes of severe hypoglycemia [16] . Therefore, more effort is needed to improve TIR in younger children by increasing parents' diabetes education, refining insulin treatment [17] , or using more advanced technological systems such as closed-loop control, which reduces the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia [18, 19] .",

On the other hand, the use of HbA1c alone for assessing glycemic control can be misleading [20] , as the same HbA1c value can be associated with good, fair, or even poor glycemic control as judged by the different potential mean glucose levels calculated by the CGM. In addition, observational studies analyzing macronutrient intake have usually been based on a threeday food diary record, while HbA1c reflects blood glucose concentrations over 3-4 months. As macronutrient intake may vary over the 3-4-month period, the association between HbA1c and macronutrient intake can be unreliable.",

Results from the Diabetes Complication and Control Trial (DCCT) showed that participants randomly assigned to intensive therapy with a dietary intake higher in fat and saturated fat and lower in carbohydrate had worse glycemic control [20] . On the other hand, results from a longitudinal study reported that the higher the carbohydrate intake, the more the HbA1c increased [21] . The recommended carbohydrate intake in the 2014 ISPAD guidelines [22] of 50-55% of total energy intake was reduced in the 2018 ISPAD guidelines [1] to 45-50%. To assess the percentage of carbohydrate intake associated with the best metabolic control as measured by TIR, we considered four classes. Using the 45-50% class as a reference, we found that the probability of having an TIR > 70% increased more than 2.5 times if carbohydrate intake was between 40-44%. Moreover, patients consuming a carbohydrate percentage of 40-44% more frequently had an HbA1c < 7% (Figure 1 ). In addition, the carbohydrate counting system was associated with a higher probability of TIR > 70% (Table 3) and it was used more frequently by participants consuming a carbohydrate percentage > 50% (Figure 1 ). The use of the carbohydrate counting system therefore represents a key strategy for improving metabolic control and reaching the target TIR. Its use should continue to be recommended in the daily management of diabetes.",

Evaluating the effect of the macronutrient composition in patients using the same algorithm remains an area of investigation. Nevertheless, this study had many strengths including a multi-center design, data collected from many participants with well-characterized T1D, and use of the same analytical laboratory methods and food consumption measure. There was consistency in the training for parents, and the macronutrient intake calculations were conducted by the same dietitian for all the centers involved. Moreover, parents' ability to measure nutrient intake was tested before the study, which helped to eliminate any potential errors in assessing food consumption.
