The public health center recommended hospitalization because the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result was positive. On admission, the oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) level was 93% in room air. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) showed scattered ground-glass opacities and hyperdensities, respectively, in both lung fields. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia (severe illness), and dexamethasone 6 mg/daily was started on the same day. After the start of treatment, oxygen administration through nasal cannula was gradually tapered down from 2 L/min to 0.5 L/min. At 11:20 on the sixth day of hospitalization, the patient developed sudden chest pain. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed a complete atrioventricular block and ST-T elevation in II, III, aVF, and V3-V6 leads, leading to the diagnosis of STEMI.",

At 13:05, an emergency coronary angiography (CAG) was performed with an infection prevention strategy using N95 masks, goggles, sterile gowns, and gloves during the procedures in the catheterization laboratory, which revealed thrombotic occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). We subsequently performed an ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A guidewire was passed easily, and the thrombus was aspirated using a thrombus aspiration catheter. A large volume of mixed thrombus, mainly white thrombus, was collected, and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 2 was obtained (onset to reperfusion time: 148 min). After reperfusion, the chest pain resolved. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) revealed a massive thrombus in the mid to proximal RCA. To reduce the thrombus volume, a total of 960,000 units of urokinase were administered into the coronary artery via a microcatheter. Although the thrombus remained soon after PTCR, we completed the procedures without balloon dilation or stent implantation because the vessel diameters were large, and TIMI flow grade 3 was obtained ( Fig. 1 ). Since no atrial 8 fibrillation was documented on ECG monitoring during hospitalization and no intracardiac thrombus was observed on TTE before and after emergent CAG, we suspected STEMI due to primary coronary thrombosis.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary PCI was recommended as the standard treatment for hospitals with the ability to perform PCI [6] . With the spread of COVID-19 in Japan, it has been reported that the rate of primary PCI for STEMI was maintained at a high level in Japan [7] . The reason for this is not clear, but it may be because the number of patients with COVID-19 was relatively low. Conversely, as primary PCI has become more widespread and its outcomes have improved, PTCR has become less common in recent years, except in limited 13 cases. Although primary PCI with stents is undoubtedly the gold standard, a stent-less strategy is also used for stenosis of dilated vessels and thrombosed lesion. PTCR have been reported as a method to reduce the volume of thrombus, especially in patients with STEMI who also have a large thrombus burden [8] . The previous study demonstrated that a higher burden of thrombus was observed in patients with acute myocardial infarction combined with COVID-19 than in patients without COVID-19 [9] . There has also been a reported case where it was difficult to treat a patient with primary PCI due to massive thrombosis [10] . The advantage of PTCR over transvenous thrombolysis is that it allows selective and direct administration of anticoagulant agents after identification of the lesion, and recanalization can be confirmed soon after the procedure. PTCR can be performed before conventional PCI as an extension of the standard procedure and can be switched to balloon dilatation and stent implantation, as required. In patients with COVID-19, we consider that the etiology of STEMI may be primary thrombosis 14 due to immuno-thrombogenicity. In these cases, PTCR with or without transcatheter thrombus aspiration may be a useful treatment option.",
