            "text": "Modern basketball is the epitome of wisdom and adventure, and it is developing in the direction of \"physical combined skills, technical combined intelligence, speed combined with rhythm, high intensity, and high risk.\" Its development continues to reflect professionalism. Modern basketball is a global era basketball that is significantly different from original basketball or traditional basketball and has its own distinctive characteristics. We can see from the history of basketball development that it is a modern sports event and a type of global modern sports culture that has gradually matured and developed since the formation of modern society in the 1950s. Basketball has the characteristics of integration, appreciation, commercialization, production, and socialization. e basketball strategy is updated rapidly, and offense and defense are more popular. e athletic ability of basketball players is limited, affected by three factors: personal skills, team, and physical fitness. Natural factors can be considered the key to success. e development of modern basketball game culture makes physical training more and more important in basketball.",

Physical exercise is conducive to the growth of human bones and muscles, enhances cardiopulmonary function, improves the functional status of the blood circulation system, respiratory system, and digestive system, is conducive to the growth and development of the human body, improves disease resistance, and enhances the adaptability of organisms. As a hot technology, peak computing has been widely used in the commercial field. e main problem of the current system is the integration of different data and the collaboration between different platforms. Since the data belongs to different systems, a unified data model must be created.

            "text": "For the research of basketball physical training, experts at home and abroad have many works. Clemente's purpose is to make a useful synthesis of all the research studies of basketball SSCGS and prove the importance of these games to basketball training. Reviewed studies have shown that in the full game, limited dribbling, coaching encouragement, and the use of smaller formats in continuous training programs may increase heart rate response, blood lactate, and excitement [1] . Grabara compares the changes in spinal curvature between young male basketball players and nontraining controls before and after 2 years. e study included 10 basketball players and 11 untrained men [2] . e Rippstein plurimeter is used to determine the curvature of the anterior and posterior spine. Basketball players and their nontraining peers only differed in the first quantification of lumbar lordosis (P < 0.05) [3] . Wan and Shan established a deep learning and optimized ant colony algorithm model for basketball technical and tactical decision-making to solve the optimization problem of actual technical and tactical decision-making. is article uses video image-related algorithms. Get the shot frame settings and shot information of the ball. In this article, by analyzing multiple samples of multishot video, a shot frame detection algorithm is proposed. A mathematical model of the shooting frame is established, which can quickly and accurately locate the shooting frame and determine the penalty frame set [4] . Wang and Gao use machine learning technology to build a basketball feature recognition model. In addition, this research mainly takes the basketball characteristic information in the state of basketball goal as the starting point to compare and analyze the detection methods of target detection in the environment. Realize the construction of dynamic ellipsoid bounding box in the state of motion. In addition, this research designed a controlled experiment to verify the analysis of the research model. e research results show that the model proposed in this paper has a certain effect, which can improve the practical guidance of competition and basketball player training [5] . Tsai et al. proposed a VRbased basketball training system, including an independent VR device and a tablet computer. e system is designed to improve players' ability to understand offensive tactics and enable them to execute these tactics correctly. Evaluate the accuracy of the running path and hesitation time of each tactical step for each participant. e results show that the proposed system is useful for learning complex tactics [6] . Daniele et al. aim to evaluate the workload analysis of basketball practice: (1) the impact of the number of different players on physiological and technical needs; (2) the changes of players' reactions in the game over time; and (3) the relationship between the workload of players and their maturity and training age. Studies have shown that changes in the number of players involved will affect the workload of ball training, and the intensity of ball training varies from game to game. Finally, regardless of the player's maturity and training age, ball training can stimulate enough training stimulation [7] . ese studies provide some references for this article, but the relevant research time is too short and the reference is unknown, which makes the article not recognized. e problems in basketball physical training can be summarized as follows: poor understanding of basketball physical fitness theory, which leads to low efficiency of training behavior or even deviation from the goal. Perhaps it is a major factor in the large gap between Chinese college basketball team and that of European and American college basketball teams. On the basis of previous research studies, from the perspectives of coaches and athletes, I investigate and study the current situation of physical training for basketball teams in Beijing colleges and universities and make suggestions based on the existing problems to provide rules for the physical training of college basketball teams in the future. e innovations of this article are reflected in the following: (1) the edge computing method of basketball sports training is proposed, and the sports training and the Internet of ings are introduced at the same time; (2) based on the optimization of the Internet of ings model, the research and analysis are carried out, and the current situation and countermeasures of physical exercise in college sports basketball are discussed.",

In addition, the localized processing of the service can make the service closer to the user itself and the wireless network so as to realize the user's perception and utilization of the network location, network load, and wireless resource utilization rate and effectively improve the user experience [10] . e main difference between the MEC network architecture and the traditional cloud computing network architecture is that the MEC network architecture deploys MEC equipment at the edge of the network close to the user [11] . In the MEC network architecture, as the core part of the network, MEC equipment is mainly used to process services locally at the edge of the network. By utilizing the computing resources and storage resources of MEC equipment, the MEC network architecture can meet the needs of users in 5G networks for low latency, location awareness, and high reliability. In addition, MEC equipment can cache the content processed on it and can actively cache related content from the cloud data center based on the characteristics of surrounding users, thereby further reducing service response delay and improving user experience [12] . e edge calculation method is shown in Figure 1 .",

To have a strong physique, exercise is the best method, but blind exercise not only fails to produce results, but may cause injury, so physical exercise must master the correct method to achieve the purpose of physical exercise. e exercise methods include repetitive exercise. is article combines its own practical experience and extracts some methods and methods that are relatively in line with energy metabolism and project characteristics from the many physical training methods and methods of basketball events for experimental research. In addition, from the release of basketball crosssports and cross-border selection policies and the development trend of basketball, it shows that physical training plays an increasingly important role in basketball training. How to formulate a reasonable basketball physical training plan to improve basketball specific skills, therefore, improving the level of basketball competition, has become a major difficulty in basketball training [16, 17] . Among them, the invention of basketball is also very interesting. Basketball was invented by the American James Naismith in 1891. At that time, he was teaching at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, MA, USA.

In the simulation process of this article, the change rate of the moving position of the sensing layer node of the Internet of ings is set from 0 m/s to 35 m/s, with an increment of 5 m/s each time. In this process of gradual change, the performance of the gateway accessoriented routing protocols GARP and ODTM protocols proposed in this paper have declined to varying degrees. e comparison of the average end-to-end delay between the gateway and the source node at different rates of node location changes is shown in Figure 5(a) . As the rate of node location changes increases, the routing facing gateway access the average end-to-end delay between the gateway and the source node of the GARP and ODTM protocols has increased to varying degrees. is is because as the rate of node location changes increases, the network topology changes more drastically, resulting in frequent links the disconnection fails, which increases the number of restarts of the route discovery process, which increases the average end-to-end delay between the gateway and the source node.

However, the benefits of this method are gradually reflected when the number of connections increases and the load on the network becomes heavier. is method means that the optimized cluster and cluster head election algorithm selected by the gateway takes into account the energy problem of the node, and the selected cluster head node will not have less remaining energy. At this time, the number and quality of gateways are both effective and reasonable due to the multigateway and multipath transmission method. e average end-to-end delay between source nodes is lower than adding the previous two cases because the performance of the path selected by this method is more superior, and the load balance is better than the previous two. Figure 6 (a) shows the packet delivery rate between the gateway and the source node in three different situations. It can be seen from the figure that the packet delivery rate between the gateway and the source node decreases with the continuous increase of the number of connections in the three different cases, but the magnitude of the decrease is different. e packet delivery rate between the gateway and the source node is the lowest in the single-path transmission method using only one gateway. In Figure 6 (b), we can see how the parameter of the network overhead during the transmission between the gateway and the source node changes with the number of connections in the above three cases. It can be seen from the figure that the network overhead of the three methods of gateway and source node transmission decreases with the continuous increase of the number of connections, but the multipath transmission method and the multigateway multipath are simply used by one gateway. When the gateway and source node of the Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience transmission method transmit, the network overhead tends to decrease with the increase of the number of network connections.",

In a basketball game, every pass and every shot has extremely high requirements for upper limb strength, especially in the case of fierce confrontation, stalemate, excessive physical exertion, psychological and physical changes, the effect is particularly effective protrude. In basketball games, passing, layups, and shooting are not only dependent on the strength of the arm, but also rely on the strength of the fingers and wrist to control the rotation, height, strength, and stability of the ball. It can be seen that the strength of the upper limbs is particularly important in the basketball game.",

Whether it is cloud, fog, or edge computing, it is only a method or mode for realizing the computing technology required by the Internet of ings and smart manufacturing. Strictly speaking, there is no essential difference between fog computing and edge Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience computing. Both are calculations provided close to the field application. In its essence, they are all relative to cloud computing. However, due to its high application requirements, this computer architecture cannot be promoted during its use.

Emerging and more mobile applications will benefit from MEC by moving their intensive functions from MEC servers to cloud computing. For edge laptop users, we assume that all tasks required for computing are independent of each other. On this basis, a new perspective of the transfer process is given; that is, it is not decided whether to proceed alone. Delete the task, but authorized to perform the task. On this basis, by writing a load model that combines the two factors Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience of containment and power consumption, the optimization problem of load reduction is proposed. Subsequently, the low-time complexity binary particle swarm optimization algorithm and the Johnson algorithm in the dual-engine design are used to optimize the problem. Finally, the algorithm was verified by simulation tests, and the Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience performance was compared with other algorithms. Regarding the binary particle swarm optimization algorithm, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is an algorithm for solving continuous space problems. However, if you want to apply it to the feature selection problem to find the necessary 0/1 strings, some minor modifications have to be made to solve the discrete space problem. Of course, one of the simplest methods is to set a threshold value for the position value. If the threshold value is exceeded, set it to 1, otherwise it is set to 0, so that the N-dimensional position vector of the continuous space is converted into the 0/1 string of the discrete space. However, it does not make sense to explain this, so the binary particle swarm optimization algorithm appeared. Its improvement to the particle swarm optimization algorithm is as follows: the speed formula remains unchanged, a sigmoid function is added, and the position formula is redefined.",

Among these influencing factors are teachers and students. e relationship and communication status are an important factor that needs to be paid attention to by all parties. In the teaching, the phenomenon of \"emphasizing knowledge accumulation, neglecting knowledge application,\" \"emphasizing theory instillation, neglecting practical teaching operation\" is common; in professional course teaching, \"emphasizing professional knowledge, neglecting compound knowledge\" and \"less forward-looking courses, less reflecting on physical education,\" \"new achievements in the field.\" e teaching method is relatively traditional, and the teaching method is single.
