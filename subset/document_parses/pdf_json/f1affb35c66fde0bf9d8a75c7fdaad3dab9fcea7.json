            "text": "The spread of COVID-19 in Italy resulted in the implementation of a lockdown that obligated the first time the general populace to remain at home for approximately two months. This lockdown interrupted citizens' professional and educational activities, in addition to closing shops, offices and educational institutions. The resulting changes in people's daily routines and activities induced unexpected changes in their thoughts, feelings and attitudes, in addition to altering their life perceptions. Consequently, the present study explores how young adults perceived their lives under lockdown during the final week of March 2020, when the reported number of daily coronavirus infections reached its peak in Italy. The research was carried out among 293 university students (234 women and 59 men) with an average age of 20.85 years old (SD = 3.23). The researchers asked participants to describe the emotions, thoughts and experiences that characterized their time under lockdown. The study analyzed specific narratives related to time and space using grounded theory methodology, which was applied using Atlas 8 software, leading to the creation of 68 codes. The study organized these codes into three specific categories: confined in the present, confined in the past, and striving toward one's goals. Finally, the researchers also created a core-category labeled \"continuity of being.\" The results showed that the closure of open spaces caused a division in participants' perceptions of time continuity, with many viewing themselves as feeling fragmented and as living the present in a static and fixed way. Additionally, participants also saw the present as being discontinuous from the past, while, simultaneously, projecting toward the future and the changes it might bring. Finally, this study examined further implications surrounding individual projecting among young people in greater depth.",

For example, in his biography, Nelson Mandela (1994) sheds light on his many years in prison, describing how, even in the worst detention, he never gave up on his dreams and hopes for freedom, while constantly developing plans for future action. Indeed, many psychological researchers have investigated individuals' attitudes toward temporal perspectives. For example, Stolarski et al. (2018) examined the long history of time and its deep roots in philosophy and physics. Additionally, Zimbardo and Boyd (2015) defined time perspectives as individual subjective experiences through which each person refers to the psychological concepts of the past, present and future. Zimbardo and Boyd (2015) specifically elaborated five individual attitudes toward time, encompassing future, past-negative, past-positive, present-hedonistic, and present-fatalistic, which are correlated with differing levels of well-being. In particular, individuals possessing past-positive and present-hedonistic time perspectives are thought to have higher levels of well-being, while future time perspectives are associated with optimism, hope and an internal locus of control.",

Moreover, the seminal contribution of Pichon-Rivi\u00e8re on time and space in everyday life pointed out that everything that happens in daily life takes place in a given space and at a given time. Furthermore, as expressed by Quiroga and Racedo, these routine events possess a \"rhythm\" that is shaped by \"the complex social relationships that govern the life of human beings in a certain historical era\" (2012, p.18 ). In addition, external events alter how time and space frame individuals' daily lives and undermine our concrete conditions of existence. However, \"only when everyday life hurts us, when there is no more pleasure or when we experience a crisis, [do] we start to think about it\" (Quiroga and Racedo, 2012, p.18) .",

            "text": "In principle, from an ecological perspective, individual dimensions and social events influence behaviors, as every external change modifies people's reference frameworks, and, in turn, these changes alter one's internal world and their world perceptions (Lewin, 1943) . Earlier research has considered how particular sudden and unexpected events, such as serious illnesses, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, wars, geographical relocation or temporary time constraints influence time perspectives (e.g., Fung et al., 1999; Fung and Carstensen, 2004) . Indeed, some studies have found that well-being is also strictly related to subjective experiences of these events (Petrillo et al., 2014) . From a phenomenological point of view, illness, as with any other critical event, causes a break in one's sense of continuity, in addition to dramatic experiences of discontinuity. This perspective underlines a crisis of the subject's sense-making systems and the necessity to pursue meaning, in order to interpret ongoing experiences. Moreover, critical events and illness represent elements of discontinuity that saturate the present and the entirety of sense-making processes. During the perturbation phase, time is organized through extremely subjective modalities, appearing to be confusing and inconsistent at first glance. However, a deeper analysis regarding the effects of illness on time perceptions, such as the dyscrasia of the temporal order, indicates that time perceptions are the result of the ongoing sense-making processes concerning what is happening at that moment. In this regard, how illness affects time perceptions involves not only meaning construction in response to the rupture of canonical states, but also a separate process of crisis subjectification. In other words, illness-influenced time perceptions result in significant sense-making processes aimed at the construction of these perceptions (Freda et al., 2015, p. 209) . As an example, people with chronic diseases when they suffer the unpredictable vulnerability of their illness are considering their selves under the Damocles Syndrome, in allusion to the Greek mythological tale about an imminent and ever-present peril (Gonzalez Leone et al., 2019) . Consequently, i.e., oncology patients are worried and anxious about eventual cancer recurrence comprising a second pathology related to impending distress or possible danger that may materialize at an unknown time in the future.",

Additionally, for some authors, narration also serves as a semiotic device mediating the connection between continuity and discontinuity, aimed not only at carrying out the previously mentioned functions, but also at creating new dynamic relations among them (Freda et al., 2015) . Therefore, for participants, documenting their COVID-19 lockdown stories was an opportunity to reflect upon their lives that also acted as a resilience tool. In fact, opportunities mediated by creative expression, group discussions and shared actions aimed at individual and social awareness are a significant goal in community building, training and education (Carnevale et al., forthcoming; Arcidiacono et al., 2016; Di Napoli et al., 2019a) . As a result, creating spaces in which people share their personal stories and ask questions about their common experiences is a preliminary goal of community psychology-based intervention strategies, while subsequently detecting meaning and symbolization in their interactions is the next step in promoting social awareness and community building (Arcidiacono, 2016; . Feeling part of a community where you share projects and consider the response of institutional members and referents reliable favors collective self-efficacy and the management of stress generated by this unforeseen emergency (Procentese et al., 2020) .",

Additionally, it is important to highlight the possibility that psychology students likely possess deeper reflective attitudes in comparison with students from other majors. Furthermore, the ethnic and geographical makeup of the sample was limited and was comprised solely of White university students living in a specific region of Italy. Therefore, any interpretation of the study results should be considered in conjunction with differing national and international contexts. Moreover, the researchers recommend that future studies also consider connections among young adults' feelings regarding their physical and psychological well-being and their time perceptions. This study collected participants' stories during the week with the highest number of reported COVID-19 cases in Italy; thus, it would be interesting to compare young peoples' feelings and perceptions of their time under lockdown with their experiences during its de-escalation. The researchers further recommend that future studies explore any associations among time perceptions and well-being or negative emotions, in addition to comparing time perceptions across different phases of life.",

In this regard, the study findings help us recognize the impact of limits on one's actions and/or mobility on individuals' psyches. The young adult study participants described their lockdown experiences through varying perceptions of time, with some of them reliving their pasts, while others focused on rethinking and shaping their futures. The COVID-19 pandemic altered participants' lives in a spatial sense, relegating them to spend the days under lockdown reliving past connections, renewing contact with old friends and lovers and redefining their future expectations.",

In order to survive confinement in such a desolate space, the prisoner, Kawni, described how his body lived confined in prison, suffering from cold and hunger, while allowing his soul the opportunity to continue life far away from these deplorable conditions. Therefore, this bodysoul divide allows individuals' spirits to survive in the face of repression and limits to individual freedoms. Reflecting upon this extreme situation aids in understanding how individual experiences of forced confinement may result in different time and space perceptions.

Furthermore, home confinement under lockdown implied an absence of close physical contact and the presence of other people in our lives. Therefore, maintaining continuity with past experiences and future goals, without becoming trapped in the present, is a crucial need and a psychological resilience strategy to maintain life continuity. Tools and spaces for sharing during emergencies, became a goal. It will help to lower distress and favor a recovery path of continuity with the past and with new future perspectives. The continuity of time and space to meet and interact is a basic need that characterizes young people's life contributing to their well-being (Di Napoli et al., 2019b) .
