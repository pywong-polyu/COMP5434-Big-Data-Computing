The COVID-19 pandemic, as declared by the WHO on March 2020, has led to over 770,000 cases worldwide reported at the end of March 2020, spreading on a logarithmic scale in Europe and the USA. As the need for hospitalization among symptomatic cases is \u223c10% globally, with an increased need for intensive care unit admission and 3% mortality, hospitals have started to intensively reduce elective activities including surgery to prepare for the high numbers of admissions (1) .",

By gathering all the above data, a rapid risk assessment can be completed for patient triage and decision making based on various pandemic surgery guidelines which share common principles (13) . Conclusively, as every surgery entails higher patient and HCW risk, unnecessary exposure to general anesthesia and surgery should be avoided during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
