We reviewed 245 pregnancies complicated by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection across 48 studies listed on PubMed and MedRxiv. The most common clinical presentations were fever (55.9%), cough (36.3%), fatigue (11.4%), and dyspnea (12.7%). Only 4.1% of patients developed respiratory distress. Of all patients, 89.0% delivered via cesarean section (n = 201), with a 33.3% rate of gestational complications, a 35.3% rate of preterm delivery, and a concerning 2.5% rate of stillbirth delivery or neonatal death. Among those tested, 6.45% of newborns were reported positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Relative to known viral infections, the prognosis for pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 is good, even in the absence of specific antiviral treatment. However, neonates and acute patients, especially those with gestational or preexisting comorbidities, must be actively managed to prevent the severe outcomes being increasingly reported in the literature.",

Chief among them is the management for pregnant women who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Pregnant women are prone to a range of fetal and maternal complications that could impact the outcome of any concurrent infection [1] . The first trimester bears a major risk for miscarriage and fetal developmental abnormalities. The late second and third trimesters carry an increased likelihood for the development of maternal conditions, such as gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders, which contribute to maternal morbidity and premature birth.",

            "text": "Cells at the maternal-fetal interface play crucial roles in fetal development and regulation of the maternal immune response [2] . Viral infections can interfere with the function of these cells and ultimately impair placental function [2] . Over the years, many studies have investigated the maternal and neonatal outcomes in the setting of several recent epidemics such as influenza A (H1N1), SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). A case-control study (deaths and recovered) conducted in Brazil on women infected with influenza A (H1N1) reported a higher rate of fetal deaths and preterm births among women who eventually died as a result of the infection, compared to women who had recovered. Further, recovered cases had more favorable neonatal outcomes following discharge [3] . The authors reported that early antiviral treatment (48 to 72 hours of symptom onset) is a protective factor, whereas having a previous visit to a healthcare provider for an influenza episode prior to hospital admission was a risk factor for death [3] . A systematic review conducted in 2017 on maternal influenza infection reported preterm birth rates (prior to 37 weeks of gestation) of 11.4%, 7.7%, 7.1%, and 6.3% in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Norway, respectively [4] . In pregnancies affected by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the rate of preterm births was reported as 29%, which is comparable to a rate of 13% for preterm births in noninfected pregnant women [5] . Among infants born to mothers with postpartum RSV infection, 57% were infected with RSV [5] . A systematic review published in 2020 compared maternal and neonatal outcomes among patients infected with either SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, or MERS. When compared to SARS-CoV and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 was associated with the highest rate of preterm birth, fetal distress, perinatal death, and C-section deliveries [6] . Additionally, no Apgar scores < 7 were reported in any of the SARS-CoV and MERS cases, whereas 2.4% of SARS-CoV-2 cases had Apgar scores < 7 [6] . There was no evidence of vertical transmission in any of the three infections [6] .",

Pregnancy-induced changes to immunity, such as reduction in cell-mediated cytotoxicity, diminished lymphokine response, and reduction in lymphocyte proliferative response, further add to the prognostic picture of pneumonia in pregnant women [8] .

We then reviewed the results for relevance and included the articles that reported on SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant patients. This search strategy resulted in 48 case reports and articles from the primary literature that we included in this review ( Figure 1 ). We extracted all information about patient characteristics, symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging studies. We also gathered the relevant data about the pregnancy course such as delivery method, gestational complications, and neonatal outcomes.

In the studies that reported laboratory findings, 147 pregnant women were included, and among them, 49% had elevated CRP, 31.3% had lymphopenia, 28.6% had neutrophilia, and 12.2% had leukocytosis. Other laboratory abnormalities included thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, abnormal liver enzymes, decreased albumin, low hemoglobin (Hb), elevated alkaline phosphate, eosinopenia, elevated uric acid, elevated ferritin, pancytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), low fibrinogen, and progressive coagulopathy. [10, 17] . Ground glass opacities (GGO) were reported in the majority of studies. Mixed GGO with consolidation were more common among pregnant SARS-CoV-2 patients in comparison to nonpregnant SARS-CoV-2 patients [10] . Lee and colleagues also reported GGO with consolidation [15] . In addition to multiple bilateral consolidations, bilateral pleural effusion were observed [18] . Given the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, lung ultrasound is a valuable tool in confirming diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as monitoring disease progression [19] . Lung ultrasound eliminates the radiation risk and avoids the incidence of falsenegative results associated with other diagnostic tests. As outlined by Moro and colleagues, specific guidelines can be followed when performing lung ultrasound for pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 [19] .",

In others, C-section was performed proactively due to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Presumably, C-sections minimize cross-infection and reduce maternal exertion during labor, as per certain recommendations [26] . Due to the uneven distribution of C-sections as opposed to vaginal delivery, it is not possible to comment on differences in neonatal and maternal outcomes between vaginal delivery and C-sections in SARS-CoV-2 pregnancies. Importantly, there are no contraindications for vaginal delivery as evidenced by the uncomplicated vaginal delivery in at least five patients [27, 28] .

Seven fetuses (2.8%) exhibited fetal distress, which was the indication for preterm delivery in some cases.

            "text": "Pregnancy, in particular, the third trimester, is associated with changes in lung physiology, such as decreases in ERV and FRC volumes, and increases in respiratory resistance [34] . A prime example is the fact that pregnant women infected with the H1N1 virus during the 2009 epidemic were at a significantly higher risk of complications and hospitalization than nonpregnant women [35, 36] . Hence, an increased rate of respiratory complications, in addition to maternal and neonatal complications, could be expected in pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The absence of widespread respiratory complications is surprising and suggests that a larger number of patients will help better understand the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy.",

There exists only eight cases of maternal mortality and ten other cases of patients developing respiratory distress [12] [13] [14] . At the time of writing, there exists only reports of severe complications during late pregnancy and no reports of termination due to early congenital defects. In the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, miscarriage rates were reported to be as high as 50% for infected women in the first trimester [37] . Similarly, infection with the seasonal influenza virus is associated with higher miscarriage and maternal mortality rates than the noninfected population [1, 35] . It should be noted however that miscarriage could be due to the maternal response to the infection, rather than a direct placental effect induced by the infection [38] . In the case of SARS-CoV-2, it is highly likely that the higher rate of stillbirths and IUFD cases could be attributed to fever. In contrast to these viral infections, the outcomes for SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women in the first trimester are reassuring.",

Unfortunately, the rate of stillbirth and neonatal death among this group was 2.5%, significantly higher than the rate among the general population. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was an expected finding in this group due to its prevalence in prior SARS infections during pregnancy [40] .

(n = 1) reported scattered multiple patchy infiltrates in both lungs, and Lee et al. (n = 1) reported left lower/middle lobe consolidation and increased vascular marking, while Breslin et al. (n = 1) reported mild pulmonary vascular congestion with no consolidation or effusion [12, 15, 16]. All three women were of similar GA (mean 36 weeks). 3.4. Computed Tomography (CT) Scan. Typical signs of viral pneumonia were frequently reported, with most patients having bilateral lung involvement. CT findings did not show signs of worsening pneumonia postpartum. However, with disease progression, Zhu et al. reported that lesions merged into strips and Liu et al. observed a paving pattern and consolidation",
