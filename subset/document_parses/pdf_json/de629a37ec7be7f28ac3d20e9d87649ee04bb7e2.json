            "text": "Background: Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) have problems in everyday tasks such as walking and climbing stairs due to a combination of neuromuscular impairments such as spasticity, muscle weakness, reduced joint flexibility and poor coordination. Development of evidence-based interventions are in pivotal role in the development of better targeted rehabilitation of CP, and thus in maintaining their motor function and wellbeing. Our aim is to investigate the efficacy of an individually tailored, multifaceted exercise intervention (EXECP) in children and young adults with CP. EXECP is composed of strength, flexibility and gait training. Furthermore, this study aims to verify the short-term retention of the adaptations three months after the end of the EXECP intervention. Methods: Twenty-four children and young adults with spastic CP will be recruited to participate in a 9-month research project with a 3-month training intervention, consisting of two to three 90-min sessions per week. In each session, strength training for the lower limbs and trunk muscles, flexibility training for the lower limbs and inclined treadmill gait training will be performed. We will evaluate muscle strength, joint flexibility, neuromuscular and cardiometabolic parameters. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design with two pre-tests and two post-tests all interspaced by three months is used. In addition to the CP participants, 24 typically developing age and sexmatched participants will perform the two pre-tests (i.e. no intervention) to provide normative data.",

            "text": "Cerebral palsy (CP) describes a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, that are attributed to nonprogressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain [1] . The spastic-type CP accounts for approximately 80% of all CP cases [2] [3] [4] and is characterized by hyper-resistance [5] which has three components: stretch hyperreflexia (i.e. velocity dependent involuntary activation), involuntary background activation and altered muscle-tendon mechanical properties. Muscle-tendon unit mechanical alterations [6] [7] [8] can cause severe reduction in joint range of motion (i.e. contractures) and lead to bone deformation [9] [10] [11] . The development of contractures does not seem to be caused solely by hyperreflexia [12, 13] ; rather muscle inactivity and impaired muscle growth seems to be important factors [14, 15] . Furthermore, another debilitating symptom in CP is a decreased muscle strength [6, [16] [17] [18] that severely hinders the ability to perform tasks such as walking and climbing stairs [19] [20] [21] . These secondary clinical symptoms induce lower physical activity (PA) levels in people with CP [22, 23] and lead to higher levels of body adiposity and other cardiometabolic risk factors [16, 24, 25] . Therefore, although the initial brain lesion is nonprogressive in CP, secondary symptoms such as reduced muscle strength and joint range of motion (ROM) typically further deteriorate with time, increasing sedentarism and creating a cycle of inactivity and loss of function [26, 27] . Thus, well targeted therapeutic interventions to reduce these secondary problems and maintain motor function are in pivotal role to enable independent mobility in individuals with CP and thus support their lifelong health and wellbeing.",

Furthermore, the effectiveness of strength training complying with known training guidelines [25, 30, 31] to increase muscle strength in individuals with CP has been well demonstrated [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Nevertheless, these interventions have reported no changes [33, [35] [36] [37] [38] or improvement in motor function [32, 34, 35] . This controversy seems to arise from two main reasons. Firstly, functional tasks involve a complex interaction between muscle strength, joint flexibility (i.e. maximum joint ROM) and motor coordination. Secondly, the neural and morphological adaptations are highly specific to the strength training methods [35, 41] , which varied in these studies. A final remark is that every day functional tasks involve activation of several muscle groups spanning across joints. Thus, an adequate intervention should train all relevant muscles with naturalistic patterns of neural activation.",

Only few strength training studies have measured components of hyper-resistance longitudinally and reported no changes after the intervention [33, 34, 37, 38] . Furthermore, the term \"spasticity\" is often used under varied definitions and assessment methods [43] . For example, the modified Ashworth Scale [44] utilized in two of these studies [33, 34] is a subjective assessment of resistance to passive movement [45] . Scholtes et al. [37, 38] evaluated hyperreflexia by assessing the presence of a catch (i.e. sudden increase in muscle tone) in response to a single fast (< 1 s) passive stretch, being also a subjective measure of the velocity-dependent resistance to passive movement. Both measurements fail to differentiate between the different components of hyper-resistance. Therefore, although it is generally accepted that strength training does not increase \"spasticity\" [46] , no longitudinal study has reported an objective, valid and reliable measurement of hyper-resistance.",

Passive stretching has the advantage of not restricting joint movement for a prolonged time as opposed to serial casting or splints, however, its effectiveness to increase joint flexibility in people with CP is unclear [48, 49] . Theis et al. [50] demonstrated that passive dorsiflexion stretching caused an acute increase in flexibility due to the elongation of both muscle and tendon. However, comprehensive longitudinal data is scarce. Theis et al. [51] showed an increase in dorsiflexion flexibility after a 6-week passive stretching intervention (4 days per week, 15 min per day). Zhao et al. [52] demonstrated that passive dorsiflexion stretching and active ankle joint movement within a 6-week intervention was able to increase fascicle length of both soleus (Sol) and medial gastrocnemius (MG). However, the study did not have a control group and the sample was composed of children, thus maturation may have been an intervening variable. The disparity between the limited scientific understanding of stretching effectiveness for CP and its widespread utilization must be addressed swiftly.",

A recent literature review has concluded that gait training is safe, feasible and effective to improve walking ability in children and young adults with CP [54] . The incline treadmill setup seems particularly effective as it forces a greater ankle dorsiflexion in the swing phase and serves as a dynamic passive stretch for the ankle plantarflexors in the stance phase [55, 56] . Daily gait training with an inclined treadmill has been demonstrated to increase walking speed, dorsiflexion strength and active ROM, and reduce ankle stiffness in only four to six weeks [57, 58] . No changes in ankle passive flexibility were found in these studies, however the decrease in passive stiffness suggests that the muscle-tendon unit is adaptable, but further improvements in ROM may require a longer period of training. It is noteworthy that altering gait pattern and automatizing it for use in everyday over ground walking may require intense individualized feedback, so the person is aware or is at least guided towards the correct pattern (e.g. verbal feedback, biofeedback/augmented reality; [54] ).",

            "text": "The present study has three aims: 1) to investigate the effects of the EXECP intervention on the following variables: gait performance (primary outcome), physical activity level, lower limb muscle strength and joint flexibility, gross motor function, cardiometabolic risk factors, neuromuscular parameters for triceps surae muscle, cortical processing of proprioceptive stimuli evoked by passive ankle dorsiflexions, tibialis anterior (TA) cortico-muscular and intramuscular coherence; 2) to evaluate the retention of the adaptations induced by the intervention after three months; 3) to compare CP and typically developing (TD) individuals in all studied variables using group and matched (age/sex) individual data. The EXECP intervention is composed of a three-month individually tailored exercise intervention containing strength training targeting lower limb and trunk muscles, combined with stretching of diagnosed short muscles and gait training. The primary hypothesis is that the EXECP intervention will enhance gait performance by: a) increasing walking distance in the 6 min walking test; b) increasing ankle dorsiflexion during the swing and stance phase of gait; c) increasing maximal walking velocity, joint net moments and ranges of motion in the lower limb joints. The secondary hypothesis are that the EXECP intervention will: d) increase habitual PA; e) increase maximal isometric and concentric torque and rate of force development for the trained muscles; f) not affect cardiometabolic risk factors such as arterial stiffness, insulin resistance, blood lipids and body fat content; g) increase gross motor function measure (GMFM; [19] ) score; h) increase lower limb joint flexibility of the trained muscle groups; i) decrease ankle plantarflexors average joint stiffness and increase joint energy (i.e. area under the torque-angle curve) during slow passive stretching; j) decrease antagonist muscle electromyography (EMG) during maximal voluntary isometric and concentric plantarflexion and dorsiflexion; k) not change spinal mechanisms related to hyperreflexia in the Sol muscle (i.e. Hoffmann-reflex (H-reflex), post-activation depression (PAD) ratio, tonic stretch reflex threshold (TSRT)); l) increase amplitude of cortical responses to proprioceptive stimulation, recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the primary somatosensory cortex; m) increase cortico-muscular coherence between cortical MEG and TA EMG signals; n) increase intramuscular coherence within TA muscle during a submaximal isometric dorsiflexion and during the swing phase of the gait cycle. No changes in any of the studied variables are expected during the 3months control period, except if the participant is going through the growth spurt. After the 3-month maintenance period, the values of the studied variables are expected to be in between the control and post intervention values (project aim B). All study variables are hypothesized to show differences between the TD and CP groups (project aim C). It is expected that the comprehensive assessment battery of neuromuscular, brain, cardiometabolic and functional parameters will add valuable information about how people with CP adapt to exercise.",

The TD age and sex-matched control group will be tested in the two pre-tests without the intervention. The nonconcurrent multiple baseline design was selected over the randomized controlled trial (RCT) because the participants inside the inclusion criteria are expected to form a highly heterogeneous group regarding the studied variables (e.g. motor control, muscle strength, joint flexibility and gait mechanics), and randomly dividing the sample into two groups is not likely to result in two comparable groups. The chosen experimental design circumvents the expected high variability in the studied variables by allowing the subjects to be their own controls. Additionally, it allows performing the EXECP intervention all year-round, avoiding systematic seasonal influences to affect the study variables (e.g. vacations, seasons [61] ;). During the participation in the project, both groups will perform their normal activities (i.e. physiotherapy and/or sport activities), with the instruction of maintaining the number of sessions and activity type as stable as possible. Exceptionally during the intervention period, a reduction in the volume of the activities may be necessary to avoid overloading the participants. Any important deviations from the activities done during the control period will be reported. The first author will be responsible for all tests, and it is not possible to blind him to group allocation. Testing procedures were defined in detail to ensure consistency. The outcome data is quantitative and objective, with little possibility to suffer from observer bias. However, because the tester will obviously hope for better results in the Post-tests, no data analysis will be performed before the data collection is done (except for the flexibility tests). Thus, the tester will not have any knowledge of the results and will be focused on implementing the tests according to the protocol.",

This composition was chosen because single joint exercises allows greater loading control minimizing compensatory movements [24, 64] , whereas multi-joint exercises offer a mixture of strength and motor control training that may be beneficial for motor function. The strength training program has two protocols (A/B), with a minimum of 7 exercises targeting lower limb and trunk muscles. However, depending on the speed that exercises can be performed, which varies considerably between GMFCS levels, 7 to 10 exercises may be performed in every session. The protocols are trained weekly in the order AB (2 sessions per week) or an alternating pattern of ABA/BAB (3 sessions per week). Ankle plantarflexors will be trained with seated and standing calf raises. Ankle dorsiflexors will be trained utilizing a rubber band resistance against the dorsiflexion movement. Additionally, TA will also be trained isometrically during a hip flexion exercise, in which the participant laying supine must flex the hip against the rubber band resistance placed on the forefoot. Manual resistance may be used instead of the rubber band in case the trainer perceives it as easier to apply the resistance during the entire ROM. The thigh muscles will be trained utilizing seated knee extensor and knee flexor machines. Additionally, lower limb muscles will be trained using the leg press and squat holding with both hands an adjustable support. A dense foam ball may be placed between the participant's knees to prevent hip adduction during leg press and squat. Exercises will be done mostly unilaterally due to strength differences between limbs (80-100% of total training volume), except the squat which will mostly be trained bilaterally. Bilateral training may be performed if exercise technique is correct and limb loading appears similar; based on the participant's perception of fatigue/effort and the trainer's visual evaluation. Trunk and hip flexors will be trained isometrically with the hollow rocks exercise, in which the participant lies supine on the floor and must lift the legs slightly above the floor (i.e. hip and trunk flexion, knee extension). Trunk extensors will be trained isometrically using an inclined (30-45\u00b0) roman chair. Table 1 describes the positioning, target muscles and kinesiology of each exercise.",

This training load has been shown adequate to increase muscle strength and mass, and it is very safe as the intensity is approximately 50% of 1 repetition maximum [67] . Furthermore, people with CP usually perform strength exercises with fast concentric bursts and have difficulty in controlling slow eccentric muscle actions. Thus, this protocol also tackles an important motor control deficit in CP. In the second block, the volume is maintained while the intensity is increased by reducing the concentric movement duration to 1 s and increasing the rest to 90 s. In the third block, training volume and rest are maintained, but the sets are increased to four while the repetitions are decreased to 6, concentric muscle actions are now done as fast as possible while eccentric muscle action duration is reduced to 2 s. Thus, concentric power is trained, and the modifications permits further increases in exercise intensity. Table 2 depicts the training load progression during the intervention.",

Furthermore, CP joint ROM is often reduced [69] and muscle weakness is present [24] . Thus, allowing CP participants to perform the strength exercises by themselves leads to a movement with a smaller joint ROM (as compared to the total possible active ROM), and the non-optimum part of the torqueangle curve is not trained. Since strength gains are generally higher at the trained angles (i.e. length-specific adaptations [70, 71] ;) and increasing the torque production If the exercise is too hard, leaning on the bars and helping with the arms will be allowed. If the exercise is too easy, it will be done in the leg press machine in the whole active curve seems very reasonable to allow functional benefits, an assisted training procedure will be adopted. The trainer will actively help the participant on the concentric phase of the movement in the positions in which the participant is not able to perform by himself. The exercise resistance will be selected based on the participant's strength on the optimal angles, thus the trainer will always be assisting on non-optimal angles, and never increasing the resistance. The eccentric phase will be performed unassisted, but constant feedback about movement velocity will be given. Due to the assistance during every repetition, no 8 or 6 repetition maximum test will be performed to adjust the weight, rather the trainer will frequently ask the participant to try and perform one more repetition, if successful, the weight will be increased for the next set. Whenever a participant is unable to perform a minimum concentric ROM, the protocol will be adjusted to include an isometric muscle action of 3 s in each repetition. Thus, it will be a small concentric movement, followed by the isometric hold phase and then the eccentric phase. If during the intervention the concentric movement increases, the isometric part will be removed. At the start of each training session, the trainer will ask the participant if any adverse events were experienced after the previous session. Participants will be constantly reminded to provide immediate feedback about any pain or discomfort during the training sessions.",

One and two-joint hip flexors will be stretched in the Modified Thomas Test position [72] . The participant lies supine on a table holding one of the lower limbs in full hip flexion (assistance may be provided), while the other leg hangs outside the table (i.e. hip extension). The only difference between the stretches is that the trainer will apply the hip extension torque at the distal thigh with the knee joint positioned either in full flexion (two-joint stretch) or in a relaxed position (one-joint stretch). The seated butterfly stretch will be utilized to stretch the hip adductors. The participant will have his back supported on a wall, hips externally rotated, knees flexed and the soles of the feet in contact. The trainer will use his knees to keep the participant's feet in position while pressing down the thighs causing hip abduction. Hamstring stretch will be performed in supine position, the trainer will secure the untrained leg flat against the floor, then flexes the participant's hip approximately to 90\u00b0and applies a knee extension torque at the posterior aspect of the shank. No flexibility training will be performed for the triceps surae muscle group because of the following reasons: 1) lack of feasibility to execute the selected stretching protocol bilaterally for all tested muscles (session duration would greatly exceed 90 min); 2) the inclined gait training forces the ankle joint into dorsiflexion during the stance phase, working as a passive dynamic stretch. To check if the gait intervention by itself can change flexibility, it seemed reasonable to avoid stretching triceps surae and to focus on the other muscle groups.",

The test consists of 6 trials of 1 min, in which participants must walk back and forth at a maximum safe and controlled walking speed. Participants are instructed to disregard the force plates (i.e. not modify the gait to step on them) and to inform in case they are feeling tired. A preparatory activity of 2 min with progressively higher walking speeds will be performed before the test. Rest periods of 1-2 min between trials based on the participant's feedback will be given. Each trial can be stopped at any time for adjustments or resting, nonetheless a total of 6 min of walking will be recorded.",

Participants will be seated with the knee joint fully extended, hip joint flexed at 60\u00b0(anatomical position = 0\u00b0), and the ankle joint at an initial position of 0\u00b0(i.e. the sole of the foot at right angles to the tibial axis) or 28\u00b0into plantarflexion. The foot will be firmly attached to a footplate mounted on the rotation platform so that the rotation axes of the ankle joint and the motor-driven platform coincide. Participants will be securely stabilized by an assembly of straps that fastened both shoulders and connected to a waist belt. An additional strap with a foam support prevents the knee joint of the tested leg from flexing. The torque around the rotational axis of the motor will be measured by a piezoelectric crystal transducer (Kistler Holding, Winterthur, Switzerland), and the ankle joint angle will be monitored by a linear potentiometer. Furthermore, a small stiff metal wire attached to a spring system, located under the calcaneus, will continuously monitor heel displacement from the footplate. Torque, joint angle, and heel displacement signals will be sampled at 1 kHz with a 16bit A/D converter (CED power 1401, Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK). The plantarflexion test starts with a 2 s maximal isometric muscle action at 0\u00b0, followed by an isokinetic (14\u00b0/s) concentric effort until 28\u00b0. The dorsiflexion test starts with a 2 s maximal isometric muscle action at 28\u00b0, followed by an isokinetic (14\u00b0/s) concentric effort until 0\u00b0. The highest attained torque at 0\u00b0, 5.5\u00b0, 11\u00b0, 16.5\u00b0, 22\u00b0, and 27.5\u00b0among the trials will be used for analysis. This approach will be used because force fluctuations during the trials (i.e. short moments of relaxation) often happen when testing the CP group, thus it may be that one single trial will not have all the peak torque values for all joint angles. Maximal isometric and concentric knee flexion and extension will be assessed using a custom-build motor driven dynamometer (NMRC, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland). Participants will be seated with the knee joint fully extended (0\u00b0) or at 75\u00b0of flexion and hip joint flexed at 80\u00b0. The distal part of the shank will be secured with a velcro strap to a strain gauge (NMRC, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland) capable of measuring both tensile and compressive forces. The position of the strain gauge on the lever arm is adjustable and the distance from the axis of rotation will be individually recorded and reproduced for all following measurements. The rotation axis of both dynamometer and knee will be carefully aligned during a submaximal voluntary muscle action, to take into account the system's compliance. Participants will be securely stabilized by an assembly of straps fastening both shoulders and connected to a waist belt. The knee flexion test starts with a 2 s maximal isometric muscle action at 0\u00b0, followed by an isokinetic (15\u00b0/s) concentric effort until 75\u00b0. An examiner will keep strong downward pressure at the distal part of thigh to prevent hip flexion during the trial. The knee extension test starts with a 2 s maximal isometric muscle action at 75\u00b0, followed by an isokinetic (15\u00b0/s) concentric effort until 0\u00b0. Torque will be obtained by multiplying the moment arm by the force, and joint angle will be monitored by a linear potentiometer. Both signals will be sampled at 1 KHz with the same hardware and software utilized for the ankle torque tests. The highest attained torque in nonoverlapping 5\u00b0steps among all trials will be used for analysis. For all four strength tests, rate of force development will be calculated as the maximum slope during the 0-200 ms time period in the isometric part. All measurements will be performed on the most affected leg for the CP group, and on the corresponding leg on the matching control participant. Test isokinetic velocity was chosen based on the slowest intervention training velocity (3 s muscle action for the ankle joint with a ROM of~45\u00b0), and because slower velocities are easier to be well performed by the CP participants (observed in the pilot experiment). A preparatory activity consisting of ten progressively stronger efforts from 20 to 90% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) will be performed before each test. Visual torque feedback will be provided in real-time and participants will receive strong verbal encouragement during every trial. Three to five trials with 1-2 min of rest for each test will be performed. In addition to the specific torque-angle analysis described, joint angles in which torque is greater than 90% of the peak concentric torque (i.e. optimum angle; [83] ) and greater than 50% of the peak concentric torque (i.e. curve width; [84] ) will also be calculated.",

The participant will be seated with the knee joint fully extended and the ankle dynamometer previously described will induce stretches (from 20\u00b0of plantarflexion to 0\u00b0) on triceps surae at four different velocities: 50, 100, 200 and 300\u00b0/s. The stretch velocities will be delivered in a pseudo-randomized and balanced order, yielding 10 stretches in each velocity, with an interval of 2.6-2.9 s. EMG data will be used to determine the joint angle in which the stretch reflex onset occurred (i.e. dynamic stretch reflex threshold, DSRT). A regression line based on a first-order linear equation using all DSRT will be calculated on a stretch velocity-joint angle plot. From the equation, the coefficient of determination, slope and intercept with the xaxis will be attained. The TSRT is the angle at which the regression line intersects with the x-axis, larger values indicate a high level of stretch hyperreflexia. TSRT will be calculated separately for each muscle. In addition to the already established TSRT calculation, we propose using the latency of the H-reflex to take into account the time between the stretch reflex onset and the EMG burst onset. A typical H-reflex latency of 35 ms and a stretch velocity of 300\u00b0/s can cause a difference of 10.5\u00b0b etween the stretch reflex and EMG onset, provoking a systematic error towards higher velocities. Thus, all variables in the TSRT will be calculated with and without the latency correction, and the differences will be discussed. Participants will be instructed to relax and will be wearing noise blocking headphones. Trials with EMG exceeding 5% of the isometric plantarflexion MVC in the 500 ms preceding the stretch will be discarded. The EMG burst onset will be defined as a 3SD increase in the RMS of a 20 ms moving average for at least 20 ms compared to the pre-stretch state. Visual inspection of false positives due to small brief muscle activations will be performed and automated onset detection algorithms may also be utilized. H-reflex, PAD and TSRT will be assessed on the most affected limb of the CP group and in the same leg of the age/sex matched control.",

In the modified Thomas test, three measurements are performed at the hip joint and 2 at the knee joint [72] . The first hip measure has the goniometer fulcrum at the greater trochanter of femur, reference lines using lateral femoral condyle and a line perpendicular to the bench. The second hip measurement is like the first, however the researcher will apply a hip extension torque at the distal thigh and will record the angle at which the subject reports initial stretch pain sensation. The third hip measure has the goniometer fulcrum at the anterior superior iliac spine, references lines using the superior aspect of the patella and a line parallel to the bench. The first knee measure has the goniometer fulcrum at the lateral femoral condyle, reference lines using lateral malleolus and greater trochanter of femur. A limitation of the knee angle to access two-joint hip flexors flexibility is that it is directly affected by the hip angle 1 (one-joint hip flexors). Thus, the second knee angle is measured with the participant in the same position, except that the thigh of the tested leg is supported on the bench (instead of hanging outside of it), thus hip angle will be 0\u00b0. It should be noted that only hip measurement 2 is a flexibility test, because attaining maximum ROM requires unlimited torque and the subject acknowledging stretch sensation pain. On the other four measurements, the joint angle attained is a result of the interaction between gravity and the joint's passive resistance to stretch. Thus, a stiffer joint will not yield much to the gravity force, and the reduced ROM cannot be mistakenly interpreted as poor flexibility. Although not true flexibility tests, these measurements provide important information about how different muscles affects the lower limb joints.",

The examiner will slowly (< 5\u00b0/s) move the device causing ankle dorsiflexion until the participant acknowledges an initial stretch pain sensation. Another criterion to stop the test is a heel raise higher than 5 mm. Since the motor-driven dynamometer will be also utilized subsequently to perform very fast dorsiflexions for the TSRT test, for safety reasons the maximum attained dorsiflexion angle is 21\u00b0. Thus, it is possible that maximal ROM is not measurable for some participants in the extended knee position. Three to five trials in each knee position will be performed and the maximum ROM for each position and leg will be reported. From the passive dorsiflexion torque-angle curve, in the region encompassing 20-80% of the participant's peak torque [51] , average joint stiffness (i.e. first derivative), energy (i.e. integral) and hysteresis (difference between loading and unloading integral) will be calculated. Additionally, these variables will be calculated utilizing absolute joint angles. Trials with triceps surae EMG RMS higher than 3 SD of resting levels will be discarded (EMG setup 1).

Three experimental MEG tasks will be performed in the following order: (1) resting state, (2) proprioceptive stimulation and (3) isometric muscle action. The resting-state task consists of two 5min recordings, in which the participant will remain relaxed fixating on a cross on a screen positioned 1 m away from the participant's eyes. In the proprioceptive stimulation, the pneumatic ankle-movement actuator will evoke a total of 100 dorsiflexions (movement range from 0\u00b0to1 5\u00b0) with a moderate velocity (mean: 15\u00b0/s; peak: 35\u00b0/s) every 4 s with \u00b10.2 s random jitter between the consecutive stimuli. Participants will be instructed to relax and not to resist the movement, fixate on the fixation cross, and avoid excessive eye and head movements. The view of the foot and actuator is blocked, and Brownian noise will be played through earplugs in an individually adjusted volume to mask the noise generated by the movement actuator. In the third task, first a preparatory activity of ten 2-s isometric dorsiflexions with increasing intensity (i.e.~20 to 90% of MVC) at 0\u00b0ankle angle in the ankle dynamometer will be performed. Then, in the same position, three to five maximum isometric dorsiflexions (~3 s each) will be performed, followed by four sets of submaximal isometric dorsiflexions at 10% of MVC with 120 s of duration each. Visual torque feedback will be provided in real-time, and participants will be instructed to maintain as stable as possible torque throughout each submaximal trial. To avoid fatigue, 1-2 min of rest periods will be enforced between trials (except in the preparatory activity). If the participant is unable to perform dorsiflexion adequately, plantarflexion will be used. Continuous HPI tracking will be performed for later correction of head movements.",

The major limitation in this study is the effect of the growth spurt on the dependent variables. If it happens during the control period, results between pre-test 1 and 2 may be considerably different, making it harder for any intervention related changes to be statistically different. If the growth spurt happens during the intervention it may increase its effectiveness, whereas if it happens during the maintenance period it may slow down the adaptation loss. By carefully monitoring the maturity indicators it will be possible to understand and estimate how each participant was affected by the maturation process. A second limitation regards the study's external validity: due to its length and great number of testing and training sessions, only participants and families that are already inclined towards higher levels of PA will likely choose to participate. Since PA levels are being measured objectively, it will be possible to characterize and compare this study with others and check this assumption.",
