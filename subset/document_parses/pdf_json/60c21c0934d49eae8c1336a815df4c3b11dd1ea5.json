Patients and Methods: Using observational data from head and neck surgery at the Sichuan Cancer Hospital in China, three scoring methods -sum scoring, domain-based scoring and IRTbased scoring, were employed to measure the QoL in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients and a propensity score matched analysis performed to explore the impact of surgery type on QoL as measured by the Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life core Questionnaire version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and a disease-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire (THYCA-QoL). Results: No statistically significant patient QoL differences were found between the two surgery types regardless of which questionnaire was used and which scoring method was used (ATE \u00bc \u00c0 0:400, p \u00bc 0:834 using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the sum scoring; ATE \u00bc \u00c0 0:4491, p \u00bc 0:807 using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the domain-based scoring; and ATE \u00bc \u00c0 0:442, p \u00bc 0:114 using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the IRT-based scoring; ATE \u00bc \u00c0 0:827, p \u00bc 0:586 using the THYCA-QoL and the sum scoring; ATE \u00bc \u00c0 1:692, p \u00bc 0:406 using the THYCA-QoL and the domain-based scoring; and ATE \u00bc \u00c0 0:032, p \u00bc 0:908 using the THYCA-QoL and the IRT-based scoring). Conclusion: This study confirmed that the surgery type (hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy) for DTC patients did not appear to influence their general QoL.",

Recently, hemithyroidectomy and total thyroidectomy are the most important ways to treat differentiated thyroid cancer patients, so we employed a propensity score matching method to build a counterfactual inference framework to detect causality between the extent of thyroidectomy and quality of life in differentiated thyroid cancer patients. Besides, we used three scoring methods (sum scoring, domain-based scoring and IRT-based scoring) and two popular questionnaires (the Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life core Questionnaire version 3.0 and a disease-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire) to measure the quality of life of differentiated thyroid cancer patients. Our research conclusions provided evidence that the different surgery types (hemithyroidectomy and total thyroidectomy) did not influence the quality of life of the differentiated thyroid cancer patients.",

[5] [6] [7] Further, as thyroid cancer prognoses are more favorable, particular emphasis should be placed on QoL issues. 8 However, as patient QoL cannot be directly observed, it must be inferred (using a mathematical model) from other observable variables. Therefore, to ensure a more dependable conclusion, this paper used three scoring methods: sum scoring, domainbased scoring and IRT-based scoring: to measure DTC patient QoL.",

Hinz et al 12 then used a total score derived from summing all 30 questionnaire items and two separate summary scores based on the sum of all items in the functioning and symptom domains.

As the EORTC QLQ-C30 and THYCA-QoL items use a Likert scale, item response theory (IRT) was found to be more suitable for measuring the QoL as it allowed respondents to indicate a level of agreement (using a rating or Likert scale). 16 Compared with the higher-order IRT model, the bifactor model was found to provide more accurate project parameters, trait estimates and test reliability. 17, 18 Therefore, this study measured the QoL of thyroid cancer patients using the bifactor model underlying the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the THYCA-QoL.

However, several studies have found no significant QoL differences in patients treated with hemithyroidectomy and those treated with total thyroidectomy.

Based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the THYCA-QoL, three scoring methods (sum scoring, domainbased scoring and IRT-based scoring) were developed to When a non PSM cohort was used and the IRT-based scoring was applied for the EORTC QLQ-C30, the results indicated that hemithyroidectomies offered better QoL outcomes than total thyroidectomies for DTC patients; however, when the sum scoring and the domain-based scoring were applied, no differences were found. When the PSM cohort was used, regardless of the scoring method for EORTC QLQ-C30, no QoL differences were found for the two surgery types. Because of the confounder conditioning and observation selection bias control, the PSM cohort results made more sense. Besides, regardless of non PSM cohort or PSM cohort was used and no matter which scoring method was applied for THYCA-QoL, results showed that the QoL of DTC survivors treated with the two surgery types are similar.",
