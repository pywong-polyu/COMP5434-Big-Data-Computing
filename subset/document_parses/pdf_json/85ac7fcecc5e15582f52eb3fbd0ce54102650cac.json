            "text": "Most patients with diabetes mellitus are asymptomatic, which leads to delayed and more complex treatment. At the same time, most individuals are routinely subjected to standard clinical laboratory examinations, which create large health datasets over a lifetime. Computer processing has been used to search for health anomalies and predict diseases using clinical examinations. This work studied machine learning models to support the screening of diabetes through routine laboratory tests using data from laboratory tests of 62,496 patients. The classification and regression models used were the K-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, Bayes na\u00efve, random forest models, and artificial neural networks. Glycated hemoglobin, a test used for diabetes diagnosis, was used as the target. Regression models calculated glycated hemoglobin directly and were later classified. The performance of classification computer models has been studied under various subdataset partitions and combinations (e.g., healthy, prediabetic, and diabetes, as well as no healthy and no diabetes). The best single performance was achieved with the artificial neural network model when detecting prediabetes or diabetes. The artificial neural network classification model scored 78.1%, 78.7%, and 78.4% for sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores, respectively, when identifying no healthy group. Other models also had good results, depending on what is desired. Machine learning-based models can predict glycated hemoglobin values from routine laboratory tests and can be used as a screening tool to refer a patient for further testing.",

Over time, DM causes an increase in blood glucose levels, which is known as hyperglycemia. DM also increases the risk of premature death and possible diabetes-associated complications, such as heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and vision loss [1] . Most DM patients are asymptomatic and do not undergo a DM test, leading to a delayed diagnosis. Late DM identification leads to complex treatment and poor outcomes. It is estimated that DM has an impact of $760 billion costs, accounting for 11.3% of 20-79-year-old deaths worldwide.",

HbA1c is considered the gold standard for screening and diagnosing diabetes due to its international standardization, lower susceptibility to biological variability, not being affected by acute stress, and no need for fasting [3, 4] . However, FPG exams are still widely used, being often the main diagnostic method. Even though it may present changes in glucose values, leading to erroneous interpretations [3, 5] . For the Hba1c test, the individual is considered healthy if the value is equal to or less than 5.6%, considered prediabetic if the value is between 5.6% and 6.5%, and considered diabetic if the value is equal to or greater than 6.5%. For the FPG test, the individual is considered healthy if the value is equal to or less than 99 mg/dl, considered prediabetic if the value is between 99 mg/dl and 126 mg/dl, and considered diabetic if the value is equal to or greater at 126 mg/dl [1] .",

In this way, it is crucial to predict possible DM diagnoses and recommend complementary exams to prevent an asymptomatic patient from being left without proper and timely treatment. In this case, the prediction of HbA1c is a possibility to confirm the diagnosis given by the FPG test, and in discrepant cases, it may propose performing the HbA1c test with the blood sample already available.

We used several models with different approaches and complexities, ranging from simple K-nearest neighbors to complex ANNs. The Python package Scikitlearn [37] was used to implement the models. For validation, 30% of the training part of the dataset was used. The training and validation approaches were used for hyperparameter tuning.

The ANN model has greater sensitivity in identifying people with diabetes, although the precision is not high (84.9%). On the other hand, the KNN model has a lower sensitivity in identifying DM but greater precision within the identi-fied DM. Figure 3 shows the confusion matrix of the classification models using the HPD dataset. We found that KNN, SVM, and NB behaved approximately equally, while the ANN performed better than the others. All the models have approximately a 30% prediction error for prediabetes, which indicates that this category is primarily fuzzy. In addition, there is a tendency to misclassify prediabetic individuals as healthy than diabetics, which may be due to the dataset characteristics. The performance of the classification models for the HN and ND datasets is presented in Table 3 . The sensitivity, precision, and F1 score are shown as bar plots in Figure 4 . The HN models are more regular regarding scores; however, they have approximately 70%-80% precision; thus, some false positives are expected. We observe that the KNN has a sensitivity of only 42.7% using ND; however, it leads to high precision, useful in screening false negatives. Figure 5 shows the regression model errors (MSE results). The regression line is shown. Data points are clustered in the regression line, which is indicative of the excellent performance of the models. The average MSE of the five models is 0.32, with the best performance achieved by the ANN model (0.29) and the worst, 0.38, by KNN. Table 4 shows the performance of the predicted values of the regression, arranged as HPDr. Figure 6 shows the relative confusion matrix. The regression models make it possible to observe the misclassification tendency of prediabetics as healthy compared to individuals with diabetes. This tendency was also observed when using the classification models (see Figure 3) . Thus, this tendency may be a characteristic of the data and not an imbalance in the database.

We demonstrated that machine learning could assist in the detection of DM. This system can be implemented at a minimal cost, as data are already available on computer databases from routine examinations. The proposed approach alone is not recommended for diagnostic purposes. We recommend using the system to generate an alert and recommend a specific DM examination. Thus, the models would improve DM investigation processes, as patients diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes could be referred for further analysis, which is compatible with intelligent health systems [40] . If a patient laboratory log shows diabetes probability, i.e., a \"diabetes-like\" pattern, the system can recommend further diabetes examination. The patients with \"diabetes patterns\" should be guided to traditional examinations and procedures. HbA1c strongly correlates with the average glucose [41] , being more stable and recommended for diabetes diagnoses [42] . Thus, during the FPG analysis process, the system will be able to predict HbA1c values over different arrangements of datasets, looking for some kind of discrepancy in relation to the exam performed. If there is a difference between the results, a new FPG test or a supplementary HbA1c test may be recommended in order to obtain a counter-proof of the result. As it is a computational method, there is no interruption in traditional procedures. The system can collaborate synergistically with the current procedure and may collaborate to detect DM earlier.",

This F1 score represents a consonant mean between sensitivity and precision and is a simple way to evaluate models with unbalanced databases. However, the most appropriate metric to evaluate a classification model in searching for a target is the joint analysis of sensitivity and precision. For instance, highsensitivity models are better for target identification (e.g., RF model for HN dataset, Table 3 ).

For instance, precision is more important than sensitivity when screening for false negatives, which would lead us to use the ND arrangement. Only the results with a negative diagnosis would be analyzed in this case. Even if the system is not very sensitive, it must have high precision. Thus, even if a few cases of false negatives are identified, we will be more confident that these cases are real false negatives. In this sense, we draw attention to the KNN classification model. Using this model in the search for false negatives, even if it only identifies half of the occurrences, we will be 94% sure that these tests are false negatives.",
