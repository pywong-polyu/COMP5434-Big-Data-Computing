Even when available, many youth face significant barriers to accessing LGBTQ-specific services for fear of being \"outed\" to parents, peers, and community members. The current study assessed the utility, feasibility, and acceptability of a synchronous, adult-facilitated, chat-based Internet community support program for LGBTQ youth aged 13-19. Chat transcripts were analyzed to examine how LGBTQ youth used the chat-based platform to connect with peers and trusted adults. A separate user satisfaction survey was collected to assess the personal (e.g., sexual orientation, gender identity, age) and contextual (e.g., geography, family environment) characteristics of youth engaging in the platform, their preferred topics of discussion, and their satisfaction with the program focus and facilitators. Qualitative data analysis demonstrated the degree to which LGBTQ youth were comfortable disclosing difficult and challenging situations with family, friends, and in their community and in seeking support from peers and facilitators online. Youth also used the platform to explore facets of sexual and gender identity/expression and self-acceptance. Overall, users were very satisfied with the platform, and participants accurately reflect the program's desired populations for engagement (e.g., LGBTQ youth of color, LGBTQ youth in the South). Together, findings support the feasibility and acceptability of synchronous, adult-facilitated, chat-based Internet programs to connect and support LGBTQ youth, which encourage future research and innovation in service delivery.",

LGBTQ youth experience poorer mental, behavioral, and sexual health than their heterosexual and cisgender peers (Russell & Fish, 2016; Saewyc, 2014) . Despite a growing acceptance of LGBTQ youth and policy changes aimed at protecting them, studies suggest that disparities in mental health, substance use, and victimization have remained relatively stable over the past 15 years (Fish et al., 2019a, b; Poteat et al., 2020; Raifman et al., 2020) . This persistence emphasizes the need for broader prevention and intervention efforts to address LGBTQ youth's unique developmental and health needs.",

LGBTQ youth also experience barriers to communitybased care (e.g., safety concerns, lack of competent providers). In contrast, LGBTQ youth are active users of Internetenabled devices (e.g., smartphones). They are informally accessing resources and building community in Internetbased contexts-particularly if they are unable to access such opportunities in their day-to-day lives (GLSEN, 2013) . Thus, Internet-based prevention and intervention programs may be particularly feasible for LGBTQ youth (Craig et al., 2015b; McInroy, 2020; Paceley et al., 2020) . The emergence of digital interventions indicates the potential for evidencebased programming for LGBTQ youth delivered via Internetenabled technologies (McInroy et al., 2019a) . Given the prospective reach of Internet-based programming, the current study documents the development and delivery of a synchronous, adult-facilitated, chat-based community support program for LGBTQ youth called Q Chat Space. Specifically, we assess the utility, feasibility, and acceptability of Q Chat Space by examining youth engagement and experience with the program.",

Q Chat Space was designed with significant input from rural LGBTQ youth, who are often under-resourced (Paceley, 2016) , as well as Black and Latinx LGBTQ youth, who are more likely to encounter stigma and marginalization (Toomey et al., 2017) . A synchronous chat platform emerged that allows youth (age 13-19) to join adult-facilitated, Internet-based support groups anonymously. Facilitators are staff from LGBTQ community centers around the United States (U.S.) and trained by Cen-terLink, the organization managing Q Chat Space. Youth continue to offer input through a youth advisory panel made up of predominantly Black, Latinx, and rural youth (now in its third cohort).",

Eighteen 60-min support groups were hosted with 16 youth. This initial test (1) assessed the utility of the digital platform and (2) refined the chat protocol (e.g., length of chats, times for chats). The pilot program started in July 2018 that included facilitators from a second LGBTQ center in the Southeastern U.S. and engaged youth who were not necessarily attending in-person services. Youth were made aware of the program through the pilot organizations' typical communication channels (e.g., social media, websites, emails, and outreach to youth serving professionals in their area). In January 2019, a third LGBTQ center was added to provide chat sessions specifically addressing sexual health. The third center also promoted Q Chat Space throughout their service area in the Southeast using similar communication strategies. The pilot enabled further revision of the chat protocol, improvements to the facilitator training, and fidelity monitoring. The pilot ended in May 2019. When the program launched nationally, CenterLink asked LGBTQ community centers across the U.S. as well as other youth-serving organizations to share the program information through social media, emails, and outreach. CenterLink also conducted a paid marketing campaign on Instagram. Two data sources were used for the current study: (1) chat transcripts from the program pilot (July 2018-May 2019) and (2) a user survey conducted February-March 2020 to understand the characteristics of youth engaged with the platform, their motivations for joining, and their satisfaction with the program. As Q Chat Space was not originally designed for assessment and evaluation, we cannot assess the degree to which pilot users are present in the survey data, and thus the degree to which the two samples overlap (see the \"Limitations and Areas of Future Research\" section for further discussion). The University of Maryland Institutional Review Board approved the research protocol for both projects.",

All authors discussed codes and related quotes, combined ones that were similar, and identified ten broad thematic categories of codes on Q Chat Space content. The team met weekly during the coding process and discussed any discrepancies and disagreements in coding until consensus was reached. Transcripts were re-read to identify platform processes (e.g., chat structure, flow, engagement) in addition to content to understand how the chat environment might offer unique user experiences. In this phase, four analysts wrote brief process memos about each chat. The memos included prompts for facilitator roles, youth engagement, and affective/emotive context.

Findings suggest that Q Chat Space is an acceptable and feasible program given its ability to reach and engage youth from across the U.S., and its effectiveness in providing a welcoming environment in which LGBTQ youth are motivated to engage and discuss topics relevant to their lives and health. Since its inception in 2018, Q Chat Space has grown from one session per week to a robust Internet-based program offering twelve 90-min chat sessions weekly. Further evidence of reach is demonstrated in the continued scale-up of Q Chat Space: As of May 31, 2021, Q Chat Space has hosted 1035 groups with 2377 unique users and an average of 15.5 youth attending each chat. The user survey findings showed that among youth who attended at least one chat, the average number of attended chats was 5.42.

Roughly 11% of youth who completed the user survey were from rural communities, which signals that Q Chat Space is accessible to LGBTQ youth in areas with historically limited services. Youth who attended at least one chat were also more likely to be transgender or gender diverse, which is consistent with youth engagement with in-person community programs (Fish et al., 2019a, b) and other Internetmediated spaces (McInroy et al., 2019b) .

This is particularly important with regard to characteristics that may inhibit access to in-person or voice-based services. For example, users and non-users did not differ on parental disclosure, family rejection, family acceptance, or psychological distress. Often, youth who are not out to their parents may hesitate to engage with in-person and Internet-based LGBTQ resources for fear that their parents will find outthis restricts youths' access to supports and services (Paceley et al., 2020) .

Findings highlight two important points. First, the chat conversations' content is directly related to contexts and processes that impact youth mental and behavioral health, as outlined in the minority stress model and related empirical work (Goldbach & Gibbs, 2017; Meyer, 2003) . For example, family rejection (Ryan et al., 2009) , peer harassment (Russell & Fish, 2016) , and coming out stress (Baams et al., 2015) are implicated in LGBTQ youth mental health and substance use (Goldbach et al., 2014; Russell & Fish, 2016) . Youth felt comfortable to discuss personal and stressful experiences in a context with peers and facilitators who could normalize these experiences, offer support, and recommend resources and informationreactions that could mitigate the negative impacts of these stressors (Wagaman et al., 2020) . Results also suggest that youth may feel safer and more comfortable sharing personal or uncomfortable experiences and questions in a text-based (rather than face-to-face) context; youth mentioned how they were able to say what was on their mind, appreciating both the anonymity of the space and the presence of LGBTQ peers and supportive adults.",

These motivations emphasize the need to cultivate LGBTQ community connections. The themes identified in the transcript analysis align closely with these desires. Although LGBTQ community affiliation and support have been studied among adults (Frost et al., 2016) , these experiences' effects are less-often examined among youth. Some qualitative work has found that LGBTQ youth, particularly youth in rural areas, have a strong desire to connect with LGBTQ peers in safe and supportive environments but often face physical, structural, and emotional barriers in doing so (Paceley, 2016) . Other work has shown that LGBTQ youth who engage with in-person LGBTQ community centers report better self-esteem and mental health, and lower substance use, than those who do not engage with these programs (Fish et al., 2019a, b) . The ability to cultivate LGBTQ community in an Internet-based environment, particularly for those who cannot seek it elsewhere, is critical for LGBTQ youth health and wellbeing.",

            "text": "Limitations qualify our findings. First, this work is exploratory. Q Chat Space was not originally designed for assessment and evaluations. We are therefore not aware of how many of the pilot users are represented in our user survey, nor were we able to contact only those youth who participated in the pilot. Future studies with a priori benchmarks and rigorous data collection will provide better assessments of feasibility and acceptability. For this same reason, assessing the impact of the program on intermediate and long-term outcomes related to mental health among LGBTQ youth was not possible. It would be important to design studies able to capture the shortand long-term changes in mental and behavioral health as a result of the program. Second, the user survey was valuable for understanding who was engaging with the platform, their satisfaction with the program, and their motivations for joining. However, the user survey only reflects a subsample of youth who have registered and participated in the program. A comprehensive demographic survey during registration and tracking use over time would help evaluate the degree to which the program engaged the intended population and the diversity therein. Lastly, this evaluation's ad hoc nature also precludes our ability to assess youth who opted not to enroll in the program. Tracking recruitment and enrollment efforts will allow for better assessments of feasibility and acceptability.",

            "text": "Our findings highlight the acceptability and feasibility of a synchronous, facilitator-led chat-based support program for LGBTQ youth. Importantly, the use of an Internetbased, textual program like Q Chat Space engages youth who may not have disclosed their LGBTQ status or who are fearful of being \"outed\" through the use of in-person or voice-based services. Obtaining community and resources via the Internet provides relative anonymity while simultaneously increasing accessibility and individual specificity. Thus, such programs provide a relatively low-cost strategy to support youth, particularly those who experience barriers to procuring LGBTQ-specific resources and support in their schools and communities (Fish et al., 2020b; McInroy et al., 2019a, b) . Q Chat Space is also unique as an Internet-based preventive intervention program for LGBTQ youth as many Internet-based programs this population are crisis-focused interventions (e.g., TrevorLifeline, TrevorChat, Trans Lifeline; McInroy et al., 2019a) . Q Chat Space's scale-up in mid-2019 was particularly timely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Within the first month of shutdowns, average attendance increased from 5 youth per chat to 13; the average number of new youth joining chats also doubled. Recent research from the Q Chat Space team suggests that this increase in users was accelerated by the isolation and mental health difficulties LGBTQ youth are experiencing as a result of the pandemic. The pandemic has separated them from their friends and offline sources of support, as well as, in some cases, has kept them at home with unsupportive families (Fish et al., 2020b) . CenterLink was called upon to provide expert support as LGBTQ centers around the country rapidly transitioned their drop-in services to the Internet. Anecdotally, COVID-19 is likely to change the landscape of community-based LGBTQ service delivery permanently. Although in-person services will undoubtedly return, many youth-serving organizations supported by CenterLink have discussed maintaining Internet-based programming developed during the pandemic (personal communication).",

We explored the feasibility and acceptability of an Internet-based, adult-facilitated chat platform for LGBTQ youth to interact, build community, and access resources. Results suggest that this preventive intervention format offers promising strategies to address the risk factors implicated in LGBTQ youth health and wellbeing. Findings show that youth are comfortable engaging in discussions that allow them to process the unique stressors of being LGBTQ and foster resilience through support and community engagement. Future research is needed to understand better these programs' impact on LGBTQ youth health and the strategies to deliver them best.",

            "text": "Chat Space pilot transcript thematic codes, defining features, and example excerpts 1. Coming out 1. Kelsey_she_they (facilitator): To begin, what does coming out mean to you all? Sunami_she (youth): The first time I came out to someone was when I told my friend who's also part of the LGBTQ community by saying \"BESTIE! I don't think I'm straight.\" She was so supportive and amazing! 1uri_she (youth): awww that's so sweet 1uri_she (youth): I had to come out four times to my parents, and they didn't believe me until I was outed by my counselor 2. Kelsey_she_they (facilitator): What do y'all think is involved in the coming out process? Do you think coming outis even a process? \u2026 Camera.Gem_she_they (Youth): gender is a way you can definitely yourself into or not into a box that people can understand 2. Carolina_j_she (Youth): I feel like if you're struggling with your identity and then you find a label or title that fits, it can make you feel David_he (Youth): I just thought it was interesting because usually when we talk about intersectionality, we talk about how multiple minority identities can negatively impact someone. But intersectionality is also the fact that privilege (white privilege, male privilege, being able bodied, passing, etc.) can create an advantage that can positively impact their lives, even as a minority 2. David_he (Youth): Because even when there are gay people in the media, they are usually not people of color\u2026or at least that's been my experience. Trans men in the media seem to be 99% white trans men. Some people don't realize how the fact that they are privileged in some ways but not in others can still intersect in a way that puts them at a higher advantage than others 4. Family dynamics 1. Kelsey_she_they (Facilitator): Are your parents affirming now that they have had time to process the information?\u2026 Quueraceonit_she (Youth): My mom definitely is, my sister is indifferent and my dad recently started talking to me again, so I think they're all okay with it sorry about the rant haha 2. Kelsey_she_they (Facilitator): Great points. So there can definitely be people who don't accept you, but you may still have a relationship with them. Do you all think you can have a healthy relationship with someone who does not accept you? School.theteacher _he (Youth): I hope it's possible. I'm thinking more of my family who I love and care about and want to continue to stay in my life. But it's hard being together when they don't accept me 5. LGBTQ community dynamics 1. Sunami_she (Youth): Lol! we need to be here for each other cause sadly a lot of this world wont and try to break us down. That's why I'm so thankful for everyone part of the LGBTQ community 2. David_he (Youth): Nice! And sometimes, I feel like while we are a community (the LGBTQ community), there's still some division. I was listen to a podcaster who's a trans woman say that she didn't really know people who were trans masculine or really from any other \"branches\" of the LGBT community. So seeing people from different areas of the community come together added a different level of beauty for me 6. Support 1. Rithy_he (Facilitator): Is your school pretty inclusive of the LGBTQ community? carolina_j_she (Youth): I actually started school online this year but my past school was not at all\u2026then again it was before i moved out to charlotte but they definitely weren't 2. Kelsey_she_they (Facilitator): Do you have anyone at your school that would be willing to advocate for you? Either another teacher or a counselor? Cameron_she(Youth): Eh not really, none of the teachers really know I'm gay, I would be fine with them knowing, it's just that the same situation could happen and I don't want them to not like me because of it Because they are Christian and I don't know how they feel about gay people 7. Direct/proximal stressors 1. Sunami_she (Youth): Well actually, me and one of my friends are so close and we had a small crush on each other for a small time, and we would hands sometimes and hug a lot. People started calling us a lesbians and started picking on us about it. Calling us \"lesbos\" and stuff like that 2. David_he4 (Youth): I tried to get my passport updated with my name/gender but they gave me a hard time about it, which was annoying 8. Indirect/structural stressors 1. Lovinn4_he (Youth): I remember a couple of years ago, and marriage equality was going through the courts. I was so nervous about it that I was reading through the Court transcripts. The celebration after it passed was so cool to watch GeminiLady_she (Youth): it's meant to have a negative connotation thats why it worked as a slur like gay just meant happy and that's not a slur",

            "text": "continued) 2. Pinto_they (Youth): Well I think it's really cool how many women are in the US Congress since the election which is a super big step. And the media in general there's still less representation of queer people and p.o.c then there should be but for some parts there's stuff that's changing for the better and better representation Carolina_j_she (Youth): voices of trans, disabled, and immigrants i feel like are a big part of people that aren't heard right now Media 1. Matthew_he (Youth): I think Netflix has gotten a lot better with it and has done some really great shows with accurate LGBT rep! OmniqueerAR_they (Youth): Thanks, I had a panic attack at school today and those usually exhaust me so for the rest of the day I felt mentally and physically drained Kelsey_she_they (Facilitator): People commenting negatively on posts can definitely turn into discrimination in real life! What do you all think that recurring discrimination does to a person? Lovinn4_he (Youth): It weakens their emotional and mental well being, for sure. It can lead to isolation, and in some cases, can make someone feel like they're less than human Derrickdaskpy_he (Youth): It can lower self esteem and make someone depressed eventually\u2026 2. Lovinn4_he (Youth): The whole community can end up feeling \"less than.\" It can lead to tensions between the community and the rest of the world, and can lead to repression of what makes that community unique or important out of shame",
