During the COVID-19 pandemic, difficult decisions are being made about the allocation of scarce resources. Respect for autonomy cannot justify rationing decisions. Justice can be invoked to justify rationing. However, this leaves an uncomfortable tension between the principles. Dignity is not a useless concept because it is able to account for why we respect autonomy and for why it can be legitimate to override autonomy in times of critical care resource shortages. Dignity affirms the worth of the human individual as a meaning-making embodied subject, who is always in relationship to others, the world, time, and transcendence, and who realizes their dignity through their moral behaviour. Such an understanding means people should be helped to make morally right decisions about their own treatment, which may include forgoing potentially beneficial treatment for the good of others. Respect for dignity does not require fulfilling the morally wrong choices of one who insists on treatment at the expense of others. Dignity also protects the discretion of clinicians to make decisions appropriate to their competence by prohibiting the application of broad-based criteria such as age.",

This is particularly so for the allocation of critical care resources, such as ventilators, for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Rosenbaum 2020; Gibson, Qin, and Puah 2020) . This has resulted in a proliferation of ethical guidelines attempting to address the problem of how to fairly allocate these resources (e.g. Emanuel et al. 2020 ; World Health Organization 2020). One thing is clear from these guidelines: respect for autonomy cannot alone do the ethical work to justify rationing.

In light of this normative function of human dignity, I then explain how concerns for justice can limit autonomy whilst still respecting dignity. This is then applied to the problem of allocating scarce medical resources in times of pandemic like COVID-19. Finally, I argue that human dignity is particularly useful in that it also helps us address the moral distress for healthcare professionals of making rationing decisions.",

It protects us from overzealous researchers who would sacrifice us for the \"greater good\" and from overzealous doctors who want to apply disproportionate treatments. In the context of scarce resource allocation during COVID-19, the question is why, if a person wants a specific treatment that could help them, not giving them that treatment would be morally right. Respect for autonomy alone cannot explain the moral rightness of withholding treatment in this case. If anything, rationing during a pandemic seems to violate autonomy. Beauchamp and Childress's (2019) principlism offers one solution. Justice balances the demands of autonomy, and respect for autonomy ensures that justice is not co-opted by the powerful at the expense of others. Consequently, it is not surprising that many of the guidelines point to the use of evidenced-based algorithms to assist clinical teams to ascertain who should get the scarce resources based on an estimation of the proportional benefit of treatment or the disproportionate burden. Yet, this still leaves a dissatisfying tension between the principles.",

Regardless of resource scarcity, the first questions are the appropriate clinical questions of proportionate therapeutic benefit or disproportionate burden in the circumstances. Whilst one can partly rely on evidence-based algorithms and even machine learning to aid this evaluation, to take dignity seriously means taking seriously everything about an individual: physical health, relationships, achievements, hopes and desires, and especially how they feel they have realized a sense of selfworth. This means that human judgement is essential to the process. Based on adequate information and cognizant of the moral meaning of my actions, the morally right conception of self-worth might lead me to the recognition that the morally appropriate thing for me to do is to not start or to end a treatment that has no proportionate benefit or is overly burdensome.",

Dignity is first respected by efforts to have appropriate care-planning discussions about when and what treatment might be withheld or withdrawn. Circumstances may change, however, or unexpected patients may end up incapacitated. In such cases, realization of dignity as self-worth through morally right behaviour by the substitute decision-makers and clinical teams is important. Because autonomy is absent, substitute decision-makers and the clinical team need to choose on behalf of the incapacitated person. They must choose what they agree the individual ought to want to do in the given circumstances (McCormick 1974) . All of the aforementioned considerations need to be taken into account. By making a vicarious morally right decision, the decision-makers support the ultimate realization of the dignity of the other person by making morally meaningful choices that serve the dignity of all.",

They also violate the dignity of clinical care teams, who are the people best situated to assist decision-making for particular individuals.

Since knowledge is an important foundation of decision-making and since becoming a virtuous person is a matter of practical application of knowledge through moral reasoning, judgement, choices, and actions over time, it is self-evident that, even with the best intentions, we might still get moral decisions wrong. In the rapidly changing knowledge-landscape and situational status of novel pandemics like COVID-19, recognizing these limitations is essential if we are also going to be able to act with sincerity and a clear moral conscience. An individual who sincerely pursues the realization of their dignity through the promotion of the dignity of all others cannot lose their dignity through unintentional error. Consequently, healthcare organizations should provide adequate pastoral support for decision-makers, and difficult decisions are best made by multidisciplinary teams, both because this increases the likelihood that the best available knowledge is taken into account and because it shares the burden of having to make decisions in circumstances where one cannot be absolutely certain that one is right.",
