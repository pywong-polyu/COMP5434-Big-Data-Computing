Concomitantly, recently, decision makers have required researchers to acknowledge the societal impact of their research, as well as anticipate and respond to ethical dimensions of this societal impact through responsible research and innovation principles. Using artificial intelligence population health research in the United Kingdom and Canada as a case study, we combine a mapping study of journal publications with 18 interviews with researchers to explore how the ethical dimensions associated with this societal impact are incorporated into research agendas. Researchers separated the ethical responsibility of their research with its societal impact. We discuss the implications for both researchers and actors across the Ethics Ecosystem.",

This reflects a desire to normalize personal ethical barometers regarding how to conduct human participant research, specifically in relation to respect for persons, justice, and beneficence. Behaving \"ethically\" in human participant research is reinforced through the \"Ethics Ecosystem\" (Samuel et al., 2019) -an evaluation network of interconnected actors existing at a number of levels within the academic system and at different points of the research production process. This notion comprises individuals (researchers), organizations (research institutions and the various committees within, such as research ethics committees [RECs] in the United Kingdom; also called research ethics boards [REBs] in Canada or institutional review boards [IRBs] in the United States), and external bodies (publishing houses, funding bodies, professional associations, and the governance policies they produce) who participate equally in the promotion, evaluation, and reenforcement of a shared understanding of responsible research behavior (Samuel et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "Alongside this, formal recognition of the societal impact of research beyond academia is gaining prominence as an embedded principle associated with knowledge production and research excellence (Derrick, 2018) . The inclusion of impact as a criterion in research funding and assessmentfor both impact generation and for the purposes of evaluating research quality-formally ensures that engagement with and ownership of impact outcomes become desirable academic behaviors. This aims to incentivize researchers to ensure their research responds to local and global challenges, and provides a level of accountability to decision makers. Notwithstanding the politicization of the impact agenda (Deem et al., 2008; Research Council Economic Impact Group, 2006; Watermeyer, 2019) , the move toward demonstrating impact can be seen to appeal to academics' intrinsic responsibilities, where the desire to generate research impact and contribute toward society (Chubb, 2017) contributes to a long-standing vision that academics ought to locate a sense of responsibility to communicate their work to the public and others (Bodmer, 1986; Chubb, 2017; Chubb & Reed, 2017; Weinstein et al., 2021) . Furthermore, while research evaluation practices are cementing the need for researchers to consider the societal impact of their work, the science and technology field is concurrently bringing societal impact into the research process through responsible research and innovation (RRI), representing a move toward a \"science for and with society\" (Laroches, 2011; cited in Owen & Macnaghten, 2012) . Although debates exist about how to effectively define RRI, all permutations of the concept converge around the need for responsibility and integrity to be embedded into research governance, and that RRI should be a collective endeavor to anticipate and respond to the ethical, social, and political dimensions associated with the societal impact of research across all stakeholders (Stilgoe et al., 2013) .",

This has presented specific ethical challenges, and in some instances, has disrupted \"traditional\" understandings of research ethics, problematizing notions of consent and privacy, and raising questions around what constitutes human participant research (we prefer the notion \"data subjects\"; Ess, 2017; Whiteman, 2012) .

            "text": "In particular, the ethical implications of AI have received much attention in recent years. We refer to AI as \"the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior\" (Peters et al., 2020) . AI is, of course, ubiquitous-applied in a range of research arenas, settings, and domains of use. To consider the impacts of AI as homogenous is therefore somewhat unhelpful. Instead, AI is an umbrella term, or a \"collection\" of technologies with wide-ranging impacts, benefits, and challenges. Although dominant narratives often associate AI with anthropomorphized \"scary robots\" and the world of science fiction (Cave et al., 2020) , it is often when we look to the present and real-world applications that we find AI is at the heart of social, cultural, and economic impact in the world, both in terms of our every day (the use of smartphones, AI voice assistance, search algorithms, and AI in games) and the more spectacular (computer-human interfaces, self-driving cars, etc.). Indeed, now so more than ever, AI and its impacts have come into sharp focus during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which saw the role of AI becoming a focal point of discussion (Vaishya et al., 2020) . Here, scholars have emphasized the urgency to consider the use of AI tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and containment of the coronavirus, as well as to consider the associated ethical implications (Tzachor et al., 2020) . Such ethical implications (specifically and more generally) include, among others, matters of public and stakeholder trust in AI systems, the need for accountability of the technology, responsibility, and transparency and explainability of algorithms. Questions about privacy in terms of data subjects and fairness and justice regarding access to AI technology are also prominent (Blasimme & Vayena, 2019; Cath et al., 2018; Dignum, 2018; Vayena et al., 2018; Vollmer et al., 2020) as are concerns about bias in data sets (Ledford, 2019; Noor, 2020; Parikh et al., 2019) .",

In fact, to date, over 80 such \"AI ethics\" initiatives have published reports describing high-level ethical principles, tenets, values, or other abstract requirements for AI development and deployment as organizations and institutions start to grapple with how best to govern AI research and use (Jobin et al., 2019) . Despite the \"ethicization of AI,\" and the concerted effort to embed ethical thinking and governance into the research and development of AI, less is known about the research ethics processes that involve the use of AI and how much they consider both research ethics issues as well as the ethics of research use. This is important given the calls for RRI, and for researchers to anticipate and respond to the ethical dimensions associated with the societal impact of research. It is vital to understand how researchers construct any responsibilities associated with the ethics of the societal impact of their research, and whether ethics governance frameworks exist to support such responsibilities. Mittelstadt (2019) notes that there is a lack of empirical evidence linking codes of best practice ethics to actual impact on AI researcher behavior, unless they are developed alongside structures of accountability and workplace practices. This is compounded by AI ethics guidelines being described as \"vague, high-level principles, and value statements\" (Mittelstadt, 2019, p. 1 ) that provide few practical recommendations for AI researchers (Mulgan, 2019) .",

As researchers interested in health, our case study was the field of population health research that uses AI methods. Our definition of \"researcher,\" and to reflect a more inclusive consideration of \"value\" beyond the mainstream academic community, was broadened to include anyone involved in AI research. This was particularly important as, between different institutional contexts, the idea of ethical AI research practice is not always shared. This offers a useful case study: health research is often governed by strict ethics governance requirements at both the research and societal impact level, however ethics governance structures associated with population health research are blurry, this can also mean between different types of public organizations involved in research, such as universities, hospitals, and other health stakeholders. Population health research using clinical data and/or having clinical applications (e.g., research into cancer prediction, and diagnosis research for heart disease, eye disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and depression) will fall under strong research (REC/REB) and professional/health sector ethical governance remits. Research using nonclinical data, however, may or may not be under the remit of RECs/ REBs; similarly, nonclinical applications of population health AI research are unlikely to fall under the regulatory structures of the clinical sector. This may include, for example, researchers who are exploring how AI systems can help predict epidemics and disease outbreaks (Bengtsson et al., 2015; Harris et al., 2017; Naghavi et al., 2010) , as well as various health and mental health states (for a review, see, e.g., Blasimme & Vayena, 2019) . Understanding ethics decision making in this space, and how researchers engage with both research ethics, as well as the ethics of research use, can help expose inconsistencies or issues with current practices and/or governance structures.",

While most interviewees acknowledged a lack of AI-specific expertise on ethics review committees (\"those ethics boards often\u2026they are not terribly sophisticated in some of the methods to really understand the application\" [interviewee 13]), for many, this lack of expertise was unproblematic because, for them, the ethical issues of their AI research were nonexceptional compared to other ethics issues raised by \"big data\" more generally. Moreover, as we go on to describe below, these interviewees separated the review of research ethics practices, which they believed did not require expertise in AI methods (given the data governance focus of their perceptions of research ethics), from the oversight of ethics practices related to research use. The latter was perceived to require an understanding of AI systems because of its association with decision making, though this was not viewed to be under the purview of RECs: people are intimidated by it [AI] and they are just \"well, this is the computer stuff and we will focus on the things we understand.\" Is it problematic? Broadly, yes in the sense that you would want your IRB [REC] to be fully informed of the whole package that is being proposed. In practice probably rarely: the difference between algorithm A and algorithm B is probably not the kind of thing that an ethics board really needs to be worried about unless it's being tied into some kind of decision-making\u2026I have already said that's probably outside an IRBs remit anyway (interviewee 17)",

It's only really if you are touching individual patients in a clinical context where regulation comes in (interviewee 13). This was problematic for many interviewees, and a consensus emerged about the perceived value of such an oversight system for the nonclinical health sector: there definitely should be an outside body testing the models to validate. Because you can imagine, people are quite motivated to have their models used. So having\u2026somebody validate the models. I think that would be excellent (interviewee 14) In fact, a number of interviewees (n = 4) viewed this need for governance as analogous to when drug regulation was initially introduced in the pharmaceutical industry, albeit with an awareness of the shortcomings of these oversight mechanisms. In the extracts below, interviewee 6 compares the historical need for drug regulation to combat the use of ineffective and harmful drugs to stress their view about the need for better AI oversight systems. Meanwhile, interviewee 13 points to the inadequacies of drug regulation to emphasize the poor regulatory fit of drug regulation for AI systems, and the need to improve on this: when you come up with a new drug\u2026there's strong regulation that prevents marketing a drug that is ineffective or perhaps even harmful\u2026but when you're applying AI\u2026there are not the same requirements.. [so] ..there is a risk to run into the same problems that have been historical problems in the development and the marketing of drugs maybe a hundred years ago (interviewee 6) [a drug is only] licensed for a particular indication and a particular set of populations, [similarly AI systems are only developed on specific datasets], and once it's in the market it can be used by clinicians for any indication and any population..[..]..so bad things happen (interviewee 13) It was perhaps because of this perceived lack of oversight for AI-related systems that all interviewees, when asked, narrated a sense of responsibility (\"a huge responsibility\" [interviewee 16]) to ensure the appropriate societal application of their own research. When interviewees were asked about what responsibility looked like to them, they spoke about ensuring their AI system had been validated (\"it's something you have just got to be sure it works\u2026it's the same with anything-you need to make sure\u2026they have gone through the right validation\" [interviewee 4]; that it was explainable (\"we don't use deep learning at all basically because, well because it's not explainable\" [interviewee 11]); and that it was open source (\"I would call it the open science framework\u2026we publish the algorithm, how we created the algorithm, we publish validation data\u2026calibration data and methods for calibrating\" [interviewee 18]). At the same time, interviewees explained the difficulties in always enacting such responsibilities. In fact, it became apparent from interviewees' discussions that while the lack of oversight mechanisms for AI-related systems was associated, at least in part, with interviewees feeling responsibility for the impact of their research (because no other individual or institution took on this responsibility), at the same time, it was the lack of oversight that stopped interviewees enacting these responsibilities because without clear oversight infrastructures, there were no incentives to promote these responsibilities. Interviewee 6 explained: it's easy to say \"oh I think we have a responsibility\" but if there are no mechanisms that at least incentivise taking responsibility then, you know, there is not much substance to such a statement\u2026.[how is] taking this responsibility\u2026actually rewarded..

Validation is an important step in the development of AI models and effective validation will ensure that models are tested with a good (ethically appropriate) representative set of input data. This testing and model validation play a necessary role in governance processes and places a responsibility on the validators to test the model sufficiently. This inconsistency in standards, which has been reported in other areas of big data research (Samuel et al., 2019) , led to some researchers \"cheating, I would say, to make your models seem more accurate than they are,\" that is, because some journals did not require researchers to validate their models for publication, researchers could pick and choose where they published their research to avoid validating their models responsibly or appropriately.

This was echoed in the visualization of affiliation networks where academic organizations were more centrally located to each cluster than the affiliated societal partners (usually hospitals). This suggests an institutional divide to the regulation and ethical use of patient-based AI data for practical (societal partner) and research (academic partner) use, where partnerships with health stakeholders are made for pragmatic reasons such as to enable access to the data and/or to increase the societal relevance of the resulting research. Differing incentive structures surrounding successful publication could also result in collaborations between researchers and stakeholders that are more pragmatic (governing the access to health data as a primary goal) rather than intellectual. However, this is unlikely to be the primary explanation as researchers in the United Kingdom affiliated to stakeholder organizations are likely to be subject to the same performative expectations as researchers solely affiliated with universities.",

This is problematic if researchers are being called upon to consider the ethics of the societal impact of the research, and take responsibility for this, because, as we saw in our findings, it leaves them with little way to enact such responsibilities. This lack of an ethics governance structure to oversee and respond to issues associated with research use can be seen as a manifestation of the functioning of the Ethics Ecosystem, in which the purview of RECs is primarily focused on issues of research ethics, leaving little space and less oversight for considerations related to the ethical use of research. This is problematic because the Ethics Ecosystem can govern research practice from inception to publication through its actors' shared understanding of research ethics, however, once research is published and disseminated, it is subject to little ethics oversight; and the research can potentially become distorted, misrepresented, and/or used inappropriately (Brundage, 2016) . As we discuss further below, the Ethics Ecosystem needs to be modified to allow for a body to support ethics decision making at the level of research use.

As we have described previously, Ethics Ecosystem actors need to participate equally in the promotion, evaluation, and enforcement of a shared understanding of ethically responsible research behavior to keep the Ethics Ecosystem in equilibrium. There is a risk that the system can become imbalanced when this shared understanding breaks down (Samuel et al., 2019) . Our findings have highlighted clear examples of disequilibrium-both at the level of the REC with their narrow focus on data governance (see below), as well as more broadly at the level of funding bodies' and journals' focus on research novelty at the expense of the more mundane, but ethically responsible repetition, verification, and validation of research. As researchers try to take more responsibility for both their research and research use, researchers will only be able to enact this responsibility if their vision of ethics best practice is shared and practiced among all \"Ethics Ecosystem\" actors, including funding bodies and journals, and if their epistemic responsibilities are valued by institutions.",

The fact that most discussions focused on privacy was problematic and led to a narrowing of ethics and responsibility debates being perpetuated throughout the Ethics Ecosystem, often at the expense of other ethical issues such as questions around justice and fairness (McQuillan, 2018) . This can be analogized to a similar situation-that of consent. Here a disproportionate focus on this concept, along with the importance RECs place on consent forms and participant information sheets, has led some way to establishing how research ethics is defined (Whelan, 2018) , that is, with consent often being viewed (sometimes incorrectly) as a proxy for ethics best practice, or in some cases, as an ethics panacea (Corrigan, 2003) .",

We support this. Although, as our findings on the separation of ethics practices of research and research use have highlighted, difficulties remain regarding how to responsibly assess such ideals that relate more to the ethics of research use, especially since these are not envisioned to be under the purview of RECs. We do not have an answer for this here, but emphasize the need for researchers, RECs, and other actors of the Ethics Ecosystem to engage in discussions about these inconsistencies, to promote education and awareness. Scholars have argued that some researchers have been led to believe that they do not always actually impact on human decision making in the field of AI and machine learning (Hagendorff, 2020, p. 1) . While our research findings did not necessarily show this (perhaps because of the self-selected criteria), here, the role of education is even more vital.",
