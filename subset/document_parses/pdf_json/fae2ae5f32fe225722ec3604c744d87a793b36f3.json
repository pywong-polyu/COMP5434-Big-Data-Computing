            "text": "Many animal species are susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and could act as reservoirs; however, transmission in free-living animals has not been documented. White-tailed deer, the predominant cervid in North America, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and experimentally infected fawns can transmit the virus. To test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in deer, 283 retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) samples collected from 151 freeliving and 132 captive deer in Iowa from April 2020 through January of 2021 were assayed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Ninety-four of the 283 (33.2%) deer samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as assessed by RT-PCR. Notably, following the November 2020 peak of human cases in Iowa, and coinciding with the onset of winter and the peak deer hunting season, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 80 of 97 (82.5%) RPLN samples collected over a 7-wk period. Whole genome sequencing of all 94 positive RPLN samples identified 12 SARS-CoV-2 lineages, with B.1.2 (n = 51; 54.5%) and B.1.311 (n = 19; 20%) accounting for \u223c75% of all samples. The geographic distribution and nesting of clusters of deer and human lineages strongly suggest multiple human-to-deer transmission events followed by subsequent deer-to-deer spread. These discoveries have important implications for the long-term persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our findings highlight an urgent need for a robust and proactive \"One Health\" approach to obtain enhanced understanding of the ecology, molecular evolution, and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.",

SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, China, toward the end of 2019 (2) , and has caused a pandemic with more than 250 million COVID-19 cases and over 5 million deaths globally as of November 2021 (3) . The virus continues to evolve and spread, with a growing concern for the emergence of new variants. SARS-CoV-2 uses the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor to enter cells (4) . ACE-2 receptors are well conserved across vertebrate species, including humans (5) , and computational analyses predict high binding affinities of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE-2 receptor in multiple animal species, indicating potential susceptibility to infection (5) . Included among these are three species of cervids: the P ere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (6) .",

The discovery of widespread infection of white-tailed deer indicates their establishment as potential reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2, a finding with important implications for the ecology, long-term persistence, and evolution of the virus, including the potential for spillback to humans. nature, we assayed 283 retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) samples collected from free-living and captive deer in Iowa from April 2020 through January 2021. Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in all 94 positive samples discovered multiple lineages corresponding to viral genotypes circulating contemporaneously in humans. In the aggregate, our results are consistent with a model of multiple independent human-to-deer transmission events followed by subsequent deer-to-deer transmission. The findings raise the concerning possibility of reverse zoonoses, especially in exurban areas with high deer density. Our results also highlight the potential risks and considerable knowledge gaps associated with the continued molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animal hosts.

The first identification of SARS-CoV-2 in deer was on 28 September 2020, in a captive deer harvested on a game preserve in southeastern Iowa ( Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Table S1 ). This was closely followed by a second positive sample identified in a free-living deer killed in a road accident on 30 September 2020, \u223c300 miles away in Woodbury County on the state's western border (SI Appendix, Table S1 ).

However, these results may be confounded in that 4 times as many RPLN were harvested from free-living deer (n = 52) as were harvested from captive deer (n = 13) during December 2020, when the virus positivity rate was at its peak in the Iowa deer herd. Hence, further studies are needed to assess the true significance or reasons for the observed differences in prevalence between free-living and captive deer. For instance, to better assess the risk of spillover and transmission, it will be important to understand whether deer in managed settings are less stressed, have different nutritional status, or otherwise exhibit behaviors that influence opportunities for spillover or within-herd transmission of SARS-CoV-2 compared with those that are free living. Preserve deer also may have fewer exposures to people, since they are not as accessible to the broader public as are free-living deer on public lands.",

In contrast, none of the nine samples collected from Black Hawk County were positive, nor were the six RPLN samples from Henry County. While the exact reasons for this heterogeneity in PCR positive response rates are unknown, this may be because of low sample size and lack of power. Alternatively, the timing of collection in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 spread in deer may play a role. For instance, the samples from Henry County were collected in April and May of 2020 during the early stages of the pandemic, well before the first positive sample was identified in deer. Similarly, all nine RPLN samples tested from Black Hawk County were collected prior to the mid-November peak of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in humans in Iowa.

A high level of sequencing coverage was obtained, and Pangolin version 3.1.11 (14) was used to identify SARS-CoV-2 lineages using previously described genome sequence analysis pipelines (15) (16) (17) . Next, we used an automated vSNP pipeline (18) to identify singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and construct phylogenetic trees in the context of 84 additional publicly available animal origin SARS-CoV-2 isolates as well as from 372 SARS-CoV-2 isolates identified from humans in Iowa during this same period (SI Appendix, Table S2 ). All newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 consensus genomes from deer RPLN are deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), and raw reads are submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Read Archive (BioProject Number PRJNA776532). The analysis identified a total of 12 SARS-CoV-2 lineages among the 94 samples from deer, with two lineages, B.1.2 (n = 51; 54.5%), and B.1.311 (n = 19; 20%), representing \u223c75% of all samples (Table 1) . Together with the next two most abundant lineages, B.1 (n = 7) and B.1.234 (n = 6), these four lineages represented \u223c88% of SARS-CoV-2 circulating among geographically widely distributed deer in the state (Table 1 ; SI Appendix, Table S2 ). While the number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Iowa is not very high (only 372 sequences are available) during this period in publicly available data, it is noteworthy that the B. 1.2 was also the most abundant (\u223c43.5%) SARS-CoV-2 lineage circulating in humans in Iowa (SI Appendix, Table S2 ). In contrast, the B.1.311 lineage, accounting for about one-fifth of the isolates in deer, was relatively poorly represented (\u223c1.6%) among the publicly available SARS-CoV-2 from humans in Iowa (SI Appendix, Table S2 ). The second-most abundant SARS-CoV-2 lineage in humans, B.1.565, accounting for \u223c8.1% of available sequences, was not identified among the sampled deer. However, given the lack of representativeness of the sampling from both humans and deer, we urge caution in interpreting these findings of apparent differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages between deer and sympatric human hosts.",

This is evidenced by the near-simultaneous recovery of multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages within temporally and geographically restricted deer herds at various locations throughout the state (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2). Recent evidence suggests that experimentally infected fawns are readily infected and transmit the virus to other susceptible fawns between 3 d and 5 d postinfection. The virus can be recovered from the palatine tonsils and RPLNs of infected animals for up to 21 d postexposure (6) . Similarly, it has been shown that adult white-tailed deer are also highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmit the virus through direct contact and vertically from doe to fetus (12) . However, evidence for deer-to-deer transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in free-living deer was not well documented. Deer experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 show no notable clinical signs; however, pathological changes characterized by rhinitis, marked attenuation of the respiratory epithelium of the trachea, bronchitis, and, in some cases, bronchiolitis were observed (12) . The clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in free-living deer and whether or not they develop symptoms or disease remain unknown. This is important, since nearly three-quarters of humans who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR also remain asymptomatic (19) . Hence, well-powered longitudinal studies may be needed to get sufficient statistical power to determine the nature of the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in deer.",

One example is evident from the Lake Rathbun area of Appanoose County, where lineage B.1.311 was predominant among deer, representing 14 of 21 positive samples (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2). The first RPLN sample harboring a B.1.311 lineage was recovered on 5 December 2020, from a hunter-killed deer from this area. This was followed by additional recoveries of B.1.311 on 8 December 2020, and then again on 2 January 2021, and 9 January 2021-more than a month apart-and with high viral loads in the lymph nodes suggestive of active infection. Together with the observation that the B.1.311 lineage was less frequently reported (based on available sequences) from humans in Iowa as well as in deer in other Iowa counties, the results suggest the continued circulation of this lineage among deer in free-living settings. However, it is important to note that, in the absence of a comprehensive longitudinal study of circulating lineages, it is not possible to formally exclude the possibility that B.1.311 was circulating within humans or other hosts in this area, and the deer were repeatedly exposed to the same point source(s) of infection.",

As evident from the branching patterns of the phylogram, the results highlight the presence of multiple independent but closely related SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating among deer in Iowa, as well as providing strong evidence for transmission within deer, as many of the genomes from individual deer shared complete genomic identity (no SNPs) or differed by between one and five SNPs. The results also highlight several branches with shared human and deer origin SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in Iowa that are related to but distinct from isolates previously identified from outbreaks from animals such as farmed mink or otters or other domesticated animal species. Hence, taken together, the results provide strong evidence of multiple spillover events of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent circulation of these strains within free-living and captive deer.",

Most viruses causing disease in humans have originated in animals, and many are capable of transmitting between multiple host species (20, 21) . The ability to infect a range of host species is a risk factor for disease emergence (22, 23) . Despite this knowledge, reservoir hosts are rarely identified and studied. Indeed, the wild animal reservoirs of SARS-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV are still not known. Indeed, while there is good evidence that dromedaries and bats may harbor MERS-CoV (24, 25) , and horseshoe bats harbor SARS (26) , wild animal reservoirs of SARS, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV are still not well understood. There have been numerous cases of isolated human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 involving companion, farmed, and zoo animals since the COVID-19 pandemic began (8, 9, 27, 28) . Our study provides evidence of widespread dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 into any free-living species, in this instance, white-tailed deer. While the precise routes of transmission of SARS-Cov-2 from humans to deer are unknown, there are several ways in which deer may be exposed to the virus from humans, including through feeding in backyards or even when a susceptible deer may come in contact with potentially infectious material (such as saliva, urine, etc.) from an infected human in forested areas or exurban environments. Deer may also become exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through contact with wastewater discharges, infected fomites, or other infected animals. Regardless of the route of transmission from humans, our results suggest that deer have the potential to emerge as a major reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2, a finding that has important implications for the future trajectory of the pandemic.",

When pathogens infect a single host species, the population dynamics are intrinsically unstable, and an outbreak spreads rapidly through a population and then fades out as hosts either develop immunity or die from the infection. The outbreak's trajectory depends on the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) and the generation time of the infection, but this changes when a pathogen is a generalist and infects multiple host species. In this instance, the dynamics are dominated by what occurs within reservoir hosts, defined as species which can maintain the infection and from which infection is transmitted to other hosts (29) .",

Evidence of some of these exists in the Denmark mink spillover event where the Y435F substitution (which conferred increased affinity of the spike protein to human ACE-2) evolved after human-to-mink transmission (8, 10, 30) . Animal reservoirs can also provide a refuge outside of a largely immune/ vaccinated human population and thus increase the threat of subsequent reemergence of ancestral genotypes into immunologically na\u0131ve or susceptible human hosts (31) . Such was the case with the 2009 A-H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic where the virus, related to both the pandemic 1918 strain and strains circulating in the early 20th century, spilled over to humans from infected pigs (31, 32) .",

In theory, pathogen evolution within a single-host system involves trade-offs with potential for transmission, but this becomes more complicated in multiple-host systems (33) . With the infection spreading so quickly through the deer population, as seen in our study, this could potentially result in fadeout, with insufficient susceptible deer recruits to sustain the infection within the deer population alone. Alternatively, with sizeable annual birth cohorts or invasion into areas where deer have not previously been infected, the virus may continue to spread among susceptible deer or circulate within the deer population. However, even while the dynamics in these multihost systems can be complex, they often result in more stable dynamics with multiple reservoir hosts, and pathogens that utilize many hosts can be at a selective advantage, since they are not lost in case they fade out in an individual species.",

However, while the generalizability of our findings remains to be tested, we see no reason why this scenario has also not already played out in other regions with large deer populations with opportunities for contact with humans. Another limitation of our study was that RPLN samples tested were all from 2020 and early 2021, representing the early part of the pandemic before the global dissemination of the highly successful Alpha and Delta variants. Hence, surveillance efforts with robust longitudinal sampling approaches are urgently needed to determine whether deer will become longterm reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 and potentially assume a role as generators of novel variant viruses that may repeatedly reemerge in humans or spill over to other animal hosts.",

In addition to the abundance, social relevance, and economic importance of deer to the US economy, the discovery of sylvatic and enzootic transmission in a substantial fraction of free-living deer has important implications for the natural ecology and long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2, including through spillover to other free-living or captive animals and potential for spillback to humans.",

            "text": "In this context, there are several important questions that require urgent attention. For instance, it is important to understand whether the observed widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission among white-tailed deer will result in virus adaptation to cervids similar to what has been observed in other species such as the mustelids. Previously, a high similarity in the white-tailed deer ACE-2 sequence was shown relative to human ACE-2, and the changes within the domains that bind the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein are at residues D30E, L79M, M82T, and E329D (5, 35) . Therefore, it is not altogether surprising that the deer ACE-2 receptors enable efficient binding by the Spike protein for viral entry, perhaps even slightly better than humans (35) , that will allow the highly efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in deer. Hence, it is tempting to predict that, unlike the observed rapid adaptions in Spike in mustelids with a restricted ACE-2 receptor, any adaptations of SARS-CoV-2 in deer during the initial waves of infection are more likely to occur in regions outside of the Spike protein. However, since experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in deer elicits a rapid neutralizing antibody immune response (12) , future investigations should closely monitor the evolutionary trajectories of Table S3 ). The genome sequences were screened for quality, SNP positions called against the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512), and SNP alignments used to generate a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree using RAxML. The results show several genetically distinct clusters of animal and human SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating within Iowa white-tailed deer, with clades highlighted in salmon color, consistent with multiple spillover events from humans to deer. Six branches with shared human and white-tailed deer SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in Iowa are highlighted. The genome sequences from white-tailed deer were genetically distinct from isolates from outbreaks in farmed mink (periwinkle color) and otters (fern color) but were closely related to SARS-CoV-2 genomes recovered from humans in Iowa.",

Hence, it will be important to understand and monitor whether the high levels of infection in deer observed in our studies might result in spillover and onward transmission to other hosts, with opportunities for further viral adaptation. In particular, we note that domesticated cattle have shown low susceptibility to infection with low levels of viral replication and only limited seroconversion when experimentally challenged with extant lineages of SARS-CoV-2 (36) (37) (38) . However, it remains unknown whether cattle and other large, farmed ungulate species, including sheep, goats, camelids, or equids, may become susceptible to emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants adapted in deer.

Weekly reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in humans per 100,000 population in Iowa from 30 March 2020 to 7 March 2021 (blue bars; left y axis) and monthly SARS-CoV-2 test positivity with 95% CI in white-tailed deer from September 2020 to January 2021 (red line; right y axis). The timing of the first positive sample identified in white-tailed deer on 28 September 2020 is marked, as are the start and end of the white-tailed deer hunting season on 19 September 2020 and 10 January 2021, respectively.

However, the single outlier isolate lineage B.1.311 was recovered from a deer at this preserve together with 12 specimens harboring the B.1.2 lineage on the same day(24 November 2020). Similarly, in the Yellow River State Forest area in Allamakee County, during the 5 d between 5 December and 9 December, all 11 hunter-killed deer were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their RPLNs. Nine of these samples were represented by the B.1.2 lineage. The two outliers, represented by B.1.311 and B.1.459 lineages were recovered from hunter-killed deer on the same date, 8 December 2020, as was another deer harboring the B.1.2 lineage. All these deer were hunted within a few miles of each other. A third example of the near-synchronous recovery of genetically distinctive SARS-CoV-2 lineages from infected deer is from the Volga River State Recreation Area in Fayette County, where four lineages were recovered from the RPLN of hunter-killed deer within a 2-mi radius in the 3 d spanning 7 December through 9 December 2020. A final example is from within a 5-mi radius of the Lake Rathbun area of Appanoose County where, on a single day, 10 positive deer RPLNs were harvested by hunters. Five distinct lineages were represented among these sampleslineage B.1.311 was recovered from six deer RPLNs, while lineages B.1.362, B.1.240, B.1.400, and B.1 were recovered from one RPLN each. Together, these findings strongly suggest multiple point sources of spillover of distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages to captive and free-living deer.",
