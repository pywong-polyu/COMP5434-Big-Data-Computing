The \"micro\"method would be to follow the fate of each member of the population modelling, its contacts and its infection happenings to microscopically model the pandemic in the way of a \"Maxwell Demon\". Like in thermodynamics, this is not possible due to the lack of sufficient information. Therefore, in the other strategy, only average \"macroscopic\" aspects are taken into account. Most models are based on the so-called SIR model or extensions from it [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and depend on time as the independent variable. These models use multiple parameters like basic reproduction number 2020-07-06 2 0 R [2, 8, 10] , average times of infection and recovery, and rates for migitation measures (see e.g. [10] ) to be fit to data. All these parameters are macroscopic averages thought to characterize a pandemic. As a consequence every country which has become a hotspot for the pandemic had to be treated individually with hugely varying conclusions (see e.g. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] ).",

Plotted is the ratio of growth factors for a pair of countries with approximately the same number of inhabitants vs. the ratio of their population densities. The red squares give the ratio of growth factors multiplied by the ratio of population numbers to correct for that influence, the red circles are obtained by multiplying with a correction factor \uf067 which indicate differences in the social distancing. Values are UK/F=0.55, DK/NZ=1.29 and US/BR=0.83 (a value<1 means that the first country of the pair has better control over the pandemic). The full line is the function 2.2 0.79 / x with x the ratio of densities. The diagram clearly shows that there is indeed a influence of the population density on the pandemic, but since it depends only on the square root it is of minor importance.",

By analyzing the empirical data from countries with sufficient resources to give somewhat reliable infection numbers, we have been able to extract a simple generic law for the general dynamics of the pandemic. This law describes the increase of the doubling time D as a function not of time, but of the total number 2020-07-06 3 of infections. The law depends, besides on the doubling time 0 D at the beginning of the pandemic characterizing the initial spread of the infection, on two more parameters: a proportionality constant \uf072 coined \"mitigation factor\" that describes an exponential growth of D , and the end point of the pandemic finit N , both crucially depending only on the enclosed population. Other parameters assumed to be relevant like the population density show surprisingly little relevance in this model. Based on this very simple model we show that all centers of outbreak follow this law. Furthermore, it allows us to identify different waves in specific countries as well as the onset and easing of measures, evaluate the usefulness of certain measures, and, most important, provide a criterion for when the epidemic ends. All of this allows drawing very general conclusions on how the pandemic evolves in different countries, how to act now, when a new wave of outbreaks hits or a new pandemic arises.",

Exemplarily, the time dependence of the doubling time is shown for Switzerland (blue circles and lines). In the first days of the pandemic the doubling times are almost constant (with some statistical jitter due to the small numbers) leading to the exponential growth of the infection number. Then the measures used by all countries to control the epidemic begin to work and the doubling times increase. In the Gompertz model this increase is linear on a logarithmic scale. For later times the empirical data clearly deviate from this dependence, which our model is able to describe. Note the quite substantial non-linearity, despite the simple laws given by Eqs.
