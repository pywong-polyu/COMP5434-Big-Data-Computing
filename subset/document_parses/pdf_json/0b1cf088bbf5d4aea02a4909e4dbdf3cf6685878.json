            "text": "Optimization of antibiotic administration helps minimizing cases of bacterial resistance. Dosages are often selected by trial and error using a pharmacokinetic (PK) model. However, this is limited to the range of tested dosages, restraining possible treatment choices, especially for the loading doses. Colistin is a last-resort antibiotic with a narrow therapeutic window; therefore, its administration should avoid subtherapeutic or toxic concentrations. This study formulates an optimal control problem for dosage selection of colistin based on a PK model, minimizing deviations of colistin concentration to a target value and allowing a specific dosage optimization for a given individual. An adjoint model was used to provide the sensitivity of concentration deviations to dose changes. A three-compartment PK model was adopted. The standard deviation between colistin plasma concentrations and a target set at 2 mg/L was minimized for some chosen treatments and sample patients. Significantly lower deviations from the target concentration are obtained for shorter administration intervals (e.g. every 8 h) compared to longer ones (e.g. every 24 h). For patients with normal or altered renal function, the optimal loading dose regimen should be divided into two or more administrations to attain the target concentration quickly, with a high first loading dose followed by much lower ones. This regimen is not easily obtained by trial and error, highlighting advantages of the method. The present method is a refined optimization of antibiotic dosage for the treatment of infections. Results for colistin suggest significant improvement in treatment avoiding subtherapeutic or toxic concentrations.",

Nonetheless, cases of resistance to these other drugs emerged and colistin has been shown to be a viable therapeutic option against pathogens which are very difficult to treat, such as Gram-negative bacteria [14, 15] . For this reason, interest in colistin was renewed in the 2000s, and it has been used as a last resort antibiotic [12] . Intravenous (IV) administration of colistin is often used in cases of nosocomial pneumonia (ventilator-associated or not) due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae [16, 17] , since after IV administration, the molecule is able to cross the blood-air barrier and reach the lung tissues [18, 19] . Colistin is administered as an inactive prodrug, colistimethate sodium (CMS), to mitigate its toxicity [12] . Once administered, CMS is hydrolyzed in colistin, most probably in the bladder of the patients, and approximately 70% of the CMS dose is rapidly eliminated in the urine [20, 21] . Therefore, the dose should be adjusted for patients presenting renal problems [22, 23] .",

Therefore, colistin administration would greatly benefit from an optimization targeting the safe plasma concentration. Target steady-state concentrations may be obtained using standard methods for linear PK modes [28] , but the optimization should also involve the loading dose, in order that the target concentration be rapidly attained.

Instead of a selection of doses by trial and error, which invariably limits the possible choices, we formulate an optimization problem that leads to an optimal control formulation. Control theory has been used to optimize treatment in problems with available PK/PD models, such as HIV infections [29, 30] , cancer therapy [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , or to optimize strategies for the prevention of infectious diseases such as cholera [36] , Zika virus infection [37] and COVID-19 [38] . For colistin administration, the optimization problem minimizes the deviations between the plasma concentration of colistin and its target value. Additionally, the optimal regimen was individualized according to the creatinine clearance of the patients. While this work focuses on the specific case of colistin, the formulation is general and allows optimization of administration of other drugs whenever a PK model is available.",

Notice that the specification of a target concentration y t t \u00f0 \u00de is arbitrary. For instance, one may specify a desired concentration curve as a function of time, considered to be ideal for clinical application. The procedure will then determine a drug administration that minimizes deviations to such target curve y t t \u00f0 \u00de. The present problem is a constrained optimization, where one wishes to minimize the functional J with respect to u such that the constraints given by Eqs. (9) and (11) are satisfied. This may be solved using Lagrange multipliers or adjoint variables, as in optimal control works dealing with cancer therapy [32, 35] or vaccination strategies [37, 38] .

The optimized dose so obtained minimizes the objection in Eq.

In this case, an interesting possibility is the inclusion of toxicity considerations. The objective functional of Eq.

Such penalization terms appear as costs introduced to the objective functional, as in Kirschner et al. [30] and Joshi [29] . The introduction of penalization terms to the objective functional and subsequent derivation of the optimal control problem should reduce toxicity cases. Notice however that the use of a target concentration of 2 mg/L in the present framework already limits toxicity, as the optimization naturally converges to this concentration avoiding values significantly above the target.",

As the PK model used in this work is linear, optimal doses for other target concentrations may be obtained directly by multiplying the doses reported here by a factor. For instance, a target concentration of 3 mg/L is obtained by multiplying all doses by 1.5, leading to a daily maintenance dose of about 10.5 MIU of CMS. The maintenance doses (around 7 MIU of CMS daily) suggested by this present model for a patient with a normal renal function are higher than the doses frequently used in the clinical practice (3 to 6 MIU of CMS per day) [21, 46] . However, this suggested dose is lower than the dose recently recommended by the International Consensus Guidelines for the Optimal Use of the Polymyxins for a patient presenting a creatinine clearance of 80 mL/min (10.3 MIU of CMS) [26] . This could be explained by the fact that the latter consensus was based on works [22, 25] that developed a dosing algorithm that did not use the median values of obtained data. Instead of this, the authors performed dosing adjustments such that more than 80% of the patients achieve concentrations equal or higher than the target. We have used the same model [22] , but we have used the median values, which means that 50% of the patients would be above and the other 50% would be below the target concentration.",

Interestingly, the loading dose obtained as optimal control was different from those often used by physicians. The optimal loading regimen is divided into 2 or more administrations, especially for shorter intervals between the administrations. A high loading dose is initially recommended followed by a dose much lower than the first one. This regimen is interesting for the treatment with colistin, since it allows one to attain more rapidly the target plasma concentration, avoiding plasma concentrations much higher than the target. Such loading regimen deserves further investigation.",

            "text": "One of the advantages of the present method is that it allows the selection of doses for specific patients. As most of CMS is excreted in the urine, it is expected that a reduction in the renal function increases the plasma concentration of CMS and, consequently, that of colistin. This requires a dose reduction, as demonstrated in previous works [22, 25] , and also obtained in this study. Interestingly, for a patient presenting creatinine clearance equal to 20 mL/min the c values after an administration every 8, 12 and 24 h were comparable (0.18, 0.19 and 0.23 mg/L) (Figs. 4b, d and f) . This can be explained by the fact that this patient eliminates CMS more slowly, which results in a lower fluctuation of the plasma concentrations over time, keeping these concentrations closer to the target values, even after an administration every 24 h. On the other hand, for a patient presenting high creatinine clearance, such as 150 mL/min, the c values were considerably lower for a shorter interval between the infusions (0.18, 0.25 and 0.54 mg/L) after an administration every 8, 12 and 24 h, respectively, Figs. 4b, d and f). Such augmented renal clearance is often observed for patients with traumatic injury [2] . The faster elimination of CMS suggests a treatment with shorter intervals between infusions, which, when optimized, leads to lower deviations of colistin plasma concentration to its target value. For the larger interval of 24 h (Fig. 4f ) the higher clearance leads to a sharp decrease of colistin concentration between infusions, with a significant period with concentrations lower than 2 mg/L.",

The optimized doses show differences to currently used values, especially for a loading regimen which often uses multiple administrations with varying doses, leading to a faster attainment of the target concentration without toxicity issues. Moreover, the quantification of the optimal standard deviation c allows an evaluation of potential benefits of lower administration intervals.
