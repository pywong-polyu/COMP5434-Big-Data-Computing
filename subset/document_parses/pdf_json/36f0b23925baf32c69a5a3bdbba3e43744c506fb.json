Moreover, the method of piecewise arguments is used to discretize the continuous system. The mathematical system is said to reveal six equilibria, namely, extinction equilibrium, boundary equilibrium, quarantined-free equilibrium, exposure-free equilibrium, endemic equilibrium, and the equilibrium free from susceptible population. Local stability conditions are developed for our discrete-time mathematical system about each of its equilibrium point. The existence of period-doubling bifurcation and chaos is studied in the absence of isolated population. It is shown that our system will become unstable and experiences the chaos when the quarantined compartment is empty, which is true in biological meanings. The existence of Neimark-Sacker bifurcation is studied for the endemic equilibrium point. Moreover, it is shown numerically that our discrete-time mathematical system experiences the period-doubling bifurcation about its endemic equilibrium. To control the period-doubling bifurcation, Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, a generalized hybrid control methodology is used. Moreover, this model is analyzed along with generalized hybrid control in order to eliminate chaos and oscillation epidemiologically presenting the significance of quarantine in the COVID-19 environment.",

            "text": "from that community. Presently, COVID-19 is of main alarm to governments, researchers and to all of the mankind. This is due to the high percentage of the infection range and the very high number of deaths that happened. The very first case of infectious disease COVID-19 is reported in Wuhan city of China. Moreover, it spread almost everywhere in the world. On January 2020, the WHO approved its outburst as a public health disaster of international concern. On April 2020, 47, 249 people had died and the total of 936,237 people are tested positive for COVID-19 [1] . COVID-19 ranges due to the interaction of individuals with infected individual when they sneeze or cough. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease with slight to temperate signs like fever, dry cough and tiredness. In severe cases, it causes the difficulty in breathing [1] . Also, few people having mild symptoms of COVID-19 disease may recuperate themselves if they evade to contact with infected cases and maintain good sanitization. COVID-19 is a key health warning to individuals with a previous medical history and also to individuals who are 60 years or above in age (elderly population). This was described by Li et al. [2] who considered the average age of 425 people infected with COVID-19 in city Wuhan, China, and almost half of the patients were above the age of 60. Governments of every country in the world are taking numerous defensive measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Till date, there is no effective vaccine present in the world to fight against the COVID-19 virus. Hence, stopping the spread is the only way to fight against this virus. Defensive actions include sanitizing hands regularly, keeping the distance of 1 meter at least from a person coughing or sneezing, and maintaining social distance. Numerous mathematical models have been established so far to report various challenges in foreseeing the outburst of COVID-19 disease. The author in [3] has used the elementary SIR-model to discover the real dimensions of the epidemic. Peng et al. [4] analyzed the situation of COVID-19 in China by expressing the SEIR dynamical system. Furthermore, he have foretold that the situation will be under control at the start of April. Sun et al. [5] argued numerous parts of COVID-19 condition in China which assistances recognize the casualty rate and spread rate of COVID-19 and control the epidemic transmission. In the situation of COVID-19 prevalent, experience to disease plays a dynamic role in the transmission of the COVID-19. The author in [6] has studied numerous models and determined that with the basic reproduction number being 2 and bearing in mind the 14-day contagious period, if an infected individual stays for 9 or more hours with others, he could infect others. If the contact time is 18 h, the model endorses total shield with more than 70 usefulness to the attendees of the communal gathering. The authors in [7] have discussed the importance of travel restriction to control the COVID-19 disease. In addition, they explained that these travel restriction delayed the progression of disease in Wuhan city of China. A related consequence was also revealed by Kucharski et al. [8] . They exposed that with the journey limitation in Wuhan, the daily reproduction number decayed from 2.35 to 1.05. Furthermore, there is correspondingly a model calculated by Tang et al. [9] and Tang et al. [10] wherein they separated the subpopulation into isolated and unisolated classes to know the spread threat of the epidemic.",

The authors in [12] have studied the dynamics of a mathematical model by using classical Caputo fractional derivative. Oud et al. [13] have studied a fractional order mathematical model for COVID-19 dynamics with isolation, quarantine, and environmental viral load. For the study of some interesting models related to COVID-19 pandemic, we refer a reader to [14] [15] [16] [17] . From the evaluations so far, we have noticed that isolation plays a huge role in controlling the disease spread. Here, we have considered a mathematically compartmental model for the persons already anguish from hypertension or diabetes who are at a greater chance of getting infected with COVID-19 (see [1] ). Moreover, the authors in [1] have considered a model by means of Z-control applied to the isolated class to get the essential exposure state in command to make the system free of chaos. Limited number of basic models related to the Z-control contains wide-ranging model by Samanta [18] and prey-predator model by Alzahrani et al. [19] . With three conjointly exclusive classes, namely, susceptible class, tested for hypertension or diabetes (S); exposed or unprotected class (E); and quarantine class (Q). Values of parameters considered in the preparation of our mathematical system are provided in Table 1 . In our model, the susceptible class is considered as a population tested for hypertension or suffering from diabetes. Here, the birth rate for new individuals is represented by B, and all the population in their particular sections undergo death at the uniform rate \u03bc. Let us represent the saturated rate by \u03b2 2 SE a+S , where a is the constant of saturation and \u03b2 2 is the infection force as shown in Fig. 1 . With the help of Fig. 1 , we get the following system of nonlinear differential equations [1] :",

Where all conditions for existence and positivity of (S * , E * , Q * ) are given in Lemmas 2.3 and 3.3. Here, we will discuss the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation experienced by system (4) about (S * , E * , Q * ) under some mathematical conditions. Bifurcation is the mathematical phenomena produced in any system due to creation of very small change in stability of system. Mathematically, bifurcation arises whenever parameters are varied in very least neighborhood of equilibrium point. Moreover, for further study of bifurcation theory and to understand this surprising behavior of a discrete-time mathematical system one can see [31] [32] [33] [34] . We deliberate the Neimark-Sacker Bifurcation for positive equilibrium point (S * , E * , Q * ) of system (4) by using an obvious criterion for Neimark-Sacker Bifurcation and compelling \u03bc as a bifurcation parameter. Due to appearance of Neimark-Sacker Bifurcation, closed invariant circles are formed. Equally, one can find some lonely orbits of periodic performance alongside with paths that cover the invariant circle tightly. The bifurcation can be supercritical or subcritical causing in a stable or unstable closed invariant curve, correspondingly. In command to study the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in system (4), we have the next obvious standard of Hopf bifurcation [35] . By means of this standard, one can catch the presence of Neimark-Sacker bifurcation deprived of finding the eigenvalues. Lemma 6.1 (see [35] ) Consider an m-dimensional discrete dynamical system Y K +1 = g \u03b1 (Y K ), where \u03b1 \u2208 is bifurcation parameter. Let Y * be a fixed point of g \u03b1 and the characteristic polynomial for Jacobian matrix J (Y * ) = (s i j ) m\u00d7m of m-dimensional map g \u03b1 is given by 2, 3 , ...., m and s is control parameter or another parameter to be determined.",

Generally discrete-time mathematical systems are more complex to analyze as compared to continuous one. It is necessary that the population does not experience any irregular situation. Hence, to avoid these irregularities a chaos controlling technique must be implemented. In this part of manuscript, we study a feedback control strategy with parameter perturbation to move unstable and irregular trajectories toward the stable trajectories. The most useful and well-known method in the field of chaos is given by Ott et al. [36] to control period-doubling bifurcation, which is known as OGY method. Latter on, numerous strategic control methods are developed (see [22, 37] ). Here, we present a modified hybrid control method to control the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation and chaos. Furthermore, this mathematical method is well applicable to every discrete-time system experiencing the period-doubling bifurcation and chaos. Originally, hybrid method was proposed by Liu et al. [27] . Moreover, it was developed to control the period-doubling bifurcation (see [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ). Here, we have used the modified hybrid control technique [22] to control Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Moreover, this technique is much better then old techniques of control.
