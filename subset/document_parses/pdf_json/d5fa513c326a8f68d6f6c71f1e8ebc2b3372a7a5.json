Lee and Robbins (1995) later expanded upon this theory by conceptualizing social connectedness, defined as one's subjective awareness of close social relationships (Lee & Robbins, 1995) . This study will focus on key dimensions of social connectedness in line with belongingness theory; namely emotional closeness, feeling bonded, being understood, and a sense of belonging (Kohut, 1984; Lee & Robbins, 1995) . Underpinned by Kohut's (1984) belongingness theory, strong feelings of social connectedness enhance an individual's mental and physical health (e.g., Begun et al., 2018; Deindl et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2001) . Within healthcare, empirical evidence indicates that weak social connectedness represents a serious risk factor for several chronic illnesses (Larrabee Sonderlund et al., 2019) . The limited research that exists in a physical chronic illness context indicates that low levels of social connectedness are a strong predictor of depression, anxiety, and poorer general health (Hatchcock, 2012) .",

Social connectedness within CF is particularly relevant given various pertinent disease factors. For example, infection control guidelines preclude people with CF from meeting each other inperson and recommend avoidance of every day respiratory infections (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), 2020; Saiman et al., 2014) , there is a demanding daily CF treatment regime (Sawicki et al., 2009) , and there is a relatively high prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms within the CF population (Quittner et al., 2014a) . Social connectedness is also a particularly relevant concept to explore within a CF context during a health pandemic. People with CF might be at an increased risk for severe illness from this virus compared to healthy age matched individuals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2021). It follows that people with CF might be at greater health risk from in-person contact, and thus significantly affected by the social distancing restrictions implemented across Australia during early 2020.",

At the heart of social connectedness is an individual's perceived feelings of social bonding, meaningful connection, and interpersonal relatedness (Grieve & Kemp, 2015; Lee et al., 2001) . Social connectedness is how we view and feel about ourselves in relation to other people (Lee & Robbins, 2000; Sinclair & Grieve, 2017) . The sense of interpersonal closeness derived from social connectedness includes both proximal relationships such as family, and distal relationships such as general society (Lee & Robbins, 1998) . Individuals who have a strong sense of social connectedness tend to feel a sense of closeness to, and understanding by, other people (Lee et al., 2001) .",

This research has found that social connectedness is positively related to mental and physical health (e.g., Begun et al., 2018; Caxaj & Gill, 2017; Collins et al., 2017) . In healthcare, research indicates that weak social connectedness represents a serious risk factor for several chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, various cancers, and mental health (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010; Larrabee Sonderlund et al., 2019) . The quality and quantity of an individual's social relationships is viewed a predicter of morbidity and mortality (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010) . Subsequently, healthcare researchers have called for the inclusion of social connectedness assessments in routine medical settings (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010; Larrabee Sonderlund et al., 2019) . Within a mental illness setting, social connectedness is deemed an essential dimension of personal recovery (e.g., Leamy et al., 2001; Pahwa et al., 2019; Sweet et al., 2018) . Social connectedness research within physical chronic illness is limited, but considered essential to combatting the social isolation that can often accompany chronic illness (Stenberg & Furness, 2017) . Low levels of social connectedness are also considered a strong predictor of depression, anxiety and general health within this population (Hatchcock, 2012) . In an unfortunate and complex interplay, physical chronic illness has been found to be a disrupter of social connectedness (Person et al., 2007; Soleimani et al., 2014) and low levels of social connectedness an exacerbator of the negative consequences of living with a physical chronic illness (Person et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Pertinent disease factors make social connectedness within CF an important research area. First, infection control guidelines precluding people with CF meeting each other in-person emerged during the nineties due to increasing concern regarding transmission of pathogens between people with CF (Saiman et al., 2014) . Prior to this time, many people with CF were readily socializing in-person, using a range of group support settings to facilitate relationship development and sharing of experiences with others with CF (Muther et al., 2018) . This type of inperson contact is known to be beneficial to people in many disease groups, by enhancing social connectedness and validation of experience (Kirk & Milnes, 2015) . Infection control guidelines introduced in the nineties therefore added a unique social connectedness barrier for those with CF. Additionally, guidelines also recommend that people with CF avoid every day respiratory infections, such as the common cold, because contamination could have more serious consequences compared to someone without CF (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), 2020). Infection control, in-person contact restrictions and social isolation are therefore issues the CF community have been managing long before the arrival of COVID-19, and part of this management has involved using online communication tools (e.g., Grossoehme et al., 2012; Moola, 2018; Quittner et al., 2016) . The demographics of the adult CF community include a significant number of people who have grown up with or are competent with online communication (Dale et al., 2016) . Consequently, the online CF community is strong, with many CF health professionals, people with CF and the family members of those with CF embracing a vast array of online communication tools, such as social media, to promote communication, information sharing, connection and support (Strekalova, 2016; Dale et al., 2016; Jeffrey et al., 2020) .",

In the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the health risks to people with CF were completely unknown and many countries considered this population to be highly vulnerable to the virus (Cosgriff et al., 2020) . Since this time, initial research into the effects of COVID-19 in the CF population suggest outcomes similar to the general population (Cosgriff et al., 2020; McClenaghan et al., 2020) . A more severe clinical course however may be associated with older age, CF-related diabetes, lower lung function in the year prior to infection, and having received an organ transplant (McClenaghan et al., 2020) . Whilst outcomes are better than initially feared overall, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that having CF might increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 compared to healthy age matched individuals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2021), and that those in this cohort who have had an organ transplant are at increased risk (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2021). Given that COVID-19 is a contagious disease that can be transmitted personto-person, it follows that people with CF might be at greater risk from in-person contact (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2021).",

People in general with underlaying mental and physical illness are at highest risk of social isolation and consequent adverse psychological effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Druss, 2020; Razai et al., 2020) . CF specific research highlights the importance of trusting human relationships between health professionals and those living with CF, and encourages the use of online communication amidst COVID-19 to share information and promote psychological health (Nobili et al., 2021) . Interestingly, preliminary studies demonstrate that adults with CF have similar levels of psychological distress during COVID-19 compared to the general population (Ciprandi et al., 2021; Haversman et al. 2020) . One may speculate that this could be owing to resilience resulting from life-long experience coping with infection control (Ciprandi et al., 2021) .

The study commencement date marked one week of no new COVID-19 cases reported in Western Australia. Due to the contagious nature of COVID-19 and lack of vaccination at that time, the Western Australian government implemented a range of stringent control measures early into the pandemic to limit the risk of COVID-19 spreading throughout the community (Western Australia Government, 2020a). These \"go hard, go early\" (ABC News, 2021) measures included all West Australians staying at home with rare exemptions, the closure of recreation facilities and non-essential businesses, gatherings excluding household members limited to two people, home-schooling, home-based childcare, and restricted intrastate and interstate travel (Western Australia Government, 2020a).

IRH is a research institute based in Western Australia dedicated to investigating respiratory disease. IRH hold a database of contact details for people with CF who have been involved in previous studies. An IRH recruitment officer selected people at random by telephoning every fifth person on the database. To participate in the study, people had to be at least 18 years old, with a CF diagnosis, English speaking (this did not exclude anyone approached to take part in the study), and medically stable (not a hospital inpatient) at time of interview. The study had strict time limitations on the recruitment and interview phase, to ensure a consistent COVID-19 context during data collection. All participants had to be recruited and interviewed within a four-week timeframe, when they were all dealing with similar COVID-19 rates, information and restrictions. This timeframe allowed for thirty-two people to be contacted by the IRH recruitment officer, with 21 (66%) people voicing interest in the study and openness to further information. Further contact was attempted with 20 of these people within time constraints, 17 of which were recruited as they scheduled an interview and provided informed written consent within the study timeframe. Participants consented to the publication of information provided. All participants were provided with information on where to access mental health support post interview if required, however no known adverse effects were caused by participation.",

Semistructured interviewing enabled openness and flexibility for participants to talk about what they deemed important, while an interview schedule supported focus and analysis. Prior to interview, participants were provided with an explanation of social connectedness that focused on key dimensions of the concept in line with belongingness theory; specifically that it is a feeling of emotional closeness, feeling bonded, being understood, and a sense of belonging to people in your life that you know, and the world in general (Kohut, 1984; Lee & Robbins, 1995) .

Final questions explored value placed upon social connectedness (e.g., Do you think social connectedness is important, and if so, why?). Due to COVID-19 transmission concerns online encrypted videoconferencing was used, allowing audio-visual queues and real-time conversation, and offering time and travel cost advantages to participants (Irani, 2019; Salmons, 2012) . Participants were also given the choice of being interviewed via telephone to promote socioeconomic inclusivity.

Our findings support existing research outside CF which suggests several mechanisms linking social connectedness with health, for example, the influence of social network health norms on health behaviour, and social connectedness enabling access to practical and emotional support to help buffer stress (Larrabee Sonderlund et al., 2019; Uchino, 2006; Uchino et al., 1996 Uchino et al., , 2013 . This is particularly significant in a cohort of people with a chronic and complex disease, who face elevated rates of anxiety and depression symptoms and a demanding daily treatment burden (Quittner et al., 2014a; Eakin et al., 2011) . It follows that social connectedness-based conversations, assessments and interventions as part of routine CF healthcare are recommended, with the goal of enhancing social connectedness where required.",

For some vulnerable groups in this pandemic, such as the elderly (Armitage & Nellums, 2020) , harnessing online technologies to promote social connectedness has proved a challenge. The ability to enhance social connectedness through online communication hinges upon a range of factors, for example, socioeconomic status, online literacy, level of disability and method of online communication (Masoud et al., 2021) . Research does however demonstrate that if people have access and ability, attaining a sense of belonging and social connectedness online is indeed possible and associated with improved mental health (Armitage & Nellums, 2020; Clark et al., 2018) . Given the CF community's pre-pandemic familiarity with online platforms, and the range of infection control and time advantages it offers inside and outside of COVID-19, it seems logical that we must utilize this skill.",

Results therefore may not reflect those struggling with low levels of social connectedness in the cohort. Moreover, a large majority of participants are employed and live with someone. These are potential social connectedness protective factors, and again may not be representation of the most vulnerable people.",
