Integrating the on-site real classes by teachers [e.g., a small group of 10 (from 4th grade onwards) in a physical class of 30] for asymptomatic students with virtual mode for 20 at home or hostel, per session. These physical classes' recordings may be relayed online in a staggered manner along with the interaction of the students on-site. The former may flip at the end of a week or session. Likewise, a digital repository unique to the grade, accessible and available for review/quality check will be created. It may be safely implemented by schools, after considering number of COVID cases (e.g., if < 500/1 million population, in the last 7 d, in a particular zone) [3] . This approach of amalgamating the physical and online teaching is the need of the hour: an implicit mechanism for regaining children's confidence and social bonding skills. Team building (with other children in real life) will also unmask creative energy as they actually interact with others; improving their emotional intelligence and well-being.",
