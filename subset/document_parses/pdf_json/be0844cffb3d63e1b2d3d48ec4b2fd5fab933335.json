In spite of the promise of artificial intelligence, there are very few models which bridge the gap between traditional humancentered diagnosis and the potential future of machine-centered disease diagnosis. Under the concept of human-computer interaction design, this study proposes a new explainable artificial intelligence method that exploits graph analysis for feature visualization and optimization for the purpose of COVID-19 diagnosis from blood test samples. In this developed model, an explainable decision forest classifier is employed to COVID-19 classification based on routinely available patient blood test data. The approach enables the clinician to use the decision tree and feature visualization to guide the explainability and interpretability of the prediction model. By utilizing this novel feature selection phase, the proposed diagnosis model will not only improve diagnosis accuracy but decrease the execution time as well.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the interpretability and explainability issues relating to the modern AI-based tools should be taken into account, since these could further impede their implementation in healthcare applications. Within machine learning techniques, deep-learning approaches, due to their ability to automatically extract representations from the learning data that are relevant to their predictions, achieved state-of-the-art results in many areas, e.g., computer vision [28, 29] , speech recognition [30, 31] , and signal processing [32, 33] . This motivated researchers to extend such approach to COVID-19 detection and prediction where it is commonly it is acknowledged that complex machine-learning models such as deep learning and XGBoost perform better than simple models such as logistic regression in the COVID-19 diagnosis [16, 34] . Despite their acknowledged performance, the widespread employ of deep learning models is halted by the capacity of such models to provide explanations to their findings, in a way to promote transparency, responsibility and ethical considerations when comprehending the outcomes of such models, especially in the light of the new data protection EU directive on the \"right of explanation\" [35] . This demand is even more stressed in healthcare sector where any diagnostic error can have fatal consequences on patient life. This raises the need to equip the complex deep-learning black-box models with explanatory modules to accommodate this new need. For example, a physician should understand why a machine learning model provides a given diagnosis and be able to explain it to the patients. This explains why most of deep-learning models implemented in healthcare field rather act as protypes and for aid to decision-support only, offering the possibility to the clinician to bypass the model output or seeking an alternative measurement strategy prior to make clinical decision. This renders several physicians reticent to utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence-based models that are not straightly explainable, interpretable and reliable. Nevertheless, enforcing explainability and transparency in deep-learning models often comes at the expense of increased time complexity and, sometimes, even system accuracy. How to balance accuracy, explainability, and other factors of artificial intelligence in medical applications remains a challenge today. As a result, not only it is necessary to develop complex and efficient model to process such COVID-19 medical data, but also to be able to explain and interpret their decisions. Research in eXplainable AI (XAI) [36] [37] [38] aims to provides tools and method for explaining deep-learning models through model approximation, enhanced feature contribution visualization, rule-based generation, among others, enabling either local or global explanation of the model outcome.",

The proposed model includes four principal steps. First, the original features of COVID-19 dataset are shown as a graph where each feature is indicated by a node and the links show the similarities between the corresponding features. In the next step, a novel scoring mechanism is proposed for feature importance calculation. The aim of this step is to rank different features based on filtering feature weighting. In the next step, an iterative search mechanism is proposed to choose final features. Therefore, the proposed features selection mechanism while removing redundant features, will also eliminate irrelevant features with the label of COVID-19 dataset. After selecting the final features, in the fourth step, the ensemble Decision Forests classifier is employed to COVID-19 screening in routine blood tests. The proposed strategy has several innovations compared with the previous intelligent COVID-19 prediction approaches:",

            "text": "1 In contrast to relatively demanding RT-PCR method, this study uses blood tests, which are faster, more accessible, and less expensive than PCR testing. Therefore, blood tests can potentially provide an alternative tool for the rapid diagnosis of infected cases and compensate for the lack of RT-PCR and CT scan by serving as an early detection tool. 2 An explainable artificial intelligence decision system based on Decision Tree (DT) that can support physicians in the COVID-19 diagnosis with a number of simple and explainable rules is developed and put forward. 3 Unlike black-box deep learning-based COVID-19 diagnosis models, which are difficult to explain to physicians, the proposed prediction model is based on DT that physicians can trust due to its acknowledged explainability and transparency. 4 Many of previous prediction model for COVID-19 diagnosis use a single classifier for final prediction, which reduces their generalization capabilities. In contrast, our model uses a novel Ensemble Learning-based prediction model, which offered increased prediction accuracy. 5 Although, previous explainable machine learning models focused on sample-wise (local) explanations, our method focuses on explaining the entire dataset (global explanation) via a single model. In this study, an individual explanation in a graph representation is provided that shows the relative importance of each feature and their interactions. 6 The developed approach uses a novel graph mining strategy to find similar features and discard redundant feature, which automatically comprehends the number of relevant feature unlike other clustering methods such as k-means [39] and fuzzy clustering [40] where some prior-knowledge is required. 7 Our model uses a novel graph-based technique to measure feature score and feature similarities, while traditional models only measure feature relevance in their feature selection procedure. 8 The developed model employs a social network-based technique and the node centrality measure to propose a heuristic search method. In comparison with nature-inspired methods such as [41] , the proposed method is enough fast and more accurate and can be applied to medical dataset. The proposed method calculates feature similarities and then applies a scoring mechanism to allocate an importance weight to each feature. Therefore, the developed method satisfies both objectives of feature relevance and feature redundancy in a multi-objective function. Unlike other multi-objective models that choose a set of non-dominated feature in their optimization phase [42, 43] , the developed search mechanism seeks the optimal feature set in a reasonable amount of time.",

Then, the next feature with the highest FI is considered as the candidate feature, and the average similarity of this feature with the previously selected features is calculated using the Pearson similarity criterion.

A decision tree is a prediction algorithm that performs a set of test conjunctions where each test evaluates a feature score with a threshold value or a set of feasible values to decide whether to maintain or discard the underlined feature. In order to divide the dataset into disjoint subsets, test nodes are created starting from the root node. The recursive process repeats itself until no further division is necessary. Since each leaf corresponds to a combination of features, it is easy to interpret local decisions. These capabilities make DT widely employed for different applications that require a comprehension of both the model construction and its prediction. Although decision tree-based prediction models are highly interpretable, these intelligent decisionmaking models have limited prediction performance due to the nearsightedness characteristic of their induction models [89, 90] . When complex interactions exist among input features, DT models usually fail to capture these, leading to essential biases. To deal with this issue, a decision forest, or ensemble of decision trees, is adopted in our approach. Decision Forest (DF) is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm for integrating the results of several machine learning algorithms into a single decision.",

This COVID-19 dataset included 5644 patients and 111 features (includes 69 Decimal features, 37 String features and 5 Universally unique identifier features) associated with blood tests (e.g. Red blood Cells, Red blood cell distribution width, venous blood gas analysis, lymphocytes, Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, Urea, Proteina C reativa, Creatinine, Potassium, Sodium, etc.), urine (e.g. Esterase, Aspect, Hemoglobin, Ketone Bodies, Density, Protein, Leukocytes, Red blood cells, Granular cylinders, etc.), and tests for the presence of other viruses (e.g. Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza 1, etc. ).

In this study, an efficient feature selection method has been proposed utilizing the feature similarity and node centrality techniques. This mechanism identifies a subset of dissimilar features that have the highest correlation with the target class of diseases.

It can be seen from the recorded data that generally the single variate feature selection approaches (FS and LS) are much faster than the multivariate feature selection approaches (i.e., RRFS, MRMR, FJMI, AHEDL, ABCD, MPSO and proposed method). This is because univariate methods do not consider the possible dependency between features in feature selection, therefore, they are computationally less costly than multivariate approaches. It should be noted that compared to multivariate feature selection approaches, univariate ones are less accurate since they ignore feature dependencies, as demonstrated in Fig. 8 .

Similarly, when \u03b8 is set to a high value, more edges will be removed, and a sparser graph is resulted or the next steps. The \u03b4 value is a threshold for average similarity value that governs the final feature selection process. This parameter can be set to any value in the range [01]. If this parameter is set to a high value, the number of features and the portability risk of selection of similar features will be increased.

Contrary to these previous models, a model based on Ensemble Learning is developed in this study. As a result of the ensemble decision forest model, the prediction accuracy is improved, and also the probability of overfitting is reduced. 4 Irrelevant features, as well as redundant features, strongly affect the performance of learning model and the result of COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore, an intelligent prediction model should recognize and remove irrelevant and redundant features as far as possible. All of the initial features have been used by many previous methods of diagnosing COVID-19. Therefore, the accuracy and generalizability of these methods will be reduced, as well as their computational complexity will be increased. In our proposed model, by incorporating an additional feature selection phase, a new COVID-19 diagnosis model is developed which will enhance the final model's performance. 5 Though decision forest has a high level of prediction performance, its inherent limitations cannot be hidden as well. This can be summarized in two factors. First, because the decision forest generates many trees instead of one, the classification of decision forest is usually inefficient and in real-time prediction systems, this property creates a significant vulnerability. Second, a DF must explore a variety of trees when it makes a classification. Therefore, the end-user cannot clearly justify the model's predictions and they cannot understand the model structure as it is composed of numerous single models. As a result, standard decision forests are usually prone to limitation when a straightforward and real time explanations are required in the health-system application. However, when real time is not an important aspect, such a limitation can be ignored.",

Then, in the second phase, after selecting the final features, in the fourth step, the Decision Forests-based classifier is employed to COVID-19 prediction by employing routine blood tests. In contrast to previous deep learning-based COVID-19 diagnosis models, which are difficult to explain for physicians due to their black box nature, the developed prediction model is transparent through its explainable decision trees. Moreover, by employing an ensemble learning-based prediction model, a new COVID-19 diagnosis model is developed that will improve the final prediction accuracy. The proposed method has been compared to the well-known and newest COVID-19 diagnosis models including XGBoost, SVM, MLP and eXplainable Decision Trees model with respect to four different performance metrics: Classification Accuracy, F1-Score, Sensitivity and Specificity.
