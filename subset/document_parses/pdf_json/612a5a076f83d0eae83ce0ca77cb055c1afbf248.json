Of those that reported changing their fertility preferences, 23.9% reported TTC earlier and 61.6% reported TTC later. Preliminary findings show the odds of changing fertility preferences in black or African American women were 5.45 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-19.90) times that of white women and in nonheterosexual women were 2.76 (95% CI, 1.41-5.42) times that of heterosexual women. Furthermore, every 1 unit increase in state anxiety and depressive symptoms was associated with a 26% (95% CI, 3%-54%) or 17% (95% CI, 5%-31%) increase in odds of pushing back TTC, respectively. Conclusion(s): This exploratory study highlights how the fertility preferences of racial and ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, and those experiencing mental health issues may be disparately influenced by the pandemic. Research is needed to examine further the disparate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility preferences. (Fertil Steril \u00d2 2021;-:---.",

Another study in the United States reported that one-third of their participants wanted to become pregnant later or wanted fewer children because of the pandemic.

Queer women compared with straight women and lower-income women compared with higher-income women also reported similar changes in fertility preference (6) . These findings suggest that the fertility preferences of socially disadvantaged groups, such as racial/ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, and low-income populations, may be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this previous study focused on adult women, regardless of prepandemic pregnancy intentions (6) . Therefore, it is unclear whether the disparate influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility preferences also exists among those who were TTC.",

(6) as key variables that drive the differential effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility preferences in the United States. Then, in a stepwise fashion, we included other variables associated with change in fertility preferences (P< .1) that were identified on the basis of the variable screening process. The traditional choice of significance level for variable selection in a stepwise model is either 0.05 or 0.10 (31, 32) . Given the exploratory nature of this study, we considered the higher significance level for variable selection so that the potential variables relevant to the outcome were not missed and to avoid eliminating variables that may be less significant but carry practical and clinical implications (33) .",

We compared demographic characteristics, financial status/ access to health care, COVID-19-related experiences, and physical, reproductive, and mental health according to whether the participants reported changing or not changing their fertility preferences because of the pandemic. Results of these bivariate analyses can be found in Supplemental Tables 1-3 (available online). We found that the participants who reported changing their fertility preferences were on average older (t \u00bc \u00c02.45, P\u00bc.01) and more likely to be cohabiting or single, divorced, or separated (c 2 \u00bc 7.57, P\u00bc.02). We also found nonheterosexual women, compared with heterosexual women (c 2 \u00bc 6.51, P\u00bc.01), and black or African American women, compared with white or Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women (c 2 \u00bc 11.0, P\u00bc.01) were more likely to change their fertility preferences. Those without health insurance also were more likely to change their fertility preference compared with those with health insurance (P\u00bc.03). The participants who perceived their health status to be good or fairly good were more likely to change their TTC plan than those who perceived their health to be average or poor (c 2 \u00bc 11.68, P\u00bc.01). Women whose family had been quarantined were less likely to change their fertility preferences than those whose family had not been quarantined (c 2 \u00bc 4.21, P\u00bc.04). Lastly, those who had been trying for 1-6 months were more likely to change their fertility preferences than those who had been trying for 6-12 months (c 2 \u00bc 20.94, P< .01).",

Furthermore, across all the models, we consistently found that the odds of changing fertility preferences because of the COVID-19 pandemic in black or African American women were 5.45 (95% CI, 1.50-19.90) times that of white women. Among the subset of participants who reported changing their fertility preferences, we also examined differences in participant characteristics by whether participants sped up or pushed back their TTC plan because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of these bivariate analyses can be found in Supplemental Tables 4-6 (available online). The participants who pushed back their TTC plan were older compared with those who sped up their plan (t \u00bc \u00c02.31, P\u00bc.03). In addition, the participants who pushed back their TTC plan reported significantly worse mental health such as higher state anxiety (t \u00bc \u00c02.21, P\u00bc.03), depressive symptoms (t \u00bc \u00c03.37, P< .01), and lower social support (t \u00bc 2.07, P\u00bc.04) compared with those who sped up their TTC plan. Perceived stress was not associated with pushing back TTC plans (t \u00bc \u00c01.63, P\u00bc.11).

These results also are supported by another similar study and may be because of the various ways the reproductive health of sexual minorities was affected by the pandemic (6) . For example, the ''TTC process'' for queer women often requires involved interactions with multiple parties and institutions (e.g., donors and cryobanks) (41) , during which many report experiencing heterosexist comments and a general lack of support for their ''TTC process'' (42, 43) . These experiences of discrimination make queer-friendly reproductive health providers important (42), but they may have been less accessible during the early stages of the pandemic because of reduced appointment times and closures of some doctor offices and fertility clinics. Therefore, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, queer people already experiencing sociocultural barriers to receiving adequate reproductive care may have been motivated or forced to change their fertility preference.",

Because of the cross-sectional nature of this analysis, we were unable to elucidate whether people with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms due to the pandemic were more likely to push back TTC, or whether having to push back TTC due to the pandemic led to increased symptoms. Although there is evidence of increased prevalence of mental health issues among those receiving fertility treatment (44, 45) , there are very few studies examining these outcomes among the broader population of people TTC (42) , and no literature has explored how changes in fertility preferences may affect mental health. Nevertheless, the reciprocal relationship between reproductive and mental health is well documented (46) . The pandemic has significantly increased the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress in the general population (36) and may have especially exacerbated these symptoms among those TTC because of sudden alterations in plans around fertility preferences. This may especially be true for those receiving fertility treatments as in the early stages of the pandemic (March 2020), the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommended the suspension of initiation of new treatment cycles and minimization of in-person interactions (7) . It should be noted that we conducted post hoc analyses exploring interactions of demographic and mental health variables, but the results were not significant. Our findings support the need to better understand how the pandemic may be influencing mental health outcomes and fertility preferences.",

First, although our study asked whether the pandemic affected the participants' fertility preferences and if so, whether the participants wanted to try to conceive later or earlier because of the pandemic, we did not explicitly ask why the participants were motivated to change their fertility preferences. Future studies examining specific reasons behind changes in fertility preferences could help identify possible social and political issues (e.g., unemployment and access to reproductive care) that are leading to these disparities. In addition, since the participants were recruited via convenience sampling of the ''TTC community,'' the pool of potential participants was more likely to be currently actively TTC. Therefore, our study underrepresents people who stopped TTC before the study initiation or those who are not a part of these online forums. Furthermore, our study population is majority white, well educated, high-income, insured, and employed full-time. Given the skewed nature of our sample population, our findings must be interpreted with caution, and future research with more diverse representative populations is needed to further examine the disparate effect of the pandemic on fertility preferences. It also should be noted that compared with COVID-19 case prevalence in the United States during May 2020 to July 2020, a higher-than-expected number of participants reported experiencing symptoms and quarantine of self or family members because of possible COVID-19 exposure. Therefore, our study participants' COVID-19related health factors are not representative of the US population. In addition, our average scores for anxiety and depressive symptoms were higher than previously documented; it is unclear whether this is due to selection bias in our sample or an overall effect of the COVID-19 pandemic (36) . Lastly, it should be noted that we did not see an increase in perceived stress scores in this sample, unlike anxiety and depression, even though systematic reviews have found significant heightened stress (8.1% prepandemic to 81.9% during the pandemic) in various international studies (36) . We are unsure why we saw an increase in anxiety and depression, but not stress, in this sample. We speculate that it may have been influenced by the nature of the PSS, which focuses on one's ability to handle/control problems and important things in life, and the relatively high socioeconomic status of our sample.",
