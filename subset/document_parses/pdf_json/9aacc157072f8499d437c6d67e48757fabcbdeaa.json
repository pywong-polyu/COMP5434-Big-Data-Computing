The genotyping primer pairs for Tg(Tek-cre)1Ywa/J mice are forward primer 5'-CGCATAACCAGTGAAACAGCATTGC-3' and reverse primer 5'-CCCTGTGCTCAGACAGAAATGAGA-3'. Mice with endothelium-specific knockout of STAT3 were created by breeding transgenic mice STAT3 flox/flox (Stat3 tm1Xyfu /J) with Tg(Tek-cre)1Ywa/J mice. C57BL/6 wildtype mice (Charles River, Catalog No. 027) were purchased and bred. Eight-to ten-week-old pathogenfree male and female mice housed in temperature-controlled room with alternating 12-hour light/dark cycles and fed a standard diet were used for vascular permeability experiments. To assess vascular permeability, Evans Blue (100 \u00b5l; 1% in PBS; VWR) was systemically injected in the lateral tail vein of mice. After 15 minutes, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (90-120 mg/kg)/xylazine (5-10 mg/kg) via IP injection, and 20 \u00b5l of PBS and VEGF solution (2.5 \u00b5g/ml in PBS; MNPHARM) were injected each in one anterior and one posterior footpad. After 30 minutes, the mice were euthanized and the footpads were excised. Evans Blue was extracted by incubation in formamide at 63\u00b0C overnight and quantified by spectroscopic detection at 620 nm using a Synergy Neo2 instument (BioTek).

Subsequently, VEGF-inducible; STAT3 +/zebrafish were incrossed and the 1-cell stage embryos were microinjected with 1.5 nl of Cre mRNA (12.5 ng/\u00b5l). Zebrafish expressing the VEGF-inducible transgene were identified by the presence eGFP in their eyes using fluorescent imaging. At 2 days post-fertilization, 37\u00b0C heat shock of eGFP+ eyed zebrafish carrying the VEGF transgene was performed to confirm VEGF transgene activity via the absence of mCherry fluorescence. At 3 days post-fertilization, zebrafish were anesthetized and fluorescent microangiography was performed. A glass microneedle was inserted through the pericardium directly into the ventricle, and a mixture of 2000 kDa FITC-dextran and 70 kDa Texas Red-dextran (2 mg/ml in embryo water; Life Technologies, Inc.) was injected. Immediately prior to imaging, 37\u00b0C heat shock induction of the VEGF transgene was performed for 10 minutes. The visualization and real-time imaging were performed using the previously described SCORE methodology 31 on a Zeiss Apotome 2 microscope. Following imaging, each individual zebrafish was euthanized and genomic DNA was extracted using standard techniques for subsequent STAT3 genotyping using the following pair of primers: 5'-GGTCTTCCACAACCTGCTG-3' and 5'-TAGACGCTGCTCTTCCCAC-3'. Zebrafish were maintained in 28.5\u00b0C water in accordance with guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Minnesota. ImageJ software was used to quantitate the extent of Texas Reddextran in the extravascular space. Mean gray value was measured after converting the image type to 8-bit gray, setting scale to pixels, inverting the image and identifying 4 areas of extravascular space in the middle of the zebrafish trunk region using drawing/selection tools to avoid intersegmental vessels evident by green fluorescent signal originating from FITC-dextran. The background gray value minus the average gray value of the four regions is used for statistical analysis.",

Single colonies were inoculated into 2 ml antibiotic LB broth containing 50 \u00b5g/ml Kanamycin, 7 \u00b5g/ml Gentamycin, and 10 \u00b5g/ml Tetracycline and grown at 37\u00b0C overnight. After isolating recombinant Bacmid DNA, we transfected Sf9 insect cells, grew cells in Gibco\u2122 Sf-900\u2122 II SFM medium (Gibco, Catalog NO.10902088) in a 27\u00b0C incubator, harvested P0 baculovirus stock, and amplified P1 and P2 baculovirus in a 27\u00b0C, 90 rpm shaker. Sf9 cells were infected with P2 baculovirus (MOI=10) and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes after incubation for 3 days. The pellet was resuspended in binding buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1mM Tris (2-Carboxyethyl) Phosphine (T-CEP), 10 mM Imidazole] supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche) and then lysed by 7 cycles of sonication (Fisher Scientific; Sonic Dismembrator, Model 100) each consisting of constant pulse for 15s on ice. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was bound to high performance HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) using binding buffer [Sodium phosphate 20 mM, NaCl 500 mM, Imidazole 20 mM and T-CEP 0.5 mM] and eluted with an imidazole gradient (0 to 500 mM). The protein was then concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 size exclusion column equilibrated in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM T-CEP. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.",

We stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with VEGF, collected lysates, and performed immunoblotting. We observed activation of VEGFR-2 and STAT3 following 2 and 5 minutes of VEGF stimulation as evident by increased phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 Y1175 and STAT3 Y705 (Figure 1A) , which coincides with prior reports 23 . VEGF stimulation promotes physical interaction of VEGFR-2 and STAT3, as evident by immunoprecipitation studies demonstrating an association of total VEGFR-2 and total STAT3 ( Figure 1B) as well as VEGF-dependent interactions between the phosphorylated forms of VEGFR-2 and STAT3 ( Figure 1C) . To further study the interaction between VEGFR-2 and STAT3, we performed a GST pull-down experiment using GST-tagged STAT3 protein purified from 293F cells as a \"bait\" protein and growth factor (i.e. FBS) stimulated HUVEC lysate as a source of \"prey\" proteins. We observed a growth factor-dependent interaction between endothelial cell-derived VEGFR-2 and GST-tagged STAT3 proteins ( Figure 1D) . Immunofluorescence studies suggest that STAT3 translocates to the nucleus upon VEGF/VEGFR-2-mediated activation in HUVEC ( Figure 1E) . Quantification of nuclear STAT3 intensity showed a substantial increase upon VEGF treatment ( Figure 1F) . Collectively, our results suggest VEGF stimulates VEGFR-2 to induce STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear localization in human endothelial cells.

Specifically, we generated STAT3 knockout zebrafish with an inducible VEGF transgene by crossing iVEGF zebrafish 28 to CRISPR/Cas9-generated STAT3 genomic knockout (STAT3 KO ) zebrafish (Figure 2A) . Importantly, we did not observe any vascular development defects in STAT3 KO larval zebrafish, and the vascular system of STAT3 KO zebrafish at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) is indistinguishable from wildtype STAT3 +/+ siblings ( Figure 2B) . To assess vascular permeability, VEGF was heat-induced in STAT3 KO ; iVEGF zebrafish following ventricular co-injection of 70 KDa Texas Red-dextran as a permeabilizing tracer and 2000 KDa FITC-dextran as a marker of the veins. Zebrafish were immediately live imaged using time-lapse structured illumination fluorescence microscopy to measure vascular permeability, evident by leakage of Texas Red-dextran into the extravascular space 28 . Using these techniques, our data showed decreased VEGF-induced vascular permeability in STAT3 KO zebrafish relative to corresponding wildtype controls (Figure 2C-D) , suggesting that VEGF signals through STAT3 to promote vascular permeability.

Pyrimethamine (PYR) 42 and Atovaquone (AQ; Mepron\u00ae) 43 are FDA-approved antimicrobial agents that were recently discovered as new STAT3 inhibitors. AQ rapidly and specifically downregulates cell-surface expression of glycoprotein 130, which is required for STAT3 activation in multiple contexts. PYR was identified as a STAT3 inhibitor through a chemical biology approach. These compounds have been shown to be safe in humans because they inhibit STAT3 at concentrations routinely achieved in human plasma [42] [43] [44] . To our knowledge, PYR and AQ have yet to be specifically assessed in endothelium as prior studies have primarily evaluated their STAT3 inhibitory effects on tumor cells of epithelial origin. Therefore, we first treated HUVEC with various concentrations of PYR or AQ for different durations of time to determine the optimal conditions, while not exceeding the concentrations typically achieved in human plasma (Supplemental Figure 1) . In serum-starved HUVEC treated with 10 \u00b5M PYR for 1 hour or 30 \u00b5M AQ for 4 hours followed by VEGF stimulation, we observed decreased phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705 (Figure 4A-B) . We confirmed activation of VEGF signaling by assessing the phosphorylation status and total protein levels of VEGFR-2 and JAK family members (Figure 4A-B) . Given that VEGFR-2, JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 are upstream of STAT3, PYR-and AQ-mediated STAT3 inhibition does not affect activation of these proteins. Taken together, these immunoblotting results suggest PYR and AQ inhibit VEGF-induced STAT3 activation in human endothelial cells.",

We confirm by immunofluorescence that VEGF induces zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) disorganization, indicative of tight junction instability ( Figure 4C ). VEGF stimulation of HUVEC results in STAT3 activation as evident by increased phosphorylation of STAT3 Y705 (Figure 4C-D) . STAT3 pharmacological inhibition via PYR or AQ restores ZO-1 organization, suggesting that VEGF may mediate vascular permeability through STAT3-regulated control of ZO-1 (Fig. 4C-D) .

Collective prior work supports the notion that the identity of the VEGF signaling-dependent kinase that activates STAT3 is cell type specific [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , but precise details remain poorly understood.

Molecular regulation of vascular barrier integrity can vary greatly based on various pathophysiological contexts and differences in cell types, tissues, anatomical locations, and species 28, 49 . To overcome these obstacles, we took advantage of a transgenic VEGF-inducible zebrafish model that is amenable to genetic manipulation and reproducible live imaging of vascular permeability in optically clear zebrafish embryos using fluorescently labeled tracers 28, 29 . Additionally, the widespread recent emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing techniques have enhanced the study genetic regulators of endothelial barrier function in genetically engineered zebrafish mutants.

For example, an in vitro study using human endothelial cells recently demonstrated that IL-6 promotes sustained loss of endothelial barrier function via STAT3 signaling 55 , and IL-6-induced STAT3 activation has been shown to induce vascular permeability in ovarian endothelial cells 60 . Furthermore, IL-6-induced retinal endothelial permeability was found to be dependent upon STAT3 activation in mouse retina by measuring leakage of Evans blue dye following IL-6 stimulation in the presence and absence of an inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation 61 . Dominant negative STAT3 has been shown to reduce IL-6-induced vascular permeability associated with malignant pleural effusion in lung adenocarcinoma 25 as well as decrease IgG-mediated vascular permeability in a mouse acute lung injury model 59 . Patients and mice harboring STAT3 mutations, which cause autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), have been shown to be partially protected from anaphylaxis. Based on this finding, Hox and colleagues have shown that HUVEC derived from patients with AD-HIES or treated with a STAT3 inhibitor exhibit decreased histamine-and IgG-E-mediated leakage 56 . Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation decreases LPS-induced myocardial vascular permeability in a murine model 58 . A chemokine called eotaxin (i.e. CCL11) increases STAT3 phosphorylation and promotes vascular permeability in human coronary artery endothelial cells 57 . Taken together with the important role of STAT3 in modulating VEGF-mediated vascular permeability in vertebrate models presented here, studies collectively suggest STAT3 is a central regulator of vascular barrier integrity.",

In addition to the important role of STAT3 in the pathogenesis of vascular disease, ischemia, and other tissue injuries, STAT3 is aberrantly overexpressed in many human tumor types and correlates with poor cancer prognoses. Development of STAT3 peptide inhibitors stemmed from elucidating the crystal structure of the STAT3\u03b2 homodimer and were designed to target the p-Y-peptide binding pocket within the STAT3 SH2 domain. However, the clinical applicability of these STAT3 peptide inhibitors has been hindered by their lack of stability and inability to cross membranes. Non-peptidic small molecule inhibitors of STAT3 exhibited promising in vivo activity in preclinical studies, but most of these STAT3 inhibitors failed to progress to clinical trials because they required medium-to-high micromolar concentrations to achieve sufficient activity and necessitated additional optimization in order to be systemically administered to human subjects. While developing and translating STAT3 inhibitors to the clinic has proven difficult because STAT3 is a transcription factor without intrinsic enzymatic activity 62 , several compounds that inhibit either the function or expression of STAT3 are currently in clinical trials 63 , including a double-stranded decoy oligonucleotide that competitively inhibits STAT3 interactions with its target gene promoter elements 64 and an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of STAT3 expression, AZD9150 65 .",

This anti-microbial drug was discovered as a new STAT3 inhibitor through a chemical library screen based on its ability to oppose the gene expression signature of STAT3 42, 44 . PYR inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity at micromolar concentrations known to be routinely achieved in humans without toxicity 42 . In the current study, PYR suppresses STAT3 activation in endothelial cells as we observe decreased phosphorylation of STAT3 Y705 by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. PYR treatment prevents VEGF-induced ZO-1 disorganization, which suggests that STAT3 inhibition improves tight junction instability in endothelium. We demonstrate that PYR administered to wildtype C57BL/6 mice substantially reduces VEGF-induced vascular permeability. Atovaquone (AQ; Mepron\u00ae), an FDA-approved anti-microbial agent with a strong human safety profile, has been shown to rapidly and specifically downregulate cell-surface expression of glycoprotein 130, which is required for STAT3 activation in multiple contexts 43 . Like PYR, we show that AQ stabilizes endothelial tight junctions in the presence of VEGF stimulation. Unlike PYR and AQ, C188-9 is a STAT3 inhibitor that targets the pY-peptide binding site within the STAT3 SH2 domain. C188-9 has been shown to inhibit G-CSF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation with low micromolar potency in AML cell lines 66 and subsequently has been well-established as an effective STAT3specific inhibitor by various studies in models of cancer 46, 67 and other diseases 68, 69 . Here, we show that C188-9 inhibits VEGF-induced vascular permeability through in mouse models and cultured human endothelial cells. Our collective studies using three different STAT3 inhibitors suggest that suppression of STAT3 activity protects the endothelial barrier from VEGF-mediated vascular permeability. Future studies testing compounds that inhibit STAT3, particularly PYR and AQ given their clinical accessibility, in models of human diseases involving pathological vascular permeability are warranted.",
