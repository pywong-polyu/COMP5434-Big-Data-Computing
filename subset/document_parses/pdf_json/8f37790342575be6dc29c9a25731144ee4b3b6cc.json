Younger patients (\u2264 50 years) tended to have more GGOs, while older patients (> 50 years) had more consolidations with organizing pneumonia pattern. Michael et al. [9] published a case series of 21 patients. In that study, GGO was also the most frequent manifestation (57%) and most of the patients (76%) had a bilateral disease. Interestingly, 33% had a round GGO and/or consolidation for their initial manifestation. General radiological features of COVID-19 are quite similar to those of SARS. It is not surprising given the fact that SARS is also caused by a strain of coronavirus, which has genetic similarity with COVID-19.",

In patients with SARS, lung lesions detected in the first week from the symptom onset aggravated in the second week [10] . Then, the lesions changed into irregular reticular opacities mixed with GGOs at the fourth week. Similarly, Pan et al. [11] described that 85.7% (54/63) of their cohort with COVID-19 pneumonia showed disease progression (i.e., increased extent of GGO and consolidation) at early follow-up CT scans (interval, 3-14 days). Lung fiber cord was found in a patient with improvement as the inflammation was absorbed [12] . The long-term sequelae in patients with severe pneumonia, although not available for the present, could be the fibrotic changes such as reticulation, interlobular septal thickening, and traction bronchiectasis, which are usually seen in the fibrotic phase of lung injury.",

            "text": "There are several roles of radiologists in this outbreak. First, early detection of the radiological abnormality can provide a suspicion of pneumonia in patients at risk. Although, the definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, radiological findings are important for the diagnosis of pneumonia. Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia would enable rapid management planning including further imaging follow-ups and conservative care. Given the fact that the most frequent imaging finding is GGO, careful interpretation of the chest radiographs is needed as GGOs may look very faint. CT scans are recommended in patients with suspicious lung abnormality. Second, disease severity can be suggested and notified to the clinicians. Michael et al. [9] reported that one COVID-19-infected patient with the highest severity score (lung involvement score) on the CT scan was admitted to the intensive care unit. In addition, a high rate (19.6%) of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was observed from the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [5] . Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of ARDS. Third, radiologists can give a suspicion of bacterial secondary infection. Notably, bacterial co-infection was common (12%-19%) among hospitalized patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza and confirmed pneumonia [14] . Bacterial co-infection was associated with serious outcomes [14] . Therefore, it is our role to provide an impression of secondary infection, which would necessitate antibiotic treatment. Fourth, radiologists should make an effort to educate trainees and clinicians of the imaging findings of emerging infectious diseases including COVID-19. This is the third outbreak caused by the coronavirus in the recent decades. Radiologists and clinicians should be prepared for unexpected infectious diseases to fight epidemic and potential pandemic.",
