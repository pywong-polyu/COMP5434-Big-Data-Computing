            "text": "Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed papain-like protease 2 (PLP2). PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein and as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin (Ub) moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2/DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly to the wild-type (WT) virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to that of the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (P \u03fd 0.05) in viral titer in liver and spleen at day 5 postinfection (d p.i.), although both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of the PLP2-ubiquitin complex and that PLP2/DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (deconjugating ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced replication in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses. FIG 1 X-ray structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex and residues involved in ubiquitin binding. (A) Overall structure of MHV PLP2-C1716S-Ub complex. Domains are color coded as follows: yellow, Ub; purple, Ubl2 domain of PLP2; orange, thumb domain; cyan, palm domain; green, fingers domain. Residue D1772 of PLP2 is located outside the active site, which is circled in black. (B) Hydrogen bond interactions between MHV PLP2 R1803 and the backbone of A46 of ubiquitin. (C) Binding interactions between MHV PLP2 D1772 and two arginine residues (R42 and R72) of ubiquitin. (D) Hydrophobic interactions between F1812 of MHV PLP2 and ubiquitin residues I44 and V70. The 2Fo-Fc maps (blue) surrounding the residues are contoured at 1 in each panel. The PDB coordinates for the MHV PLP2-C1716S-Ub complex are available under PDB code 5WFI.

            "text": "C oronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the order Nidovirales, which includes enveloped viruses with large (\u03f330-kb), positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes that yield a characteristic nested set of subgenomic mRNAs during replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells (1, 2) . The genome organization for coronaviruses is highly conserved, with the 5=-most two-thirds of the genome encoding the replicase polyprotein, followed by sequences encoding the canonical structural proteins, i.e., spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. Many CoVs contain accessory genes, which are interspersed among the genes for the structural proteins. Although these accessory genes are not necessarily required for virus replication and are, in general, not highly conserved within the virus family, many encode proteins that regulate the host response (3) . Interestingly, coronavirus replicase proteins, which are highly conserved, can also act as antagonists to block or delay the host innate immune response to infection (1, (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . That a slew of coronavirus-encoded accessory and nonaccessory proteins have been shown to shape the host antiviral response suggests that virally mediated subversion of host defenses is an important element of infection. Here, we focus on the viral protease/deubiquitinase (DUB) with the goal of assessing the role of DUB activity in shaping the pathogenesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model murine coronavirus.",

We and others have revealed that PLP2 or PLpro of multiple coronaviruses, including MHV, is multifunctional, not only capable of cleaving the viral polyprotein but also possessing deubiquitinase (DUB) and deISGylating (deconjugating interferon-stimulated gene 15 [ISG15] molecule from modified substrates) activities (9, 12, 13, (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . However, it has been challenging to study the effects of a mutated DUB on virus replication and pathogenesis because the protease and DUB activities share the same catalytic site, disruption of which is lethal for virus replication. Therefore, it was necessary for us to identify residue(s) within the MHV protease/DUB-ubiquitin (Ub) binding surface that can be mutated to result in reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing. In this report, we describe the X-ray structure-guided identification of such residues and evaluate the replication, interferon (IFN) antagonistic effect, and pathogenesis of a recombinant DUB mutant MHV.",

To investigate the role of viral deubiquitinating activity in coronavirus replication and pathogenesis, we first needed to identify amino acid residues that, when mutated, result in reduced DUB activity while preserving the enzyme's deISGylating and protease activities, the latter being necessary for viral replication. X-ray structural studies of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV papain-like protease/DUBs cocrystalized with ubiquitin modified at the C terminus with a covalent warhead (aldehyde, 3-bromo-propylamine, or propargylamine) allowed for identification of residues that are important for direct interaction with ubiquitin (17, 18, 20) . Here, we took a slightly different approach and mutated the catalytic cysteine (C1716) of MHV PLP2 to a serine residue and cocrystalized it with free ubiquitin. The X-ray structure of MHV PLP2 (C1716S) in complex with ubiquitin (PDB code 5WFI) was determined to a resolution of 1.85 \u00c5 and an overall R free of 19.6% and R work of 15.8%. The overall structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex is similar to other PLP2/PLpro ubiquitin-bound structures (Fig. 1A) . Ubiquitin binds within the palm region and is gripped by the zinc finger motif, while the C terminus extends into the active site.",

From this analysis, we identified three residues (R1803, D1772, and F1812) in MHV PLP2 that form direct interactions with ubiquitin ( Fig. 1B to D) . Two of the side-chain guanidinium nitrogens of R1803 form direct hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of A46 in ubiquitin (Fig. 1B) . The two side-chain carboxylate oxygens of D1772 in MHV PLP2 interact with ubiquitin by forming direct bonds with each of the guanidinium nitrogens of R42 and with one of the guanidinium nitrogens of R72 (Fig. 1C) .

To identify a mutant MHV PLP2 enzyme that retains protease activity but exhibits reduced DUB and/or deISGylating activity, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on each of the residues (R1803, D1772, and F1812) by changing each to an alanine to disrupt interactions with ubiquitin. Each mutant enzyme was expressed, purified, and tested for its ability to hydrolyze three substrates: Z-RLRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC, and ISG15-AMC. The activity of each mutant enzyme toward each substrate relative to that of the wild-type (WT) enzyme is shown in Fig. 2A . All three mutants retained their ability to hydrolyze the peptide substrate, but each mutant had altered specificity toward Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC substrates. Mutation of F1812 resulted in a substantial decrease in hydrolysis of both Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC (class I), whereas mutation of R1803 resulted in loss of activity only toward ISG15-AMC (class II), and mutation of D1772 resulted in loss of activity only toward Ub-AMC (class III).",

            "text": "The kinetic response of MHV PLP2 toward another substrate, ISG15-AMC, was also determined. ISG15 is an important ubiquitin-like modifier that is upregulated and used to ISGylate host proteins during viral infection. A number of viruses, including coronaviruses, engender ISGylation during infection, but the function(s) and importance of this activity are not clear (28) (29) (30) . For MHV, neither the wild-type nor the D1772A mutant PLP2 enzyme can be saturated with ISG15-AMC, suggesting weak binding with this ubiquitin-like modifier (Fig. 2B) . Moreover, the R1772A mutation does not disrupt the interaction with ISG15 but in fact enhances it to some degree. A potential explanation for the observed selective disruption of ubiquitin binding stems from our analysis of a primary sequence alignment of ubiquitin and ISG15 and the residues that interact with D1772 (Fig. 2C) . The interaction between MHV PLP2 D1772 and the R42 residue in human and mouse ubiquitin is absent in human and mouse ISG15 since this residue is a tryptophan in human and mouse ISG15. Therefore, in line with our observations, D1772A mutation would not be expected to alter ISG15 binding. In contrast to R42, residue R72 is conserved in both ubiquitin and ISG15, and its interaction with MHV PLP2 for ubiquitin is likely weaker than that with ISG15. PLP2 D1772A mutant exhibits reduced DUB activity and inhibition of IFN response in cell culture-based assays. The in vitro biochemical studies presented here support the notion that we are able to use a structure-guided mutagenesis to uncouple the DUB enzymatic activity from MHV PLP2 while preserving the peptide hydrolysis and deISGylating activities of PLP2. Next, we focused on comparing the activity of the mutant enzyme to its wild-type counterpart for the ability to remove Flag-taggedubiquitin conjugated to host proteins in cultured cells (Fig. 3A) . We found that in cells, wild-type PLP2 exhibits robust DUB activity and removes ubiquitin modifications from multiple cellular proteins. On the other hand, the PLP2-D1772A mutant exhibits re- duced DUB activity, similar to that of the previously documented catalytic cysteine to alanine mutant, PLP2-CA (19) . To determine if this impaired DUB activity altered the ability of PLP2 to act as an interferon antagonist, we transfected cells with a RIG-I expression plasmid, an interferon-luciferase (Luc) reporter construct, and either wildtype or mutant PLP2 plasmid and measured luciferase activity at 18 h posttransfection. In agreement with previous reports (13, 25, 31) , we find that wild-type PLP2 acts as an interferon antagonist, reducing reporter activity by 50 to 80%. In contrast, PLP2-D1772A is unable to significantly reduce interferon activation in this assay despite similar expression levels of the wild-type and mutant versions of the protein (Fig. 3B ). We also evaluated the protease activity of the enzymes in cells using two independent transcleavage assays and found that the wild-type and DUB-mutant enzymes produce similar levels of cleaved products. These results indicate that the D1772A substitution did not alter protease activity ( Fig. 3C and D), in agreement with the in vitro kinetic results described above (Fig. 2) . Together, these studies reveal that aspartic acid residue 1772 of MHV-PLP2 is important for DUB activity and interferon antagonism, but not for protease activity.",

We engineered the mutant virus via reverse genetics (32), performed full-genome sequencing to verify the genotype (2 nucleotide changes at positions 5525 and 5526, resulting in D1772A substitution in the replicase polyprotein), and designated the virus DUBmut. Upon evaluating virus replication of the DUBmut virus by performing a growth kinetics experiment in parallel with wild-type virus, we found that the DUBmut virus replicates with essentially identical kinetics to those of the wild-type in a murine astrocytoma cell line (DBT cells) (Fig. 4A) . These results are consistent with previous studies of coronavirus interferon antagonists, which showed in many cell lines that virally mediated interferon antagonism is not essential for virus replication (5, 6) . Regarding the other ubiquitin-interacting residues identified in the structural analysis, we attempted to rescue virus with substitutions at the F1812 position, but we were unable to recover viable virus. These results indicate that F1812 may play a critical role within the polyprotein during virus replication. We were able to recover virus containing the R1803A substitution but found that it had no detectable phenotype, which we documented in our previous study (5) .

To test this, we first used an intracranial infection model to evaluate pathogenesis in WT and DUBmutinfected mice. We found that intracranial infection of mice with either virus resulted in similar weight loss and 100% lethality (data not shown), suggesting that the loss of DUB activity does not affect the neuropathogenesis of MHV. To investigate the pathogenesis in the liver, we inoculated 4-(young) or 6-week-old (adult) mice intraperitoneally with a low dose (6 \u03eb 10 3 PFU) or a high dose (6 \u03eb 10 4 PFU) of the designated virus, respectively, and measured viral titer in the liver and spleen at the indicated days postinfection (d p.i.). We observed similar levels of infectious particles in young mice inoculated with a high dose of virus and adult mice with a low dose at 3 and 5 d p.i.

Although we only observed a subtle attenuation of the DUBmut virus in the tested animal models, we demonstrated that PLP2 DUB activity does play a role in suppressing the host immune response and is a virulence trait, strengthening our earlier discoveries on SARS-CoV PLpro (4).

Activity against the Z-RLRGG-AMC peptide substrate represents the polyprotein processing activity of MHV PLP2, while Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC stimulate the deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of the enzyme, respectively (17, 35) . The kinetic data for D1772A DUBmut hydrolysis of the z-RLRGG-peptide provided in Fig.  2B indicate that the polyprotein processing ability of this mutant is likely not affected by the D1772A substitution. The deISGylating ability of the enzyme is also not affected. In contrast, the mutant enzyme's deubiquitinating activity is significantly reduced relative to that of the wild type, which is most likely due to a lowered binding affinity for ubiquitin, as the enzyme could not be saturated with Ub-AMC as a substrate.",

By aligning the X-ray structure of the PLpro domains of SARS-CoV bound to ubiquitin (17) with the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (Fig. 6A ) and comparing the differences in their residues with those of MHV PLP2 (Fig. 1E) , we observed significant differences in the potential interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ubiquitin. For example, we found that the hydrogen bonds between MHV PLP2 R1803 and the carbonyl oxygen of UbA46 (Fig. 1B) are lost in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 6B) . In contrast, the hydrogen bonds between MHV PLP2 D1772 and Ub residues R42 and R72 (Fig. 1C ) are likely preserved with the substitution of E1772 in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV PLpro (Fig. 6C) . The hydrophobic interactions between Ub residues I44 and V70 and F1812 of MHV PLP2 (Fig. 1D ) also appear to be preserved with M1812 of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV PLpro (Fig. 6D) . The X-ray structures of MHV PLP2 and SARS-CoV PLpro, together with our structural model of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, will provide testable hypotheses for the design and mutagenesis of the ubiquitin-binding domain (17) and diubiquitin-binding domains (20) of the recently emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 PLpro.",

            "text": "We were able to reproduce the enzymatic profile of the purified PLP2-D1772A mutant protein when we expressed it in cell culture (Fig. 3) . Therefore, our finding that the DUBmut virus containing the PLP2-D1772A substitution activates an elevated antiviral response in macrophages compared to that of the wild-type virus, but that this antiviral state results in only mild attenuation of disease in mice relative to WT infection, was unexpected. Previous studies demonstrated that ubiquitin has important roles in both the activation and the attenuation of innate antiviral pathways (40) ; therefore, we anticipated a more remarkable phenotype for a DUB mutant virus. We can imagine several possible explanations for our findings. First, it is possible that viral DUB activity has a relatively minor role in shaping pathogenesis in this system. In fact, our recent studies using SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs found that the papain-like protease domain/DUB is a virulence trait that varies among members of the SARS-coronavirus species (4) . In that study, we found that replacing the SARS PLP2/DUB domain with a SARS-related PLP2/DUB domain reduced the ability of that virus to antagonize the innate immune response. This previous report, in conjunction with the current study, supports the concept that different PLP2/DUB domains may have distinct effects on antagonism of the innate immune response, depending on the virus and the host cell type. Another possibility is that the DUB mutant virus we generated may not have been sufficiently debilitated in its DUB activity to result in altered pathogenesis. We found that it was difficult to recover viable DUB mutant viruses; indeed, this D1772A mutant was the sole viable DUB mutant representative of our many attempts. Because an elevated interferon response was elicited from the DUBmut-infected cells, this mutant virus fulfilled our criteria for demonstrating the inactivation of an interferon antagonist. However, we speculate that if we are able to recover mutants that exhibit a range of DUB activities, we may be able to more fully assess the role of DUB activity as a contributor to coronaviral pathogenesis. In addition, the viral DUB activity may be important in specific cell types, such as epithelial cells that are infected by respiratory and enteric-tropic CoVs. Despite these caveats, the MHV DUB mutant generated in this study did exhibit a reproducible phenotype of eliciting an elevated interferon response in infected macrophages that was associated with mild attenuation of pathogenesis, with reduced titers in the livers and spleens of infected mice. Overall, we conclude that DUB activity is indeed a virulence trait and contributes to the ability of MHV to modulate the host innate immune response to infection. Further studies are needed to identify the targets of viral DUB activity and the detailed role of DUB activity in delaying the innate immune response to virus replication.",

Viral genomic RNA from in vitro transcription of ligated cDNA fragments using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 transcription kit (catalog no. AM1344; Thermo Fisher) was electroporated into BHK-R cells. Cell supernatants were collected as viral stock following observation of cytopathic effects. Rescued virus was plaque purified, propagated on BHK-R cells, and titer was determined on 17Cl-1 cells. The stock virus was subjected to full-genome sequencing and the sequences were aligned to the parental strain, with the intended engineered mutation detected and no additional mutations detected (Kansas State University Diagnostic Laboratory).",

At the indicated time points, monolayer cells were collected for RNA extraction and cell culture supernatants were harvested for ELISA analysis. To determine IFN-\u242311, \u2424-actin, or MHV-A59 N gene mRNA levels, total RNA was extracted from collected cells using an RNeasy minikit (catalog no. 74104; Qiagen). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from an equal amount of RNA using an RT 2 HT First Strand kit (catalog no. 330401; Qiagen). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was then performed with specific primers for mouse IFN-\u242311 (catalog no. PPM03050B-200; Qiagen), mouse \u2424-actin (catalog no. PPM02945B-200; Qiagen), or the MHV-A59 N gene using RT 2 SYBR green qPCR mastermix (catalog no. 330502; Qiagen) in the Bio-Rad CFX96 system. The thermocycler was set as follows: one step at 95\u00b0C (10 min), 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C (15 s), 60\u00b0C (1 min) and plate read, one step at 95\u00b0C (10 s), and a melt curve from 65\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C in increments of 0.5\u00b0C/0.05 s. Samples were evaluated in triplicate, and data are representative of three independent experiments. The levels of mRNA were reported relative to those of \u2424-actin mRNA and expressed as 2 \u03ea\u0394CT [\u0394C T \u03ed C T (gene of interest) \u03ea C T(\u2424-actin) ], where C T is the threshold cycle.
