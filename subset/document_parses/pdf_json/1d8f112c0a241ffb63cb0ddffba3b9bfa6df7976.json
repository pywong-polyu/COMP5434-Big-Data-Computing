We assessed SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia (RNAemia) and the association between RNAemia and inflammation, organ failure and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We included all patients with PCR verified COVID-19 and consent admitted to ICU. SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies above 1000/ml measured by PCR in plasma was defined as RNAemia and used as surrogate for viremia. In this cohort of 92 patients 59 (64%) were invasively ventilated. RNAemia was found in 31 patients (34%). Hypertension and corticosteroid treatment was more common in patients with RNAemia. Extra-pulmonary organ failure biomarkers and the extent of organ failure were similar in patients with and without RNAemia, but the former group had more renal replacement therapy and higher mortality (26 vs 16%; 35 vs 16%, respectively, p = 0.04). RNAemia was not an independent predictor of death at 30 days after adjustment for age. SARS-CoV2 RNA copies in plasma is a common finding in ICU patients with COVID-19. Although viremia was not associated with extra pulmonary organ failure it was more common in patients who did not survive to 30 days after ICU admission.

As the number of observations were limited, we used age as a surrogate for the pre COVID-19 risk of death. Therefore, we also assessed if the RNA copies after adjusting for age was an independent predictor of these outcomes. We performed a sensitivity analysis defining RNAemia as RNA copies above the Limit of detection (> 300 RNA copies/mL plasma) when relevant.

In this cohort of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure requiring intensive care almost one third of the patients had RNAemia and almost two thirds had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their plasma. Although the level of RNA copies in plasma decreased during the first week of ICU care, RNAemia was still common up to seven days after ICU admission. Higher levels of RNA copies were found in patients with hypertension, and corticosteroid treatment. Despite substantial multiple organ failure, as suggested by SOFA score, the level of RNA copies in plasma was not associated with organ failure outside the respiratory system assessed by the patient's biochemistry other than higher IL-6 levels in plasma. Although RRT was more common in patients with RNAemia this was not linked to AKI. The RNAemia did not predict level of organ support in this cohort. However, mortality was higher in patients with RNAemia. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Relation to other studies. RNAemia in COVID-19 patients seen in this cohort and its relation to illness severity has been reported previously. In a small study on 10 severe COVID-19 patients it was reported that 7 of 10 had viremia 9 . Moreover some data indicate, similar to our findings, that viremia can be persistent and be present several weeks after the onset of illness 17 . There was no association between illness severity and the level of RNAemia in our study. This is in line with another study with 41 patients, where although the ratio of patients with viremia was low, it was similar in noncritically and critically ill patients 8 . Yet, in the largest of the previous studies viremia was strongly associated with the admission to intensive or intermediate care 11, 18 . Viremia per se may be a marker of severe disease as studies of hospitalized patients report lower ratios of viremic patients 7 than studies with critically ill patients 10 . One possible explanation could be that in critically ill COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, viremia does not Table 3 .

Extra-pulmonary organ failure was present since SOFA score indicates multiple organ failure in the majority of the patients. Intuitively viremia could be proposed as a mechanism of distant organ damage. However, neither the presence, nor the extent of RNAemia was linked to organ failure outside the respiratory system. Although RRT was more common in patients with RNAemia a similar effect of RNAemia was not seen for AKI. In contrast to our findings a recent publication reports strong relationship between respiratory failure, cardiac injury, renal damage and RNAemia 22 . Yet as with studies reporting an association between RNAemia and the illness severity, one could speculate that when a certain level of illness is induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, derangement of biochemistry and the development of organ damage may be mediated by already triggered inflammatory systems rather than virus replication per se. However, this does not preclude that RNAemia is a marker of local virus load, especially in the lungs.",

Although one would assume that presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma indicates presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the PCR method only detects a fragment of the RNA, thus not differentiating between live virus and RNA fragments from non-infective virions. Ideally the presence of live virus would be confirmed by virus culturing, but that was not within the scope of this study. We also conclude that RNAemia was not linked to organ failure indicating other mechanisms than viral replication, but we cannot entirely exclude that some of the organ failure is triggered by direct viral spread through the blood stream. Finally, although the number of patients in this study is relatively large for ICU COVID-19 cohorts, the study is underpowered to exclude other than major effects in variables that were measured with high precision. For example, the possible association between RNAemia and renal replacement therapy will need to be investigated in larger cohorts of patients.",

The most solid finding of this study is that in spite of the abundant RNAemia seen in this ICU cohort the effect of RNAemia was not associated to organ failure and the association to death was weak. Previous studies indicate that RNAemia in non-ICU patients can predict illness severity and outcome, but our results do not support the possibility of such a prediction among ICU patients. Moreover, our findings could indicate that blood of patients with severe COVID-19 potentially has considerable virus load and should be handled accordingly. Furthermore, RNAemia in this study may indicate the presence of live SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients up to a week after ICU presentation. This may be considered when starting therapies with potential immunosuppressive effect within the first week of presentation to health care. Both data from a case report 4 and a large randomized trial 27 suggest that the timing of immunosuppressive treatment in COVID-19 has major impact on outcome.",

An additional strength is the prospectively collected high resolution patient data covering all major organ systems. Finally these patients presented with the most severe forms of COVID-19 enabling us to study extra-pulmonary organ failure and its relation to RNA copy levels in plasma. Finally, we Odds ratios for association between age, crude and age adjusted plasma RNA copies, and risk of organ support and death",
