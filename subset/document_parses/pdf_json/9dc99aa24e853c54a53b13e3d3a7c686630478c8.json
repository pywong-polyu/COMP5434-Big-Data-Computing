An individual tele-education (interactive education and consultancy provided by phone calls, text message and digital education booklet) was provided to the pregnant women in the experiment group for one week. No intervention was administered to those in the control group.

Zhu et al. performed a retrospective study for clinical analysis of 10 neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, and they reported that vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is yet to be confirmed ( Zhu et al., 2020 ) . Additionally, it is still not confirmed whether the COVID-19 infection is likely to be transmitted to the baby via placental transmission or during childbirth ( Zhu et al., 2020 ) . For this reason, pregnant women may feel concerned about the probability of the infection to be transmitted to the fetus and be more open to anxiety ( Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2020 ; . For example, a study reported that pregnant women assessed after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic showed significantly higher depressive symptoms than those assessed before the declaration of the pandemic .",

The lowest and highest scores are 11 and 55 for primiparous women, and 10 and 50 for multiparous women, respectively. A higher scale score indicates a higher level of anxiety in pregnancy. All scale items are scored positively. The scale has no cutoff score.

Their posttest data were obtained at the end of one week by using the same method. All data obtained through the online self-report method was saved through Google Forms. The pregnant women in the control group, who did not receive any intervention, were reached twice every other week, and their pre-and posttest data were obtained via the internet by using the Google Forms method. Data collection from each pregnant woman lasted around 5-10 minutes.

Additionally, social isolation and social distance practices due to COVID-19 infection may affect the social support status of pregnant women during pregnancy. Therefore, it is extremely important for midwives and healthcare professionals to provide guidance and support to women during pregnancy and childbirth ( Antonakou, 2020 ) . In this study, in comparison to the mean score of those in the control group, the posttest prenatal distress mean score of the pregnant women in the experiment group decreased significantly after they received the tele-education on pregnancy and birth planning during COVID-19 ( Table 4 , p < 0.05). Furthermore, the intragroup posttest prenatal dis-tress mean score of pregnant women in the experiment group decreased significantly compared to their pretest mean score ( Table 4 , p < 0.001). These results show that the tele-education was effective in decreasing the prenatal distress levels of the pregnant women.",

Educational interventions in the prenatal period are effective in preventing or reducing prenatal anxiety ( Kang et al., 2016 ) . This study found that the pregnant women who received the tele-education on pregnancy and birth planning during COVID-19 had a significantly lower posttest PRAQ-R2 mean score than those who did not ( Table 4 , p < 0.001). Studies have reported that false information about COVID-19 increases the fear and anxiety of pregnant women, whereas correct information about COVID-19 has a positive effect on their anxiety levels during pregnancy ( Corbett et al., 2020 ) . The decreased level of anxiety in pregnant women due to the tele-education on pregnancy and birth planning during COVID-19 in this study was consistent with those in the literature. Duranku \u015f et and Aksu (2020) evaluated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnant women by using different measurement tools, and they determined that the anxiety levels of pregnant women with a high risk of developing postpartum depression were significantly higher ( Duranku \u015f and Aksu, 2020 ). This indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic is a risk factor for both the prenatal and postnatal periods. Additionally, acceptance of pregnancy anxiety as one of the most important risk factors and determinants of postpartum anxiety and depression increases the importance given to the subject in the literature ( Derya et al., 2018 ; Lefkovics et al., 2018 ; Naki \u0107 Rado \u0161 et al., 2018 ; Silva et al., 2017 ; Sinesi et al., 2019 ) .",

Fear of childbirth may also affect the preference of pregnant women for type of delivery ( Matinnia et al., 2015 ; Nilsson et al., 2018 ) . Although COVID-19 infection is not a contraindication for vaginal delivery alone, infected women may prefer cesarean delivery due to their perception of childbirth, fear of giving birth, complications associated with labor and fear of disease transmission ( Vivilaki and Asimaki, 2020 ) . Studies have reported that an education given in the antenatal period is effective in reducing the fear of childbirth in pregnant women ( G\u00f6k\u00e7e \u0130 sbir et al., 2016 ; Karabulut et al., 2016 ) . In this study, the pregnant women who received the teleeducation on pregnancy and birth planning during COVID-19 had a significantly lower posttest PRAQ-R2 \"fear of giving birth \" subscale mean score than those who did not. Additionally, the posttest PRAQ-R2 \"fear of giving birth \" subscale mean score of the pregnant women who did not receive the education significantly increased in comparison to their pretest mean score. These results showed that the educational intervention associated with COVID-19 was not only effective in reducing the pregnant women's fear of giving birth, but it also prevented the increase in fear of childbirth over time. One study on pregnant women's fear of labor in the antenatal period found that pregnant women were most concerned about the health of their babies ( Geissbuehler and Eberhard, 2002 ) . Studies have also reported that pregnant women were mostly concerned about their elderly relatives, children and unborn babies during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively ( Corbett et al., 2020 ) . In this study, the pregnant women who received the tele-education on pregnancy and birth planning during COVID-19 had a significantly lower posttest PRAQ-R2 \"worries of bearing a physically or mentally handicapped child \" subscale mean score than those who did not. This result suggested that the education was effective in reducing the fears of the pregnant women about their babies' health.",
