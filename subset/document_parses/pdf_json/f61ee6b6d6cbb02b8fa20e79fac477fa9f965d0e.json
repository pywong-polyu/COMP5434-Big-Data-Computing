            "text": "Background Several neurologic complications have been reported in close temporal association with both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, several cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) have been reported in temporal relationship with COVID-19 vaccination, with two small case series describing a specific phenotype with bifacial weakness and paresthesia in the limbs. Methods We retrospectively collected patients who developed a new-onset neuromuscular disorder in the first 6 weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (either first or second dose). The patients were collected from one tertiary care centre and one secondary care centre from February to July 2021. Results We report eight patients who developed phenotypically diverse neuromuscular disorders in the weeks following COVID-19 vaccination, with a presumed immune-mediated etiology. In our case series, we report three patients with classical GBS, one patient with bifacial weakness with paresthesia variant of GBS, two patients with subacute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), one patient with brachial plexopathy and one patient with subacute axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Conclusions New-onset neuromuscular disorders with onset in the weeks after COVID-19 vaccination can include diverse phenotypes. A causal relationship between these disorders and the vaccine cannot be proven at present, and further epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate this association.",

Neurological examination showed bilateral weakness in the lower extremities (MRC 2/5) and upper extremities (MRC 4/5), with reduced vibration sense in the lower limbs and global areflexia. Nerve conduction studies showed an inhomogeneous demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy. Lumbar puncture showed an albumin-cytological dissociation (see Table 1 ; a virus panel study was not performed). He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), repeated after 3 weeks due to deterioration after initial improvement. After 2 weeks, the patient deteriorated again, and treatment with IVIG was continued with regular intervals of 4 weeks, while methylprednisolone and azathioprine were associated to his therapy. At last clinical follow-up, muscle strength in the upper extremities remained stable (MRC 4/5), and strength in the lower extremities improved (MRC 3/5 proximally and 4/5 distally). Initially, a diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was considered. However, since the patient continued to fluctuate more than 8 weeks after onset of the symptoms, a diagnosis of subacute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) was made.",

These patients were more likely to suffer from acute-onset CIDP, which is also reflected in our series. However, as in GBS, a causal relationship between vaccination and CIDP is not proven [8] .",

To our knowledge, no other cases of CIDP or brachial plexopathy following COVID-19 vaccination have been reported so far. We also report another case of the bifacial weakness with paraesthesia variant of GBS, of which some small case series have already been reported. These various presentations strengthen the association between COVID-19 vaccination and particular GBS phenotypes. While a causal relationship between these disorders and the vaccine cannot be proven at present, the temporal association is remarkable. Further epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate the association between COVID-19 vaccination and peripheral nerve disorders.",
