            "text": "Background: Canine circovirus is reported in dogs in many countries, including the USA, China and Thailand. It has been detected in healthy dogs and dogs with diarrhea, hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, and vasculitis. It comprises five genotypes and is frequently found as a coinfection with canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2). Aim: To characterize canine circovirus genotypes co-circulating with CPV-2 in Vietnam. Method: PCR assessment of 81 CPV-2-positive fecal samples from Vietnamese diarrheic dogs up to seven months of age for other viral enteric pathogens, including canine bocavirus, canine adenovirus, paramyxovirus, canine coronavirus, porcine circovirus-3 and canine circovirus. In addition, eight selected full genome sequences of Vietnamese canine circovirus were analyzed and used for phylogeny. Results: In total 19.8% of samples were found to be positive for canine circovirus. Phylogeny revealed that the Vietnamese canine circovirus strains were clustered in two different genotypes (genotype-1 and -3). The genetic diversity among Vietnamese canine circovirus was 86.0-87.2%. The nucleotide discrepancy among both genotypes altered the deduced amino acid sequence in 14 and ten residues of the replicase and capsid proteins, respectively. Genetic recombination analysis revealed that the Vietnamese canine circovirus-6 strain has the American and Chinese canine circovirus as its major and minor parents, respectively. Only a single dog revealed triple detections of CPV-2c, Canine circovirus and canine adenovirus (1.2%). Conclusion: The co-circulation of two different genotypes of canine circovirus and CPV-2c in dogs in Vietnam has been illustrated. Clinical relevance: The mortality rate with CPV-2 only (22%) doubled in dogs with canine circovirus and CPV-2 co-infection.",

In non-human mammals, the porcine circovirus (PCV) infection in pigs causes an immunosuppressive condition, particularly PCV type 2 (PCV-2), and results in devastating syndromes for the swine industry (Segales et al. 2005) . The CanineCV was first detected in serum samples collected from dogs in the USA (Kapoor et al. 2012 ). Subsequently, the virus has been reported in dogs in Italy, Germany, Thailand, Taiwan, Argentina, China, Brazil, and Colombia (Li et al. 2013; Decaro et al. 2014; Hsu et al. 2016; Weber et al. 2018; Piewbang et al. 2018b; Kotsias et al. 2019; Sun et al. 2019; Giraldo-Ramirez et al. 2020) . CanineCV is considered to be the second, non-human mammalian circovirus. Recently, CanineCV has been divided into five genotypes (CanineCV-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5) (Urbani et al., 2021) . The CanineCV-1 genotype has been identified in dogs, wolves and a badger from the USA, Europe and China, which corresponds to the Cosmopolitan genotype proposed by Giraldo-Ramirez et al. (2020) . The CanineCV-2, -3, and -4 genotypes are reported in Asia, including China and Thailand (Niu et al. 2020; Urbani et al., 2021) , and this classification agrees with the China, Asia-I, and Asia-II genotypes reported by Giraldo-Ramirez et al. (2020) .",

Its genome is comprised of two major putative open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) protein. The Rep protein is comprised of 303 amino acids and is essential for viral replication (Cheung 2003) , while the Cap protein is comprised of 270 amino acids and plays the role of a structural protein in the virus (Kapoor et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013 ). Among the two major ORFs, there is a non-coding region containing nine nucleotides (TAGTATTAC), which is a thermodynamically stable stem-loop that acts during the initiation of rolling-circle replication (Kapoor et al. 2012) . Recently, an additional ORF, ORF-3, was identified in the antisense of ORF1 of a Thai strain of CanineCV, but its function has yet to be elucidated (Piewbang et al. 2018b) .",

Since viral isolation in vitro has not been successful, knowledge on the pathogenesis of CanineCV infection in dogs remains poorly understood. However, CanineCV has been considered as a cause of enteritis and is frequently identified in dual infections attributed to canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) (Hsu et al. 2016; Thaiwong et al. 2016; Giraldo-Ramirez et al. 2020 ), leading to an increased mortality rate (Anderson et al. 2017) . Therefore, it has been suggested that CanineCV likely acts in synergy with other infectious agents in the development of disease. A few studies in dogs have reported coinfections of CanineCV with CPV-2 and that these coinfected dogs developed disease with severe clinical signs (Thaiwong et al. 2016; Kotsias et al. 2019) .",

The CanineCV genome was detected in CPV-2-positive fecal samples at an incidence of 19.8%, which is higher than those reported in Germany (13.0%) and South America (16.6%) (Anderson et al. 2017; Giraldo-Ramirez et al. 2020) . The incidence of CanineCV detected from this study varied in the Northern, Central and Southern areas of Vietnam. The fecal samples collected in Hanoi (Northern Vietnam) showed the highest rate of CanineCV at about 24.4%, while those samples from Da Nang (Central Vietnam) and Ho Chi Minh (Southern Vietnam) were about 12.5% and 16.7%, respectively. Since this study did not investigate the presence of CanineCV in either healthy or CPV-2negative dogs and the number of samples has been limited, the actual prevalence of CanineCV in Vietnam could not be ascertained. Further investigation into these groups is required to understand the epidemiology of CanineCV in Vietnam.

However, several studies have indicated that CanineCV may act in synergy with other infectious agents in the development of a disease (Thaiwong et al. 2016; Zaccaria et al. 2016; Kotsias et al. 2019) . In this study, CanineCV was co-detected with CPV-2c in enteritissuffering dogs, which is in agreement with the previous findings (Kotsias et al. 2019; Giraldo-Ramirez et al. 2020) . Since CPV-2c has been reported as a predominant genotype detected in Vietnam (Hoang et al. 2019) , which is in agreement with our study, co-infection with CanineCV may play a significant role as a negative co-factor in disease outcomes in dogs with CPV-2 infection (Anderson et al. 2017) . This is shown in our study as a higher mortality rate for dogs co-infected with CanineCV and CPV-2 (43.8%) than for dogs having a single CPV-2 infection (22.2%). However, a recent report indicated that the CanineCV may play a role as a primary pathogen that causes acute hemorrhagic diarrheic disease in dogs (Anderson et al. 2017) . Thus, the definitive role of CanineCV-associated diseases should be explored in further studies.",

Selective pressure analysis on the PCV-2 genome has been demonstrated to be the factor driving mutations in the Cap gene, resulting in the virus escaping the host's immune response in pigs (Franzo et al. 2016 ). However, the factor driving the mutation in CanineCV has not been investigated, but evidence for positive selection in both the Cap and Rep proteins of CanineCV has been reported (Giraldo-Ramirez et al. 2020).

Notably, the CanineCV-1 genotype was mainly detected in Europe (Italy and Germany) and the Americas (USA, Brazil, Colombia and Argentina), except for one Chinese sequence (MG266899) (Niu et al. 2020 ) and four Vietnamese sequences (MT740198-MT740201) from this study. The CanineCV-2 and -4 genotypes were distributed only in China, while the CanineCV-3 genotype was detected in both China and Vietnam, representing four sequences (MT740194-MT740197) from this report. Of note, the CanineCV-5 genotype is found only in arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Norway and the UK (Bexton et al. 2015; Urbani et al., 2021) . Interestingly, each genotype presented the typical mutation in both the Rep and Cap proteins. Since the geographic distribution pattern has been well-described in canine distemper virus (CDV; a fatal Morbillivirus in dogs), this indicates that the origin and global evolution of CDV derives from specific mutations of the ancestral strain (Panzera et al. 2015) . Therefore, further study is required to verify this observation in CanineCV, as to whether any mutations in the ancestral sequence (KC241983 as an outgroup in the phylogeny) play a role in the global evolution of CanineCV. In addition, this study confirms that the CanineCV-1 and -3 genotypes are now circulating in CPV-2 enteritis-infected dogs in Vietnam, and provides evidence for the distribution of the CanineCV-1 genotype in Asia.",

In the results of the phylogenetic analysis on the Cap gene, we found that the ancestral American strain KC214983 has been clustered within the most CanineCV sequences detected in China and Vietnam, suggesting that they shared evolutionary patterns among sequences. This result implies that the American strain may serve as the common ancestor of the strains detected in Vietnam. Further studies on evolutionary analysis and retrospective, larger-scaled investigations in the form of genetic analysis are, therefore, needed to elucidate the intermediate CanineCV strains that may have closer relationships to the American ancestor. This viral recombination is important because it has been associated with viral host range expansion, the emergence of novel progeny viruses that express new antigenic and serological characteristic, and increases in virulence and pathogenesis (P erez-Losada et al. 2015) . Our findings suggest that various genotypes of CanineCV have been prevalent in Vietnam and a novel recombinant CanineCV-CN-6, which belonged to the CanineCV-3 genotype, is apparent. This recombination event should be strictly monitored because the different genotypes of CanineCV have simultaneously circulated and been co-detected with other pathogens in the same host.",
