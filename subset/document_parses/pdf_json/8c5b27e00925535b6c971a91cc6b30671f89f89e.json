Adolescents aged 12-18 years compiled an online questionnaire designed through validated diagnostic instruments. We enrolled 1262 adolescents who declared that they had not experienced any previous traumatic events. Participants were divided into two groups: 118 adolescents with psychiatric problems (APP+) and 1144 without (APP\u2212). In total, 79.52%",

Besides an impressive biological health emergency, literature provides strong evidence for the psychological and psychiatric impact that the current emergency health condition is having on the general population in worst-hit countries, including Italy (Fiorillo & Gorwood, 2020; Rossi et al., 2020) . Containment measures, including self-isolation and social distancing correlated to COVID-19 outbreak, along with feelings of uncertainty and extreme fear, may eventually have a strong impact on the population's daily life and negatively affect psychological well-being (Brooks et al., 2020) . Literature states that pandemics and quarantine are among the main causes of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and, in general, of the onset of stressrelated symptoms (Brooks et al., 2020; Hawryluck et al., 2004; Sprang & Silman, 2013; Usher et al., 2020) . Recent studies and reviews regarding the psychiatric impact of COVID-19 emergency on the general population reported a significant increase in PTSD symptoms (Dutheil et al., 2020; Favieri et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Vindegaard & Benros, 2020) . Furthermore, besides stress-related symptoms, several studies reported on the development of mood deflection, anxiety, panic attacks, poor sleep quality, especially among patients, considered the ones with the highest risk of psychological distress (Qiu et al., 2020; Torales et al., 2020; Vindegaard & Benros, 2020) .",

During COVID-19 outbreak, parenting becomes an even more multifaceted mission: Parents experienced increased pressure to work from home as well as to take care of schooling adolescents at home at the same time, without external support by other family members and social support systems (Cluver et al., 2020; Fegert et al., 2020) .",

Furthermore, this may be a particularly challenging period especially for disadvantaged or marginalized adolescents, such as the ones with already existing mental health problems or previous trauma experiences (Fegert et al., 2020) , who tend to experience higher levels of psychological distress (Duan et al., 2020) . Thomas et al. (2020) reported on the worsening of the existing mental health problems among 83% of adolescent patients in Britain, with increased anxiety, sleep problems, panic attacks, and self-harming. Noteworthily, the different psychological and psychiatric impacts of the current pandemic between adolescents with pre-existing psychiatric conditions and healthy ones has not been investigated so far. Therefore, it seemed mandatory to assess COVID-19 stress-related symptoms quickly, considering the influence of parental perceived stress, urgently addressing the mental health needs of Italian adolescents and their families.",
