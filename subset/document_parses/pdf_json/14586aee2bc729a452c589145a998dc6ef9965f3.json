What is not known about the virus is part of the problem, and the knowledge gap drives an unprecedented and urgent search for knowledge. This article explores the challenges for lifelong learning and the relevance of transformative learning. Disorientation, disorienting dilemmas and critical reflection are the ingredients of such learning, since we can only learn our way out of this situation. The authors present American adult educator Jack Mezirow's theory of transformative learning (TL) as an appropriate learning framework for lifelong learning. They draw on the work of American philosopher Richard Rorty and German philosopher and sociologist J\u00fcrgen Habermas to re-shape TL so that it supports the kind of learning that is sufficiently complex and nuanced to enable us to deal with contradictions, ambivalence and meaning-making in a world where not-knowing is the new normal.",

They frame this as a developmental task for adults -in much the same way that Dewey saw growth as the aim of education (Dewey 1916) . Like never before we are required to understand, respond to and act with sophisticated and expert knowledge. This is knowledge about infections, immunity, resistance, vulnerability, vaccines and knowledge from microbiology, epidemiology and social theory with a mindset created in a pre-pandemic era. What ordinary citizens know is overshadowed by what is not known and yet needs to be known. However, as learners and teachers we are compelled to make sense and meaning of what could be called an absurd situation. Workers from the lower levels of socio-economic scales have become essential workers, while at the same time they are members of high-risk groups in society.",

The absurdity is in the tension between not knowing what we want to know and refusing to give way to nihilism. What is left is rebellion, to struggle to make sense and impose form. The plague in the novel represents indifference rather than heroic vigilance of the kind required to combat the plague. In Oran (northwest Algeria), where this plague rages, there are townspeople and volunteers. The townspeople are passive and victims, who fight and lash out. Volunteers form sanitary squads and bury the dead (ibid., p. 131). The doctor, Rieux, also struggles -because it is his job. Both he and the volunteers talk of love and decency. They show compassion, move beyond the sleep of victims and survive -out of a sense of common decency and doing their job (ibid., p. 136). \"And thus I came to understand that I, anyhow, had had plague through all those long years\" (ibid., p. 205). \" [O] n this earth there are pestilences and there are victims, and it's up to us, so far as possible, not to join forces with the pestilences\" (ibid., p. 207). In our current situation, we might identify with the struggle against the plague within, the inertia of unquestioned assumptions -and the way forward is to search for meaning, for growth, for transformation.",

In a third step, (3), learners critically assess and reflect on their guiding assumptions underlying their current meaning perspective. What follows is (4) the realisation that one's personal problem is shared and (sometimes) a public issue: the public breaks into the private sphere and learners realise that others have negotiated and undergone similar changes and challenges. In the next phase, (5), learners explore alternative ways of being and living in terms of relationships, roles and actions. This phase is complemented by another phase, where (6) learners plan (new) courses of action and (7) acquire new knowledge in order to put these courses of action into practice. In the aftermath of (8) learners trying out these new roles (provisionally), they (9) build (self-) confidence and competence and (10) re-integrate into their lives, employing a new, transformed (meaning) perspective.",

The choice of social action resides with the learner, as collective and social transformation may be separate entities from individual transformation (Mezirow 1989) . A perspective transformation happens within the learner, and the site of change -as well as agency -is envisaged primarily in terms of the transformation of the inner mental landscape of an individual learner which may, or may not, have broader social consequences (Finnegan 2019, p. 48) .",

The experience of being physically distant while being connected through social media adds additional challenges. Transformative learning is also politically dangerous, as this crisis reveals structural injustices. Risks are not equally distributed, and frontline workers carry a heavy burden on behalf of everyone. Social inequalities are amplified. Reopening the economy raises questions about who may be carrying the risks. Transformative learning is also empowering.

Even though people are trying to get back to their comfort zones, to escape these edge-emotions and return to the previously known \"normal\", the individual and global crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to offer us a way back to this known \"normal\". Kaisu M\u00e4lkki argues that in order to learn transformatively, we need to develop our ability to embrace edge-emotions, which come into play when we are challenging the integrity of deeply held assumptions. Following M\u00e4lkki's approach, the way forward is to reframe these edge-emotions as an invitation to explore our assumptions in the light of the current crisis. Kessler's advice is similar to M\u00e4lkki's suggestion that we acknowledge what we are going through so that we can find or regain some control in acceptance (Berinato 2020 ). Mezirow (1991) draws heavily on the work of German philosopher and sociologist J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1971 Habermas ( , 1984 Habermas ( , 1987 and builds on the Habermasian ideas of discourse, instrumental, communicative and emancipatory knowledge, and the role of argument and rationality as key concepts in his TL theory.

Habermas links \"the importance of learning how to reason to adults' ability to participate in democratic decision making\" (Brookfield 2005 (Brookfield , p. 1131 . Habermas (1987) postulates an adult learning crisis in modern society, arguing that adults are not sufficiently prepared for what is central to his vision of a democratic society, namely participation in public discourse. 2 Habermas' view of what adults need to be active citizens departs from the uncritical version of lifelong learning, where a lack of basic skills in concert with employability is central for adults in order to fulfil their roles as active citizens participating in democracy. Maren Elfert (2018) refers to the way lifelong learning has been emaciated and today bears little resemblance to its original meanings. She asserts that, in the European Union (EU), \"Lifelong learning began as a radical idea with a strong political dimension, which asked questions about justice and equality, the distribution of resources and the exercise of power\" (Elfert 2018, p. 215) . It has instead become de-politicized and \"transformed\" to make it fit into the agenda of the marketplace, turning it into a euphemistic label for a neoliberal worldview, in which the individual is held responsible to invest in her human capital, in the name of a false notion of freedom (ibid.).",

This is close to what Mezirow conceptualises as a frame of reference, \"as having cultural, social and personality dimensions, as the lifeworld\" (Fleming 2002, p. 7) . It is the philosophical grounding of TL in Habermas' works that adds the social dimension to TL (ibid.). When others serve as critical mirrors (Brookfield 2000) in discourse, they enable us to critique our assumptions. Critical reflection, according to Mezirow (1991) , is situated in a community established by reflective, rational dialogue and is intersubjective by nature -with ties of mutual recognition. Mezirow (1991, pp. 64-98 ) relies on Habermas' notion of rational discourse (Habermas 1971 (Habermas , 1984 (Habermas , 1987 to promote TL by exchanging arguments in an environment free from coercion. Learning transformatively involves rediscovering a sense of self-direction insofar as one learns to act on one's freely chosen values, feelings and purposes instead of those \"uncritically assimilated from others\" (Mezirow 2012, p. 75) . In order to do this, according to Mezirow, one needs to engage in rational discourse by exchanging arguments. Brookfield suggests:",

Being primarily interested in democracy and the public sphere, Habermas is less concerned with (ironist) projects of self-fulfilment or selfdevelopment, which belong to the private sphere. Therefore, TL theory, as much as it focuses on individuals experiencing a perspective transformation, is mainly concerned with a discursive format to promote the kind of TL which is appropriate for deliberative decision-making processes and participation in democracy. What is missing is a philosophical grounding that reflects both processes of transformation and related, suitable concepts to foster TL on a meta-theoretical level (Eschenbacher 2019) . In the context of COVID-19, this becomes apparent as a dilemma that needs to be adequately addressed through the theory of TL. One possible way of tackling this is to engage Mezirow in a critical conversation with Rorty.",

By placing Habermas' notion of discourse at the centre of Mezirow's theory, TL theory lacks the kind of dialogue that is more suitable to fostering perspective transformation within the personal sphere. Even though TL theory focuses on the individual without being an individualistic theory of adult development, it lacks a form of dialogue that is not merely about exchanging arguments and the non-coercive force of the better argument. When adult learners are searching for answers to the question of how to live one's life, it is not so much about finding \"the\" objective truth, one correct way to live life, or arriving at a consensus with others. Instead, it is more about the realisation that there are always other possibilities to explore, that one is not trapped by one way of looking at the world and one way of living. By bringing Mezirow's theory of TL into dialogue with Rorty's work, TL theory strengthens its potential to support individuals in coping with challenges in their private lives. It adds a valuable dimension to the discourse of lifelong learning which is so often reduced to being concerned with people's employability and their capacity to be or become active citizens. Mezirow created a theory that is less concerned with people's employability -or, to use Habermas' words -an instrumental approach (Habermas 1987) . On the other hand, the idea of personal development or individual fulfilment is less prominent within the lifelong learning discourse. The experience of an existential crisis -like COVID-19 -reveals the absence of a debate about the idea of personal development and an ability to cope with crises apart from the notion of \"employability\" within the lifelong learning discourse. By engaging in a dialogue between Rorty and Mezirow, this gap can not only be closed within TL theory, but also addressed within the lifelong learning discourse.",

Reflective critical discourse of the kind Mezirow (1991) recommends might not be the most adequate format to create a safe (enough) space. Instead of looking for the coercive power of the better argument and arriving at a tentative consensus on how to deal with the consequences and with edge-emotions, the theory of TL needs to be broadened. There is no need for consensus regarding the way in which one copes with COVID-19 as an individual, or how to live one's life. There is no \"One Right\" way to do this. We need to foster new kinds of dialogue suitable for supporting learners in transforming their individually experienced crises into learning opportunitieslimit situations (Freire 1972). 4 However, there is also a need for public discourse, for a consensus on how we want to live our lives together in the light of COVID-19, how to live in solidarity and how to foster democratic learning processes.",

The current crisis, being experienced both globally and individually, urges people to learn transformatively. It also creates a learning opportunity to engage in the kinds of conversations that are supportive to coping with these challenges either in an individual way or as a society. Since these different ways of coping belong to different spheres (the private and the public, respectively), there is a need to address both spheres in ways that are adequate for each. Arcilla (1995) suggests the concept of conversational edification as \"the power to converse reasonably with others for the purpose of edifying oneself\" (Arcilla 1995, p. 105, emphasis in original) . His concept is especially helpful for learners experiencing disruptions to originally unproblematic ways of being and living:",

            "text": "This calls for a format which is different from discourse and argumentation, one that allows for an exchange and for exploration of different vocabularies without the necessity of arriving at a consensus or a final vocabulary in Rorty's terms. Rorty's (1989) vocabularies comprise more than just the ways in which we describe ourselves and the world we live in. Instead of asking what the correct way of looking at the world is, and discussing arguments to see what we all can agree on to be true, the alternative, namely exploring different vocabularies as proposals regarding how one might live can be understood as invitations to leave the (mental) homes we have hitherto occupied. Rorty's vocabularies provide the ground for justifying actions, beliefs and living one's life. They are the words with which we express our deepest self-doubts and our highest hopes. They are the words in which we tell, sometimes prospectively and sometimes retrospectively, the story of our lives (Rorty 1989, p. 73) . Like Mezirow, Rorty wants \"to liberate us from the dead weight of past vocabularies and open up space for the imaginative creation of new vocabularies\" (Bernstein 2016, p. 52 ). Rorty's (1989) concept of irony offers an attitude that doubts our own vocabulary in a radical and ongoing way. It is through the experience of (existential) crisis that learners become aware of the limits of their vocabulary in use. Instead of trying to arrive at a final vocabulary, one we take for granted, Rorty suggests -as does Mezirow - to remain open to alternative vocabularies, to understand them as tentative, and contingent; as one way of being or one possible vocabulary among others (Eschenbacher 2019 ). Rorty's concept of irony stresses the idea that we are free to create new vocabularies, to redescribe ourselves and to transform our guiding assumptions. For Rorty (1989) , radical and continuing doubts about the vocabulary we employ is one defining criterion for being an ironist. Another is the awareness that our most central beliefs are subject to change. \"Contingency stresses freedom by keeping open the possibility of metaphorical redescription\" (Arcilla 1993, p. 202) . This is also the essence of TL theory: the purpose of transformative learning is to help adults transform their taken-for-granted assumptions about themselves, as well as how they relate to the world. One way forward in coping with feelings of loss, grief and not-knowing is to accept them, as Kessler suggests (Berinato 2020) . Providing adults with a type of edifying conversation that serves as a space where they can redescribe themselves and rediscover a sense of self-direction in order to be better able to cope with COVID-19 is a pathway to the kind of transformative learning that allows learners to broaden their current meaning perspectives, to develop -and ultimately to grow.",

This may help us master the challenges and demands of adults' everyday lives even in the face of existential crises such as the one we are currently experiencing. While all of these aspects have become a prerequisite for mastering adult life, they have not yet been given enough consideration in the course of one's lifespan from the perspective of lifelong learning. Transformative learning adds this insight to the discourse. According to both Habermas and Mezirow, participatory, active citizenship might be less a matter of employability than the current discourse on lifelong learning suggests. To foster communicative learning and reason as an adult learning project, and to establish a global dialogue on how we want to live our lives, might provide an avenue worth exploring in the face of this current existential crisis.",

The latter question shares much of what we find in the Habermasian foundation of the theory of TL. Rorty's work is particularly relevant here, since his concept of irony (ibid.) values ideas of freedom and change, or, more precisely, transformation. He embraces an ethic of invention and seeks to open up possibilities to transform our given selves by redescribing our current selves. Transformation can be conceptualised as a redescription of ourselves, our situation and our being in the world, whereas Rorty's idea of vocabularies is closer to what Mezirow understands as frame of reference (Eschenbacher 2019).",
