            "text": "How can sport community involvement influence life satisfaction during a pandemic? Selfexpansion theory posits that individuals seek to gain resources such as positive interpersonal relationships for growth and achievement. By considering psychological capital (PsyCap) as a dispositional resource intervening between sport community involvement and life satisfaction, we examined an empirical model to test the chain of effects. Based on the stress process model, distress and generational group (Generation Z vs. others) were tested as moderators. Participants (N = 233) responded to the scale item questionnaire for model assessment. Supporting the hypothesized relationships, the model was supported with a significant moderated-moderated mediation. The mediation effect of PsyCap was stronger when distress level was lower and such interaction effect was amplified for Generation Z (Gen Z). Whereas the global sport communities and Gen Z were found to be more particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, our findings suggest that there are psychological pathways for fans to maintain their resilience. It is foremost imperative to lower the stress level of sport fans for their community involvement to positively affect life satisfaction. Gen Z were more stressed during the pandemic but individuals who managed to cope with stress were able to leverage community involvement to boost positive psychological resources. Acknowledgment of these effects brings implications for better management strategies and provides avenues for new research.",

In addition, while there are evidences indicating a positive relationship between job involvement and PsyCap (e.g., Demir, 2018; Rani and Chaturvedula, 2018) , the role of involvement in a non-occupational community setting gained little attention.

PsyCap refers to the developmental capacity of individuals including state-like and motivational cognitive constructs such as hope, efficacy, optimism, and resilience (Luthans, 2002) . PsyCap is highlighted as one of the core constructs in the positive organizational behavior perspective for its significance in individual growth from the actual self to the possible self (Luthans et al., 2007) .

In terms of how to improve one's PsyCap, Tu (2020) maintained that facilitating social relationships among people plays a crucial role in leisure participants' psychological development. These results suggest that sport community involvement can contribute to an individual's growth and development. Specifically, individuals can gain greater confidence in dealing with challenges when they receive support from other members in their community (i.e., efficacy), allowing them to discover new ways to achieve their goals (i.e., hope). Also, a sport fan community member's optimism and resilience can be strengthened by their belief that there will be support and help from other group members when they face difficulties, allowing them to think positively about the future instead of becoming frustrated (Sagi et al., 2021) .",

Furthermore, resilience and optimism are positively associated with adaptive coping responses and negatively correlated with negative emotions in adversity, which in turn can impact the subjective well-being of an individual (Andersson, 1996) . To sum up, four sub-constructs of PsyCap (i.e., efficacy, hope, optimism, resilience) synergistically enhance one's life satisfaction.",

As a generic term, distress has been linked to mental tension and or strain and is often perceived as a nonspecific bodily response to a stimulus. The subjective feeling of distress is triggered by a stimulus (i.e., a stressor) or environmental demands (Krannich et al., 1988) . In the field of spectator sport, distress has been studied mostly in terms of its effects on fans' well-being, particularly given the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as a stressor. Studies found that the pandemic has imposed numerous restrictions on sports fans and their communities, putting them under a significant level of stress (Schellenberg et al., 2021) . Further, it was evidenced that fans' anxiety over when they will be able to return back to participating in fan activities without worrying about the disease was stressful and perceived as a threat to their self-identity (Schellenberg et al., 2021) . The stress process model, commonly employed to better understand the effects of distress on an individual (Pearlin et al., 1981) , has been a primary sociological lens for comprehending the relationships among stressors, individual resources, and mental health. In this model, stressors are defined as \"the broad array of problematic conditions and experiences that can challenge the adaptive capacities of people\" (Pearlin, 2010, p. 208) . In other words, the stressors can be viewed as external forces hindering one's ability to function normally, thus constituting a primary attribute of poor mental health (Wheaton et al., 2013) . Based on the stress process model, external stressors can exert a direct negative effect on an individual's mental health (e.g., depressive symptoms). Additionally, the stressors negatively affect personal resources (e.g., self-esteem and self-mastery) and ultimately their mental health.",

The pandemic has limited the ability of those heavily involved in the sports community to engage in community activities, and the resulting stress can affect their PsyCap and lead to a consequent deficit in life satisfaction. Conversely, the effect of such stress may be relatively smaller for fans who are less involved in sports community activities, as they may satisfy their intrinsic desires by other means. In this respect, it is hypothesized that the extent to which an individual can enhance their PsyCap through sports community involvement varies depending on their level of stress.

Previous studies found that interpersonal or face-to-face social interactions cannot be completely replaced by other forms of social interaction (Turkle, 2011; Turner, 2015) .

Distress significantly moderated the effect of sport community involvement on PsyCap, supporting hypothesis 3. Sport community involvement affected PsyCap more positively when the distress level was low. It is imperative to consider this disordinal interaction as the effect of sport community involvement became significantly weaker when fans are stressed. As many restrictions have been placed on sports fans and their community involvement as a result of the pandemic, current study results are in accord with recent studies identifying the significant role of stress on fans (Schellenberg et al., 2021) . Simultaneously, our results confirm and expand the stress process model (Pearlin et al., 1981) , suggesting that such global pandemics or other disasters can act as an external stressor negatively affecting personal-PsyCap, resulting in a negative impact on mental health. Further, we found that Gen Z is experiencing higher levels of distress than others. The stress process model explained that stressors can exert a stronger negative impact on the mental health of certain people than others. In this regard, the demographic cohort information provides additional evidence to support the theoretical explanation and prediction of the stress process model. The significant moderated-moderated effect further spotlights the importance of distress levels and generation differences based on the three-way disordinal interaction (Figure 2) . The mediation of PsyCap showed stronger effects when distress level was low and this interaction effect was more so the case to Gen Z. Visualized in Figure 2 , engaging in fan community activities was more impactful for lessstressed Gen Z group. For Gen Z fans, the indirect effect was prominent, especially when their distress level is low and medium (see Table 3 ). In contrast, for non-Gen Z fans, the indirect effect of sport community involvement through PsyCap was only significant when their distress level is low. It indicated that unless Gen Z's distress level is notably high, their life satisfaction can be improved by the increased level of PsyCap generated by sport community involvement. Such findings can encourage practitioners and policymakers in sport as the adaptive role of sport community involvement in relation to life satisfaction is further evidenced. However, it is also imperative to note that the role of sport community involvement is not necessarily effective in boosting PsyCap and life satisfaction when individuals are highly stressed out. Scholars need to provide evidence-based solutions based on the findings that it is important to keep the level of distress low for community members, specifically to a greater degree to Gen Z as they are more vulnerable to stress (Turner, 2015) .",

            "text": "Our results suggest that when people are experiencing high levels of stress, community involvement has no effect regardless of generation. In this regard, continued efforts are needed to prepare and build a policy or program that can reduce people's stress. At the same time, our results show that community involvement is effective when people have normal or low levels of stress, highlighting the role of community involvement in increasing PsyCap and life satisfaction. This information indicates that developing effective community engagement strategies that stimulate people's interest and enthusiasm, while also generating a sense of community involvement, is crucial. More practically, it would be valuable for practitioners or managers in the sport community to use a variety of communication channels (on-and off-line) to increase fans' social interaction. Not only can the boundaries of the community expand through fan access channels, but the life satisfaction of the fans previously involved in the community can also be boosted for a positive social capital. Taking a more careful look at the generation differences, it may be important to activate various alternative channels for Gen Z as they are known to be omnipresent online (Wood, 2013; Turner, 2015) . Gen Z showed stronger effects of sport community involvement on PsyCap when distress level was lower, compared to the non-Gen Z group. This is consistent with the viewpoint that Gen Z are the most vulnerable to stress (Turner, 2015) while being the least resilient to stress among all generations (Cartwright-Stroupe and Shinners, 2021) . Practitioners must acknowledge the differences across generations to prepare for future contingencies. Whereas Gen Z were more distressed during the outbreak, those able to cope with the situation were able to leverage community involvement to boost their PsyCap. Together, these findings elucidate the importance of developing targeted community engagement strategies that take Gen Z's characteristics into account. For instance, since Gen Z is social and adept at handling technology (Turner, 2015) , developing community activities that reflect these characteristics is necessary to generate positive psychological outcomes as well as to reduce their stress.",

Our results showed that fans' life satisfaction did not increase by the direct effect of sport community involvement but PsyCap mediated to yield positive outcomes. Therefore, the promotion of a program that allows fans to learn and grow as well as be entertained will create a beneficial community . Furthermore, if practitioners or managers of the sport community can develop a program that leads Gen Z to become more involved and engaged, then the sport community will be able to play a positive role as a social connection for Gen Z in difficult times, such as during the pandemic.",

Specifically, a strategy that facilitates fan community activities in new communicational environments such as the metaverse and other virtual worlds can be effective to the younger generation (Lee et al., 2021) . Based on the self-expansion theory, virtual identities in stress-free environments could engage the younger generation seeking psychological revitalization and varieties. Technology-mediated objects and content such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and social memes disseminated through social media could be effective communication tools within sports fan communities. These methods can be applied not only to stress-sensitive members of Gen Z but also to their contemporaries with higher stress tolerances. Developing new content should include elements that Gen Z members can casually consume without being a stressor. For example, recent efforts by the NBA to use the metaverse as an additional viewing channel exemplifies how technology is being used to engage Gen Z fans. Aligning technology-based communication tactics with the current findings, Gen Z members' involvement in the online and offline communities warrants academic and managerial attention as such experiences can lead to more profound life satisfaction. Involved sport fans will not only merely participate in sports community activities but will acquire knowledge and share their experiences to co-create the community.",

In this regard, practitioners should devise strategies to address each of the conditions under which Gen Z members are expected to be undereither high or low levels of stress. Given that each member of Gen Z faces different levels of stress, customized direct contact messages, which are frequently used in professional sports promotions, may be an effective strategy. Now utilizing data analytic approaches dynamic contact algorithms acquire personal data through previous interactions and customize information based on individual users rather than generic audience characteristics. Such analytic solution provides practitioners with tailored approaches for each sports fan, engaging individuals with a customized selection of information and activities. Thus, practitioners can use such technology to deliver messages which will capture the attention of each individual Gen Z member and provide information while moderating or reducing their stress levels (i.e., pull strategy) rather than increasing stress as a spam message does (i.e., push strategy). Future studies could investigate algorithms to monitor and capture users' moods and distress.",

The generalizability of our findings may be limited to different communities, such as those based on celebrities, politics, race, or gender. In future studies, therefore, if we compare and analyze various contexts, we can reveal a wider scope of how community involvement affects an individual. Next, due to the participants in our study skewing toward males more than females, generalizing our findings may be limited. This may be problematic in that there can be gender differences in associations between community activity and its outcomes (Ferris et al., 2013) . We expect that a more valid result can be elicited by similarly examining the gender ratio; a more insightful result can be presented by comparing the differences between males and females. Lastly, generations other than Gen Z were not indicated in this study. Although the target generation of this study was Gen Z, various practical implications could be determined if other generations were investigated individually, as each generation has its own distinct characteristics (Seaman et al., 2018) . Therefore, we propose to categorize, compare, and analyze other generations in a follow-up study.",
