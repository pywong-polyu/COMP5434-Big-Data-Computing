Various epidemiological studies have been carried out to explore the spatial spread of COVID-19. Every country has been affected differently and has exhibited a unique pattern of incidence and mortality under the influence of many underlying factors. Temporal and spatial variation in the incidence rate of COVID-19 have produced the three distinctive high-rate clusters, initially China, then Western Europe, and finally the USA [2, 3] .",

Spatial analysis is essential to understanding the spatial spread of infection and its association with the community and environment, especially in the early stages of an outbreak [5] . The spatial and spatialtemporal proximity concept is deeply linked with the transmission of infectious diseases, since transmission rates are more likely to be high when people are near each other [6] . Spatial patterns of disease often suggest links between disease and potential risk factors of a geographic area [7] , and the analysis of such patterns can be traced back to the cholera epidemic in London in 1854, when John Snow mapped cholera-related deaths, which resulted in subsequent removal of handles from public water pumps on Broad Street [8] .",

Our current study will expand on the previous review and will further synthesize spatial studies of COVID-19. Our main objectives will be to: (1) review the use of spatial analysis tools and techniques in investigations of the geographic variation of the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential influencing factors (environmental, socio-economic, demographic, and healthcare-related); and (2) synthesize study results separately for three categories: disease mapping, exposure mapping, and spatial epidemiological modeling.",

Our review, by reflecting the application of most recent spatial techniques in visualization, exploration, and modeling of COVID-19, also showcased the most up-to-date trends in the field of health geography and spatial epidemiology. Cluster analysis through global and local Moran's I, hotspot analysis, interpolation, and space-time scan statistics were found to be the main spatial techniques used to analyze COVID-19 data. However, the use of all these techniques was determined by the availability of spatial and relevant attribute data. We conclude that disease mapping has been used by researchers not only to detect spatial and temporal distribution, clusters, and hotspots of COVID-19, but also to explore relationships of COVID-19 with other factors. Exposure mapping has revealed that poor living conditions, elderly population, limited access to health facilities, and high population density were key risk factors for COVID-19 infections. Spatial epidemiological modeling has been used to explore and confirm positive associations between above mentioned socio-demographic factors (e.g., population density, proportion of elderly residents, poverty) and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We maintain that there is a need for spatial studies in other geographic areas of the world, since current studies were mainly focused on Asia and the Americas. We also call for a wider availability of health data at a fine-scaled geographic resolution (to the extent allowed by data-privacy rights) in order to facilitate application of the most advanced spatial approaches.",

            "text": "Spatial methods in epidemiology help to elucidate the spatial distribution of population health and the locally specific causes, so that we know where to intervene to prevent disease and promote health. This is particularly important in the current pandemic, as global public health measures to contain the disease (hand washing, social distance, mask wearing) need to be combined with locally targeted health interventions. Healthgeographical approaches will continue to play a crucial role within the current pandemic and also beyond this crisis. ",
