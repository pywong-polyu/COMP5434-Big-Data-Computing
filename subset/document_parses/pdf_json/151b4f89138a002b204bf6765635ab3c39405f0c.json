There were no complaints of loss of taste, sore throat, cough, or respiratory distress. In his systemic examination, body temperature, pulse and respiratory rates were normal. There was widespread tenderness on abdominal palpation. WBC and sedimentation rates were normal, and CRP was high. Kidney and liver function tests including amylase were within normal limits. In radiology work-up, low-density pneumonia foci involving bilateral middle and lower zones were seen on thorax X-ray (Fig-1) and a ground-glass appearance specific to SARS-COV-2 infection (Fig-2) Providing anesthesia in pediatric population during the Covid-19 pandemic has its own unique challenges. Although the documented incidence of disease in children is lower, the high rate of asymptomatic carriers increases the risk of viral transmission to other patients and the healthcare team. The rates and severity of adverse perioperative outcomes in pediatric patients are less than in adults but are based on limited reported data. In a study summarizing 20 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of Covid-19 who underwent general anesthesia (3), it was found that 12 required emergency surgery and 9 patients had preoperative symptoms such as cough, fever, or diarrhea. It has been reported that 3 patients who required noninvasive ventilation postoperatively did not have any symptoms before surgery. One patient died as a result of small bowel necrosis secondary to intussusception and acute respiratory failure due to concurrent Covid-19 pneumonia (3).",

We decided to treat the patient medically because of the risks of general anesthesia and the difficulties of spinal anesthesia in children (4) .
