Based on the Medical Cyber-physical Systems (MCPS) concept, we construct a safe and reliable automatic anesthesia control closed-loop system. The control architecture uses the patient's propofol pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model, using the calculated results as a feedback signal to correct the model's uncertainties. During anesthesia, the bispectral index (BIS) level is used as a control variable to control the depth of anesthesia. The proposed control architecture can automatically adjust the infusion rate of anesthesia drugs without concussion or overshoot. The system adaptively adjusts the drug infusion rate to maintain the BIS level at a stable target value. We utilized MATLAB-Simulink to verify the effectiveness of this method, and the robustness test was carried out by adding noise blocks. At last, we analyze the simulation result of the average patient. In general, the proposed method achieves a stable and fast induction period during the maintenance phase of anesthesia with a good disturbance rejection.",

During the period of anesthesia, the anesthetist will adjust the dose of anesthetics according to the operation situation and the patient's vital signs [1] . However, due to the complexity of the clinical environment and the patient's differences, even experienced anesthetists are not immune to cardiovascular or neurological damage due to over administration of drugs or inadequate administration of drugs leading to intraoperative awareness. Ira Dhawan [2] counted the reports of relevant anesthesia cases from 1998 to 2011 and pointed out that the incidence of drug administration errors was 0.078%-0.75%, with the two most significant categories of errors involving incorrect doses (20%) and incorrect drugs (20%). Infusion pumps and other systems have not established effective feedback mechanisms with patient monitoring systems, which is also a problem to be solved urgently. We hope that there will be a way to achieve some degree of improvement in terms of anesthesia optimization and patient risk reduction.",

In addition, it is necessary to address the particular hazardous factor associated with infected patients caused by the COVID-19 outbreak [9] . At present, the computer mainly controls the drug infusion through the open-loop TCI system to control a stable anesthesia drug delivery rate. The TCI system primarily uses the pharmacokinetics or the plasma concentration prescribed by medical practitioners to simulate the aimed effect-site [10] . Nevertheless, the anesthetist just simply selects the initial target dose or intervention and then adjusts it by assessing the status of patients during surgery. Clinicians hypothesize the drug's impact on the patient according to monitoring results or experience. In contrast, the proposed closed-loop control system uses direct measurements from the anesthesia depth monitor to automatically regulate the infusion rate. It is much more reliable than the subjective judgment of the anesthetist.",

In the system, an infusion pump is used to infuse various medications. The sensors relay information about the patient's physiological dynamics. Patients are systems with complex dynamics. The anesthetist can inject the patient directly when needed, creating interference in the control system. The controller estimates and adjusts the drug dosage based on the patient's current status. The model should be adaptive and optimized online to ensure real-time performance. Patient safety is the most crucial consideration in the system. 3 shows the infusion pump drive module for cyber-physical interaction (injecting drugs into the human body).

The 13 th patient was a fictitious individual whose parameters were calculated from the algebraic average of other patient parameters. Fig.4 is a simulation of all 13 patients, showing the correlation between BIS output and effect-site compartment concentration. In clinical practice, the BIS level between 40 and 60 indicates the patient is in a better state of anesthesia, and the corresponding effect-site concentration is around 3 to 9. ",

The control protocol sets the desired BIS at first. A BIS value between 40-60 is usually optimal in clinical practice, so we fix the BIS level at 50. Fig.5 shows the control architecture, where d(t) is the deviation between the target and calculated concentrations. The control action u(t) is the infusion speed of propofol, and the result of the patient linear model is the estimated effect-site concentration Ce(t) of the patient. The output y(t) is the BIS level with noise interference added. The innovation signal i(t) is used to complement the deviation between the calculated result and the target value. We add noise blocks to represent the common BIS signal noise to verify the scheme's robustness. Therefore, we added two filters to the control scheme to deal with noise. The architecture we put forward can integrate the patient model into the control architecture to provide exceptional and personalized drug infusion. The calculation result is used as a feedback signal to obtain an appropriate drug infusion rate. Other parameters (Ce50, \u03b3 , Emax) are usually unknown except E0 can be measured when calculating BIS level, so we use the average parameters in Table 2 , which are derived from [18] . Eq.(5) expresses the inverse of the Hill function in the control architecture. To study the robustness of the controller, we added mutational interference to the BIS measurement to simulate external nociceptive stimuli. Noise can degrade the property of the architecture; for instance, it may cause a risk of slow or unstable responses. To solve the noise problem, we use two linear filters. The F1 filter pre-filters the BIS signal with the primary purpose of eliminating the potential disturbance with no free of affecting the system. The F2 filter deal with the tradeoff between system and noise filtering for innovative signal i(t). We use second-order low-pass filters for both filters:",
