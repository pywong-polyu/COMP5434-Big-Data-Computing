            "text": "Pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is related to epithelial expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) that plays a pivotal role in regulating viral entry. ACE2, a type 1 membrane-bound enzyme located in different epithelial tissues, is involved not only in blood pressure regulation by acting on the renin-angiotensin system, but it is also involved in inflammation and neuro-degeneration. 1 This relationship would be exerted by the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein, and requires cleavage by TMPRSS2 proteases. Testing ACE2 tissue specificity, Shafiee S et al. 1 reported a medium/high expression for respiratory nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, a medium expression for squamous oral epithelium, a medium/high expression for salivary glandular cells, and a medium expression for lymphatic/ squamous tonsillar cells. 1 With regard to ACE2 tissue expression, new studies reported conflicting results: Hikmet et al. 2 documented consistent localizations to non-respiratory subsites (gut microvilli), while no reliable data exist supporting any detectable expression in the lungs/respiratory epithelium. A high ACE2 expression was detected in esophagus cells and enterocytes, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate here, and this is consistent with the detection of viral RNA in stools and anal swab of COVID-19 patients.",

This is consistent with previous findings documenting that simultaneous infection with Mycoplasma species would enhance cytopathic effect in VeroE6 cells persistently infected with SARS-CoV. 8 This effect would be exerted by promoting apoptosis of surviving cells escaped from SARS-CoV-2-induced death, thus preventing the establishment of long-lasting infections. Given that airway colonization by Mycoplasma species is particularly frequent in pediatric age, with bacterial location within the pharynx and the mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue, it cannot be excluded that respiratory microbiota would modulate host susceptibly to SARS-CoV-2, possibly resulting in a reduced pathogenesis in children. The real action (immunologic/anatomic barrier? microbiota banking?) exerted by hypertrophic adenotonsillar tissue in determining clinical manifestations in children deserves further investigations.",
