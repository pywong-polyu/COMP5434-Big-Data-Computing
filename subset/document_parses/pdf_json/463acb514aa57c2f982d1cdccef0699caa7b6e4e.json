In our study, we decided to focus on the comparison of the vaccination outcomes in two EU states: Lithuania and Poland. They have a common border and common history, having functioned as one polity from the late 14th c. to the close of the 18th, when they both simultaneously lost statehood to stronger neighbours and afterwards jointly repeatedly fought for independence. To this day there is a Polish minority in Lithuania and a Lithuanian minority in Poland. Moreover, both countries share communist and post-communist history [1] [2] [3] [4] , comparable COVID-19-related morbidity [4, 5] , and proportion of the vaccines used in the W27-W43 period (Pfizer 58.5% for Lithuania and 56.3% for Poland, Janssen 34.9% and 42.8% respectively, Moderna 5.5% and 0.6%, AstraZeneca 1.1% and 0.3%), as well as originally very similar vaccination outcomes. However, the decision of the Lithuanian government in August 2021 to introduce, since September 13, new rules for the functioning of the so-called opportunity passport (galimybi\u0173 pasas) enabled us to gain a unique insight into the effectiveness of that measure and to isolate only one factor with potential impact on these outcomes. eating out: in 2019, the average inhabitant of Iceland spent EUR 4410 on restaurants and hotel stays, while the average Pole spent only EUR 310 [16] .",

Since 15 November 2021, Latvians with the certificate have had access to shops with shopping areas of over 1500 m 2 , adult education onsite and to church services, as well as to events of more than 500 participants. By contrast, those without the pass may only use small-size shops (with pharmacies, pet stores, hygiene stores, press vendors and gas stations excluded from restrictions), and they may visit religious sites only individually, for no longer than 15 min at a time [19] . The backdrop of tightened restrictions is the deteriorating pandemic situation in Latvia-the percentage of those vaccinated, 54% as of 31 October 2021, placed this country rather low in Europe-coupled with the fifth-lowest interest in getting vaccinated against COVID-19 in June-July 2021 among all the EU member states [20] .",

            "text": "The idea for such a passport in Lithuania was first announced in Lithuanian media in April 2021 [21] . It was planned as an electronic document, developed independently of a similar EU project (Digital Green Certificate), and issued to every Lithuanian citizen over 16 years of age who either completed the full COVID-19 vaccination cycle, recovered from the COVID-19 infection with a positive test result obtained no more than 180 days before or tested COVID-negative within the past 24 h. The original provisions enabled its owner to fully enjoy a social life, which at the time (April-May) meant chiefly visiting restaurants, caf\u00e9s, billiards clubs, escape rooms, bowling alleys, swimming pools, water parks and other sports facilities, as well as participating in concerts and similar cultural events. The document was eventually introduced on 24 May 2021. The main driving force behind this regulation, it seems, was the wish to support the national economy after some period of enforced stagnation by making it possible for restaurants or sports clubs to fully reopen and to organise cultural events. On 9 July 2021, the President of the Lithuanian Business Confederation Andrius Romanovskis proposed in social media to give employers the right to ask employees for a COVID-19 certificate [22] . On July 13, Prime Minister Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 revealed in an interview [23] that as the epidemiological situation in Lithuania was deteriorating, more activities might become available only with the \"opportunity passport\", especially considering that currently the slowest to vaccinate were the people aged 20-40, the most mobile and active group that should be the most interested in travelling and having fun. She did not rule out the government having \"to use some negative incentives to politely remind citizens that vaccination has additional benefits\".",

The impact had to be measured from the perspective of actually achieving a uniformly high vaccination rate over all former LAU1 sub-regions (380 \"powiats\" in Poland and 60 \"savivaldyb\u0117s\" in Lithuania) for the purpose of achieving herd immunity.",

Unfortunately, from 1 September 2021 onward ECDC data begin to diverge from the data of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland, as booster doses are counted as relating to new people receiving their first dose, which leads to serious discrepancy for those above 60. Lesser discrepancies should also affect other groups, as booster doses are also provided for healthcare workers and immunocompromised patients. Theoretically, the roll-out was at that moment covering people above 50, though in practice the waiting period of 6 months from the 2nd dose was mostly preventing big-scale vaccination with the 3rd dose of the 50-59 age bracket. To tackle this problem, additional data have been taken directly from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland, though it provides them in differently divided age brackets, which allows comparison for age groups 60-69 and above 70. Such analyses allow us to gauge the effectiveness of the vaccine mandate in the most vulnerable age groups. Moreover, this allows us to gauge the indirect impact of the vaccine passport on those who are not compelled to vaccinate because of being under 16: whether it encourages them by creating a social norm or discourages them by turning vaccination into a tedious, best-avoided legal requirement.",

As prior studies were showing that prior track record was a very strong predictor of subsequent vaccination increase, a correlation between prior vaccination rates and the percentage of the remaining people that got vaccinated has been calculated using Spearman's Rho with 95% confidence intervals, to be able to determine whether there has been any clear divergence.

When Germany is analysed in pre-unification borders, the gap between mostly former Eastern Bloc and the old EU becomes even more visible. Poland and Lithuania initially had very similar vaccination rates (cf. Figure 2) , and until 26 July 2021, the difference remained within a 3 p.p. band. From that moment onward the trajectories clearly diverged, with the new peak of the number of people receiving the first vaccination dose reached in Lithuania on 4 August 2021, even though the highly restrictive mandate was formally announced only on 11 August 2021 and came into force on 13 September 2021, with further but much slower increasing divergence.",

            "text": "We analysed the increase in the percentages of those vaccinated by age groups in Poland and in Lithuania in the period June 30-October 31. In this period, Lithuania was clearly leading in the increase of vaccination rate, which was much higher than in the baseline scenario for Poland. Nevertheless, the net gain (calculated in each age group as the difference between gain for Lithuania and that for Poland) over the Polish baseline that could be attributed to the mandate clearly differed for various age brackets. The biggest success of Lithuania's policy can be observed in the 15-17 age group, where the net gain was 16.5 p.p., even though the vaccine mandate in Lithuania actually concerned those at least 16 years old. In the 18-24 age bracket the net increase was 14.5 p.p., while among those aged 25-49 it was 13.8 p.p., and in the 50-59 age bracket-10.6 p.p. However, the net increase in the 60-69 group was 5.4 p.p. and only 3.0 p.p. for those over 70. Among the youngest, unaffected by the mandate, there has also been a net increase of 3.4 p.p., though the Polish level has not been reached. Taking from these data only the number of those initially unvaccinated who received their first dose in the analysed period, one can clearly see that Lithuania was more successful in all age brackets, though its advantage was not uniform. In the 10-14 group, not covered by the mandate, the increase was 10.6% in Lithuania and 7.4% in Poland. In the partially covered by the mandate 15-17 age group, the increase was 35.5% and 13.5% respectively. In the 18-24 age group, it was respectively 43.1% and 11.6%, among those aged 25-49: 45.1% and 12.0%, among those aged 50-59: 41.3% and 18.2%, while in the 60-69 age bracket it was 40.2% and 18.2%. However, in the most vulnerable 70+ age group, even though Lithuania was more successful, it achieved vaccination of only 20.3% of those remaining, while for Poland, which did not introduce any restrictions, it was 18.9%. As analysed in Table 1 , when OR was calculated for all age groups, both prior to and after vaccine mandate roll out, the differences were not only statistically significant but also confidence intervals were not overlapping, which shows that the divergence was a real phenomenon. Additionally, until June 30 in 3 age groups (10-14, 15-17 and 70+) Poland was in the lead, but after July 1 this trend was reversed. As of 30 June 2021, the average percentage of the population that received at least a single dose of the vaccine for former Polish LAU1 sub-regions was 46.7% (SD 6.4%), while for Lithuania it was 45.0% (SD 8.4%). Subsequently, by 31 October 2021, this rate grew to 55.2% (SD 6.7%) for Poland and to 65.5% (SD 8.9%) for Lithuania. In Poland, the average rate for the least vaccinated quantile of sub-regions increased from 32.8% to 41.1%, while in Lithuania-from 36.0% to 55.6%. In both cases, the initial success of vaccination roll out in each sub-region was a strong predictor of the percentage of remaining people who would receive a vaccine in a subsequent period, which is presented in Figure 3 . Spearman's correlation between those two values for Polish sub-regions was 0.942 (CI 95% 0.929-0.952), while for Lithuanian ones-0.764 (CI 95% 0.632-0.852). ",

Regardless whether one measured the overall result change of standard deviation of former LAU1 sub-regions, or the change among the lowest quantile, there was no clear change, as the uniformity of the increase was comparable. In both cases, there was a very tiny increase in the divergence between sub-regions. Interestingly, mandates raised the percentage of vaccinated people comparably, both in earlier successful and unsuccessful regions. Though one could have hoped that they would especially raise laggers, this was not the case. It is possible that in the already well-vaccinated municipalities there was a higher number of facilities with restricted access that made the mandate more motivating, though minor divergence was observed in Poland as well. So, it could have been simply that in some districts there had been a higher number of people still considering vaccination.",

Quite a uniform percentage of unvaccinated people deciding to get vaccinated would appear to suggest that it was simply the impact of restrictions and not some combination of factors where the mandate was merely the final straw. If we look at initial government assumptions, we could say that mandates were successful at achieving them, as in Lithuania vaccination rates reached 67.4% vis-\u00e0-vis 53.6% in Poland, so very near 70% that was theorised to be the level granting herd immunity, especially after including people who already recovered [31] [32] [33] .

Interestingly, the percentage of those willing to get vaccinated even among healthcare professions (and students), excluding medicine proper, may not be markedly higher than among respondents unrelated to any medical profession or study, which might indicate a low potential of one's professional or educational background to convince them to vaccinate [45] .

This fact cannot be explained solely by economic factors, as according to Eurostat eastern European countries already have comparable or even higher GDP per capita in PPP than poorer Mediterranean countries. Neither can this be explained by education, as UN PISA tests show the north-south divide rather than the effect of the Iron Curtain. Among the post-communist countries, we noted the lowest vaccination coverage in Romania and Bulgaria (Figure 1) , closely followed by Croatia, Slovakia, Poland, the former East Germany and Latvia, and by the somewhat higher levels of vaccination in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia and Lithuania.",

A case in point is Bulgaria, the lowest-performing EU state in COVID-19 vaccinations, which seems to have experienced inconsistent activity in the early phase of the pandemic when very low numbers of those infected were coupled with very strict COVID-19 security measures, abruptly lifted in the summer of 2020. This in turn is likely to have led to a grave underestimation of the danger in the autumn of that year, which ultimately resulted in an overburdened healthcare system and in one of the highest COVID-19 morbidity rates in the EU; the low levels of vaccine acceptance were further aggravated by poor coordination of vaccine supply at the peak moment of the societal interest in getting vaccinated [49] . Similar factors and a similar scenario appear to have been decisive in the case of Romania [49] , which, at the time of writing this, experiences the highest COVID-19 death toll in Europe, alongside Bulgaria and also Latvia, another poor vaccination outcome EU state [50] . By contrast, while the number of new (Delta variant) cases in Lithuania is soaring, its death rates, owing to relatively good vaccine uptakes due in turn to effective certificate-related incentives, are not as high. An additional factor in Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary might be the high share (7-10%) of the Roma population, characterised by low social inclusion, unsatisfactory access to healthcare and very low immunisation coverage levels even before the pandemic [51] .",

All these factors seemed to play a role, especially effective if combined, with the freedoms most attractive to the younger generation, and the provision of the vaccination service locally-to the elderly. Patterns of COVID-19 vaccination in Israel and how they relate to various incentives were studied by Saban et al. [53] , who found that those reluctant to vaccinate (especially young people) may be motivated by incentive schemes that impose restrictions, e.g., in access to social, cultural or sporting events, while a segment of society might also be encouraged by exemptions from quarantine.",

Its results enabled the creation of a profile of a typical opponent of vaccination: aged 25-35, from a larger household, and from a lower income bracket. By contrast, a typical person expressing willingness to vaccinate was found to be aged 45-64, from a smaller household (2 members), with higher income and education level, and also more closely exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., because of the past illness of a family member). The group of vaccine sceptics was more likely to include service, trade workers, manual workers, the unemployed, or housewives; they were more likely to express more conservative views, were less receptive to innovation, and less likely to know personally someone with a COVID-19 infection. According to the survey, Latvians and Estonians are more sceptical about COVID-19 vaccination than Lithuanians: 34% of respondents in Latvia and 31% in Estonia declared that they would definitely not get vaccinated, whereas 51% of Latvians and the same ratio of Estonians declared the wish to do so [55] .",

The \"stick\" might be e.g., dismissal from work, a ban on freely travelling, or on participation in cultural events. That type of motivation seems to appeal most to the younger segment of the population. The \"carrot\" is mostly financial (a lottery with prizes, a voucher worth EUR 10-20, small gifts). However, as many as 47% said that their views on vaccination would not be changed by any incentive. Our own aggregate data on the number of those vaccinated do not allow us to identify individual reasons for the ultimate decision to vaccinate, beyond the differences among age groups or place of residence. Nevertheless, the payment of EUR 100 to each Lithuanian resident aged 75 or more, vaccinated with two doses between 1 September and 30 November 2021, or to those 75+ Lithuanians who have accepted the third, booster dose by 31 March 2022 [57], may have proved the effectiveness of such a financial reward in the oldest group, in which the increase between June 30 and September 31 was considerable, despite not reaching yet the Polish levels for that age bracket.",
