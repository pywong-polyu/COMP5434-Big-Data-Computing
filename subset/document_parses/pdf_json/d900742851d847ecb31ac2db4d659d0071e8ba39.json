Many different products have been used to meet the demands of large-scale diagnostic and surveillance testing. The stability of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was assessed in several commercially produced transport media and an in-house solution. Coronavirus RNA was rapidly destroyed in the commercial transport media though the deleterious effects on intact virus were limited. Similar results were obtained for a Type A influenza virus. There was reduced detection of both virus and nucleic acid when a herpesvirus sample and purified DNA were tested. Collectively these data showed that the commercial viral transport media contained nucleases or similar substances and may seriously compromise diagnostic and epidemiological investigations.",

Almost all commercial batches of foetal bovine serum contain pestiviruses and at times other bovine viruses. In addition to the potential for there to be nucleases in the transport medium, the presence of these viruses and other extraneous nucleic acid in samples may compromise the interpretation of sequence data. The inclusion of foetal bovine serum presents a biosecurity risk for the movement of animal pathogens and renders these transport media unsuitable for animal disease diagnostic applications. While these transport media may be suitable for virus culture purposes, there could be misleading results if used for nucleic acid-based tests. Therefore, these products should be evaluated to ensure fitness for purpose.",

            "text": "For several decades a variety of medium solutions have been recommended to stabilise specimens for the detection of bacteria and viruses, particularly during diagnostic investigations. These have usually been based on balanced salt or saline solutions with a buffering capacity to maintain a \"near-neutral\" pH. To enhance the stability of viruses a spectrum of protein supplements has and continues to be recommended (1, 2, 3, 4) . While some laboratories have prepared viral transport medium (VTM) \"in house\", commercial preparations are used extensively and are often supplied as part of a sample collection kit with sterile swabs. Testing of samples by cultural methods meant that the emphasis of studies for the evaluation of these products originally focussed on the capacity of a preparation to maintain the infectivity of viruses at different temperatures while being held prior to and during transport and while being stored at the laboratory (5, 6) . With the widespread introduction of molecular based diagnostic assays, especially real time PCR (qPCR), studies have been undertaken to evaluate the stability of viruses in VTMs, particularly in commercially prepared products, while being held at a range of temperatures (7, 8, 9) . However, while thermal stability has been considered, generally little attention has been given to other characteristics of the VTM or the potential impact of endogenous components. One commercially available product is specifically designed to inactivate viruses and bacteria and contains components to inhibit the activity of nucleases that may be present in the sample (10, 11) . There are some other products that are recommended for use in molecular detection assays but the manufacturers provide no comment that these products are unlikely to be suitable for samples where virus culture will be attempted.",

            "text": "During large-scale disease epidemics there can be pressure placed on the capacity of manufacturers to supply transport media and, during a pandemic, supply-chain and manufacturing pressures can become prohibitive. During the current (2020) SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, there has been an acute shortage of VTM in Australia because of a combination of both local and international demand, the lack of a local manufacturer and partly because of reduced international airline flights to Australia. Consequently, many different VTMs and similar solutions have been used to meet the demand for transport media generated by large scale diagnostic and surveillance testing. After becoming aware of concerns of variable results in some assays, we initiated a preliminary study to compare the stability of SARS-Cov-2 RNA in several commercially available VTMs and an in-house product. When disturbing results were found in a preliminary SARS-CoV-2 study, the investigation was extended to examine whether there was also an adverse impact on qPCR results for other viruses. Also of concern are recommendations (3, 4) to include foetal bovine serum (fbs) as a source of protein to enhance the stabilising properties of VTMs. This report documents observations of the adverse impact of certain VTMs on real time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as on a Type A influenza virus and a herpesvirus and discuss the broader implications of the inclusion of foetal bovine serum as a protein supplement to VTMs.",

VTM-1 and PBS gave very similar results for the RNA samples. Again, no SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected in the dilutions prepared in VTMs 2-4. Consequently, a further set of dilutions ( Table 2 , Samples 1-3) were prepared in each solution to test whether there was any adverse effect on higher concentrations of RNA. SARS-Cov-2 RNA was not detected in any dilution prepared in VTM-2 and very weak reactivity (approaching the assays limit of detection) was observed for VTM-3 and VTM-4 in the sample with the highest concentration of RNA. In contrast, samples diluted in PBS and VTM-1 gave almost identical results, with a Ct value of approximately 21 for the highest RNA concentration. This difference between the PBS/VTM-1 result and the results for the other VTMs represents a reduction in analytical sensitivity of approximately 6 log10 for the detection of free SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The results for the XIPC were again highly reproducible and similar for each dilution in each solution, confirming the high efficiency of RNA extraction and no apparent impact of PCR inhibitors. ",

As the detection of the XIPC was not affected, we propose that these results provide unequivocal evidence of the presence of a nuclease(s) or similar substance in these VTMs. The impact on these samples was rapid as all samples were extracted within one hour of preparation yet no RNA was detected in a sample that was estimated to contain more than 3000 copies of viral RNA in a 5uL sample. The same result was obtained with assays that were directed at 3 different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The results obtained for the virus samples that were diluted to similar concentrations as the RNA samples and held for the same time period also support this hypothesis because it is expected that these samples contained a high proportion of intact nucleocapsids that offered protection to the viral RNA. The same trends were observed with the Influenza A virus RNA and presumptively intact virions. Although the effects on the herpesvirus samples were less pronounced, nevertheless there was some impact on both purified DNA and whole virus.",

            "text": "It is also important to recognise that these observations reflect the outcome of contact between viral nucleic acid and VTM for less than 1 hour in each instance. The levels of nucleic acid that were destroyed after almost immediate addition to the VTMs were not insignificant. With a concentration of RNA that gave a Ct value of approximately 21 in both PBS and VTM-1, this represents a reduction of approximately ten thousand-fold and cannot be ignored. While it might be argued that the adverse impact on whole virus appeared to be slight, free nucleic acid and perhaps whole virus was destroyed at levels that could be of diagnostic relevance (20) . While the impact on RNA viral genomes is likely to be markedly greater than on DNA sequences, the outcome cannot be predicted as secondary structure may also have an influence (20) and the speed and severity of the impact may vary depending on the nucleic acid target, as shown by the differences between the results for the two RNA viruses and the XIPC. Further, it cannot be assumed that the target nucleic acid will always be protected by nucleoprotein. Degradation will occur during the course of an infection and also under conditions where sample collection, transport and storage are sub-optimal. Additionally, the adverse effects observed in this study could potentially be exacerbated with alternative nucleic acid purification technologies that take longer than the 20 minutes required for this magnetic-bead based method. While undertaking surveillance and epidemiological tracing during a pandemic, failure to detect a moderate level of RNA in a person who is asymptomatic could result in a critical source of infection remaining undetected. However, with the selection of an appropriate transport medium, sample degradation, even at room temperature, can be minimal. This is clearly shown by the performance of the 'in house' medium (VTM-1) where there is little evidence of deterioration of the RNA samples after holding at room temperature for 2 days and no significant deterioration of virus when held at 4 o C for more than 6 weeks.",

We believe that, while this is an essential feature of a high quality VTM, it is in achieving this requirement that the current problem with the commercially available VTMs may have arisen. Our 'in house' VTM includes gelatin which is extracted from animal tissues by treatment at very low or high pH, and prolonged boiling at high temperatures before sterilisation and drying. These steps inactivate both enzymes and infectious agents that are present as well as destroying residual nucleic acid. Further, during the preparation of VTM-1, the PBS solution to which the gelatin has already been added is also sterilised by heat treatment. In contrast, products that include bovine serum albumen or other serum-derived components, such as VTMs 2, 3 and 4, cannot be sterilised by autoclaving without coagulation of the protein supplement. Therefore, for these VTMs, the raw materials must each be free of nucleases and proteinases prior to sterilisation by methods that do not include heating.",

A moderate concentration of BVDV viral RNA (Ct=30.6, data not included) was detected in VTM-4. As whole genome nucleic acid sequencing is now often undertaken on many original, uncultured patient samples, the presence of these viruses and other extraneous nucleic acid in samples may reduce the sensitivity of sequencing protocols and complicate the interpretation of sequence data. The nucleases present may also have an impact on the quantity of RNA available for sequencing.
