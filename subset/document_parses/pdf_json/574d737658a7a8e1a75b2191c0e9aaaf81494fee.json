As the epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei Province has been hit hardest, accounting for over 83% of all the confirmed cases in China [1] . More than 40 000 healthcare personnel (HCP) from around the country rushed to Hubei, working around the clock with local HCP in the public health intervention, diagnosis and treatment, patient care, field investigation, samples testing and sterilization [2] .",

Some hospitals in Hubei had to reduce the replacement of critical PPE.

It is laudable that the central government has attached great importance to protecting the health of HCP and has taken a number of immediate actions [3] , such as improved guidance on the proper use of PPE, strengthened logistics and medical supplies, and enhanced disinfection at the hotels where HCP stay. In addition, an emergency surveillance system is now in place to monitor all exposed HCP, contributing to prompt detection, effective triage, and isolation of infected HCP. A special medical expert group is making every effort to diagnose and treat medical staff of suspected and confirmed infection. In addition, a special health and life insurance fund is set up for all HCP working in the frontline at both national and provincial levels [4] . All of these are conducive to ensuring the confidence and efficiency of the HCP, but more needs to be done for further protection of their occupational health in the long run.",

Public health schools should be given more support within medical education system and all medical students should receive regular theoretical courses and practical training of public health, including the knowledge and skills to deal with large scale health emergencies, such as COVID-19. Standard guidelines and procedures should be in place to detect infectious diseases at an early stage, to timely announce the pathogens, transmission paths, diagnosis, and treatment among HCP. Furthermore, improvement in professional development as essential part of continuous medical education at all public health and medical institutions is another critical step toward reducing infection rate among healthcare workers. HCP, regardless of the disciplines they are in, should have routine emergency drills for infectious diseases, receive professional development periodically in the protection from occupational hazards. Especially, medical staff related to the handling of infectious diseases should be well trained to properly use PPEs, and continuing education certificate can be mandatory for key HCP or staff members in all medical institutions. In addition, easy access to mental health service for HCP should be available throughout their career journey, especially during the time of crisis when they need for anxiety and stress relief.",

Yet, the COVID-19 outbreak alerts us that a carefully planned stockpile of PPE and other essentials is key to effective infectious disease preparedness and to the optimal function of HCP [6] . An epidemic can affect a broad population, hence the availability and appropriate use of PPE, such as N95 respirators, face masks, gowns, and gloves, are crucial to protecting the health of HCP [7] . While it is very difficult to predict an outbreak of widespread epidemic, all the healthcare facilities should stockpile a certain amount of critical PPE to ensure an adequate supply at the onset. In addition, it is also important to set up a centralized and coordinated network of emergent PPE supply among central and local governments, healthcare facilities, and medical equipment, so as to meet the demand for consumable and durable supplies when a wide spread epidemic lasts long.",
