Here, we analyze the effect of efficient cooperative immigrants on a population playing public goods games. We considered a population structured on a square lattice with individuals playing public goods games with their neighbors. The demographics are determined by stochastic birth, death, and migration. The strategies spread through imitation dynamics. Our model shows that cooperation among natives can emerge due to social contagion of good role-model agents that can provide better quality public goods. Only a small fraction of efficient cooperators, among immigrants, is enough to trigger cooperation across the native population. We see that native cooperation achieves its peak at moderate values of immigration rate. Such efficient immigrant cooperators act as nucleation centers for the growth of cooperative clusters, that eventually dominate defection.",

Thus, different areas have explored this matter, and there is extensive literature focused on the emergence of cooperation (e.g. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] ). Because the environmental pressure is creating urgent demands for more altruism, a highly welcomed kind of immigrant turns out to be the cooperative one. Super-cooperative immigrants could even create a positive synergistic environment, promoting cooperation among natives. Some famous examples are humanitarian organizations such as the Red Cross, the World Food Program, and the Doctors Without Borders among many others [19, 20] . Those organizations send human resources to aid developing communities as well as places hit by disasters or civil wars. Such initiatives can strongly act as seeds for widespread cooperation, even when the so said super-cooperators are not permanent immigrants. For immigrants who move permanently into a community, several empirical studies suggest that their presence may help boost innovation and benefit such community [21] [22] [23] .",

Typically, n individuals are asked to invest a fixed resource amount of c to a common pool.

The multiplication factor quantifies how efficiently individual resources aggregate to create public goods. This may depend on the resource quality of each contribution or the agent's capacity to increase the value of the common pool. Because defectors -individuals that do no contribute -earn more than cooperators, they become wealthier, and cooperation does not thrive.

The population is structured on a square lattice and the demographics are determined by stochastic birth, death, and migration. Only the immigrants can adopt the efficient cooperation strategy. The strategies spread through imitation dynamics, such that the strategies yielding higher payoffs spread at higher rates [33] . Here, we show that cooperation among natives reaches a peak at moderate migration rates and that even a small fraction of cooperation among the immigrants is enough to boost native cooperation. We also note that while the group size variation can promote cooperation by itself when the group is smaller than the multiplicative factor [41] , here the efficient cooperators have a multiplicative factor greater than the group size, turning, at least for the efficient cooperators, the investment option into the most profitable decision. However, when the payoff of the efficient cooperators is compared to that of the defectors in a single game, defectors always win. The effect of demographic parameters is discussed. Our results suggest that closing borders, to avoid exploitation by non-natives, may be counter-productive, because the positive spillover can be greater than the harms of the potential exploitation. In the next sections, we describe the model, analyze the results and provide an overall discussion of our work.",

Notice that the regular and the efficient cooperators can be both seen as individuals whose actions are classified as cooperation. Next, we describe the demographic part of the model. Another individual and one of its nearest neighbor sites are randomly selected. If that neighbor site is empty, the selected individual reproduces with probability \u03b2.

As r increases, cooperative clusters become more and more stable in a sea of defectors, until they can survive. For our model, simulations show that cooperation is extincted for r < 3.4. When r is that low, the benefits from clustering are not enough to face the defectors. However, if efficient cooperative immigrants are allowed into the society, i.e. \u00b5 > 0, even if they come along with defecting immigrants, the native cooperation can be sustained. This can be seen in Fig. 1a , where we present the equilibrium density of native cooperators, C 0 , as a function of the super-cooperator's efficiency, \u03b1, and the immigration coefficient, \u00b5, in a heat map. We set r = 3, a value where cooperation would be extinct without immigration, so as to understand the effects of efficient cooperators in the dynamics. Notice that C 0 is the number of native cooperators in the system normalized by the system size. Surely, the solution where the native population is, for the most part, replaced by efficient cooperative immigrants is trivial (high \u00b5 and \u03b1). Instead, ideally one wants to promote local cooperation through a minimal amount of incentives. Hence, allowing just a small fraction of immigrants from highly cooperative societies may create a sustainable environment even for native cooperation. This scenario corresponds to the bright red region of the heat map, where we see a small fraction of super-cooperative immigrants being able to greatly boost the native cooperation. Note that there is also a minimum level of efficiency required to promote native cooperation. This can be seen in the black region of Fig. 1a , where no matter how large \u00b5 is, native cooperation never emerges.",

In Fig. 1b , we show the equi-librium density of native cooperators as a function of the immigration coefficient, \u00b5, for fixed values of efficiency, \u03b1. First, it is clear that \u03b1 certainly impacts the outcome. The greater the efficiency of the super-cooperators the higher is the cooperation peak and the lower is the immigration coefficient needed for cooperation to reach such a peak. In other words, for a given efficiency level, there is an optimal immigration coefficient that generates a maximum amount of native cooperation. Let \u00b5 cmax be the value of the immigration coefficient at which the peak of the native cooperators density, C Fig. 1c as functions of 1/\u03b1. For visual simplicity, the behaviors of \u00b5 cmax and C (max) 0 are consider separately. Interestingly, C (max) 0 presents a linear decrease with 1/\u03b1, tending to its maximum value, C (max) 0 \u2243 0.87, when \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e. Additionally, the immigration coefficient decreases more rapidly with \u03b1 than the respective increase in C (max) 0 , reaching its minimum value, \u00b5 cmax \u2243 0.0156, when \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e. In other words, there must be a minimum influx of immigrants for native cooperation to reach a maximum, even when the cooperative immigrants are infinitely efficient. We stress that this tendency is observed for simulations with finite size lattices, but it is observed for all parameters examined. Also, the existence of an upper bound for C (max) 0 that is not equal to unity establishes that, when there is immigration, native cooperators are never able to completely dominate the system. Such limitation is related to native cooperators having to share the space with, at least, the incoming immigrants.

The subsequent decrease in C 0 comes from the competition for space. If more immigrants arrive, the competition for space increases, and efficient immigrants become more abundant than native cooperators, as shown in Fig. 2 .

Because of that, efficient cooperators, e, act as nucleation centers for the formation of native cooperation clusters. As e is able to provide a better quality contribution, the initial clusters grow sustainably. We stress that this is an emergent phenomenon, where agents self-organize as cooperators around these centers. Therefore, the rapid increase in the native cooperators population for small p e (Fig. 3) comes from the formation of c 0 clusters around the new nucleation centers arriving more frequently as p e increases. Figures 4c and 4d , discussed below, show a couple of examples that illustrate such formation process. This rapid increase happens until the p e fraction is enough to allow all cooperation clusters to percolate. After that, the further increase is due to the few small defector clusters that will be outcompeted. Also, native cooperators are being generated through reproduction, which increases with the number of e in the system.",

The efficient cooperators will initially act as nucleation centers for the formation of native cooperation clusters. However, because reproduction is less frequent than immigration, the population ends up with more immigrants (e) than native cooperators. A typical scenario for this configuration is shown in Fig. 4a .

Comparing both situations, we see that some increase in \u03b2, when it is way smaller than \u00b5/\u03c1 a , may turn the beneficial effect of e more effective, as can be seen in Fig. 4b , where \u03b2 = 0.11. However, if reproduction is way more frequent than immigration, and empty sites are too rare, d 0 tends to dominate the system. Those results indicate that there are optimum combinations of the immigration and the reproduction coefficients for the success of native cooperators.

The peak of native cooperation is observed in all cases. However, the higher the \u03b2, the less pronounced the peak is. The reason is that at high \u03b2 replacement by reproduction and death becomes more important than immigration, as discussed in the last paragraph. Interestingly, the system that is most close to its caring capacity, Fig. 5a , has the highest peak of native cooperators. These results indicate that if the demographics are more stable, the cooperation clusters are also more stable and can resist defection.

We show that moderate immigration can promote a peak of cooperation among natives in our model. Our main result suggests that a population in a context that is not favorable for cooperation may greatly benefit from the arrival of just a small fraction of supper cooperative immigrants. This is so because when only a few immigrants arrive they act as nucleation centers for native cooperation, influencing defectors to cooperate. The presence of a few efficient cooperators increases the effective multiplicative factor of the few public goods centered around the efficient cooperators, which is enough to increase the power of the cooperative clusters. This boosts local cooperation, which radiates to the population. However, the native cooperation increases only up to a certain level, beyond which the effect of more immigrants is to decrease the number of native cooperators, who compete with immigrants for space.",

However, because there can be many defectors among the immigrants, it is still remarkable that cooperation thrives. On the other extreme, when reproduction and death are way more frequent than immigration, defectors become more common. Despite that, the small influx of efficient cooperators is still able to prevent defectors from dominating the entire system.",

However, only a few works analyze the impact of the arrival of new individuals, born somewhere else, to the native community [49, 50] . These works focus on the issues related to the population capacity to receive immigrants and the immigrants' adaptability to the new society but do not take into account the possible benefits the immigrants' diversity and skills may bring to the native community. Here we study how super-cooperative immigrants could benefit the native society through the diversity they introduce into the system. We stress that this is a simplified model if compared to real-world immigration, a very complex phenomenon, depending on culture, economics, politics, and many other aspects. Nevertheless, here we aim at an analysis of the emergence of cooperation in a competitive scenario including just the minimal amount of mechanisms to model immigration in a simplified way. This approach highlights the most important aspects of an emergent phenomenon. The proposed model, although based on human migration, can also be further expanded to understand animal migration and individual exchanges between groups with different cooperative traits.",

The figure shows native defectors (red), native cooperators (blue), efficient cooperative immigrants (green), immigrant defectors (orange), immigrant cooperators (light blue), and vacant sites (black). Increasing \u03b2 means increasing the probability of birth and death events in comparison to immigration events. Note that v represents vacant sites.

Because systems with different \u03b3 values have different occupation densities, \u03c1a, we choose to use a relative density for native cooperators, \u03c1c = C0/\u03c1a, in order to compare the results. In a, \u03b3 = 0.005 and the system is almost at its carrying capacity. For b and c, \u03b3 = 0.1 and \u03b3 = 0.2, respectively. For those last values, the number of death events is higher, which generates more available space for immigrants. In all 3 cases the efficiency coefficient considered is \u03b1 = 4, while pe = 0.5. The dashed line separates the region where cooperators, in general, are the majority (below the line), while the grey thin line delimits the area where natives are more frequent (above the line).
