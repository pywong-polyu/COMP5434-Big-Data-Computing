The purpose of this study is to investigate how hope, self-compassion, and perception of COVID-19 health risks influence parenting stress. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 362 parents living in the United States completed an online survey in July 2020. Multiple regression analyses revealed that higher levels of hope are related to lower levels of parenting stress. On the other hand, lower levels of self-compassion as indicated by higher scores on the subscales of isolation, self-judgment, and overidentification are related to higher levels of parenting stress. Further, testing positive for the coronavirus is positively related to parenting stress, whereas the belief that COVID-19 is a serious disease is negatively related to parenting stress. Findings also revealed the significant role of hope in moderating the relation between self-compassion and parenting stress. This study highlights the importance of nurturing and drawing from one's own psychological resources to mitigate parenting stress, particularly in the context of a chronic source of stress like a pandemic. Implications for the counseling profession are discussed.",

Aside from examining its physiological health risks, researchers have also started identifying the effects of the pandemic on families' mental health and well-being. Although the majority of the population from all sectors of society have been impacted by the pandemic, parents and caregivers face unique, and possibly greater challenges with increased caregiving and household responsibilities, increasing vulnerability to stress. Recent studies that explored the parenting experience during the pandemic found a host of negative mental health outcomes and undesirable parenting behaviors related to parenting stress (Gadermann et al., 2021; Goldberg et al., 2021; Horiuchi et al., 2020; Mikolajczak & Roskam, 2020; Miller et al., 2020; Weaver & Swank, 2021) . Given the pandemic's enormous toll on parents, as well as the limited access to support systems and other external resources, family counselors will benefit from identifying resources to assist clients who are parents in maximizing their own psychological resources to moderate the negative effects of stress on their parenting and well-being.",

Families are interdependent systems where what is occurring for one member of the family, such as stress and concern or changes in schooling, impacts the family as a whole, including dynamics and challenges (Ackerman, 1984; Kerr & Bowen, 1988 ). Yet families are goal-oriented systems that try to maintain equilibrium in the face of internal or external challenges and changes, trying to maintain existing boundaries and patterns. Ideally, family members must work together to make decisions and solve problems through communication and feedback loops to seek a balance between the changes and maintaining stability (Olson, 2000; Whitchurch & Constantine, 1993) .",

Some sources of parenting stress include family structure (e.g., number of children), employment demands and work stress, child temperament and problematic behaviors, household income (Schneewind et al., 2012; Warfield, 2005) , as well as everyday tasks of parenthood (Crnic & Low, 1995) .",

In fact, in a survey of more than 3,000 adults in the United States, 71% responded managing distance learning is contributing to parenting stress (APA, 2020). The increased time of necessary parental supervision is especially difficult for employed parents who also had to deal with working remotely from home (Chung et al., 2020) , as work and school hours greatly overlap. In addition, because there were also disruptions in childcare arrangements and other services and programs catering to children (Lee et al., 2021) , parents are burdened by additional responsibilities without additional support. In all, adults with children were found to report more stress compared to adults with no children during the COVID-19 pandemic (APA, 2020; Goldberg et al., 2021) .",

Self-kindness acknowledges the interconnectedness of suffering as a part of the human experience. On the contrary, self-judgment increases negative feelings of isolation and abnormality. Humans are biologically social beings, and while self-kindness enhances benevolence towards the self, common humanity shines a light on the importance of the social connectedness fundamental to the human condition (Germer & Neff, 2019 ). Finally, to be self-compassionate we must recognize when feelings of pain arise. When attended to with a balanced awareness of mindfulness, we receptively pay attention to the present moment without judgment and can acknowledge that feelings of suffering exist without denying, resisting, or repressing them. Further, mindfully attending to our painful feelings encourages the separation of negative affect from interfering with how we view ourselves (Germer & Neff, 2019) .",

Although having a parenting partner is usually considered as an asset or a buffer against parenting stress (Solem et al., 2011; Webster-Stratton, 1989) , it is plausible that the disruption in home and work set-up, caused by COVID-19 at the time of data collection, as well as the overall anxiety toward the pandemic, may result to more conflict or stress in the relationship (Luetke et al., 2020) , and this can ultimately affect the parenting realm.",

Although this may sound counterintuitive, we offer a plausible explanation for this finding. Although the subscale of common humanity did not significantly relate to parenting stress in the current study, common humanity emphasizes acknowledgment of the collective human experience of suffering, and these parents' stress may be lowered because of their recognition that they are not alone in their parenting experience and transitions imposed by the pandemic. Therefore, for parents who consider COVID-19 as a serious disease, there may be more understanding of the challenges brought about by the pandemic, as well as support for safety guidelines and restrictions imposed by businesses and the government. This understanding and acceptance may leave less room for doubt and stress. The current dataset did not allow us to test for this, however, so it is recommended that future research further examine this conjecture.",

Parents engaging in selfjudgment may have negative self-talk, such as, \"I'm a horrible parent,\" and \"I'm a failure as a parent.\" Cognitive-behavioral strategies that identify and adjust maladaptive thought patterns can specifically reduce self-judgment. Self-judgment may be replaced with self-kindness and a kind and encouraging internal dialogue. Beyond solely ending self-criticism, self-kindness entails responding to ourselves as we would to a beloved friend or family member. By offering care, comfort, and nurturance, family members can develop skills to console themselves before moving to problem-solving, protecting, and fixing (Germer & Neff, 2019) . For example, self-kindness includes compassionate self-talk such as, \"This is really hard right now. I can take a break and care for myself in the moment.\" In the context of family counseling, teaching self-kindness to multiple members of the family will reap even greater benefits for the individuals as well as the family system.",

Parents engaging in overidentification may ruminate and exaggerate their suffering. For example, a parent might believe, \"I'm a total disappointment to my children.\" Counselors can assist parents by replacing overidentification with mindfulness. Mindful attention to the present experience and not engaging in exaggeration nor judgment of thoughts and feelings. Like self-kindness, mindfulness requires the courage to avoid immediately fixing and problem-solving and instead of recognizing the emotions that arise (Germer & Neff, 2019) . For example, \"That was a difficult naptime and I'm frustrated and exhausted.\" Promoting self-kindness and mindfulness strategies in family counseling can enhance the psychological flexibility necessary to manage a quickly changing environment (Weaver & Swank, 2021) .",

First, with data collected within a single timepoint and the correlational nature of the study, we are not able to establish temporal precedence. As such, we cannot make conclusions about the direction of the relations among the variables. Second, the alphas for the subscales of the SCS are relatively low. This scale is well established and have shown excellent validity and reliability estimates in previous studies (Neff, 2003) , but it is possible that the low alphas were due to having fewer items on each subscale (4-5 items; Peterson, 1994) . Also, we suspect that the timing and context of the pandemic when data was collected may have some influence on the participants' responses on the self-compassion items. Lastly, as the data was collected during the early phase of the pandemic, we cannot generalize the findings and it is plausible that the responses on the measures we administered may have been different as the COVID-19 cases increased or decreased in different parts of the country.",
