It is implicit in the work drawn together under this rubric that enrolling the power of climate science is essential for planetary health, and even that more intensive use of science is a prerequisite for achieving global social justice. There is, too, a suggestion that science needs translation to be made more \"usable\" for purposes of policy action. All these presumptions bear questioning in the light of the ambiguous history of climate decisionmaking over the past half-century. In particular, we need to query the term \"climate science\" to form a clearer picture of how it advances (or does not) the coupling of knowledge and justice.",

At once historical and predictive, the IPCC reports have underscored the suddenness and severity of the changes occurring in the Earth's physical and biological systems: among them, sea level rise, extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and mass extinctions. This knowledge is already sufficiently \"usable\" in the minds of many actors around the world, as exemplified in the modern-day children's crusades led by Thunberg and the plaintiffs in lawsuits such as Juliana v. United States. For all the hundreds of thousands who have taken to the streets worldwide to demand immediate climate action, science has already spoken clearly enough: there is no need to make it yet more usable.",

Indeed, the most pronounced manifestations, whether through direct action such as XR's or through official policy at levels of government from the international to the municipal, are in the regions that have historically contributed most to the problem through their greenhouse gas emissions: that is, Europe and North America. These are also the regions where one sees the bulk of leading-edge climate science, pointing to intimate connections between knowledge generation and political awakening. At the September 2019 UN General Assembly meeting, for example, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reappointed UN Special Envoy on Climate Change in February 2021, called attention to the increasing role of non-state actors in leading climate action. He noted that, even in the USA, a country often seen as erratic or lagging on climate change, policy activism cuts across scales and sectors: \"A growing number of U.S. cities, and states, and businesses have committed to reaching net-zero emissions. These states would by themselves form the world's fourth-largest economy.\"",

What sorts of climate research are needed to advance the cause of justice, and how can one ensure that such research, if done, will be heeded-or used-by policymakers? One widely accepted answer is to say that the causes of climate change are now so thoroughly understood that scientists should focus more of their energies on impacts. This, at first glance, seems a reasonable proposition. Justice, after all, requires us to pinpoint with greater accuracy how the burdens of an unstable climate might fall on diverse populations, with what discrepant welfare effects.

This line of work allows scientists to assess the likelihood of a connection between climate change and \"natural\" disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires or extreme flooding. In principle, better attribution could serve as a first step toward allocating responsibility, especially if impacts fall disproportionately on marginal populations. Yet, attribution science is only a starting point. On its own, it says little about who will be affected, how much, and with what consequences for social order. The social sciences of vulnerability and resilience might enable us to craft more equitable policies than more refined natural science studies of different aspects of climate phenomena. A turn toward questions of distribution and vulnerability would be consistent with the position I advocated in my 2003 article on \"technologies of humility.\" But this too may not get to the heart of the question: are the sciences we are generating useful for a just world?",

Many leading research universities have heeded the call for usable climate science and initiated research programs that aim to pull together cross-disciplinary strengths across the natural and social sciences. To date, however, efforts in the global North remain decidedly tilted toward finding engineering solutions to climate problems. An ambitious example is Cambridge Zero, an initiative by the University of Cambridge (UK), announced in late 2019, not only to develop greener technologies but to \"harness the full power of the University's research and policy expertise, developing solutions that work for our lives, our society and our economy.\" Yet, a glance at the contributing centers shows that the impulse to know has not engaged all of the university's intellectual resources. It remains more concentrated on technical problems and material solutions than on the normative questions posed by climate change. There was to start with little explicit role for history, philosophy, or science and technology studies (STS), among other humanistic fields.

Geared toward producing specific results, such research is utilitarian by definition and there is little reason to worry that breakthroughs, if any, will not be taken up by governments anxious to protect their polities against grave and immediate harms. The greater concern is that the very appeal of such promissory research will make for less critical review and uptake, with marginalized populations once again least likely to be able to voice their objections in time. Precisely, such reasoning led to wide mobilization among scientists and indigenous groups who successfully lobbied the Swedish Space Agency to cancel SCoPEx (Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment).

Numerous organizations, such as Future Earth, have taken it upon themselves to extend the IPCC's baby steps through more ambitious efforts at what is sometimes called the co-production of knowledge. Future Earth proposes four principles to improve the likely efficacy of such processes: they should be context-based, pluralistic, goal-oriented, and interactive.",

That quandary centers on a very different understanding of what knowledge production entails as a social matter: not simply the construction of agreed-upon facts with respect to preordained goals, but a more complex, multivalent exercise, in which the purposes of knowledge-making are up for grabs at the same time as more bounded debates on methods or the weight of the evidence for and against particular positions. Co-production as understood by STS scholars problematizes the goals of fact-finding along with the means of making facts. That dual questioning defines a fluid space of inquiry that cannot be made tractable through simple \"pluralism\" (who, after all, belongs at the table when we don't know what the table is?) or \"interaction\" (to what ends, if we do not agree which ends are desirable?).",

Climate science, in particular, radically disrupts people's understanding of what gives their lives meaning, shape, and worth. By redefining ourselves as a planetary collective that has wrought potentially irreversible changes in all of Earth's functioning systems, climate science has dislocated how we previously understood and positioned ourselves in terms of place, time, economics, and politics (Jasanoff 2010) . These disruptions necessarily have a bearing on people's sense of justice, whether because of increased vulnerability to climate effects, ruptures in existing lifestyles, or a demand for nearterm sacrifices to benefit distant communities not of one's own kind. Future generations are a prime example. I met a villager in India once, in the late twentieth century, who asked how he could save trees for people not yet born when he could not find ways to feed his own children and grandchildren. What answer could climate science give him, and how might any of the IPCC's vast reserves of knowledge be translated into forms that such a person might find useful?",

Evidence of such a reaction can be found in Martin Mahony's case study of the Himalayan glacier controversy. The conflict originated in a dispute between Indian glaciologists and the IPCC about what proved to be an error in the latter's 4 th Assessment Report, claiming that Himalayan glaciers were rapidly receding and would disappear by 2035. One consequence of the dispute, Mahony found, was to kindle a sense in India of the close relationship between epistemic and political sovereignty, spurring the creation of a new national expert body, the Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment. Indeed, then environment minister Jairam Ramesh was quoted making the co-productionist point that climate science is politics by other means (Mahony 2014) . One could see this as a moment of cosmopolitan knowledge-making, in which the Indian state recognized that its autonomy demanded, in effect, that it had to be the author of its own climate knowledge. Letting outsiders control how to know local terrains and conditions, such as glaciers and monsoons, was a recipe for ceding some control over the nation's future.",

Such a move, they argued, would justly differentiate the \"luxury emissions\" of the rich from the \"subsistence emissions\" of the poor. The IPCC ignored this plea, not through malice, but because of its culturally conditioned inability to see greenhouse gases as anything but \"natural\" and its oft-stated commitment to separating science from policy-in a textbook example of what STS calls boundary work. Numbers, on this view, must be objective and untouched by politics to be just, and this requires that they be seen to stand apart from politics. The result, as we have seen, was that the IPCC over several decades produced quantitative science that was eminently usable in the eyes of knowledgeconsumers and climate activists in Northern nations. As already stated, it energized First World youth to demand climate policy that takes their futures explicitly into account. But was the IPCC's vision of an apolitical science also seen as science for justice to serve the world? Many said no, and many still do-whether through denial of the science, as among America's fossil-fuel advocates, or through calls for decoupling the obligation to control emissions from national emissions levels under the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.",

Here, too, STS offers some analytic resources for understanding what makes the esoteric knowledge of bench science persuasive to wider communities.

A dramatic illustration in the Covid-19 era is the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy, a widespread reluctance to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, despite repeated expert assurances that this treatment is safe, highly effective, and the most important defense we have against yet more lethal variants emerging.

Second, the science of how the climate works will not move societies to action in and of itself; one needs symmetrical attention to why societies trust, or do not trust, the makers and interpreters of that science. In short, the quantitative, aggregative approaches that have characterized mainstream climate research need to be supplemented by critical, interpretive work that traces the deep structures connecting people's sense of justice with the ways in which the sciences have represented their world. And, third, knowing the climate system inside out in scientific terms will never be sufficient to illuminate what ideas of global social justice are abroad in the world, what histories gave rise to them, and how they link to people's hopes and fears about the long-term future of their species and their Earth.",
