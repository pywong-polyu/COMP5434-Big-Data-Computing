            "text": "Chromatin accessibility mapping is a powerful approach to identify potential regulatory elements. In the popular ATAC-seq method, Tn5 transposase inserts sequencing adapters into accessible DNA ('tagmentation'). CUT&Tag is a tagmentation-based epigenomic profiling method in which antibody tethering of Tn5 to a chromatin epitope of interest profiles specific chromatin features in small samples and single cells. Here we show that by simply modifying the tagmentation conditions for histone H3K4me2/3 CUT&Tag, antibody-tethered tagmentation of accessible DNA sites is redirected to produce accessible DNA maps that are indistinguishable from the best ATAC-seq maps. Thus, DNA accessibility maps can be produced in parallel with CUT&Tag maps of other epitopes with all steps from nuclei to amplified sequencing-ready libraries performed in single PCR tubes in the laboratory or on a home workbench. As H3K4 methylation is produced by transcription at promoters and enhancers, our method identifies transcription-coupled accessible regulatory sites.",

            "text": "Identification of DNA accessibility in the chromatin landscape has been used to infer active transcription ever since the seminal description of DNaseI hypersensitivity by Weintraub and Groudine more than 40 years ago (1) . Because nucleosomes occupy most of the eukaryotic chromatin landscape and regulatory elements are mostly free of nucleosomes when they are active, DNA accessibility mapping can potentially identify active regulatory elements genome-wide. Several additional strategies have been introduced to identify regulatory elements by DNA accessibility mapping, including digestion with Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) (2) or restriction enzymes (3), DNA methylation (4), physical fragmentation (5) and transposon insertion (6) . With the advent of genome-scale mapping platforms, beginning with microarrays and later short-read DNA sequencing, mapping regulatory elements based on DNaseI hypersensitivity became routine (7, 8) . Later innovations included FAIRE (9) and Sono-Seq (10) , based on physical fragmentation and differential recovery of cross-linked chromatin, and ATAC-seq (11) , based on preferential insertion of the Tn5 transposase. The speed and simplicity of ATAC-seq, in which the cut-and-paste transposition reaction inserts sequencing adapters in the most accessible genomic regions (tagmentation), has led to its widespread adoption in many laboratories for mapping presumed regulatory elements.",

Furthermore accessibility is not all-or-none, with the median difference between an accessible and a non-accessible site in DNA estimated to be only ~20%, with no sites completely accessible or inaccessible in a population of cells (12, 13) . Despite these uncertainties, DNA accessibility mapping has successfully predicted the locations of active gene enhancers and promoters genome-wide, with excellent correspondence between methods based on very different strategies (14) . This is likely because DNA accessibility mapping strategies rely on the fact that nucleosomes have evolved to repress transcription by blocking sites of preinitiation complex formation and transcription factor binding (15) , and so creating and maintaining a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) is a pre-requisite for promoter and enhancer function.",

The rationale for this mapping strategy is that the enzymes that modify histone tails and the chaperones that deposit nucleosome subunits are most active close to the sites of initiation of transcription, which typically occurs bidirectionally at both gene promoters and enhancers to produce stable mRNAs and unstable enhancer RNAs. Although the marks left behind by active transcriptional initiation \"point back\" to the NDR, this cause-effect connection between the NDR and the histone marks is only by inference (16) , and direct evidence is lacking that a histone mark is associated with an NDR.",

We provide evidence that reducing the ionic concentration during tagmentation preferentially attracts Tn5 tethered to the H3K4me2 histone modification via a Protein A/G fusion to the nearby NDR, shifting the site of tagmentation from nucleosomes bordering the NDR to the NDR itself. Practically all transcription-coupled accessible sites correspond to ATAC-seq sites and vice-versa, and lie upstream of paused RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII). \"CUTAC\" (Cleavage Under Targeted Accessible Chromatin) is conveniently performed in parallel with ordinary CUT&Tag, producing accessible site maps from low cell numbers with signal-to-noise as good as or better than the best ATAC-seq datasets.",

We previously introduced CUT&RUN, a modification of Laemmli's Chromatin Immunocleavage (ChIC) method (17) , in which a fusion protein between Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) and Protein A (pA-MNase) binds sites of antibody binding in nuclei or permeabilized cells bound to magnetic beads. Activation of MNase with Ca ++ results in targeted cleavage releasing the antibody-bound fragment into the supernatant for paired-end DNA sequencing. More recently, we substituted the Tn5 transposase for MNase in a modified CUT&RUN protocol, such that addition of Mg ++ results in a cutand-paste \"tagmentation\" reaction, in which sequencing adapters are integrated around sites of antibody binding (18) . In CUT&Tag, DNA purification is followed by PCR amplification, eliminating the end-polishing and ligation steps required for sequencing library preparation in CUT&RUN. Like CUT&RUN, CUT&Tag requires relatively little input material, and the low backgrounds permit low sequencing depths to sensitively map chromatin features.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted this CUT&Tag-direct protocol for implementation with minimal equipment and space requirements that uses no toxic reagents, so that it can be performed conveniently and safely on a home workbench (Fig. S1) . To ascertain the ability of our CUT&Tag-direct protocol to produce DNA sequencing libraries at home with data quality comparable to those produced in the laboratory, we used frozen aliquots of native human K562 cell nuclei prepared in the laboratory and profiled there using the streamlined single-tube protocol. Aliquots of nuclei were thawed and serially diluted in Wash buffer from ~60,000 down to ~60 starting cells, where the average yield of nuclei was ~50%. We used antibodies to H3K4me3, which preferentially marks nucleosomes immediately downstream of active promoters, and H3K27me3, which marks nucleosomes within broad domains of Polycomb-dependent silencing. Aliquots of nuclei were taken home and stored in a kitchen freezer, then thawed and diluted at home and profiled for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. In both the laboratory and at home we performed all steps in groups of 16 or 32 samples over the course of a single day through the post-PCR clean-up step, treating all samples the same regardless of cell numbers. Whether produced at home or in the lab, all final barcoded sample libraries underwent the same quality control, equimolar pooling, and final SPRI bead clean-up steps in the laboratory prior to DNA sequencing.

We used either rapid 20-fold dilution with a prewarmed solution of 2 mM or 5 mM MgCl2 or removal of the pAG-Tn5 incubation solution and addition of 50 \u00b5L 10 mM TAPS pH8.5, 5 mM MgCl2. All other steps in the protocol followed our CUT&Tag-direct protocol (19) (Fig. 2) . Tapestation capillary gel electrophoresis of the final libraries revealed that after a 20 minute incubation the effect of low-salt tagmentation on H3K4me2 CUT&Tag samples was a marked reduction in the oligo-nucleosome ladder with an increase in faster migrating fragments (Fig. 3A) . CUT&Tag profiles using antibodies to most chromatin epitopes in the dilution protocol showed either little change or elevated levels of non-specific background tagmentation that obscured the targeted signal ( Fig.  S2) , as expected considering that we had omitted the high-salt wash step needed to remove unbound pAG-Tn5. Strikingly, under low-salt conditions, high-resolution profiles of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 showed that the broad nucleosomal distribution of CUT&Tag around promoters for these two modifications was mostly replaced by single narrow peaks (Figs. 3B, S3-S4A-B).",

However, we noticed that the peak narrowed further if following the stringent wash lowsalt tagmentation we included a small amount of pAG-Tn5 and incubation was extended from 20 min to 1 hr ( Fig. 3D \"Addback\").

            "text": "Salt ions compete with protein-DNA binding and so we suppose that tagmentation in low salt resulted in increased binding of epitope-tethered Tn5 to a nearby NDR and then tagmentation. As H3K4 methylation is deposited in a gradient of tri-to di-to monomethylation downstream of the +1 nucleosome from the transcriptional start site (TSS) (20) , we reasoned that the closer proximity of di-and tri-methylated nucleosomes to the NDR than mono-methylated nucleosomes resulted in preferential proximitydependent \"capture\" of Tn5. Consistent with this interpretation, we observed that the shift from broad to more peaky NDR profiles and heatmaps by H3K4me2 low-salt tagmentation was enhanced by addition of 1,6-hexanediol, a strongly polar aliphatic alcohol, and by 10% dimethylformamide, a strongly polar amide, both of which enhance chromatin accessibility (Figs. 3E-F, S4C-D) . NDRfocused tagmentation persisted even in the presence of both strongly polar compounds at 55 o C. Enhanced localization by chromatin-disrupting conditions suggests improved access of H3K4me2-tethered Tn5 to nearby holes in the chromatin landscape during low-salt tagmentation. Localization to NDRs is more precise for small (\u2264120 bp) than large (>120) tagmented fragments, and by resolving more closely spaced peaks increases the number of peaks called (Figs. 3D, S5-S6). CUT&Tag low-salt tagmentation fragments coincide with ATAC-seq sites. Using CUT&Tag, we previously showed that most ATAC-seq sites are flanked by H3K4me2-marked nucleosomes in K562 cells (18) . However, lining up ATAC-seq datasets over peaks called using H3K4me2 CUT&Tag data showed smeary heatmaps, reflecting the broad distribution of peak calls over nucleosome positions flanking NDRs (Fig. 4A) . In contrast, alignment of ATAC-seq datasets over peaks called using low-salt tagmented CUT&Tag data produced narrow heatmap patterns for the vast majority of peaks (Fig. 4B) . We confirmed these observations by the reciprocal comparisons, aligning H3K4me2 CUT&Tag and CUTAC datasets over peaks called from Omni-ATAC data (Fig. 4C) . To reflect the close similarities between fragments released by H3K4me2-tethered low-salt tagmentation as by ATAC-seq using untethered Tn5, we will refer to low-salt H3K4me2/3 CUT&Tag tagmentation as Cleavage Under Targeted Accessible Chromatin (CUTAC).",

Using a window of 250 bp around the peak summit based on average peak width at half-height, we found ~50% overlap between ENCODE ATAC-seq peaks and peaks called from either Omni-ATAC (50.0%) or CUTAC (51.3%) data. This equivalence between H3K4me2 CUTAC and Omni-ATAC when compared to ENCODE ATAC-seq implies that CUTAC and Omni-ATAC are indistinguishable in detecting the same chromatin features. This conclusion does not hold for H3K4me3 CUTAC, because similar alignment of ENCODE ATAC-seq data resulted in only ~75% peak occupancy (Fig. 4D) , which we attribute to the greater enrichment of H3K4me3 around promoters than enhancers relative to H3K4me2.",

CUTAC is relatively insensitive to tagmentation times, with similar numbers of peaks and similar FRiP values for samples tagmented for 5, 20 and 60 minutes (Fig. 5A) . We attribute the robustness of CUT&Tag and CUTAC to the tethering of Tn5 to specific chromatin epitopes, so that when tagmentation goes to completion there is little untethered Tn5 that would increase background levels. When we measured peak numbers and FRiP values for ATAC-seq for K562 data deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) from multiple laboratories, we observed a wide range of data quality (Fig. 5B , even from very recent submissions (Fig. S5) . We attribute this variability to the difficulty of avoiding background tagmention by excess free Tn5 in ATAC-seq protocols and subsequent release of non-specific nucleosomal fragments (26).

However, the processes that are responsible for creating gaps in the nucleosome landscape are not completely understood. In part this uncertainty is attributable to variations in nucleosome positioning within a population of mammalian cells such that there is only a ~20% median difference in absolute DNA accessibility between DNaseI hypersensitive sites and nonhypersensitive sites genome-wide (12) . This suggests that DNA accessibility is not the primary determinant of gene regulation, and contradicts the popular characterization of accessible DNA sites as \"open\" and the lack of accessibility as \"closed\". Moreover, there are multiple dynamic processes that can result in nucleosome depletion, including transcription, nucleosome remodeling, transcription factor binding, and replication, so that the identification of a presumed regulatory element by chromatin accessibility mapping leaves open the question as to how accessibility was established and maintained. Our CUTAC mapping method now provides a physical link between a transcription-coupled process and DNA hyperaccessibility by showing that anchoring of Tn5 to a nucleosome mark laid down by transcriptional events immediately downstream identifies sites that are indistinguishable from the best ATAC-seq sites. The equivalence of CUTAC and ATAC at both enhancers and promoters provides support for the hypothesis that these regulatory elements are characterized by the same regulatory architecture (31, 32).",

            "text": "The mechanistic basis for asserting that H3K4 methylation is a transcription-coupled event is well-established (20) . In all eukaryotes, H3K4 methylation is catalyzed by COMPASS/SET1 and related enzyme complexes, which associate with the Cterminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNAPII when Serine-5 of the tandemly repetitive heptad repeat of the CTD is phosphorylated following transcription initiation. The enrichment of dimethylated and trimethylated forms of H3K4 is presumably the result of exposure of the H3 tail to SET1/MLL during RNAPII stalling just downstream of the TSS, so that these modifications are coupled to the onset of transcription. Therefore, our demonstration that Tn5 tethered to H3K4me2/3 histone tail residues efficiently tagments accessible sites, implies that accessibility at regulatory elements is created by events immediately following transcription initiation. This mechanistic interpretation is supported by the mapping of CUTAC sites just upstream of RNAPII, and is consistent with the recent demonstration that PRO-seq data can be used to accurately impute \"active\" histone modifications (16) . Thus CUTAC identifies active promoters and enhancers that produce enhancer RNAs, which might help explain why ~95% of ATAC-seq peaks are detected by CUTAC and vice-versa ( Fig. 5B-C) .",

Although H3K4me2 CUT&Tag datasets have lower background than CUTAC datasets run in parallel, the combination of the two provides both highest data quality (CUT&Tag) and precise mapping (CUTAC) using the same H3K4me2 antibody.
