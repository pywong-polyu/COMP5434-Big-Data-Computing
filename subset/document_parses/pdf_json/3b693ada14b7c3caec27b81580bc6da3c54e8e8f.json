            "text": "First-generation vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been administered to more than 60% of the population in developed countries. However, the monovalent vaccines currently available in Europe do not confer adequate and durable immune protection. To satisfy the need for a novel vaccine, we engineered a divalent gene construct consisting of the receptor binding domain (RBD, 300-685 aa) of the spike protein and the immunodominant region of the nucleocapsid (100-300 aa). This fusion protein was cloned into a pET-30a plasmid and expressed either in Escherichia coli or in a recombinant baculovirus in insect cells. Following purification via its His-tag, the fusion protein was mixed with adjuvant, and administered to mice in a prime-booster-mode. Upon testing for IgG antibody response against nucleocapsid and RBD, a titer of 10 -4 -10 -5 was demonstrated 14 days after the first booster injection in 72% of the animals, which could be increased to 100% by a second booster. Notably, comparable IgG responses were detected against the delta, gamma and omicron variants of the RBD region. Durability testing revealed the presence of IgG beyond 90 days. In addition, granzyme A and perforin mRNA expression (cytolytic effector cell molecules) was increased in cytotoxic lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. Ex vivo stimulation of T-cells by nucleocapsid and RBD peptides showed antigen-specific upregulation of CD44 in vaccinated mice among their CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells. No sideeffect was documented in the central nervous system, be it either endothelial inflammation or neuronal damage. Cumulatively, the combined induction of B-cell and T-cell response by a bivalent protein-based vaccine directed against two structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins represents a proof-of-principle approach alternative to existing mRNA vaccination strategies, which could confer long-lasting immunity against all known viral strains.",

Both the mRNA-based (Jackson, Anderson et al., 2020 , Mulligan, Lyke et al., 2020 and protein-based (Guebre-Xabier, Patel et al., 2020) vaccines are effective in humans. Further protein-based designs at a preclinical stage of development promise superior safety and efficacy, at least in animal models (Watterson, Wijesundara et al., 2021) . However, there has been and continues to be a growing concern that existing and emerging virus mutants may escape currently-available vaccine-induced immunity (Mostaghimi, Valdez et al., 2021) . Although vaccinated individuals infected with the delta or omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 have a lower infectious viral titer (IVT) than non-vaccinated individuals (Puhach, Adea et al., 2022) , the spread of these variants is very rapid, despite high rates of vaccination using mRNA or vector vaccines encoding the spike protein alone. Therefore, proposals have been made to include other SARS-CoV-2 proteins known to generate high antibody titers and T-cell responses (Ahlen, Frelin et al., 2020 , Dutta, Mazumdar et al., 2020 .",

As a result, nucleocapsid detection is an effective means to screen infected individuals even before the onset of symptoms (Diao, Wen et al., 2020 , particularly because antibody production against this protein is rapid and abundant (Burbelo, Riedo et al., 2020 , Guo, Ren et al., 2020 . The 100-300 aa region of the nucleocapsid induces the highest antibody titer in humans (Smits, Hern\u00e1ndez-Carralero et al., 2021) , which is attributed to its octapeptide structure homologous to the four hyperendemic seasonal coronaviruses (Pajenda, Kapps et al., 2021) . Epitope profiling of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with cross-reactivity to seasonal coronaviruses (Ladner, Henson et al., 2021) together with experimental data showing that an antibody against the nucleocapsid can protect mice from lethal infection with a hepatitis virus (Nakanaga, Yamanouchi et al., 1986) highlight the conceptual and technical potential of targeting this protein epitope. In addition, recent work in hamsters showed that immunization with attenuated intracellular replicating bacterium-vectored vaccines protects from the typical disease pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Jia, Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al., 2021) .",

Since conformation-specific antibody responses may be important in immune defense against SARS-CoV2, recombinant proteins generated in eukaryotic systems are the tools of choice. This is significant because the RBD domain has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel \u00df-fold with strands and loops connecting its \u00df-strands. This fold could be resolved by crystallography of the RBD produced in Hi5 insect cells (Lan, Ge et al., 2020) . There are 9 cysteines in this region, 8 of which are involved in disulfide bond formation in order to generate the ACE-2 binding structure. Here, we show that insect bioreactor systems could also be amenable to producing vaccine backbones. Particularly, our molecular design incorporates 8 cysteines from the RBD region (300-685 aa), thus likely stabilizing the ternary structure of the protein to increase its recognition by the host's immune system, a feature likely contributing to a near-maximal immune response already at the second booster stage. In contrast, relatively limited emphasis has been directed towards the welltranscribed nucleocapsid protein in presently pursued SARS-CoV2 vaccine strategies in Europe and beyond, even if the nucleocapsid of other coronaviruses was earlier recognized for its immunogenicity (Boots, Kusters et al., 1991) . This lack of interest is surprising since 11% of human CD4+ T-cells and 12% of CD8+ T-cells recognize the nucleocapsid in individuals with SARS-CoV2 infection (Grifoni, Weiskopf et al., 2020) , supporting its immunogenic potential to generate potent immunoprotection by expanding surveillance to cellular branches of defense in humans.",

The fact that high immunogenicity is detected even after 90 days in a mouse immunization model with near-equivalent efficacy against the alpha, delta and omicron strains when measuring the end-titer gives confidence in the correctness of this design strategy. Immunological analysis of lymphocytes harvested from the spleen of immunized animals showed a significant T-cell response as indicated by the significant upregulation of granzyme A and perforin, cytotoxic granule effector molecules, in peripheral lymphocytes. An increased expression of CD44 upon N-and S-specific peptide stimulation ex vivo demonstrated the generation of T-cells capable of executing cellular protection and production of interleucins (Tian, Patel et al., 2021) .",

Accordingly, the adoptive transfer of T-cells into immunodeficient mice led to rapid recovery after the transfer of SARS-CoV-specific effector cells (Zhao, Zhao et al., 2009) . Similar results are seen in ferrets, in which neutralizing antibodies do not fully protect against SARS-CoV2-induced disease. Instead, nasal immunity, which is reliant on T-cell responses together with the presence of antibodies, seems to carry optimal protection (See, Petric et al., 2008) . Notably, nucleocapsid-related B-cell immunity has also been shown earlier , Pajenda et al., 2021 , Shrock, Fujimura et al., 2020 , and even served as a diagnostic tool because the detection of nucleocapsid-specific IgG in conjunction with RBDspecific IgG differentiated SARS-CoV2 exposure from a pure mRNA-based vaccine response.",

The original construct (engineered pET-30a/VieVac) has been used as template. The PCR conditions were as: 95\u00b0C for denaturing, 58\u00b0C for 30 sec annealing and 72\u00b0C for 2 min synthesis with 30 cycles. The resultant PCR amplicon was ligated into the pEntry/D-TOPO vector by incubation at 24\u00b0C for 1h. The resultant plasmid was transfected into One Shot TOP10 chemically competent E. coli",
