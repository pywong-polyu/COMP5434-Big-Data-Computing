            "text": "In the earliest years of the AIDS epidemic, when effective treatments were non-existent, public health leaders focused on the importance of consistent and correct condom use as one of the primary strategies to prevent the sexual transmission of the virus. A critical component of those efforts entailed surveys and studies among key target populations to assess the frequency of using condoms and to better understand the variables and circumstances associated with their use. Collecting information from sexually active gay men [2] , heterosexual men and women presenting for STD clinic services [3] , women seeking contraceptive care [4] , and women living in inner-city public housing developments [5] helped to identify potential avenues for intervention, including: improving ready access to condoms, addressing negative attitudes about condoms and their use, developing condom negotiation skills, and creating strategies to enhance partners' acceptance of condoms. Given the age of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., less than 1 year old at the time of this writing), the lack of a robust literature on the variables associated with face mask usage is not altogether surprising. Gallup, an American analytics and advisory company, has been measuring US adults' use of face masks since April 2020; their July 2020 assessment indicates than less than half (44%) of US adults report \"always\" wearing a mask outside their home [6] . This same assessment revealed that women, persons identifying as Democrats and those living in the Northeastern U.S. were most likely to always use a mask in public. Variables influencing the use of face masks are likely to change over time-indeed, the U.S. President's recent endorsement of face masks was associated with a significant increase in their support among members of his political party [7] . Therefore, it will be necessary to continually assess the frequency of this protective behavior among key target populations and in areas prone to community spread of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, ongoing assessments will need to become more finely tuned in order to unravel the demographic, attitudinal and situational factors associated with face mask usage. As is evident when one reviews the formative literature on condom use to prevent HIV, such nuanced information will be necessary in order to inform intervention development.",

In part, this confusion derives from changing recommendations about mask use, both in the U.S. and elsewhere [10, 11] . Initially, facial coverings were not recommended for the general public. Now, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that \"people wear cloth face coverings in public settings and when around people who don't live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain\" [12] . In large part, these temporal variations in recommended mask guidance stem from the expanding knowledge base related to both SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as the efficacy of face masks in preventing viral transmission. Although legitimate questions remain about the overall prevention effectiveness of mask wearing at a population level-especially when considering its impact on other prevention strategies such as social distancing [13] -emerging evidence provides support for policies calling for masking in public as a means of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [14] [15] [16] .",

Here, too, our nation's response to the AIDS epidemic provides an exemplar. Granted, the absence of both the world wide web and our now nearly ubiquitous social media made for a very different communication landscape in the first decade of the U.S. AIDS epidemic. However, responding to our, then, novel epidemic, the federal government invested in a variety of strategies to spread accurate information about AIDS. A National AIDS Hotline was established in February 1983 and provided toll-free, live information specialists to answer questions about AIDS twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week [17] . In 1987, CDC implemented \"America Responds to AIDS\"-described as both a public information and social marketing campaign, designed to disseminate \"accurate and timely information via multiple communication channels and vehicles\" [18] . And in 1988, CDC mailed a seven page informational booklet, \"Understanding AIDS,\" to every household in the United States; special mailings were made to reach the military, Americans assigned abroad, prisoners, persons in juvenile detention facilities and those living in homeless shelters [19] . Among the topics addressed in the booklet were: \"How Do you Get AIDS?\"; \"What Behavior Puts You at Risk?\"; and \"What is All the Talk about Condoms?\". The section on condoms stated unambiguously that \"condoms are the best preventive measure against AIDS besides not having sex\" and provided basic information about proper condom use [20] .",

As we learned during the HIV/ AIDS epidemic, prevention interventions must be tailored to the circumstances and needs of their specific audiences. Therefore, even as we continue to invest in vaccine development and other biomedical solutions to the pandemic, responding to the current threat of SARS-CoV-2 and preparing for future pandemics of respiratory pathogens, requires that we support behavioral science research to inform the development of other prevention interventions, including consistent face mask use.",

These variations may result from a host of influences ranging from alterations in individual risk perception to shifts in the socio-economic milieu. Consequently, it becomes necessary to monitor trends in prevention behaviors so as to determine the continued relevance and effectiveness of prevention strategies. In the HIV realm, data from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System [28] and other population-based longitudinal surveys [29, 30] have been used to monitor trends in condom use and other prevention practices, so as to inform the development of prevention policy and to identify needed modifications to existing prevention messages and strategies.",

Despite substantial differences between the two viruses and the diseases that they cause, reviewing the national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic makes a strong case for the importance of developing comprehensive, well-funded and long-term strategies when faced with the threat of an expanding epidemic. As demonstrated by the select examples provided in this commentary, the federal government's efforts to promote condom use to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV required sustained investments into the development of surveillance systems to monitor the behavior, behavioral research studies to identify targets for intervention, communication channels to disseminate accurate information and community-based programs to promote \"safer sex\" and to provide ready access to condoms and other prevention services. These systems did not develop immediately nor were they solely the province of federal planners; leaders from academia, state and local government and advocates from affected communities had a substantial role in creating and shaping these efforts [33] . Nonetheless, without the necessary resources and support at the federal level, it is unlikely that they would have developed in a consistent and comprehensive manner across the United States.",

Making state and local governments solely responsible for addressing this need-especially at a time of looming budget shortfalls [34] -is sure to result in an inadequate and uneven prevention response. Certainly, the immediate and immense economic [35] and social issues (when and how best to re-open schools, for example) engendered by this pandemic can often overshadow concerns that are seemingly less consequential, such as how to promote prevention practices like consistent face mask use. And at a time when so much of the national focus is, understandably, centered on the development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, this concern may appear to be of secondary importance. To that point, the National Institutes of Health's recent \"NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Research\" states that \"NIH will support studies on preventive treatments, behavioral and community prevention practices,\" but makes no specific mention of funding behavioral research studies to help us better understand the variables that influence the consistent use of face masks in community settings [36] .",
