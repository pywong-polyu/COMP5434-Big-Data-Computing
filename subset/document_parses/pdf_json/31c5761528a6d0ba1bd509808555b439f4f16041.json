The seriousness of this illness quickly became apparent with the emergence of many cases with serious and catastrophic morbidity and mortality. The human toll climbed to tens of millions infected and more than a million deaths worldwide before the end of the year. General awareness of serious mental health consequences associated with COVID-19 followed, and within just a few months, the academic literature swelled with articles describing mental health outcomes, including 3504 articles from a PubMed search on 27 November 2020 using the terms \"COVID-19\" and \"mental health\". Thus commenced the most deadly pandemic in more than a century, overwhelming efforts to respond effectively by public health authorities and clinical and academic professionals.",

For example, people who are located in Houston or Los Angeles or London would not be directly exposed to a disaster that happens far away such as in New York City, as in the 11 September 2001 attacks that occurred there. The most obvious way to be exposed to a traumatic event is by being directly endangered, such as being in a motor vehicle accident, being shot or stabbed, or falling off a cliff. Such exposures may lead to both physical injuries and psychological sequelae. Other types of exposure such as witnessing trauma to others from a safe location or learning of a traumatic event experienced by a loved one, of course, do not result in physical injuries to oneself (only to others) but could, nevertheless, have emotional and psychological consequences [32] . It should also be noted that not everyone who experiences a disaster is necessarily exposed to trauma in that disaster. For example, a person's city might be destroyed by massive flooding without that individual being personally exposed directly or indirectly to injury or endangerment or being a direct witness to it.",

This mixing of exposure and trauma in criterion A also separated the introduction of exposure from the subsequent description of the four exposure types (criteria A1-A4) by the definition of trauma placed between them.

For example, PTSD cannot occur with exposure to a non-traumatic stressor, nor can it occur in a person who is geographically distant from a mass casualty incident involving victims unknown to the person. Erroneous conflation of trauma and exposure to it can lead to enormous practical public health consequences. For example, unwarranted attribution of symptoms to PTSD in large trauma-unexposed populations can lead to overestimation of population prevalence of PTSD on the order of 10 times the magnitude and potentially millions of cases [2, 39, 40] .

Thus, naturally occurring illnesses, including medically severe and even immediately life-threatening acute heart attacks and strokes, do not qualify as trauma for a diagnosis of PTSD given this constraint. Unfortunately, a complete delineation of the types of events that qualify as trauma was not provided in the actual criteria; the accompanying text description listed a few examples buried in the descriptions of exposure types, and none of the examples were naturally occurring illness (other than two noteworthy, stated exceptions: sudden and catastrophic hemorrhage of one's child and anaphylactic shock). However, the diagnostic criteria for traumatic events qualifying for indirect exposure through close family members or close friends state that they are restricted to events that are \"violent or accidental\" (p. 271) [32] .",

The COVID-19 pandemic also generated important secondary stressors in the form of economic, social, and recreational losses that included closures of businesses and loss of jobs, curtailed opportunities to socialize with friends and loved ones, and discontinuation of many of life's usual pleasurable or meaningful activities [43] , further augmenting the severity and the breadth of the pandemic on affected populations.",

The reported findings of COVID-19-related post-traumatic stress (PTSD, \"probable\" PTSD, post-traumatic stress symptoms and syndromes) in the published COVID-19 literature are not consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic convention. Because the COVID-19 studies measuring posttraumatic stress have nosological problems in the conceptualization of trauma, it follows that the post-traumatic stress syndromes and symptom outcomes reported in these articles do not technically conform to DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. Five of the 25 studies summarized in the current article acknowledged methodological limitations in the assessment of post-traumatic stress symptoms using self-report symptom measures that do not provide diagnostic assessment of PTSD [13, 18, 22, 24, 44] . This is an important methodological problem that has been well established in the research literature [45] . One article acknowledged inability to distinguish new (incident) stress symptoms from pre-existing stress symptoms in its research methods [20] , and one study acknowledged the use of a symptom measure not referenced to the COVID-19 experience [25] , further departing from the identification of mental health outcomes related to the pandemic. None of these studies considered that the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD do not include naturally occurring medical illnesses such as a viral infection as representing a qualifying traumatic event, and reference to the pandemic was generally broader than the specific aspect of viral exposure. One article curiously concluded that its results \"suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could be considered as a traumatic event\" (p. 1) based on its findings of subjective mental health effects, inconsistent with the stated DSM-5 exclusion of naturally occurring medical illness as a qualifying trauma [25] .",

Samples of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 illness were all clearly exposed to COVID-19. In the general population studies, very few individuals likely had SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection, an assumption based on the small fractions of general populations worldwide known to have been exposed or infected (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html). Most of the COVID-19 studies of general populations reported far higher proportions with COVID-19-related \"post-traumatic stress\" in their samples than the proportions with known SARS-CoV-2 exposures, indicating conceptual problems in the research design and reporting. In the COVID-19 studies of healthcare workers, the exposure status of the workers was likely mixed and more complex. For healthcare workers, when personal protective equipment (PPE) is used and it functions properly, the worker wearing it is not bodily exposed to the virus, which stops, as intended, outside the PPE. Only when the PPE is not used, is not used properly, or fails is the worker physically exposed to the virus. Because the virus is imperceptible, healthcare workers may not be able to discern personal exposure to the virus unless they test positive for it or develop COVID-19 illness symptoms. The proportions of healthcare workers who were personally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in caring for patients with COVID-19 illness in these studies are unknown and may have been diminutive, creating further validity problems.",

Until the contact is known to carry the virus, an exposure cannot be determined and thus the incident technically cannot be classified as an actual exposure). More severe exposure may be experienced in higher levels respectively among individuals testing positive for infection with the virus but not becoming symptomatic. Among those individuals who do develop COVID-19 illness, the medical illness itself constitutes yet another dimension of exposure severity. Among those who become medically ill, in turn, different levels of medical effects ensue, including illness requiring medical care and more severe illness requiring intensive care and even ventilator assistance. These considerations suggest that not only does exposure to the virus have dose-related direct effects on both medical complications of the viral illness and mental health, but the severity of the medical illness may serve to further drive more severe emotional and psychological consequences. Besides direct personal exposure, other types of exposure to the virus may prove stressful, including witnessing the course of severe COVID-19 illness in previously healthy patients, learning about severe COVID-19 illness in a close family member or a close friend, or even having personally exposed or infected a close family member or close friend.",

These widespread concerns about risk of exposure are of potentially limitless dimensions and might even be at least as distressing as the specific and contained awareness of an actual and identifiable virus exposure, as in a popular saying, \"Fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all\" (attributed to Yvon Chouinard, outdoor adventurer and founder of the clothing and gear company Patagonia). Particularly in the initial phases of the pandemic when less was understood about the virus and its transmission, realistic assessment of the level of risk from daily activities for potential exposure to the virus, infection, and medical illness and complications was particularly difficult.

It might create difficulties with decisions of which illnesses to include, such as COVID-19, influenza, (certainly HIV, especially in years before effective treatments were developed) cancer, or even diabetes mellitus, all of which significantly increase an individual's risk of fatality. Additionally, no one survives life without eventual fatality, and thus, even birth itself could be conceptually construed as meeting criteria for trauma by this logic.

Potential solutions involving new diagnostic entities, however, are not without potential problems.

If the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD were rewritten to include risk of exposure as a qualifying trauma exposure, then simply having potential for exposure could lead to a diagnosis of PTSD. This solution would have the same issue with naturally occurring medical illness not meeting the criteria for categorization as trauma in addition to the lack of actual exposure. Expansion of PTSD criteria to include fear of exposure as a qualifying trauma exposure could be expected to render the criteria meaninglessly broad. For example, just as concerns about risk for trauma exposure in general could be extended beyond reason to include simply driving on a highway, concerns about risk for COVID-19 could be extended beyond reason to include simply taking a breath of fresh outside air from an open window. Nevertheless, the substantial proportion of general populations and healthcare workers reporting psychiatric symptoms related to concerns about potential viral exposure in published COVID-19 research studies supports the concept of concern about risk for viral exposure as an important stressor with potential for mental health consequences. Research might find the mental health outcomes related to fear of exposure to also represent stressor-related disorders, other psychiatric illness such as depressive and anxiety disorders, and non-pathological distress, with all the same potential issues for diagnostic categorization discussed above for categorization of viral exposure.",

The issues rising from the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD are unsatisfying for guiding the response to this disaster because the constraint of its definition of trauma, which excludes natural illness such as viral infection, has not been fully investigated. The international criteria do not include this constraint, and supporting evidence for this new change in the American diagnostic criteria is needed. To determine whether exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus represents a qualifying traumatic event or a non-traumatic stressor will require empirical data. Research must be designed to compare SARS-CoV-2 exposure to exposure to qualifying traumatic events according to DSM-5 criteria to determine whether the symptomatic response to both types of events is similar or distinct.",

Using this procedure, if the syndrome following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 displays a distinctive symptom complex and clinical characteristics, continues to manifest consistently over time with characteristic treatment outcomes, runs in families by itself, can be demonstrated by exclusion criteria to be identifiably different from other established illnesses, and especially if distinctive biomarkers can be found, then it suggests the syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 exposure may be distinct from syndromes following exposure to traditionally qualifying traumatic events. Conversely, if the COVID-19-related psychological syndrome appears equivalent to other trauma-related syndromes across these five procedural phases, this might be considered evidence that it represents a trauma-related syndrome and could lead to PTSD. Alternatively, this direction of research investigation could potentially help determine whether the COVID-19-related syndrome fits with known non-trauma stressor-related syndromes. Additionally, fears related to potential for exposure are a sufficient source of stress such that research is needed to further characterize the mental health effects of these concerns and differentiate them from mental health outcomes of the stress of actual viral exposures and of secondary stressors of the pandemic.",

Accurate diagnosis is central to all of medical practice; it guides the clinician to select the most appropriate and effective treatment, helps determine a likely prognosis, allows communication with professional colleagues, facilitates education of clinicians and researchers, and organizes scientific research [53] . All of these activities have central relevance to mounting and executing the most effective responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The specific relevance for the psychiatric aspects of COVID-19 regarding determination of whether exposure to the virus represents trauma and thus constitutes a source of PTSD in the traditional sense as currently defined by DSM-5 or a non-trauma stressor and stress-related syndrome is particularly salient for psychiatric treatment. For example, there are efficacious treatments for PTSD [54, 55] , but if the disorder is not the same as PTSD, the safety and efficacy of PTSD treatments may not be known. These concerns are relevant not just for the millions of people affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic but also for the broad populations that will experience threats of infection and other stressors arising with the upcoming epidemics and pandemics that the future will inevitably bring; thus, research addressing these issues is greatly needed for the current and future welfare of the world.
