The method is based on a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model that describes the virus transmission. A two-stage estimation method, which combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the reported state variables (active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational transfer function to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used with case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Our method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate. We show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g., age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models. We also apply it to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, where the positive rates were below 5% recommended by WHO.",

The effective (or instantaneous) reproduction number R t , on the other hand, reflects the extent of transmission in the presence of population immunity or intervention. Thus, the estimation of R t is important for evaluating public measure success. However, estimation of R t is sensitive to the model structure and parameter assumptions [3] . As a case in point, due to incorporation of more individual case information and travel data, the estimate for R 0 in Wuhan was revised upward from 2.2-2.7 to 5.7 [4] . On the other hand, data inavailability or poor quality often hinders the use of certain estimation methods, such as serial interval data that are usually needed to estimate R t (e.g., Fraser [5] , Wallinga and Teunis [6] , Cauchemez et al. [7] , White and Pagano [8] ).",

[9] discussed a likelihood-based approach to estimate R t from early epidemic growth data, while Cazelles at al. [10] used stochastic models for the disease dynamics coupled with particle Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Using the compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, Bettencourt and Ribeiro [11] use the incidence data to estimate R 0 and R t . In this paper, based on the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model as a reference, we develop a novel approach to estimate R t of COVID-19. It uses information on the number of infected or active (I), recovered (R), and death (D) cases, which are readily available for all affected countries, so that they can be accessed rather easily. This method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate. We assume mass population testing is sufficiently enough, such that the positive rate is below 5% recommended by WHO. This is to ensure data quality of the number of infection is acceptable since asymptomatic carrier transmission is often underestimated [12] .",

During that time the daily test-positivity rate is below 1% for Denmark and Norway, while Sweden is at 2.9% [18] . These numbers are good indications about the testing capacity in the Scandinavian countries and may describe the dynamics of the transmission better with respect to asymptomatic cases.

The former method exploits the new reported incidence, while the latter one uses the distribution of the serial interval. First, we compare our method with Bettencourt and Ribeiro [11] , that allows sequential estimation of the basic reproduction number at the initial stage when the growth is still exponential. While the two methods are based on the SIR model, Bettencourt and Ribeiro [11] use new incidence data and the result is filtered using a five-day moving average filter. In Fig. 3 , we plot the comparison and summarise the basic reproduction numbers that are taken to be the maximum of the curves in Table 2 .

The discrepancy is caused by the active and recovered cases that apparently were not updated regularly, in contrast to the new positive cases needed by the method of [13] . The unreported recovery cases were all released at once on May 22, 2020, see Fig. 1 (c).",

Here, we provide a novel method exploiting reported active, recovered and death cases using the SIR model as an underlying approach. This new method offers several advantages compared to existing methods: (i) from modeling point of view, the resulting R t value can follow the dynamics of the model suggested, so it is possible to develop it further if the model chosen has a higher complexity, (ii) the estimation method can still be expanded in terms of statistical view, and (iii) the method does not need information about serial intervals. In the case that the data provided in time series do not change much or instead have drastic changes, such as accumulating at a certain time, the resulting R t value will show the same spikes and serrations. As a result, the latest information from data dynamics can be more elaborated.",
