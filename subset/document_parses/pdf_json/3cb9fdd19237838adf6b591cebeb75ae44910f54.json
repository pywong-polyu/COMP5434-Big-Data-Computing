As with frequency tabulation, various percentage measures can be computed in a crosstabulation, including the percentage of the sample associated with a specific count within either a row ('% within jobsat') or a column ('% within gender'). You can see in Table 5 .2 that 18 inspectors indicated a job satisfaction level of 7 (Very High); of these 18 inspectors reported in the 'Total' column, 8 (44.4%) were male and 10 (55.6%) were female. The marginal distribution for gender in the 'Total' row shows that 57 inspectors (53.8% of the 106 valid inspectors) were male and 49 inspectors (46.2%) were female. Of the 57 male inspectors in the sample, 8 (14.0%) indicated a job satisfaction level of 7 (Very High). Furthermore, we could generate some additional interpretive information of value by adding the '% within gender' values for job satisfaction levels of 5, 6 and 7 (i.e. differing degrees of positive job satisfaction). Here we would find that 68.4% (\u00bc 24.6% + 29.8% + 14.0%) of male inspectors indicated some degree of positive job satisfaction compared to 61.2% (\u00bc 10.2% + 30.6% + 20.4%) of female inspectors. This helps to build a picture of the possible relationship between an inspector's gender and their level of job satisfaction (a relationship that, as we will see later, can be quantified and tested using Procedure 6.2 and Procedure 7.1).",

Figure 5 .2 shows a pie chart representation of the same data, with an 'exploded slice' highlighting the percentage of female inspectors in the sample who worked for large business computer manufacturersthe lowest percentage of the five types of companies. Both graphs were produced using SPSS. The pie chart was modified with an option to show the actual percentage along with the label for each category. The bar chart shows that computer manufacturing firms have relatively fewer female inspectors compared to the automotive and electrical appliance (large and small) firms. This trend is less clear from the pie chart which suggests that pie charts may be less visually interpretable when the data categories occur with rather similar frequencies. However, the 'exploded slice' option can help interpretation in some circumstances.",

The shape of the distribution of data points is evident. The plot has a fan-shaped characteristic to it which indicates that accuracy scores are highly variable (exhibit a very wide range of possible scores) at very fast inspection speeds but get much less variable and tend to be somewhat higher as inspection speed increases (where inspectors take longer to make their quality control decisions).

Thus, you must be careful in creating and interpreting visual representations so that the influence of aesthetic choices for sake of appearance do not become more important than obtaining a faithful and valid representation of the data-a very real danger with many of today's statistical packages where 'default' drawing options have been pre-programmed in.

Such graphs typically sacrifice precision in representation in favour of a snapshot pictorial summary that can help you form general impressions of data patterns. It is important to note that what is presented here is a small but reasonably representative sampling of the types of graphs one can produce to summarise and display trends in multivariate data. Generally speaking, SYSTAT offers the best facilities for producing multivariate graphs, followed by STATGRAPHICS, but with the drawback that it is somewhat tricky to get the graphs in exactly the form you want. SYSTAT also has excellent facilities for creating new forms and combinations of graphsessentially allowing graphs to be tailor-made for a specific communication purpose. Both SPSS and NCSS offer a more limited range of multivariate graphs, generally restricted to scatterplot matrices and variations of multiplots. Microsoft Excel or STATGRAPHICS are the packages to use if radar or spider plots are desired.",

Radar plots are generally easy to interpret and provide a good visual basis for comparing plots from different individuals or groups, even if a fairly large number of variables (say, up to about 25) are being displayed. Like a clock face, variables are evenly spaced around the centre of the plot in clockwise order starting at the 12 o'clock position. Visual interpretation of a radar plot primarily relies on shape comparisons, i.e. the rise and fall of peaks and valleys along the spokes around the plot. Valleys near the centre display low scores on specific variables, peaks near the outside of the plot display high scores on specific variables. [Note that, technically, radar plots employ polar coordinates.] SYSTAT can draw graphs using polar coordinates but not as easily as Excel can, from the user's perspective. Radar plots work best if all the variables represented are measured on the same scale (e.g. a 1 to 7 Likert-type scale or 0% to 100% scale).

To illustrate icon plots, without generating too many icons to focus on, Figs. 5.15, 5.16, 5.17 and 5.18 present four different icon plots for QCI inspectors classified, using a new variable called BEST_WORST, as either the worst performers (\u00bc 1 where their accuracy scores were less than 70%) or the best performers (\u00bc 2 where their accuracy scores were 90% or greater). The Chernoff's faces plot gets its name from the visual icon used to represent variable scoresa cartoon-type face. This icon tries to capitalise on our natural human ability to recognise and differentiate faces. Each feature of the face is controlled by the scores on a single variable. In SYSTAT, up to 20 facial features are controllable; the first five being curvature of mouth, angle of brow, width of nose, length of nose and length of mouth (SYSTAT Software Inc., 2009, p. 259).

The first attitude variable is jobsat and anchors the left end of each line graph; the last variable is polsatis and anchors the right end of the line graph. The remaining variables are represented in order from left to right across the X-axis of each graph. Figure 5 .16 shows that these inspectors are rather different in their attitude profiles, with best performers tending to show taller profiles on the first two variables, for example. Figure 5 .17 produced using SYSTAT, shows a histogram plot for the best and worst performing inspectors based on their ratings of job satisfaction, working conditions and the nine attitude variables. This plot tells the same story as the profile plot, only using histogram bars. Some people would prefer the histogram icon plot to the profile plot because each histogram bar corresponds to one variable, making the visual linking of a specific bar to a specific variable much easier than visually linking a specific position along the profile line to a specific variable. The sunray plot is actually a simplified adaptation of the radar plot (called a \"star glyph\") used to represent scores on a set of variables for each individual within a sample or group. Remember that a radar plot basically arranges the variables around a central point like a clock face; the first variable is represented at the 12 o'clock position and the remaining variables follow around the plot in a clockwise direction.",

In a normal or near-normal distribution of sample data, the mean, the median, and the mode will all generally coincide at the one point. In this instance, all three statistics will provide approximately the same indication of central tendency.

This plot provides a symbolic representation that preserves less of the original nature of the data (compared to a stem & leaf display) but typically gives a better picture of the distributional characteristics. The basic boxplot, shown in Fig. 5.24 , utilises information about the median (50th percentile score) and the upper (75th percentile score) and lower (25th percentile score) hinge points in the construction of the 'box' portion of the graph (the 'median' defines the centre line in the box; the 'upper' and 'lower hinge values' define the end boundaries of the boxthus the box encompasses the middle 50% of data values). Additionally, the boxplot utilises the IQR (recall Procedure 5.5) as a way of defining what are called 'fences' which are used to indicate score boundaries beyond which we would consider a score in a distribution to be an 'outlier' (or an extreme or unusual value). In SPSS, the inner fence is typically defined as 1.5 times the IQR in each direction and a 'far' outlier or extreme case is typically defined as 3 times the IQR in either direction (Field 2018, p. 193) . The 'whiskers' in a boxplot extend out to the data values which are closest to the upper and lower inner fences (in most cases, the vast majority of data values will be contained within the fences). Outliers beyond these 'whiskers' are then individually listed. 'Near' outliers are those lying just beyond the inner fences and 'far' outliers lie well beyond the inner fences. Figure 5 .24 shows two simple boxplots (produced using SPSS), one for the accuracy QCI variable and one for the speed QCI variable. The accuracy plot shows a median value of about 83, roughly 50% of the data fall between about 77 and 89 and there is one outlier, inspector 83, in the lower 'tail' of the distribution. The accuracy boxplot illustrates data that are relatively symmetrically distributed without substantial skewness. Such data will tend to have their median in the middle of the box, whiskers of roughly equal length extending out from the box and few or no outliers.",

This helps in the visual detection of meaningful subgroup differences, where boxplot 'notches' don't overlap. Focus first on the left graph in Fig. 5 .25 which plots the distribution of accuracy scores broken down by company using regular boxplots. This plot clearly shows the differing degree of skewness in each type of company (indicated by one or more outliers in one 'tail', whiskers which are not the same length and/or the median line being offset from the centre of a box), the differing variability of scores within each type of company (indicated by the (continued) Fig. 5.25 Comparisons of the accuracy (regular boxplots) and speed (notched boxplots) QCI variables for different types of companies overall length of each plot-box and whiskers), and the differing central tendency in each type of company (the median lines do not all fall at the same level of accuracy score). From the left graph in Fig. 5 .25, we could conclude that: inspection accuracy scores are most variable in PC and Large Electrical Appliance manufacturing companies and least variable in the Large Business Computer manufacturing companies; Large Business Computer and PC manufacturing companies have the highest median level of inspection accuracy; and inspection accuracy scores tend to be negatively skewed (many inspectors toward higher levels, relatively fewer who are poorer in inspection performance) in the Automotive manufacturing companies.

There seems to be a very slight preponderance of pairs of z-scores where the signs are reversed (12 out of 22 pairs). This observation provides some very preliminary evidence to suggest that there may be a relationship between inspection accuracy and decision speed, namely that a more accurate decision tends to be associated with a faster decision speed. Of course, this pattern would be better verified using the entire sample rather than the top 25% of inspectors. However, you may find it interesting to learn that it is precisely this sort of suggestive evidence (about agreement or disagreement between z-score signs for pairs of variable scores throughout a sample) that is captured and summarised by a single statistical indicator called a 'correlation coefficient' (see Fundamental Concept III and Procedure 6.1). z-scores are not the only type of standard score that is commonly used. Three other types of standard scores are: stanines (standard nines), IQ scores and T-scores (not to be confused with the t-test described in Procedure 7.2). These other types of scores have the advantage of producing only positive integer scores rather than positive and negative decimal scores. This makes interpretation somewhat easier for certain applications. However, you should know that almost all other types of standard scores come from a specific transformation of z-scores. This is because once you have converted raw scores into z-scores, they can then be quite readily transformed into any other system of measurement by simply multiplying a person's z-score by the new desired standard deviation for the measure and adding to that product the new desired mean for the measure.

This includes most measures of ability, performance and productivity, personality characteristics and attitudes. The normal distribution is important because it is the one form of distribution that you must assume describes the scores of a variable in the population when parametric tests of statistical inference are undertaken. The standard normal distribution is defined as having a population mean of 0.0 and a population standard deviation of 1.0. The normal distribution is also important as a means of interpreting various types of scoring systems. Figure 5 .28 displays the standard normal distribution (mean \u00bc 0; standard deviation \u00bc 1.0) and shows that there is a clear link between z-scores and the normal distribution. Statisticians have analytically calculated the probability (also expressed as percentages or percentiles) that observations will fall above or below any specific z-score in the theoretical standard normal distribution. Thus, a z-score of +1.0 in the standard normal distribution will have 84.13% (equals a probability of .8413) of observations in the population falling at or below one standard deviation above the mean and 15.87% falling above that point. A z-score of \u00c02.0 will have 2.28% of observations falling at that point or below and 97.72% of observations falling above that point.

In a normal distribution, the values for the skewness and kurtosis statistics are both zero (skewness \u00bc 0 means a symmetric distribution; kurtosis \u00bc 0 means a mesokurtic distribution). The further away each statistic is from zero, the more the distribution deviates from a normal shape.

However, notice that with the violin plot, unlike with a boxplot, you also get a sense of distributions that have 'clumps' of scores in specific areas. Some violin plots, like that for Automobile manufacturing companies inFig. 5.27, have a shape suggesting a multimodal distribution (recall Procedure 5.4 and the discussion of the fact that a distribution may have multiple modes). The violin plot inFig. 5.27 has also been produced to show where the median (solid line) and mean (dashed line) would fall within each violin. This facilitates two interpretations: (1) a relative comparison of central tendency across the five companies and (2) relative degree of skewness in the distribution for each company (indicated by the separation of the two lines within a violin; skewness is particularly bad for the Large Business Computer manufacturing companies).",
