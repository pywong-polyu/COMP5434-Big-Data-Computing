            "text": "Inflammation triggers secondary brain damage after stroke. The meninges and other CNS border compartments serve as invasion sites for leukocyte influx into the brain thus promoting tissue damage after stroke. However, the post-ischemic immune response of border compartments compared to brain parenchyma remains poorly characterized. Here, we deeply characterize tissue-resident leukocytes in meninges and brain parenchyma and discover that leukocytes respond differently to stroke depending on their site of residence. We thereby discover a unique phenotype of myeloid cells exclusive to the brain after stroke. These stroke-associated myeloid cells partially resemble neurodegenerative disease-associated microglia. They are mainly of resident microglial origin, partially conserved in humans and exhibit a lipid-phagocytosing phenotype. Blocking markers specific for these cells partially ameliorates stroke outcome thus providing a potential therapeutic target. The injury-response of myeloid cells in the CNS is thus compartmentalized, adjusted to the type of injury and may represent a therapeutic target.",

However, recently unexpected immune-related functions of these CNS border compartments were identified 2, 3 . Even in homeostasis, the meninges induce a border-associated cellular phenotype in myeloid lineage cells 4, 5 . Similarly, tissueresident lymphocytes also exhibit a location-specific composition and phenotype in each individual compartment 4 . For example, we and others previously identified that the dura contains a large proportion of B cells across a broad developmental spectrum 6, 7 and meningeal lymphocytes form local immune hubs 8 . Immunity in border compartments also responds to diseases, as shown for meningeal leukocytes in experimental neuroinflammation 4, 6, 9 and in traumatic brain injury 9 . And meningeal lymphatic vessels in fact partially control neuroinflammation 5,10 and neurodegeneration 11 .",

We then discover a specific stroke-associated phenotype of myeloid cells in the pia and CNS parenchyma in rodents and humans exhibiting a lipidphagocytosing phenotype. These stroke-associated myeloid cells (SAMC) share features with microglia in neurodegenerative diseases and from development and are mostly, but not exclusively, derived from resident microglia. Moreover, we find that blocking SAMC-specific markers partially ameliorates stroke outcome.

We therefore induced transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in C57BL/6 mice and then characterized cellular immunity in multiple border compartments and CNS parenchyma. We used two artery occlusion times (30 and 45 min) and two post-ischemia analysis times (24 and 72 h) to model different conditions (Fig. 1A) . As expected, infarct volumes were highest at 72 h and increased with longer artery occlusion ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ).

Different meningeal layers (pia vs. dura) could not be discerned in histology. We found that the density of meningeal 7/4 + granulocytes increased at 72 h after 45 min of MCAO (Supplementary Fig. 1E ). Dura and pia thus exhibit a site-specific leukocyte response to stroke that differs from parenchyma and shows a temporally defined pattern. Fig. 1 Stroke affects leukocytes in a compartment-specific fashion. A Scheme of the experimental approach. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (or sham-operated, as controls) was induced in wild-type (WT) mice for 30 or 45 min and mice were sacrificed 24 h or 72 h later (post ischemia). Prior to stroke induction, fluorophore-labeled CD45 antibody (mAb) was injected intravenously (iv). After 5 min, mice were intracardially perfused and CD45 +leukocytes negative for the CD45iv antibody (CD45 + CD45iv \u2212 ) then defined as tissue-resident leukocytes were flow-sorted from central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, pia, dura, choroid plexus (CP) and blood, and analyzed by flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Tissue sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Single-cell transcriptomics identifies specific stroke-associated myeloid cells in CNS and pia. We speculated that flow cytometry would miss more subtle compositional changes induced by ischemia over time. We, therefore, performed single-cell RNAsequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45iv \u2212 CD45 + TRL sorted from the brain parenchyma, pia, and dura at 24 h and 72 h after MCAO compared to healthy control animals. We thereby obtained 32,457 total single-cell transcriptomes from the CNS (18,396 cells), pia (6,650 cells), and dura (7200 cells) with 8050 cells derived from CNS at 24 h and 6,049 cells derived from 72 h (Supplementary Data 1). We jointly clustered data from all tissues at 24/72 h after ischemia together with controls and identified 21 cell clusters ( Fig. 2A ) that were annotated based on marker genes (Fig. 2B ). Lymphoid lineage clusters separated into Tc (Cd3g, Trbc2, Cd8a), NK cell (Nkg7, Gzma), Bc (Cd79a, Ms4a1), \u03b3\u03b4 Tc (gdTc; Cd3g, Trdc) and innate lymphoid cells type (ILC2; Gata3, Rora) ( Fig. 2A, B) . Myeloid lineage clusters were separated into 15 clusters ( Fig. 2A) . Four clusters expressed microglia transcripts (micro_1-3, stress_Micro; Tmem119, Hexb, Cx3cr1, Sparc, P2ry12, Cst3) and were almost exclusively found in the brain ( Fig. 2C ; Supplementary Fig. 4A , C). Five clusters expressed macrophage transcripts (CAM_1, CAM_2, SAMC, Macro_1, Macro_2; Lyz2, Apoe) of which one cluster expressed a pronounced border-associated phenotype (CAM_1; Pf4, Lyve1) while one cluster showed a weaker expression of CNS borderassociated transcripts (CAM_2; Pf4). The macrophage clusters were mainly present in pia and dura and lower in brain parenchyma ( Fig. 2C ; Supplementary Fig. 3A , C). One cluster (SAMC; Cd14, Apoe, Spp1, Lpl) ( Fig. 2A, B ) was notably mainly present in brain parenchyma after ischemia and absent in the other compartments ( Fig. 2C ; Supplementary Fig. 3A, C) .",

Indeed, M-CSF/FluoroMyelin-co-staining showed a widespread interaction of SAMC with myelin and intracellular vesicular myelin structures in M-CSF + cells (Fig. 4F ). We next labeled oligodendrocytes and neurons together with F4/80. Interestingly, F4/80 + , M-CSF + and LPL + -cells frequently engulfed both oligodendrocytes and whole neurons after stroke (Fig. 4G , H). SAMC may thus serve to phagocytose and remove lipid-rich cell debris after stroke. To experimentally investigate this hypothesis, we first performed histological staining of the SAMC-marker M-CSF with BODIPY, a dye that specifically labels neutral lipids and is commonly used to detect lipid droplets 31 . These identified BODIPY + lipid droplets were preferentially found in SAMC marker positive cells (M-CSF, Fabp5) within the infarcted area ( Supplementary Fig. 6A ). Furthermore, we also detected Perilipin-2, a lipid droplet surface protein that is highly expressed by SAMC, frequently expressed among cells with fluorescently labeled myelin indicating phagocytosis of myelin structures ( Supplementary Fig. 6A ). These findings were conserved in photothrombotic brainstem ischemia in rats ( Supplementary   Fig. 6B ). To next test whether the SAMC in fact exerted lipidphagocytosing function, we performed in vitro lipid phagocytosis assays. Compared with non-SAMC CD45 high Lilrb4 \u2212 cells, CD45 high Lilrb4 + SAMC-specific cells showed increased bodipy uptake indicating lipid phagocytosis ( Supplementary Fig. 6D) . Moreover, the percentage of CD45 high Lilrb4 + SAMC cells presenting diffused fluorescence indicating lipid clearance was increased in comparison to non-SAMC cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 6D ). In addition, immunohistochemical staining of human stroke tissue detected SAMC marker positive cells together with BODIPY + lipid droplets ( Supplementary Fig. 6C ). Together, these findings validate the phagocytic function of SAMC and confirm that these properties are conserved across species.",

Functional and structural recovery was not significantly influenced after treatment with an MMP12-specific inhibitor (Fig. 5F ). However, we could detect a trend towards a better functional outcome after treatment with MMP12-specific inhibitor 72 h after induction of MCAO (Fig. 5F ). Furthermore, after treatment with MMP12specific inhibitor, the SAMC-marker LPL, M-CSF, and Adam8 were not significantly altered in comparison to vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 5G) . To further validate the phagocytic function of SAMC, we performed immunohistochemical staining for Perilipin-2 and BODIPY in mice after blockade of SAMC-specific markers (Fig. 5D, H) . In all mice treated with SAMC-marker specific antibody/inhibitor, we found a trend towards a decreased amount of Perilipin-2 + cells (Fig. 5D, H) and part of lipid droplets (Fig. 5D) indicating a reduced phagocytic activity. In summary, we found that antibody-mediated blocking of SAMCspecific markers ameliorated stroke outcome potentially through reduced phagocytosis of cell debris, thus supporting the functional relevance of SAMC in stroke.",

Compared to the meninges, immune cells in the brain parenchyma feature a delayed and reduced influx of DCs and T cells; likely mirroring the myeloid to lymphocyte influx gradient from the meninges towards the parenchyma described previously 4, 6 . Second, using single-cell transcriptional profiling, we identify and subsequently confirm a phenotype which we name stroke-associated myeloid cells (SAMC) instructed onto the myeloid lineage by the ischemic CNS tissue. We find that these cells are not likely an ontogenetically homogeneous population, but are derived from both resident microglia and peripheral monocytes/macrophages with microglial predominance. The core gene signature comprising Spp1, Fabp5, Gpnmb, Ctsb, Ctsl, Lgals3, Lpl, Fth1, Cd63, and Ctsd distinctly characterized SAMC. We speculate that the ischemic tissue instructs this phenotype onto myeloid cells of different ontogenetic origin. Third, a detailed examination of SAMC, showed signs of enhanced lipid metabolism and phagocytosis, suggesting a need for clearance of lipid-rich tissue debris after stroke. It is known that activated microglial cells phagocytose neuronal material after stroke 33, 34 . Recent studies also suggest that microglia increase phagocytic activity following stroke, albeit at significantly lower levels than recruited monocytes 35 . In fact, immunostaining of SAMC-specific genes followed by lipid phagocytosis assay identified lipid-phagocytosing activity of SAMC cells. Recently, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) was shown to attenuate phagocytic activity of microglia after stroke 34, 35 . In detail, TREM2 deficiency induced a reduced tissue resorption with increased infarct size and a worsened neurological outcome. Interestingly, microglial TREM2 expression, and not TREM2 expression on circulating macrophages, was fundamental in stroke outcome 34, 35 . We integrate these previous and our findings into a model where SAMC may modulate stroke outcome through phagocytosis of lipid-rich tissue debris.",

However, these cells did not form as many lipid droplets as expected in highly phagocytosing cells indicating fast processing of lipids as being recently described in receptor-mediated (such as CD36, SR-A1, or Lox1) phagocytosis of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) 36 . In fact, at the sites of atherosclerotic lesions, lipid-droplet-rich foamy macrophages provide decreased phagocytosis activity compared with macrophages without lipid droplets 37 . Interestingly, CD36, a phagocytic receptor that mediates the uptake of fatty acid-containing ligands, is highly expressed in the SAMC population. In stroke, CD36 was found to provide a contextdependent function involving inflammation and resolution with either beneficial and detrimental outcome effects 38 . In conclusion, our findings thus lend support to a phagocytic function of SAMC in stroke in rodents and human affecting both functional and structural outcomes.",

Single-cell transcriptomic studies of patients who suffered from stroke will be needed to further elucidate the function of SAMC in ischemic stroke. The identification and understanding of the utility of CNS and border compartmentassociated leukocytes during stroke is essential to developing new therapeutic approaches, specific to previously unidentified subsets. Animals. Adult (10-16 weeks of age, n = 175) male C57BL/6 mice were used in all experiments, adult Balb/c male mice (10 weeks of age, n = 15) and adult male Wistar rats (10-16 weeks of age, n = 7) were used for immunohistochemistry, and adult (10-16 weeks of age, n = 14) male B6.SJL-Ptprc a Pepc b /BoyJ (i.e. CD45.1 congenic C57BL/6) mice were used in bone marrow chimera experiments. Cxcr4CreER/WtR26CAG-LSL-tdT mice were generated as follows: A Cxcr4CreER(T2)-IRES-eGFP knockin allele was generated by inserting CreER(T2)-IRES-eGFP into the exon 1 of the Cxcr4 locus. Following this, Cxcr4CreER does not produce functional Cxcr4. Cxcr4CreER males were bred to females of the R26CAG-LSL-tdT Cre-reporter strain Ai1446 and to Cxcr4LoxP; R26CAG-LSL-tdT females, thus generating Cxcr4CreER/wt; R26CAG-LSL-tdTcontrol and Cxcr4CreER/LoxP; R26CAG-LSL-tdT inducible Cxcr4cKO mice 32 . Mice were maintained under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle period and had access to pelleted food and water ad libitum. Mice were kept in standard housing conditions with ambient temperature between 20-24\u00b0C and humidity between 45-65%.
