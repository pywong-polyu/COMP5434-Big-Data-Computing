            "text": "The scale and asymmetry of commercial technology firms' power over people through data, combined with the increasing involvement of the private sector in public governance, means that increasingly, people do not have the ability to opt out of engaging with technology firms. At the same time, those firms are increasingly intervening on the population level in ways that have implications for social and political life. This creates the potential for power relations of domination, and demands that we decide what constitutes the legitimacy to act on the public. Business ethics and private law are not designed to answer these questions, which are primarily political. If people have lost the right to disengage with commercial technologies, we may need to hold the companies that offer them to the same standards to which we hold the public sector. This paper first defines the problem and demonstrates that it is significant and widespread, and then argues for the development of an overarching normative framework for what constitutes non-domination with regard to digital technologies. Such a framework must involve a nuanced idea of political power and accountability that can respond not only to the legality of corporate behaviour, but to its legitimacy.",

            "text": "Problems occurring as a result of this kind of domination can be typologised as follows. First, there are problems arising from contracting. These are cases where commercial firms develop capacity that is complementary to that of the state and then become incorporated as contractors in the state's operations while still retaining a private-sector identity. One example of the problems this can create is the interaction between the South African government and the firm Cash Paymaster Services, owned by the technology firm Net1, for the digital distribution of welfare payments (Foley and Swilling 2018) . CPS became a monopoly provider due to its technical capacity in electronic transfers and biometric verification, but then exploited both its monopoly and grant recipients' poverty by using the data it gathered through service provision to create a private marketplace in which Net1's other subsidiaries could market products and services, making deductions directly from welfare recipients' welfare accounts. When CPS was challenged in court and proved to have engaged in corrupt practices, however, it did not lose its contract due to the necessity of its public function. Foley and Swilling note 'the risks which come with the outsourcing of services to the private sector [\u2026]where a private company attempts to hold the country's most vulnerable people hostage and leaving the government with no option but to concede to its demands.' This is an example of technology-based power that aligns with the three characteristics of domination according to Lovett (2010) : imbalance of power, dependency and arbitrariness. These are particularly relevant because welfare recipients cannot say no to the services of a government contractor.",

            "text": "The second way in which technology firms acquire mass influence and leverage over public attention and engagement is in the style of the multinational technology giants: independently of government, through people's engagement with their platforms or services. This mass engagement effectively makes them public service providers, because their platforms or services can be used to reach particular populations for political, economic or social purposes. An example of this is the API service developed in 2020 by Google and Apple to facilitate contact tracing during the Covid-19 pandemic, where the two firms' almost complete monopoly on smartphone operating systems enabled them to channel information about the location of, and contacts between, almost all the world's smartphone users to anyone building an app. A second illustration of this problem is the trend amongst younger US adults toward accessing political news mainly on social media (Pew 2020), giving social media firms' algorithms immense power over the topics people become aware of, and how they are presented. A third was Facebook's 2019 proposal to introduce a new digital currency, Libra, that would operate worldwide based on private-sector networks and backed up by capital reserves held by private firms. France's finance minister responded that 'the monetary sovereignty of countries is at stake from a possible privatisation of money \u2026 by a sole actor with more than 2 billion users on the planet.' (Guardian 2019b) . This type of activity by firms demonstrates problems of power, dependence and arbitrariness: firms not only have the ability to act arbitrarily on the mass scale themselves, but create markets for data and profiles that enable others to act arbitrarily as well, without scrutiny or accountability. This second type also takes the form of passive intervention resulting from the design of products and platforms, as for instance when social media algorithms amplify particular political messages over others in a systematic way, or change the reach and power of misinformation about public health issues (e.g. Guardian 2019c) .",

            "text": "The third type that can be distinguished is a hybrid one where government allows or invites technology firms to operate in public space but explicitly refuses to regulate their activities. Two examples are the UK government's interaction with Amazon in 2019, and Alphabet subsidiary Sidewalk Labs' marketing of digital payment and logistics platforms to cities around the world. In the UK case, the government agreed in 2019 to give Amazon access to National Health Service data because, according to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, 'allow [ing] Amazon Alexa devices to offer expert health advice to users would reduce pressure on \"[\u2026] hard-working GPs and pharmacists\"' (Guardian 2019a) . Under its agreement with the government, Amazon is permitted to monetise copyright NHS content, data and materials by using them to create new products and services, and to share the information with third parties who may also monetise them, but the NHS receives no compensation and has no control over the use of its materials by Amazon (Guardian 2019a) . Sidewalk Labs provides digital services to cities in return for all the data stemming from people's use of public transport infrastructure, which then enable it to capture more of the service provision market as well as channelling demand to its preferred partners, such as Uber (Bliss 2019) . Other examples are the World Health Organisation's adoption of WhatsApp for global public health messaging relating to the Covid-19 pandemic (Devex 2020 ) and the EU's call for data analytics vendors to create migration statistics from big data sources (Taylor and Meissner 2020) .",

I will argue that if we frame the problem of regulating technological power as one of non-domination, the notion of legitimacy becomes a tool to evaluate the extent to which we wish to regulate that power, and how to approach such regulation. Theories of domination, however, have so far been used to analyse state rather than corporate behaviour as a threat to freedom (see, for example, Laborde and Ronzoni 2016; Pettit 2012) , despite their utility for thinking about privatesector action. A notable exception is van der Sloot (2018) who examines how the European Court of Human Rights' decisions on digital surveillance cases have shifted from a focus on interference and harm to a broader logic of domination and arbitrary power.",

The interaction between Chinese state authorities and mobile network operators during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 for example resulted in various tools for social control which rapidly became part of the apparatus of everyday Chinese governmental power (The Guardian 2020). This suggests that the worldwide shifting of public-sector tasks such as public health and law enforcement onto private-sector actors therefore requires a re-ordering of democratic and regulatory scrutiny.",

The statement went on to explain that 'The public interest in the disclosure of the agreement with Amazon is largely focussed on the issue of sharing personal data.

This is not merely an alliance that benefits government and firms, nor is it just another example of the neoliberal state exercising the principles of New Public Management. Instead, a different type of claim is being made by both parties involved: that there is no difference between public services provided by government and by business, despite the profit interests involved and the different regulatory architectures occupied by firms and government. In the classic PPP model, firms contract with government in sectors where they already have expertise, with engineering firms for example contracting to build public infrastructure, and software companies developing platforms to provide e-government services. In contrast, this new mode of involvement is based on formerly unrelated capacity (data processing, cloud storage, analytics) entrepreneurially repurposed to take on public service tasks in a particular field, but without the 'implicit values, norms and skills' that characterise existing actors in that field (Sharon 2020: 7). Sharon uses both Walzer's concept of spheres of justice and the idea of political legitimacy to explain why this new phenomenon is problematic in the case of Google and Apple's contact-tracing API: 'legitimate advantage acquired in the sphere of digital goods-digital expertise-has been converted into advantages in the sphere of health and medicine (where epidemiological expertise should be the main source of legitimacy), and in the sphere of politics (where democratic accountability should be the source of legitimacy)' (Sharon 2020: 10) .",

While a lack of public transparency is normal for business contracts, this becomes a problem when firms undertake the tasks of government. When the EU instigated a market for migration statistics deriving from big data (EU 2018) , vendors rushed in with projects to track and predict migrants' movements and behaviour, with an eventual audience of the IOM, Frontex and other border and migration authorities. However, this contribution to migration policy was just as opaque to the public as the work of Google and Amazon with public data. A freedom-of-information request to Frontex in 2019, asking to see documents relating to the Big Data for Migration projects, resulted in a reply from the organisation's Transparency Office that 'Frontex has identified a total of 28 documents. However, access to 27 of those must be refused [\u2026] as their disclosure would undermine the protection of commercial interests of legal persons. [\u2026] As no overriding public interest that is objective and general in nature and not distinguishable from individual or private interests for the release of these documents is ascertainable in the present case, the release of these documents has to be refused.' 1 Similarly to the UK's statement about Amazon, this is a claim that private firms' activities on public issues must not be defined as public in nature and subjected to public scrutiny. This claim twists the purpose of data protection, which was originally conceptualised as a way of protecting democratic rights, regardless of whether states, firms or both were threatening them (Westin 1967, p. 65) . In public administration terms, where firms formally contract with government, this means that responsibility and accountability for service provision formally remain with the state, but research shows that in practice, this tends to be a rhetorical rather than an operational claim since such functions are not usually highly visible in terms of procurement and execution (Mulgan 2006) .",

The law names a category of 'Donn\u00e9es d'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral' (data of public interest) separately from the national law on data protection, and stipulates that this category of data must be opened for public use and the firm appropriately compensated.

This assumption that data becomes a matter for the public and the government (Art. 17), 2 rather than the government and the firm, contrasts explicitly with the UK government's position on its Amazon Alexa collaboration, i.e. that a tech firm is entitled to make profits from public data without being accountable to the public.",

It does not provide guidance on where we should seek the definition or criteria for what is legitimate and what is not.

There, data protection provisions tend to be sector-specific and to address people as consumers rather than citizens, which leads to framing legitimacy in relation to commercial, rather than public, interests.

The domain of business ethics has more recently addressed the question of how corporations can claim legitimacy, at first with a focus on the economic relationship between corporations and society (e.g. Epstein 1972) . It is worth briefly engaging with the business literature on empirical legitimacy in order to address the argument that we do not need a normative legitimacy framework for corporations in the public sphere and that instead we can rely on them to determine for themselves the values they will uphold, independently of the public.",

Palazzo and Scherer (2006) chart how issues such as multinational firms' labour practices in low-income countries, or the violation of environmental rights, have in the past generated challenges that had to be answered in the political, rather than purely the economic, sphere. Building on this, Demuijnck and Fasterling (2016) posit two categories of corporate legitimacy. First, that a firm is normatively legitimate if it can be supposed that people would approve of its entire business model and practices, if they were fully informed of them. Second, that it can be empirically considered legitimate if it is popularly perceived to be so. The important factor here is whether people are informed about what the firm is doing: the authors warn that this empirical legitimacy may depend on 'some information [being] hidden or misrepresented so that people can be manipulated' (ibid, 678). These paper-thin concepts of legitimacy are particularly unsatisfying because the ways in which technology firms monetise data are hidden from the public. In order to make personal choices on the everyday level with respect to personal autonomy and liberty, people also need meaningful information on the overall business model they are engaging with. This necessitates a thicker concept of legitimacy against which to test business purposes, if we are not to legitimise anything a corporation chooses to put in its mission and then enact on the public.",

Firms do not, for instance, (usually) claim coercive political authority, meaning that the coercive power that has been the focus of political philosophies of legitimacy, starting with Rousseau, may not be the most relevant framing when we think of the private sector. Technology firms are not attempting to conscript citizens, to go to war or (directly) to conduct coups. Instead, we see them claiming a passive kind of political legitimacy, namely that they may explore activities that have traditionally been those of the state while remaining shielded from public scrutiny as purely forprofit actors. There is an important difference between this type of activity and government procurement, or the purposeful privatisation of public services and infrastructure. In these cases, it is clear that we should hold the government responsible for the outcomes of privatisation. There is also a difference between firms using open data that is accessible to anyone. The political legitimacy problem belongs to a stillemerging middle ground that allows firms with particular reach and power to become quasi-governmental actors while still claiming to be merely doing business.",

One, originating with Weber (1918) , is based on the notion of effective authority, i.e. that an actor is judged legitimate if people accept its authority and agree they should obey its commands. An alternate perspective on legitimacy holds that an actor may be judged legitimate if its power is understood by people as justified; Raz, in particular, links this type of legitimacy to the justification of authority (Raz 1986). According to him, people may obey an actor for one of two reasons: either because they have effective authority (for example, a first-aider asking people to stand back when someone is taken ill in the street), or because their authority is based on legitimacy and therefore need not be weighed in the same way (for example, a firefighter asking people to leave their homes because their neighbourhood is at risk). The first case does not preclude disagreement and resistance: for example, if I were a doctor, I might not want to stand back but instead step in and take over authority. In the second case, I would be unlikely to refuse to leave my house regardless of my opinion of the level of risk involved.",

It matters which we choose because they lead to different routes of action, the first in the political sphere and the second in the sphere of regulation, for example through data protection or competition law. It is hard, however, to argue solely for the latter, and practice seems to bear this out: although data protection and competition law are clearly the main practical tools available if we wish to limit the firm's power, its management is increasingly being called to account by state authorities because of its political effects.",

In contrast when technology firms create new systems or applications, rather than contracting to serve a specific public need, they are carving out possibilities for engagement and profit in the public realm.

In this case, imposing the hollowed-out version of consent demanded of users of commercial technology is the epitome of forced cooperation. Evidence of this hollowing-out of consent is provided by Draper and Turow's research on people's relationship with technology firms in the USA: the authors find that people believe 'available responses are meaningless in the face of various manifestations of corporate power', and that this 'prevents individual frustration from being transformed into collective anger that might encourage institutional change' (Draper and Turow 2019, pp. 1834-5) .",

Given how readily states are giving up their power to corporations, and those corporations' strong arguments for their contribution to the public good (Taylor 2016) , we should consider this too. If this narrative is the right one, then we might expect it to be generating evidence of real consent. What endorsement consent might look like in relation to corporate activities remains an open question however, given the evidence presented by Draper and Turow that actively using a firm's products or services may denote unhappy resignation rather than agreement with its business model. On the other hand, if convention consent is what we currently see with regard to the role of technology firms in the public sphere, and if contestation within the existing framework is not a meaningful option since states are protecting the interests of corporations as their own, this suggests that domination is an appropriate framing for the problem of technological power.",

The authors describe how 'transnational private actors [\u2026] exercise arbitrary power over crucial aspects of domestic institutional settings' and 'not only do domestic institutions have limited means to resist the phenomenon; they are also often themselves pressurised into modifying their own policies, thus being undermined both in their problem-solving capacity and in their accountability to their own citizens.'

Policy interventions, he pointed out, are seldom clearly visible to those directly affected, and '[since the] supervision and regulation [of these consequences] cannot be effected by the primary groupings themselves[\u2026] consequently special agencies and measures must be formed if they are to be attended to' (Dewey 1991 (Dewey [1927 . A public must make sense of new interventions and respond to those conducting them, regardless of whether individuals can perceive them clearly or not. Dewey's 'special agencies and measures' are the question here: what would it take for a public to be able to form around, understand and respond to data-enabled harms and risks on the collective level? Fraser (1990, p. 66) helps answer this question by orienting us toward more inclusive representation that takes account of 'subaltern counter-publics'. This notion of multiple publics is important in understanding how the social contract with regard to data currently works. Rather than a single 'we' who volunteer our data for purposes of governance or commerce, in reality that transaction may be consensual and reciprocal for some groups (for instance in relations between elites and government) and simultaneously oppressive and intolerable for others within the same society (for example indigenous groups, the incarcerated, or welfare recipients' relationships with those who categorise and sort them through data technologies). In the South African case of CPS, for example, while some welfare recipients may be well served by digitising provision others will have language difficulties with services provided in English and without adequate user support. If those groups become represented, the ability of CPS to serve the public adequately becomes contestable and with it, the decision to move service provision to a private online provider.",

And what should we do if we learn that the third party we have chosen to work with uses programme participant personal information to either sell them unwanted services, or worse still, refuse certain potentially beneficial services to this group?' (Kondakhchyan 2019) The last question seems to answer the previous two: if individuals engaging with public technologies are asked to consent to the monetisation of that engagement, and if the humanitarian partner cannot guarantee that its private-sector partner will not behave according to the same principles as it does itself, informed consent is not possible and instead we find hollowed-out consent that should not be taken as conferring legitimacy, and may instead be taken as a signal that the potential for domination is present. This is indeed the case, given that firms partnering with humanitarian organisations remain independent and do not adopt the mission and principles on which the sector's effective legal immunity is based.

In 2018, the Signal Program, a human rights group developing data technologies for the humanitarian field, published the Signal Code (Campo et al. 2018) . The Code examines the basis for translating the established legitimating basis of humanitarian organisations into the new partnerships and collaborations occurring around data. Rather than assume that the involvement of data analytics in humanitarian action is a given and asking how to legitimise it, the authors set out in detail the core obligations of the field and the 'humanitarian standards and related ethical, moral, and legal frameworks' on which the field's legitimacy is based. The Code returns continually to the fundamental obligation of humanitarian organisations to answer the needs of affected populations, warning that 'The use of information and ICTs do not become humanitarian by virtue of their use by humanitarians. For these activities to qualify as humanitarian, they must be designed and executed to uphold the humanitarian principles. An information activity is only humanitarian if its aim is to prevent and alleviate suffering, protect life and health, and ensure respect for the individual.' (Campo et al. 2018, p. 18) This framework starts from the position of Raz (1986), namely that an authority gains legitimacy by serving the people. At no point does the Code inquire as to the legitimacy of the technological partners becoming involved in humanitarian action. Instead, the authors focus as comprehensively and forcefully as possible on the requirements and obligations of the field in relation to affected people in order to address what is legitimate and what is not. This effectively makes humanitarian organisations fully responsible for the actions of any for-profit actors in the humanitarian sphere: if they are intervening, the intervention is that of the humanitarian, not of the firm. There is no difference in the requirements of transparency, accountability and ethics regardless of the originator of an intervention: if it is occurring under the auspices of the humanitarian sector, there is one standard.",

If they are not accountable to those they are intervening upon, they require something else, for example a humanitarian mission to justify their actions. A business case is not sufficient to make any claim to legitimacy, particularly in the absence of meaningful accountability. Now that corporations are partnering with humanitarian organisations, there is a debate emerging about whether they can be shielded by those organisations' unique privileges and immunities given that their mission is profit, not humanitarian action (Responsible Data 2019). There is a similar question for firms doing the work of government: if their mission does not align with that of government, they cannot borrow the government's legitimacy.

However, these two forms of accountability in fact have the effect of blunting each other. Government's responsibility for firms' compliance is only activated if they do something illegal, and the scope of this responsibility does not include firms' inclination to act in the public interest. Consumers' ability to vote with their feet, while relevant if they are using a business's platform or services voluntarily, does not apply if that business is acting on them as a member of society. In this case, they are no longer consumers but merely part of the affected population-something that places a different kind of responsibility on businesses not to do harm.

Second, to provide the direction for this kind of regulation, states would have to foster a free and plural debate on what is just with regard to data, including how to balance economic with social imperatives. For this to happen, other types of institution need to be involved-think tanks and activist organisations, academia and funders.",

Pagallo (2017) connects the notion of secondary (i.e. procedural) law to legitimacy with his analysis of the Japanese government's policy on new technologies such as robotics: marking out experimental zones for scientists and the public to engage with them and to test out whether the controls and boundaries on the science of robotics are empirically adequate. Unforeseen challenges can be addressed with the rules and laws already available, or may be found to necessitate new ones. This combination of attending to procedures for safety and to the public's response to a new technological intervention can be seen as a form of public discussion and effectively constitutes one type of strategy for determining legitimacy: if robots become perceived as a positive addition to society, they will receive endorsement consent. If not, the experiment can be rolled back.",

The firstwhere they contract to provide new digital models for public service provision-might be answered by the deliberation-through-practice approach taken in Japan. So might the third type, the hybrid model of engagement where a firm provides public informational infrastructure on an entrepreneurial basis. In this case, though, this would require engagement by the state in creating deliberative processes that might restrict the actions of the company in question-something states have not so far shown themselves willing to do. The second type of problem, the spontaneous corporate capture of particular functions in the public sphere, is the most intractable because it involves firms acting entirely unilaterally. Instead, this would require this type of capture to be scrutinised systematically by dedicated authorities charged with protecting the public interest, with regular reporting to insert the findings into deliberative processes. This kind of scrutiny might be performed by a coalition of a public watchdog and relevant civil society organisations, but would need to be formalised and funded rather than made the responsibility of activists.",

Just as the incursion of robotics into social space provokes discussion about employment, healthcare, public safety and education, discussions of other technologies in social space will bring up social and political rather than purely technological or regulatory questions. Economic and informational power asymmetries, issues of autonomy, rights and representation-all these are existing social justice issues that already provoke public response. We have to link 'technological citizenship', as the Rathenau Institute terms it (Rathenau Institute 2018), which 'emancipates the regular citizen in relation to the experts and developers of technology', with everyday citizenship and with questions of social justice. Many of the challenges attributed to 'technological citizenship' involve regulating capitalism, something we already have the tools and experience to do, learned from the challenges of regulating other domains such as financial markets and the energy sector. The challenge is to bring these lessons to bear in the presence of the siren song of innovation and corporate power.",

We can see this from the failure of efforts to confine data governance to data protection law and data ethics, which have resulted in a model which relies heavily on self-regulation and ad hoc enforcement. During the 2010s, we saw much emphasis being placed on ethics commissions and guidelines as actual regulatory instruments rather than consultative bodies, with the assumption that experts advising on a general level in advance of any application. Implicitly, the current architecture also places huge demands on rights organisations, who find themselves in the role of policing violations without the firmlevel access to pre-empt those violations, or the institutional heft to prosecute them. The inefficiency of this model means that in practice most of the burden to report serious violations rests on individual whistleblowers, who then bear the full weight of firms' response on behalf of society. It is not realistic to expect most people to sacrifice their careers and often their personal safety to fulfil a function that should be pre-emptively performed up by the only actor powerful enough to stop corporations taking harmful action-the state.",

This might mean on the country level, for instance, that corporations cannot act on the population without experiencing the kinds of checks and balances that attend state action. In the case of corporate collaborators with international organisations, we may need think of accountability as layered and mutually reinforcing, where the receiving country government and the humanitarian organisation both have to appoint monitoring and enforcement bodies to check each other's actions on the most vulnerable. This perspective also has implications for the new phenomenon of direct development interventions in lower-income countries by technology corporations (Taylor and Broeders 2015) : checks and balances would have to be imposed in the country of the intervention, meaning that institutions would have to be developed which would allow developing countries to check corporate power.",

One relates to its inapplicability in authoritarian contexts where the state itself is not concerned with legitimacy. If the state is not interested in guarding the interests of its people against corporate power, no legitimacy-based approach is possible. There are a minority of states where this would fully apply, however, given that even authoritarian governments are faced with some need to justify their power. Some of the most visible problems of technology in the public sphere occur in authoritarian states, however, with the new power of data technologies only adding to the ability of powerful elites to suppress resistance and exert control. In cases of limited statehood, such as developing democracies, a legitimacy approach has the potential to serve as a political tool for governments to exert power over international interests, as in the example of development interventions by multinationals-but it has little to offer citizens of genuinely authoritarian states. Instead, public resistance must first address the problem of authoritarianism itself.",

This is the argument used in the case of CPS in South Africa described above. However, where technology firms are involved, genuine consent on the basis of understanding the business model and choosing to engage with it inevitably becomes collapsed into the idea of 'user consent', a hollowed-out version that has only the most superficial relationship with the political notion of consent and which should not be seen as conferring legitimacy.",
