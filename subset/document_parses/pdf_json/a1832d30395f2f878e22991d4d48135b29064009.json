Most states already permit other forms of gambling and receive tax revenues from these sources. The literature analyzing consumer substitution in gambling spending contains some evidence on the impact of expansions in many types of gambling, but no evidence on the impact of expanded sports betting. This paper exploits the legalization of sports betting and timing of sports book openings in West Virginia to analyze the impact of expanded sports betting on other casino gambling. Evidence using Instrumental Variables and difference-in-differences shows that increased consumer spending on sports betting caused a significant decline in spending on video lottery terminals (VLTs) in casinos, both of which generate tax revenues. Fiscal impacts include $2.6 million in new tax revenue from sports betting and a $45.4 million decrease in VLT tax revenues caused by expanded sports betting.",

However, most states that legalize sports betting already receive substantial tax revenues from other forms of gambling, like lotteries, video lottery terminals (VLTs), and casino table gaming. Understanding the fiscal consequences of legalizing sports betting requires understanding the relationship between consumer spending on sports betting and spending on other types of gambling in casinos. Limited evidence exists on the impact of legalizing or expanding sports betting on consumer spending on other forms of gambling, referred to as cannibalization in the literature.",

Substantial video lottery gambling currently exists in the state at about 1300 stand-alone state-wide establishments that also sell alcohol, called \"Hot Spots,\" and at all casinos. A \"Hot Spot\" can have up to 5 VLTs. Figure 1 shows the locations of the five casinos in West Virginia along with all cities with population over 20,000. The state's norther panhandle contains Mountaineer Casino and Wheeling Island Casino (located in the city of Wheeling, 2019 population 26,430), both of which lie in close proximity to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (60 miles, about 1 h driving time) and Columbus, Ohio (127 miles, about 2 h driving time). Hollywood Casino, located in the eastern panhandle, lies in the Washington DC SMSA, just 63 miles from downtown DC and 75 miles from Baltimore. Mardi Gras Casino, lies between two of the largest cities in the state, Charleston (2019 population 46,536) and Huntington (2019 population 45,111), and can be reached by car from Cincinnati, Ohio in just over 3 h. The Greenbrier, located in White Sulphur Springs in the south east of the state, is a historic resort and tourist destination not located in close proximity to any major urban centers or large West Virginia cities. The other two cities shown on Fig. 1 The legalization of sports betting adds another gambling option to the state's existing portfolio of legal forms of gambling. Adding an additional form of gambling to a market with other existing gambling opportunities can generate many changes. Legalized sports betting could attract new consumers to casinos, or to create accounts for mobile betting, from the ranks of non-participants with no interest in wagering at VLTs, table games, or race tracks, increasing gambling spending and tax revenues. Alternatively, legalized sports betting could induce existing gamblers to substitute some or all of their gambling spending away from existing forms of gambling, called cannibalization in the existing literature.",

Table 3 shows summary statistics for key gambling revenue data by casino over the sample period. Table 3 reveals substantial heterogeneity across the five casinos in West Virginia.

In terms of VLT wagering, Hollywood Casino took in more than $53 million per week over the sample period. For fiscal year 2018, which ran from July 2017 until June 2018, Hollywood Casino took in a total of just over $2.9 billion in VLT revenues. The Greenbrier, located in the relatively isolated south east of the state, takes in far less gambling revenue per week than the other four casinos.

I assume that the number of possible games available to bet on represents one major factor affecting bettors decisions to place wagers and the size of the wagers placed.

Estimates from a first stage regression with weekly sports book handle as the dependent variable and the instruments, and other exogenous second stage variables, as explanatory variables are used to estimate a fitted value for weekly sports book handle that should be, by construction, exogenous to factors in the equation error term in the second stage. A second stage regression model, with either weekly table game revenues or weekly VLT revenues as a dependent variable and the fitted value from the first stage along with other explanatory variables provides an estimate of the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of sports book handle on the other two types of casino revenues. Table 5 contains the second stage results from the IV estimation. Column (1) uses weekly table game revenues as the dependent variable and Column (2) uses weekly VLT revenues. Both models also contain casino fixed effects. The results suggest that no start-up effects exist, as expected. The start of sports betting would not likely affect table games or VLT revenues immediately. The suspension of sports betting and mobile sports betting at Mardi Gras and Wheeling island had no effect on table game revenues but increased VLT revenues by more than $600,000 per week. This suspension should be exogenous to unobservable factors affecting VLT wagering, since the suspension of sports betting at these casinos resulted from a licensing dispute, not from any specific activity in the betting market. The sports books and mobile app had been operating for many weeks and there was little indication in the press that a dispute was brewing between Delaware North and Miomni Gaming. The suspension occurred abruptly, and lasted for nearly a year. The parameter on the suspension variable can be interpreted as a difference-in-differences estimate of the causal effect of elimination of sports betting on VLT wagering. The positive and significant sign on this variable suggests that sports bettors switched over to VLT wagering when the sports books suspended operations.",

This parameter captures the LATE causal effect of increased sports betting on other casino revenues. The parameter for the table game revenue model is not statistically different from zero. However, the parameter for the VLT revenue model is negative and statistically different from zero at the 5% significance level. Legalizing sports betting caused a reduction in VLT revenues in West Virginia. The size of the parameter is economically significant as well. Each additional $1 wagered on sports caused a $3.96 reduction in VLT wagering. This represents an elasticity of VLT revenue with respect to changes in sports book handle of 0.18 at the mean of the sports book handle and VLT revenue distributions. Note this parameter estimate is consistent with the estimated positive effect of sports book shutdowns on VLT revenue at Mardi Gras and Wheeling Island discussed above. Table 7 in the appendix contains OLS results for the IV model using VLT revenue as the dependent variable for comparison to the IV results. OLS does not correct for correlation between sports betting handle and unobservable factors affecting table game and VLT revenues and OLS is biased and inconsistent in the presence of such correlation. The OLS results indicate no association between sports betting handle and these two variables. The parameter estimate on the sports book handle variable in the OLS model is biased up because the model does not account for the impact of game availability on handle.

The rate of customer spend on VLTs likely exceeds the rate of customer spend on sports betting, since VLT customers feed coins into machines while sports bettors likely place a bet on a game and then watch that game in the sports book. The impact of a new sports book on casinos cannot be determined a priori. Opening a sports book provides new wagering opportunities in casinos. At one extreme, opening a sports book might only attract new customers who would not have gone to the casino to gamble on VLTs or table games. This would unambiguously increase total casino handle and hold. At the other extreme, opening a sports book might attract no new customers, but instead draw all its betting action from existing customers who previously wagered on VLTs or table games.

The evidence paper develops evidence consistent with important substitution between consumer spending on sports betting and spending on VLTs in casinos, called \"cannibalization\" in the gambling literature. The results imply substantial fiscal implications: legalized sports betting generated about $2.6 million in new tax revenues from September 2018 to March 2020, but consumer substitution into sports betting and away from VLT wagering caused a reduction in tax revenues generated by VLTs by about $45 million over the same period.

One company, Delaware North, owns and operates the two casinos connected to dog tracks in Nitro (Mardi Gras) and Wheeling. A large gaming corporation, Penn National, owns and operates the Hollywood casino. The current governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, owns and operates the Greenbrier Resort and Casino. With the exception of the Greenbrier, all casinos in the state operate large numbers of VLTs. West Virginia taxes gambling in several ways. The four race track casinos pay an annual $500,000 licensing fee to operate VLTs and table games. The Greenbrier casino pays an annual license fee based on average table game revenues at the other four casinos. The state taxes net VLT revenue at 53.5% and adjusted gross table game revenue at 35%. Total revenue from VLTs in race track casinos for fiscal year (FY) 2018 (July 2017-June 2018) amounted to $5.6 billion; VLT gambling at the Greenbrier Casino generated only $4.8 million. Taxable VLT receipts amounted to $485 million with just $1.4 million generated at the Greenbrier. Casino VLT tax revenues totaled $257 million in FY 2018. These revenues go to a variety of sources including track purse funds, pensions for track employees, horse and dog development funds, and various county and municipal governments. Total table game revenue in fiscal year 2018 amounted to $105 million including $5 million at the Greenbrier. This generated just over $35 million in tax revenues in FY 2018.",
