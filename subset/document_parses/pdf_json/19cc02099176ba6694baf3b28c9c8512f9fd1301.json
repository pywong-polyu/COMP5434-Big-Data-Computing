            "text": "In medical practice, all decisions, as for example the diagnosis based on the classification of images, must be made reliably and effectively. The possibility of having automatic tools helping doctors in performing these important decisions is highly welcome. Artificial Intelligence techniques, and in particular Deep Learning methods, have proven very effective on these tasks, with excellent performance in terms of classification accuracy. The problem with such methods is that they represent black boxes, so they do not provide users with an explanation of the reasons for their decisions. Confidence from medical experts in clinical decisions can increase if they receive from Artificial Intelligence tools interpretable output under the form of, e.g., explanations in natural language or visualized information. This way, the system outcome can be critically assessed by them, and they can evaluate the trustworthiness of the results. In this paper, we propose a new general-purpose method that relies on interpretability ideas. The approach is based on two successive steps, the former being a filtering scheme typically used in Content-Based Image Retrieval, whereas the latter is an evolutionary algorithm able to classify and, at the same time, automatically extract explicit knowledge under the form of a set of IF-THEN rules. This approach is tested on a set of chest X-ray images aiming at assessing the presence of COVID-19.",

As a few examples, just consider problems related to risk assessment, as credit assignment in finance, recidivism risk prediction in court trials, and diagnosis in medicine as well. In this latter field, when doctors examine images related to a patient, they can motivate their decisions and can explain them to patients. An automatic tool should be able to convince doctors by telling them why that image represents a positive or a negative case and should reassure patients that the decision is correct and will not threaten their lives.",

It is often the case that, as Cynthia Rudin notes in [4] , ''Explainable ML methods provide explanations that are not faithful to what the original model computes''. Unfortunately, the current ways to add explainability to black boxes are far from being satisfactory. As Rudin writes, ''explanations often do not make sense, or do not provide enough detail to understand what the black box is doing.'' Unlike explainability, an alternative approach aims at creating classification tools that are interpretable, meaning with this that they directly build an explicit model so that they can provide users with explicit knowledge about the problem and with the reasons for classifying items the way they do. This knowledge may be represented as, e.g., decision trees or sets of rules. A common criticism about interpretable models is that they perform worse than explainable ones. Yet, in [4] it is argued that ''It is a myth that there is necessarily a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability''.",

Since its first official announcement on December 31, 2019, this disease has been defined as a pandemic and has caused more than 197 million cases worldwide, and more than 4.2 million people died. Symptoms of Covid-19 are highly variable, the most common being fever, dry cough, and fatigue, followed by, among many, loss of taste or smell, nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis. Symptoms of severe Covid-19 disease are shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, high temperature (above 38 C).",

One of the routine ways to help objectively diagnose the presence of Covid-19 in a subject consists of letting them undergo a chest X-ray radiography (CXR) examination [7] . This has the advantage of being performed easily, also by means of portable X-ray machines that can provide faster, and accurate Covid-19 diagnosis. CXRs, when coupled with AI, can be very useful in the detection of Covid-19 [7] .

This is confirmed by a wide and recent literature survey conducted in 2020 by Nakane et al. [8] . In it, they report that surveys on the application of EAs and swarm algorithms (SAs) to the field of computer vision have not been updated during the last decade, so their paper is the most reliable source on this. Importantly, they report no EAs being used to classify images of any type. The only way in which EAs have been utilized for image classification consists of their use to evolve good DNN structures and hyper-parameter values [9, 10] , yet those structures remain black boxes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new generalpurpose methodology to classify images that is based on two steps. The first step performs pre-processing, namely, it filters each image and transforms it into a set of real values, so that the image data set is transformed into a numerical one. In the second step, an evolutionary-based interpretable classifier acts on this numerical data set by performing classification, and at the same time provides users with explicit knowledge. This latter has the form of a set of IF-THEN rules each of which contains AND-connected literals on the data set variables.",

This was mainly due to the lack of parallel processing techniques and limited hardware resources necessary to train such networks. This problem was overcome in around 2010, and in about the same period some important advancements were made in the activation function, with ReLu or Tanh replacing the Sigmoid [12] .

A possible solution to this is represented by transfer learning, in which a CNN is previously trained on a large image data set and is then applied to face the small data set available. Secondly, the execution of CNNs needs high amounts of computational resources in terms of both memory and storage. Thirdly, their working mechanism implies that they build a black-box model based on the implicit extraction of features, yet these cannot be checked and approved by humans.

Given a problem needing optimization, an EA iteratively updates a set of a number of Pop_Size solutions over a number of Max_Gens iterations. An objective function, called the fitness function, drives this optimization process. Details on how this takes place in DE can be found in [39, 40] .

In fact, we can see that 35 of them are always equal to 0.0 for all the items in the data set because all the correlogram features related to non-gray colors receive a value of 0.0 due to the nature of the image. Specifically, the only significant variations are, obviously, those related to black, white, and gray levels, which are represented by nine attributes as a whole.

In particular, for each class, the majority of the items is correctly assigned to that class, and this takes place for all three sets. Instead, the use of indices as the accuracy, not designed to effectively deal with such situations, could have likely led to the majority class incorporating many samples of the minority one, even more than half of them, and up to all of them. Thanks to MCC, this is not the case here. The last row of the table reports the values for Accuracy A cc and MCC. As it can be seen, A cc is higher than 80% overall three sets.

Noticeably, this difference in execution time increases with the data set size. As a further example, we have executed a ResNet-50 network, consisting of 50 layers.

We have effected some preliminary experiments on it, with good results in discriminating among birds as common yellowthroat, redcockaded woodpecker, and red-headed woodpecker. The data set used has three classes and about 60 items per class. Accuracy values obtained are 97.52% on the train set and 96.23% on the test set.
