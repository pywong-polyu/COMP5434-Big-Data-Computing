            "text": "Depletion of CpG dinucleotides in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes has been linked to virus evolution, host-switching, virus replication, and innate immune responses. Temporal variations, if any, in the rate of CpG depletion during virus evolution in the host remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the CpG content of over 1.4 million full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes representing over 170 million documented infections during the first 17 months of the pandemic. Our findings suggest that the extent of CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is modest. Interestingly, the rate of CpG depletion is highest during early evolution in humans and it gradually tapers off, almost reaching an equilibrium; this is consistent with adaptations to the human host. Furthermore, within the coding regions, CpG depletion occurs predominantly at codon positions 2-3 and 3-1. Loss of ZAP (Zinc-finger antiviral protein)binding motifs in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is primarily driven by the loss of the terminal CpG within the motifs. Nonetheless, majority of the CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes occurs outside ZAP-binding motifs. SARS-CoV-2 genomes selectively lose CpGs-motifs from a U-rich context; this may help avoid immune recognition by TLR7. SARS-CoV-2 alpha-, beta-, and delta-variants of concern have reduced CpG content compared to sequences from the beginning of the pandemic. In sum, we provide evidence that the rate of CpG depletion in virus genomes is not uniform and it greatly varies over time and during adaptations to the host. This work highlights how temporal variations in selection pressures during virus adaption may impact the rate and the extent of CpG depletion in virus genomes.",

            "text": "Depletion of CpG dinucleotides has been documented in DNA and RNA viruses infecting humans and animals. CpG depletion from DNA viruses has been attributed to deamination of methylated cytosines within CpG dinucleotides (Upadhyay et al. 2013 (Upadhyay et al. , 2014 Upadhyay and Vivekanandan 2015) . We had previously demonstrated a role for host DNA methyltransferases in CpG depletion from DNA viruses (Upadhyay et al. 2013) . The Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a host antiviral protein that can selectively bind to CpG-rich viral RNA resulting in their degradation and inhibition of virus replication (Takata et al. 2017; Meagher et al. 2019) . ZAP has been recently identified as a potential driver of CpG depletion in RNA viruses (Ficarelli et al. 2020; Nchioua et al. 2020; Xia 2020) . Among beta coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been shown to be the most CpG-depleted virus (Xia 2020) . CpG dinucleotide deficiency in SARS-CoV-2 has been studied to understand evolutionary pressures, virus origin, hostswitching, virus replication, and evasion of innate immune responses (Nchioua et al. 2020; Pollock et al. 2020; Xia 2020; Di Gioacchino et al. 2021) . The adaptive evolution of coronaviruses in bats was associated with CpG depletion (Nchioua et al. 2020; MacLean et al. 2021 ) before it infected humans. Nonetheless, the extent and the rate of CpG depletion in complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes during their evolution in humans remain poorly understood. Further, although it is well-documented that CpG depletion occurs in several RNA viruses, it is not known whether the rate of CpG depletion remains constant or it varies during virus evolution in the host. In other words, temporal variations, if any, in the rate of CpG depletion during virus evolution and adaptation to the host are not understood. The availability of over 1.4 million complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes representing over 170 million documented cases of human infections in a 17-month period provides a unique opportunity to investigate the temporal evolution of CpG dinucleotides and the evolutionary pressures associated with CpG depletion.",

            "text": "Modest Depletion of CpGs in SARS-CoV-2 Genomes in the First 17 Months of the Pandemic We analyzed the CpG dinucleotide content in full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n \u00bc 1,410,423) available in GISAID database as on August 24, 2021 (supplementary table 1, Supplementary Material online). We observe that the extent of CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is modest during the first 17 months of the pandemic corresponding to over 170 million documented human infections ( fig. 1a and c) . On average, not more than three CpGs were lost from full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes starting from January 2020 to May 2021 ( fig. 1a and c) . We also measured the CpG content of SARS-CoV-2 genomes as an absolute percentage of all dinucleotides (CpG percentage) after correcting for minor differences in length of whole genome sequences available. Both CpG numbers and CpG percentage confirm modest depletion of CpG dinucleotides (fig. 1a-d) in the first 17 months of the pandemic. We believe that the extent of CpG depletion during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is modest considering that: 1) over 7,000 mutations have been described Wang et al. 2021 ) during this period, 2) a plethora of host factors including APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide) editing (Mourier et al. 2021 ) and binding of ZAP to SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Kamel et al. 2021) have been linked to CpG depletion (Nchioua et al. 2020; Mourier et al. 2021 ). There are no yardsticks available to compare the temporal loss of CpGs in virus genomes. The best and perhaps the only example of a study investigating the loss of CpGs in full-length virus genomes over time was done by Greenbaum et al. (2008) , on influenza viruses, which are single-stranded negative sense RNA viruses that lack proof reading ability and contain segmented genomes capable of reassortment. In their study, about 2,300 influenza A virus sequences from samples collected over several decades were investigated. Their data suggest that the CpG content may fluctuate over 5% within the same year for some subtypes of influenza A virus. In contrast, in our study, we find that the extent of CpG loss in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is far less than 1% (i.e., about 2-3 of 439 CpGs are lost) in 17 months of evolution in human hosts ( fig. 1 ). Although differences in CpG content along different coding and noncoding regions of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented (Di Gioacchino et al. 2021) , our goal was to perform temporal analysis of CpG depletion at the genome scale.",

Although the possible reasons for modest CpG depletion from SARS-CoV-2 genomes during evolution in humans merit further investigation, we speculate that combinations of mutations that provide significant survival-, replication-, or infectivityadvantages may be preferentially selected over CpGdepleted variants that may provide protection from ZAPmediated restriction. It is also possible that SARS-CoV-2 genomes are already extensively CpG depleted (Digard et al. 2020; MacLean et al. 2021 ) and further loss may be potentially deleterious.",

In the ongoing pandemic, the number of infections (or number of infected individuals) is a surrogate for the number of replication cycles. In other words, the opportunity to generate mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes should increase with the number of infections. However, this does not mean that substitution rates (i.e., rate at which mutations become fixed at a population level; substitutions/site/year) at population level increase with the number of infections. In fact, substitution rates may gradually taper off during virus evolution in a host (Scholle et al. 2013) . Although mutations leading to the loss of CpGs may help the virus evade host innate immune responses, they can also be deleterious or neutral. Further, mutation rates respond to natural selection and can vary during the course of virus evolution (Duffy 2018; Peck and Lauring 2018) .",

The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections increased exponentially during the study period (supplementary fig. 1b , Supplementary Material online). The epidemic rate (i.e., rate at which transmissions occur) may influence virus evolutionary dynamics (Berry et al. 2007 ). In addition, it is also possible that the selection pressures shaping virus evolution may have varied during this 17-month period (January 2020 to May 2021). We therefore sought to understand how the number of human infections impacts CpG depletion from the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. For this purpose, we plotted CpG content (CpG numbers and CpG percentage) of full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes against number of infections for each day of the infection timeline analyzed ( fig. 2a and b) . The fulllength sequences analyzed in this study represent over 170 million documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections across the world. Interestingly, about 85% of CpG depletion occurred in SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the first one-third of documented infections ($57 million; orange grid in fig. 2 fig. 2a and b) . In contrast, there is little or no CpG depletion in the genomes available from the subsequent 114 million cases (green grid; fig. 2a and b) . This finding suggests that the rate of CpG depletion is highest during early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, gradually tapering off with increasing number of infections.",

We observed an initial rapid decline of CpGs followed by slower rates of decline with increasing number of infections. This is consistent with progressive adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in humans with increasing number of infections leading to reduced selection pressure for CpG depletion. Furthermore, our data suggest that CpG content in SARS-CoV-2 genomes has stabilized or almost reached an equilibrium when 40-50 million infections were documented world-wide ($9-11 months from the onset of the pandemic). This finding is in keeping with a previous report suggesting the lack of major changes in the CpG content in influenza B virus, a welladapted human pathogen (Greenbaum et al. 2008) . In addition, since SARS-CoV-2 genomes represent human coronaviruses with the lowest CpG content (Digard et al. 2020) , the observed stabilization of CpG content in our study may reflect the limited evolutionary space available for CpG depletion. However, our findings that the CpG content of SARS-CoV-2 remains stable for over 7 months (i.e., October 2020 to May 2021, corresponding to over 110-120 million documented human infections) do not by any means rule out the possibility of additional CpG depletion in future.",

The repeated transmission of HIV-1 from an individual in the early stages of infection reduces the window in which immune selection pressures can impact virus evolution. Although limited information is available on the extent of multiple transmissions during the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the exponential increase in number of infections along with increased transmission potential for some variants suggest increased transmission events.

Nonetheless, no evidence of increased G-to-A mutations was found in SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Simmonds 2020; Di Giorgio et al. 2020 ). APOBEC-editing may lead to the depletion of C residues from the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We mapped the changes in the percentage of the four mononucleotides (A, C, G, and U) in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes with time (supplementary fig. 2a -d, Supplementary Material online). The percentage of Cs decreased with increasing number of infections, whereas the percentage of Us increased. Importantly, the GC content (i.e., G% \u00fe C% or G \u00fe C content) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome clearly shows a downward trend with time (supplementary fig. 2e , Supplementary Material online). Hence, we asked the question if the loss of CpGs from the SARS-CoV-2 genomes is merely a result of the loss of constituent mononucleotides (i.e., Cs and Gs) or is there a role for specific selection pressures on CpG depletion? The GC content of SARS-CoV-2 genomes were significantly lower in samples collected in April and May 2021 as compared with those collected in the beginning of the pandemic ( fig. 3a ). To investigate if the depletion of CpG dinucleotide content in SARS-CoV-2 is linked to the reduction in GC content, we calculated the relative abundance of CpG dinucleotides (i.e., CpG dinucleotide content normalized to the numbers of the constituent mononucleotides; this is referred to as O/E [observed/expected] ratios). If the CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 is merely a reflection of loss of Cs and Gs from the genome, one would expect that during the 17 months of evolution, CpG O/E ratios will either: 1) almost remain constant (i.e., the number of CpGs lost is proportional to the loss of Cs and Gs) or 2) increase (i.e., if the extent of Cs and Gs lost is more pronounced than extent of CpGs lost from the genome). Nonetheless, the CpG O/E ratios were significantly lower in sequences from April and May 2021 compared with those from the beginning of the pandemic ( fig. 3b ), indicating that the depletion of CpGs is not necessarily linked to the loss of the constituent mononucleotides.",

We wanted to understand if the extent of CpG depletion from the coding region of SARS-CoV-2 is linked to the location of the CpG at specific codon positions 1-2 (i.e., CGN) or 2-3 (i.e., NCG) or 3-1 (i.e., NNC-GNN). For this purpose, we mapped the number of sequences that lost CpGs from coding regions to their position within the codon ( fig. 4c) . Notably, the median number of sequences that lost a CpG dinucleotide from codon positions 2-3 and 3-1 were significantly higher as compared with those from codon position 1-2 ( fig. 4c ). Differences in evolutionary constraints across the three codon positions are well-documented (Belalov and Lukashev 2013) . The third position in the codon is referred to as the wobble position and it may allow for nucleotide substitutions without changes in the amino acid. The increased depletion of CpGs from codon positions 2-3 and 3-1 compared with that in codon position 1-2 in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes may be due to the presence of the wobble position in both 2-3 and 3-1 positions; CpG depletion at codon position 1-2 is constrained by accompanying amino acid changes. CpG content at codon position 2-3 has a stronger influence on codon usage bias as compared with that at position 3-1 (Belalov and Lukashev 2013) . However, stronger suppression of CpGs at codon position 3-1 than at 2-3 has been documented for some viruses infecting humans (Belalov and Lukashev 2013) . For SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we found that the extent of CpG depletion from codon positions 2-3 and 3-1 was comparable ( fig. 4c ). Increasing the CpG content within codons without altering the amino acid sequence of poliovirus capsid proteins led to a reduction in virion secretion and infectivity (Burns et al. 2009 ). We believe that the significant reduction of CpG content from codon positions 2-3 and 3-1 in SARS-CoV-2 genomes may have implications on virus replication and transmission.",

However, the loss of other CpGs within the motif may not necessarily lead to the loss of ZAP-binding motifs. Therefore, we sought to investigate the association between the loss of a ZAP-binding motif and the loss of the terminal CpG site.

            "text": "We then asked the question whether the depletion of CpG dinucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is driven by the loss of CpGs from within ZAP-binding motifs. For this purpose, we compared the loss of CpGs from within ZAP-binding motifs with that from the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. As ZAP-binding motifs may be overlapping, the same CpG position may be shared by two or more motifs. Therefore, only nonoverlapping or unique CpG sites were considered for this analysis (see Materials and Methods for details). Interestingly, the median number of sequences that had lost a terminal CpG or any CpG from within a ZAP-binding motif was comparable to those that had lost a CpG from regions that lie outside of ZAP-binding motifs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome ( fig. 5c and d) . In other words, the extent of CpG depletion in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is comparable from locations within ZAP-binding motifs and the rest of the genome. Taken together, our data suggest that: 1) the loss of ZAP-binding motifs from SARS-CoV-2 genomes is primarily driven by the loss of the terminal CpG site within the motif and 2) the extent of CpG depletion for sites within and outside ZAP-binding motifs in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is comparable. Our results also suggests that the negative selection of CpGs from ZAP-binding motifs explains only a fraction of the CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes (since nearly 80% of the CpG sites in the genome are outside ZAP-binding motifs). Although we cannot rule out the existence of yet unknown ZAP-binding motifs, our findings highlight a major role for other evolutionary forces that may contribute to CpG depletion apart from ZAP. Greenbaum et al. (2009) demonstrated that the loss of CpG motifs from an A/U-rich context (i.e., (A/U)CG(A/U)) from H1N1 influenza genomes over time. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the U-content of bases flanking (three bases at the 5end and two bases at the 3end) CpG motifs was linked to the ability to induce interferon-a (IFN-a) from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Jimenez-Baranda et al. 2011) through activation of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7). Specifically, CpG motifs flanked by 4Us (e.g., UUU-CG-AU) were able to induce significantly higher levels of IFN-a as compared with CpG motifs with 1U or 2Us (e.g., AAA-CG-AU or AAU-CG-AU). Together, these findings explain the selective loss of CpGs in an A/U-rich context from influenza virus genomes. Therefore, for CpG motifs that occurred outside the ZAP-binding motifs, we investigated if the loss of CpGs occurred specifically in a A/U-rich context. Unlike in H1N1 influenza genomes, we found that the proportion of sequences that lost CpG motifs which are flanked by A/U (i.e., (A/U)CG(A/U)) were comparable to those that lost CpG motifs in a non-(A/U)-rich context (i.e., (C/G)CG(C/G)) ( fig. 6a) . Interestingly, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 sequences that lost CpG motifs flanked by 4Us (i.e., 4Us in the motif NNN-CG-NN) were significantly higher than those that lost CpG motifs flanked by 1 to 3Us or no Us ( fig. 6b ). This finding provides evidence that during evolution in humans, SARS-CoV-2 genomes selectively lose CpG motifs that occur in a Urich context to avoid immune recognition by TLR7.",

Each of the VOCs is defined by lineage-specific mutations. The full-length SARS-CoV-2 sequences analyzed were classified into alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-variant; the rest of the sequences that are not classified as a VOC (as in GISAID; supplementary table 3, Supplementary Material online) are referred as \"Non-VOCs.\" The CpG content of the alpha-, beta-, delta-variants, and non-VOCs were significantly lower as compared with the sequences from the beginning of the pandemic (January-February 2020) ( fig. 7 and supplementary The number of sequences that lost CpG dinucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were analyzed.

Since the gamma variant had higher CpG content, we wanted to understand if this could be a result of gamma variantdefining mutations that lead to an increase in CpG content (i.e., by creating a new CpG). On analyzing mutations associated with the alpha-and beta-variant, we found that none of them resulted in a loss or a gain of CpGs. However, mutations associated with the delta variant lead to the gain of two CpGs (T22917G and C23604G) and the loss of one CpG (G15451A). Interestingly, the gamma variantdefining mutations did not lead to a loss of CpGs but were associated with the gain of two CpGs (A22812C and C28512G), thus explaining, at least in part, the higher CpG content of this variant. Our findings on the CpG content of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs suggests that: 1) the CpG content may vary across VOCs, but all variants except for the gamma variant have lower CpG content compared with sequences from the beginning of the pandemic, 2) some of the VOClineage defining mutations may lead to a net gain in CpG content. Although CpG depletion from SARS-CoV-2 genomes may help the virus better survive ZAP-mediated restriction and facilitate optimal codon usage, the retention of mutations leading to CpG gain in the gamma variant sheds light on the delicate balance among the evolutionary forces that regulate CpG content in virus genomes. Importantly, our findings suggest that mutations resulting in the gain of new CpGs may be retained if they confer advantages such as increased transmissibility or reducing the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies. Clearly, these advantages outweigh the benefits provided by CpG deselection.",

In other words, our data suggest that the emergence of all the four VOCs coincides with the period corresponding to the slowing and stabilization of CpGs from SARS-CoV-2 genomes. It is evident that VOCs had no role in the initial rapid depletion of CpGs from SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We have two speculative, but intriguing explanations based on the coincidence of the timelines for the emergence of VOCs and the slowing of CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. First, it is possible that the emergence of VOCs is defined by a specific combination of mutations that confer several advantages to the virus including transmissibility, fitness, and reduced neutralization may obliterate the need for further CpG depletion. Second, it is also possible that the depletion of CpG content below a critical threshold is a prerequisite to facilitate the emergence of VOCs. Although both the explanations are no more than speculations, the coincidence of timelines for the emergence of all the VOCs and the slowing of CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes merits further investigation and it should not be dismissed as a mere coincidence.",

Analysis of the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that CpG depletion is more pronounced at codon positions 2-3 and 3-1 than at codon position 1-2. We also identify that the loss of the terminal CpG from ZAP-binding motifs is the major driving force for the deselection of these motifs from the SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Similarly, we also identified CpGs in a A/Urich context by mapping motifs flanked by A/U (i.e., (A/ U)CG(A/U)) and mapping the U-content of five flanking bases (i.e., NNN-CG-NN). These (A/U)-rich motifs have been described previously (Greenbaum et al. 2009; Jimenez-Baranda et al. 2011) . ZAP-binding motifs were excluded for analysis of CpG motifs in an (A/U)-rich context. For line plots in figure 2 , the minimum resolution in time for sequences analyzed is 1 day and since each day corresponds to many available sequences, mean value for individual days were calculated. We have data on the number of cases from January 22, 2020. However, there are a total 15 days in between January 1, 2020 and January 21, 2020 for which we have sequence data but no data on the number of infections. Thus, the average values for 52 sequences submitted until January 21, 2020 were analyzed and used as the baseline (day one). We had a total of 497 points (a point for each day) from January 21, 2020 to May 31, 2021. For each day of the study period, we plotted the CpG content of the sequences analyzed against the total number of documented infections in the world (cumulative) at the end of that day (blue line in fig. 2 ). For example, on August 9, 2020, we have 630 sequences which were averaged out for the metrics (e.g., CpG numbers; plotted on the left Y axis) and cumulative cases at the end of that day stands at 19.87 million (plotted on X axis). Further, for smoothening, we plotted a tandem, overlapping 10-unit (10-day) moving average on the same graph (orange line in fig. 2 ), along with 95% confidence interval of this moving average (green bands in fig. 2 ).

Over the course of the pandemic, a statistically significant decrease in GC content was observed. Contrasting trends in the relative abundance of CpG and GpC dinucleotides were noted; CpG O/E ratios decreased, whereas GpC O/E ratios increased during the 17-month period. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the medians. O/E, observed/expected.

Different colors are used along the x axis to indicate genes/ORFs. For overlapping ORFs, segments are colored to half the height. The graph shows that majority of the CpG dinucleotides are conserved in over 99% of the sequences analyzed. (b) Gene-wise analysis of CpG loss: the number of CpGs within each gene is indicated on the x axis. Box-and-whiskers plots show the gene-wise distribution of sequences that lost CpG dinucleotide(s). Outliers are shown as black dots. The extent of CpG depletion varies greatly within and across genes. (c) CpGs within coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 are grouped on the basis of codon positions.
