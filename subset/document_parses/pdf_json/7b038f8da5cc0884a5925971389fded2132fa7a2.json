Briefly, RT-PCR was performed with the viral RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs as template to amplify conserved regions in the viral genome. Next, PfAgo, guide DNAs and molecular beacons in appropriate buffer were added to the PCR products, followed by incubating at 95 \u2022 C for 20-30 min. Subsequently, the fluorescence signal was detected. This method was named as SARS-CoV-2 PAND. The whole procedure is accomplished in approximately an hour with the using time of the Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument shortened from >1 h to only 3-5 min per batch in comparison with RT-qPCR, hence the shortage of the expensive Real-time PCR instrument is alleviated. Moreover, this platform was also applied to identify SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutant due to its single-nucleotide specificity. The diagnostic results of clinic samples with SARS-CoV-2 PAND displayed 100% consistence with RT-qPCR test.",

            "text": "The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 results from a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has already caused more than 68 million confirmed cases and 1.5 million deaths (https://ncov.dxy.cn/ncovh5/v iew/pneumonia). To slow down the spread of COVID-19, the infected individuals need to be identified and quarantined efficiently. Molecular diagnosis approaches, including nucleic acid and serological tests offer the possibility for fast pinpoint of infected patients (Shen et al., 2020) . Serological test is rapid and requires minimal equipment. But it may take several days for the patient to show a detectable antibody response after onset of initial symptoms (W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020) . On the other hand, nucleic acid detecting method directly identifies conserved sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and provides the earliest and most sensitive detection of the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is still the primary method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (Esbin et al., 2020) . Currently, the most recommended nucleic acid test is RT-qPCR. The RT-qPCR kits include reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase, target-specific primers and TaqMan probes. These probes are short oligonucleotides containing 5 \u2032 -fluorophore and 3 \u2032 -quencher and anneal to the target DNA. During the extension step of each thermocycle, Taq polymerase moves along the DNA template and degrades the annealed probe through its 5 \u2032 to 3 \u2032 exonuclease activity. The fluorophore is cleaved off and released from being quenched. The change of fluorescence signal is measured at the end of each thermocycle. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the worldwide RT-qPCR testing capability increased dramatically and reached millions of tests per day. Even though RT-qPCR test is rapid, specific and economic, it takes hours to perform and requires specialized reagents, expensive equipment and skilled operators . To overcome these limitations, alternative nucleic acid detecting methods, especially programmable endonuclease based methods were innovated (Ding et al., 2020) (Guo et al., 2020) (Hou et al., 2020) (Joung et al., 2020) (Lucia et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "PfAgo is a prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo) from Pyrococcus furiosus (Swarts DC et al., 2015) . As a nucleic-acid-guided endonuclease, PfAgo prefers to cleave DNA substrate under the guidance of short 5 \u2032 -phosphorylated single-strand DNA without the presence of protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). In 2019, we developed a PfAgo (Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute) mediated nucleic acid detection method (PAND) (He et al., 2019) . In the present study, we simplified PAND and applied it on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants (Fig. 1) . The viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs and conserved regions in the viral genome are amplified through RT-PCR. Next, PfAgo, guide DNA and molecular beacon in appropriate buffer were added and mixed with the PCR product, followed by incubating at 95 \u2022 C for 20-30 min. During this process, PfAgo cleaved the target DNA under the guidance of the input guide and generated a short 5 \u2032 -phosphorylated single-stranded DNA, which in turn, bonded to apo form of PfAgo molecules and served as the guide for the second round of site-directed cleavage to complementary molecular beacons, leading to the split of the quencher from the fluorophore. Subsequently, the fluorescence signal was detected with Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument or fluorescence spectrometer. This method was named as SARS-CoV-2 PAND. The sensitivity of this method reached 1 copy per reaction. SARS-CoV-2 PAND is compatible with RT-PCR testing reagent easily available, but the working time of Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR instruments is shortened from >1 h to only 3-5 min per batch in comparison with RT-qPCR test, hence, solves the problem of the shortage of the expensive Real-time PCR instruments. Meanwhile, the targets are amplified with easy-handled regular RT-PCR, followed by a simple enzymatic digestion and no skilled operator is required. Moreover, one shortcoming of RT-qPCR test is the high false-negative rate (Younes et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 PAND is more sensitive and reproducible because amplification of the targets is performed in a RT-PCR system without the interference of TaqMan probes. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 PAND is capable of identifying a single-base mutation in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, which cannot be accomplished with RT-qPCR assay.",

The key point of SARS-CoV-2 PAND is the efficient cleavage of PfAgo/input guide complex to the target DNA. Therefore, we designed 36 guides covering the full amplifying regions of both N and ORF1ab and tested the cleavage activity of corresponding PfAgo/guide complexes to the ssDNA targets ( Fig. S2; Fig. S3; Fig. S4 ). Accordingly, guides gN 17 and gO 31 were chosen for SARS-CoV-2 PAND due to the high activity of the complexes. The cleavage sites and the sequences of guides were indicated in Fig. 2A and B. To detect N and ORF1ab gene with SARS-CoV-2 PAND, PfAgo protein, guide DNA (gN17 or gO31), molecular beacon (MB-N or MB-O) were added directly to the RT-PCR product amplified using pUC57-ORF1ab and pUC57-N spike-in samples as template since PfAgo demonstrated high activity in RT-PCR buffer supplemented with Mn 2+ (Fig. S5) . Obvious elevation of fluorescence signals was detected with both targets in comparison with the negative controls ( Fig. 2C and  D) , which proved the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 PAND. Meanwhile, two more input guides (gN 17-2 and gN 17-3 for N gene; gO 31-2 and gO 31-3 for ORF1ab gene) were designed for each target based on the principle of PAND (Fig. S6) . However, the intensity of the fluorescence signal showed no obvious increase. Therefore, we established the workflow for SARS-CoV-2 PAND with only one input guide (Fig. 1) . It is worth noting that the gn for N gene is 91 nt, with a 75-nt 3 \u2032 -unpaired regions to the molecular beacon ( Fig. 2A) , which is much longer than previous reported guides of Argonaute protein (Dayeh et al., 2018) (Hegge et al., 2019) (Kaya et al., 2016) (Kuzmenko et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 PAND was also applied for large-scale identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The D614G point mutation in spike (S) protein caused by a single-based mutation at nt23403 was chosen as the target (Pachetti et al., 2020) . Input guides targeting the wild-type and mutant locus were screened and the result indicated gWT1 and gMT1 were able to guide the site-directed cleavage to wild-type and the mutant with high specificity, respectively (Fig. S10A, B) . Next, SARS-CoV-2 PAND was performed with the mock samples and the result indicated gWT1 and gMT1 were able to distinguish mutant and wild-type distinctly through comparing the difference between the readouts (Fig. S10C) . Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 PAND was designed based on these two input guides (Fig. S11 ) and applied to identify D614G point mutation of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples which were identified as positive in the last session. The readouts of wild-type for all 36 samples were significantly higher than mutant, which indicated that all the samples were wild-type ( Fig. 5C ). This result is consistent with previous reports that this mutant was discovered mainly in Europe after February 2020 (Korber et al., 2020) . In rare cases, two or more alleles may co-exist in one sample, and the alleles in low concentration are hardly detectable. Under this circumstance, NAVIGATER (Nucleic Acid enrichment Via DNA Guided Argonaute from Thermus thermophilus), a TtAgo mediated nucleic acid enrichment method , can be coupled with our method to detect trace amount of rare alleles.",
