However, adoption of technology in supply chain and retail stores is still low and there is a great potential to adopt computer-vision based technology for identification and classification of fruits. We have chosen banana fruit to build a computer vision based model to carry out the following three use-cases (a) Identify Banana from a given image (b) Determine sub-family or variety of Banana (c) Determine the quality of Banana. Successful execution of these use-cases using computer-vision model would greatly help with overall inventory management automation, quality control, quick and efficient weighing and billing which all are manual labor intensive currently. In this work, we suggest a machine learning pipeline that combines the ideas of CNNs, transfer learning, and data augmentation towards improving Banana fruit sub family and quality image classification. We have built a basic CNN and then went on to tune a MobileNet Banana classification model using a combination of self-curated and publicly-available dataset of 3064 images. The results show an overall 93.4% and 100% accuracy for sub-family/variety and for quality test classifications respectively.",

This high production serves both domestic consumption, high amounts of exports and also processed food. Domestic purchase and consumption are being slowly penetrated by eCommerce delivery giants like BigBasket, Grofers and Amazon Fresh who rely on technology not just for the commerce platform but also in entire supply chain, packaging and delivery. At the same time, retailer shops are also gradually adopting technology at quality checks, weighing and point of sale. Less manual interventions at various stages both to save cost and reduce manual handling are gaining importance, more so after COVID-induced behaviors became the norm.",

The key takeaway from the existing work was the model architectures and hyper parameters. In [6] [5] have tried to judge the quality of lemons using the images from Fruit 360 dataset using a publicly-available dataset of 2690 images. Due to lack of data they have used GANs to enrich their dataset. It proposed the use of pretrained VGG16 as a model with a small batch size to accommodate it on commodity hardware. It was found that appending a 4096 neuron fully connected layer to the convolutional layers leads to an image classification accuracy of 83.77%. The model was then trained on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network on the training data for 2000 epochs, and it learned to generate relatively realistic images. Grad-CAM analysis of the model trained on real photographs shows that the synthetic images can exhibit classifiable characteristics such as shape, mould, and gangrene. A higher image classification accuracy of 88.75% is then attained by augmenting the training with synthetic images.",

Results and the performance of the proposed system are compared with various techniques such as the SVM, the naive Bayes, the KNN, the decision tree, and discriminant analysis classifiers. Results reveal that the proposed system has the highest overall recognition rate, which is 97.75%, among other techniques. Classification of Banana Fruits Using Deep Learning, 2020, Ahmed F.

However, on assessment of existing open datasets, we realized that to make this useful for the Indian context and also to address the quality prediction use-case, we needed some new data which needs to be collected from scratch. We addressed this by procuring different sub-families of bananas from the market, clicked pictures of them and created our own dataset required for the project. We created about 1500+ images of the banana dataset using these pictures. The subfamilies that were used are Elakki, Red Banana, Robusta, Nendram and Hill Banana. We further augmented this by using about 800 banana images data from Fruits 360 dataset for Robusta and Red Banana. We also added some negative use-case images of other fruits, so that we can address the first use-case of identifying Banana from the rest of the fruits. For this purpose, we clicked pictures of fruits like sweet lime, pomegranate and apple and added them as Other Fruits in the dataset. All the pictures were clicked with plain background so that the noise level in learning is reduced, and below Table 1 ",

While we have addressed the issue of identifying a single banana/bunch of bananas, we are yet to include the option of capturing these images if present inside any other form of wrapping. Since the regular practice is of first billing followed by packing into bags, we have not explored this option and could be explored as part of future work to make this more practical to use in the market. An addition to further work would be to include quality check for varieties other than Elakki and to test for two or more varieties of bananas in the same frame. Another drawback to be considered is that our model would classify fake bananas or any object with the shape and color of a banana as a real fruit. This is due to the fact that we have assumed only real fruit images would be fed into the model and have limited its working to identifying skin/surface level features/defects only. Further on the model deployment and production, creating a REST api, predicting and maintenance are part of future work of this paper.",

There are three main points we would like to discuss as a closing note of this paper, 1) Hardware requirements -As for the hardware required for deployment in businesses, the model can be deployed on commodity hardware and is suitable for mid-size retail stores as they can leverage this product without huge setup costs. 2) Part of overall inventory management -The model can be used as part of overall inventory automation.",

Fruits images were acquired by a digital camera and then the background of each image was removed by splitand-merge algorithm and further resized/down sampled to 256x256. The color histogram, texture and shape features of each fruit image were extracted to compose a feature space. In total, there are 79 features (64 color features + 7 texture features + 8 shape features) extracted from a prescribed image. PCA is applied on this feature space to reduce dimensionality and then it is split into training and test sets. The experimental results on the 1653 color fruit images from the 18 categories of fruits achieved a classification accuracy of 89.1%. Fruit recognition from images using deep learning 2 Dec 2017 \u00b7 Horea Mure\u015fan, Mihai Oltean[18] Introduces the Fruit 360 dataset with high quality images of different fruits. The dataset contains 61934 images of fruits spanning across 90 fruits. The fruits are planted on a low speed motor with a speed of 3rpm and a short video is recorded for 20 secs which is then broken into different frames and added as a dataset. A white sheet of paper is used as the background for collecting the images. A separate algorithm was applied to get the background appear the same in different lighting conditions.",
