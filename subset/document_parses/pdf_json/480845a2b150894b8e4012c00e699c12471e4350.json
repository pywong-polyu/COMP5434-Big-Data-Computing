The protection provided by symptomatic infection was also considered in terms of the population effectiveness of vaccination as well as the waning protection and ratio and infectivity of viral variants. To represent changes in public behavior, public mobility and interactions through social media were also included in the analysis. Findings: Comparing the observed and estimated new DPC in Tel Aviv, Israel, the parameters characterizing vaccination effectiveness and the waning protection from infection were well estimated; the vaccination effectiveness of the second dose after 5 months and the third dose after two weeks from infection by the delta variant were 0.24 and 0.95, respectively. Using the extracted parameters regarding vaccination effectiveness, new cases in three prefectures of Japan were replicated. Interpretations: The key factor influencing the prevention of COVID-19 transmission is the vaccination effectiveness at the population level, which considers the waning protection from vaccination rather than the percentage of fully vaccinated people. The threshold of the efficiency at the population level was estimated as 0.3 in Tel Aviv and 0.4 in Tokyo, Osaka, and Aichi. Moreover, a weighting scheme associated with infectivity results in more accurate forecasting by the infectivity model of viral variants. Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered model and its extensions, were used to estimate the rate of viral transmission. Due to the global transmission of this new virus, a more sophisticated forecasting model based on machine learning approaches is necessary. However, based on a review search using SCOPUS and Web of Science, long-term forecasting and projection models that consider vaccination effectiveness and different viral variants have not been developed. The search strategy we conducted is included in the Supplementary Materials. Added value of this study: Previously, it was possible to estimate new positive cases using few factors in a mathematical manner. After large-scale vaccination campaigns and the emergence of different viral variants, the estimation has become complicated. There are two points where the prediction is not straightforward: the timing of the infection upsurge and the potential protection through vaccination. The infection upsurge can be determined by including parameters regarding the infectivity index. For protection conferred by vaccination, real world information is limited.",

Due to vaccination, the number of daily positive cases (DPC) has decreased in several countries.

The proposed approach, which was based on insights and data from regions that have achieved high vaccination rates, can help optimize vaccination requirements in regions with low vaccination rates. Considering that more than 65% of countries still have vaccination rates below 70% (10 Jan. 2022, WHO), these countries may apply protocols from other countries that have achieved high vaccination rates. Moreover, the developed model can provide a clearer understanding of potential booster shot requirements and when they should be administered.",
