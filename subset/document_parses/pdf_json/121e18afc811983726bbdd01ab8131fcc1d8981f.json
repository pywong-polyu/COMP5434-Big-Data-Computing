            "text": "Physical distancing has been argued as one of the effective means to combat the spread of COVID-19 before a vaccine or therapeutic drug becomes available. How far people can be spatially separated is partly behavioral but partly constrained by population density. Most models developed to predict the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. do not include population density explicitly. This study shows that population density is an effective predictor of cumulative infection cases in the U.S. at the county level. Daily cumulative cases by counties are converted into 7-day moving averages. Treating the weekly averages as the dependent variable and the county population density levels as the explanatory variable, both in logarithmic scale, this study assesses how population density has shaped the distributions of infection cases across the U.S. from early March to late May, 2020. Additional variables reflecting the percentages of African Americans, Hispanic-Latina, and older adults in logarithmic scale are also included. Spatial regression models with a spatial error specification are also used to account for the spatial spillover effect. Population density alone accounts for 57% of the variation (R-squared) in the aspatial models and up to 76% in the spatial models. Adding the three population subgroup percentage variables raised the R-squared of the aspatial models to 72% and the spatial model to 84%. The influences of the three population subgroups were substantial, but changed over time, while the contributions of population density have been quite stable after the first several weeks, ascertaining the importance of population density in shaping the spread of infection in individual counties, and in their neighboring counties. Thus, population density and sizes of vulnerable population subgroups should be explicitly included in transmission models that predict the impacts of COVID-19, particularly at the sub-county level.",

            "text": "In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are still uncertain about the pathways how one may contract the virus [1] [2] [3] . Despite the lack of this critical knowledge, numerous studies, published and on-going, try to develop models to better predict various disease statistics, such as the reproduction number (R t ), but ultimately to predict the size of the infected population and causalities. With no certainty on the details of the transmission processes, social demonstrated at both the state and county levels in the U.S. [18] . There is a need to ascertain the importance of population density in modeling the spread of diseases. The main objective of the current study is to evaluate the influence of population density on COVID-19 infection in the U.S. More specifically, the objective is not to estimate the transmission rate, but to assess the role of population density on the total impacts of the infection-i.e., the totals of infected populations. One may postulate that counties with larger populations are likely to have more cases, and these counties with more people also have higher population density levels. Based on the 2010 Census data of the 3,144 U.S. counties excluding Puerto Rico, the correlation between population size and population density is only 0.33, a moderately low level. Thus, a connection between population density and total infected cases has yet to be established at the county level. While the pandemic may be understood from multiple perspectives, one may perceive the pandemic as a spatiotemporal process operated at multiple geographical scales with humans as the vectors spreading the disease. The infection intruded the U.S. starting from a few entry points, which may be regarded as seeds. These entry points, assuming that the disease was imported, are major international transportation hubs or cities. As the infection spread from these seeds to smaller settlements, more cases continued to import through major population centers. It is not the intent of this paper to address the detailed spatiotemporal diffusion of the virus. Our study intends to assess the influence of population density in controlling the spread of COVID-19 infection at the macro-geographical scale over time. Thus, we adopt a spatiotemporal framework, evaluating the importance of population density in affecting the infection level over time, from the initial importation period to the time passing the peak of the infection \"curve.\"",

In addition, we found significant spatial spillover effect of infection at the county level. Accounting the spatial spillover, over 76% of the variation of cumulative cases among counties can be explained by population density alone around week 13 of the pandemic. While adding sizes of older adults, African American and Hispanic populations in logarithmic scale to the models raised the explanatory power to about 84%, population density still play a significant and steady role in controlling the size of infected population.",

We acquired that dataset and examined the confirmed cases by counties in the U.S. from February to May, 2020 (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). We found that for certain weeks, the data have gross errors. For this study, we used the data provided by USAFacts instead (https://usafacts.org/). Data from this source have been used by several portals, such as the spatiotemporal rapid response gateway to COVID-19 (https:// covid-19.stcenter.net/), US COVID Atlas (https://geodacenter.github.io/covid/) provided by the University of Chicago's Center for Spatial Data Science (CSDS) and Databricks COVID-19 resource hub(https://databricks.com/databricks-covid-19-resource-hub). Because the current study hypothesizes that population density is a major factor influencing the distribution of infection across counties, the outcome variable used, different from some studies that predict new cases daily or over a period, is (the logarithm of) the number of cumulative confirmed cases by counties. This indicator reflects reasonably the magnitude of morbidity impact of the epidemic. In addition, many studies and models use the total numbers of cases [11, 12] , as these numbers can inform the public about the severity of the outbreak.",

Although the U.S. Census Bureau conducted the decennial census in April 2020, the data are not available yet. Therefore, we use the county population counts of 2010 decennial census to compute the population density of each county. Despite we do not have the most updated population counts, the variation of density across enumeration units is more important than the actual counts to assess the influence of population density on the numbers of confirmed cases. In addition, our units of analysis are counties. Population counts at the county levels between 2010 and 2020 should be different, but the relative differences should not have changed dramatically over a decade. One may recommend using the American Community Survey (ACS) data to derive population density. However, the latest release of ACS provides only 1-year estimates for 2018, not 2020. Also, errors in ACS estimates are not uniform across areal units, and thus, errors of estimate need to be considered when using these ACS estimates [19] . This requirement would complicate the use of ACS estimates tremendously in our study. Therefore, ACS data were not used.",

Covaried with their occupation characteristics, these two subgroups have higher exposure risks than other population subgroups.

To remove the fluctuation and derive a more stable trend, many authorities have been reporting 5-day or 7-day moving averages. In our analysis, we used the 7-day moving average, which potentially accounts for the incubation period and the lapse between the time when symptoms first appear and the infection being diagnosed [20] . To ensure that the frequency distribution will not be influenced severely by outliers, we took a natural logarithm transformation of daily confirmed cases [20] . Specifically, we took the natural logarithm of (x i + 1), where x i is the cumulative count of confirmed cases on date i. Adding 1 to the frequency is to avoid taking the natural logarithm of 0 (which is undefined) at the expense of inflating all counts by 1. These natural logarithms of cumulative counts for seven consecutive days were used to compute the 7-day moving average. Therefore, this indicator is labeled as ma(lct). As the 7-day moving averages remove day-today fluctuation, there is no need to analyze the changes in frequencies from day to day. Thus, we used the ma(lct) value of every seven days to cover the study period from January 22 (week 1 in our data) to May 20 (week 18), 2020. However, before March, fewer than thirty counties have confirmed cases. Therefore, some of the statistical analyses used only data starting from March 4, 2020 (week 7).",

These transportation centers and nearby areas do not necessarily have the highest population density levels. As infection cases started in these locations, these counties might have larger numbers of cumulative cases than those counties with later onsets of the epidemic. We have evaluated the influence of early onsets in affecting the number of cumulative cases found in counties throughout the study period (18 weeks) and found that initial infections only influenced the numbers of cumulative cases in early weeks, but the influence dissipated in latter weeks.

Population concentration and the spread of diseases are not bounded by administrative or statistical units. Our analysis clearly shows that spatial regression models, both the bivariate and the multivariate models, perform better than the classical or aspatial regression models. Besides being more statistically appropriate to account for spatial dependency, these spatial models conceptually consider the situations in neighboring counties. Methodologically, such consideration would moderate a potential problematic issue in our modeling framework. Conceptually, our models explored the relationship between (the log of) cumulative cases and (log of) population density of counties, hypothesizing that high density is related to more cases. Thus, population density reflects the situation of the population over a region-how closely people are packed together. Operationally, demarcations of U.S. county boundaries are often the results of unique local historical developments with little reference to population distribution. Some counties are fundamentally cities with small area but high population density. For instance, the Commonwealth of Virginia has 38 independent cities, most of which are relatively small in area with relatively high population density, but they have an official status equivalent to the other 95 counties in Virginia. Some of them are surrounded by low density counties in the rural regions while some are surrounded by high density counties. On the other hand, some major inner cities are dissected by several counties, each is constrained in area but are highly populated. Examples of these include Washington, DC., and the four New York counties of New York, Kings, Queens and Bronx. Therefore, these high-density counties are part of the integrated urban structure but are \"cookie-cut\" to form separated administrative-statistical entities. Their population sizes can be large or small, depending on how large the footprints these counties occupy. Mathematically, for high density counties with relatively small to moderate population sizes, our proposed models may predict cumulative infected cases larger than the population sizes of these counties (although predicting total cases is not the purpose of the current study). These anomalies, therefore, may be regarded as artifacts of county boundary delineation, but not the general outcomes of the analysis.",

As spatial models also consider the situations of neighboring units, these small high-density cities or counties are \"moderated\" by the neighbors' situations in the modeling framework. If neighboring counties have high density similar to these small highdensity counties, the predicted high cumulative counts from the small high-density counties are indicative of the regional situation.

If relatively reliable COVID-19 statistics are available at the sub-county level across the country, models with higher spatial resolutions would be preferred as the COVID-19 transmission also involves spatial processes at the sub-county geographical scales [24] . While population density is a reasonable predictor of the numbers of cases, most prediction models referred to by CDC do not consider population density explicitly [11] . Most of these models use some estimates for contact parameters. Even when population density is considered, only some general measures such as the state-level density are used. However, as argued above, population density level may vary tremendously even within a county. Using the county level population density fails to account for the local situations, not to mention using the state level population density. On the other hand, population density can be computed for multiple geographical scales, even down to the local community and neighborhood levels such as census block groups and blocks.

Some of these missing variables may reflect particular situations of selected counties. For instance, in certain weeks, some counties with relatively high cumulative incident rates have relatively low population density levels. Detailed examination of these counties found that they belong to one of the following situations: counties with a few cases, but with very small population sizes; counties with large numbers of cases from institutions including elderly communities, correction facilities and industrial facilities; counties with small local communities but with visitors and tourists as vectors spreading to the local populations. Removing these counties from the analyses raised the R-squared levels slightly, supporting the notion that population density imposes robust control over the macro-scale structure of the distributions of cases across counties.

The research presented here identifies the strong positive association between population density and the number of cases. Logically, higher population density makes distancing more difficult. Therefore, this policy may need to be enforced differentially according to population density levels. For areas with high population density, more stringent policies or implementations of distancing may be considered, but for lower density areas, enforcing distancing may not be necessary. Maps in Fig 2 show that as of May 26, 2020, more than 200 counties in the U.S. still did not have confirmed cases and these counties are low population density counties.

Although high-density environments make distancing more challenging, smart human behaviors may reduce the detrimental effects of high density in the epidemic setting, but ignorant behaviors may amplify damages. People living in high-density environments such as inner cities and major urban centers need to be constantly reminded what to avoid and why. Another major finding in the current study confirms the significant contributions of older adult, African American and Hispanic-Latina population sizes toward infection cases. The presence of these three population subgroups together with a highdensity environment could have a synergetic effect on infection spread. Local communities or geographic regions possessing these characteristics should enforce distancing policies stringently and closely monitor for potential outbreaks.",
