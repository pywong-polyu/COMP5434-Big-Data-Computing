The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses the ACE2 receptor as the entry point to the host cells. ARBs/ACEIs which are widely used in elderly patients, have been found to be associated with overexpression of ACE2.To decrease the severity of COVID-19 infection, ARB/ ACEI should be switched to another class drug not known to cause a rise in ACE2 until the COVID-19 infection subsides. Specific human immunoglobulin can be tried for COVID-19 patients with critical conditions under supervision.",

            "text": "On 11 March 2020, the WHO informed that COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 can be characterized as a pandemic. Hoffmann et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for host cell entry [1] . Elderly people are found to be more susceptible to this infection [2] . This indicates a possible link in elderly patients of increased ACE2 levels to some preexisting comorbid conditions. Zhang et al. found that the common comorbid conditions associated with COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 were hypertension and diabetes mellitus [3] . Earlier studies by Wang et al. and Furuhashi et al. have found that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have been associated with overexpression of ACE2. This points towards a possible link between the severity of COVID-19 and use of ARB and ACEI [4, 5] . [5] . ARB and ACEI are widely used as one of the first-line drugs in hypertensive diabetic patients, diabetic nephropathy, and congestive cardiac failure, etc. These are very commonly witnessed comorbidities associated with many elderly patients. Hoffmann et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 as a receptor to enter the host cell, and the presence of overexpression of ACE2 can lead to a more severe form of COVID-19 infection [1] . This might be a possible explanation of why elderly patients with hypertension and diabetes are more affected by SARS-CoV-2 and why mortality rates are higher among them [6] .",

This should only happen following careful consideration of all possible complications resulting from a temporary change in drug. 5. Specific immunoglobulin from cured patients of COVID-19 should be collected and, under strict supervision, used for critically ill COVID-19-infected patients. In future, this may be considered as a standard therapy protocol for the treatment of any unkown viral pandemic.",
