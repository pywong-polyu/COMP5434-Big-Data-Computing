However, non-NP collection routes, such as anterior nasal swabs (NS), may be preferred based on patient comfort and potential decreased infection risk to the healthcare worker [2, 4] . The existing literature is mixed regarding the comparability of different sample collection methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection [2, 5] , including whether such differences change with time post-symptom onset or may simply be explained by differences in collection adequacy. Moreover, there are limited data on the performance of rectal swabs (RS) compared to upper respiratory specimens for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus [6] .",

Beginning in July 2020, participants were offered the option of at-home NS collection if they were unable to present for inperson collection. Inpatients had swabs collected on day 0, 3, 7 and then weekly thereafter, if they continued to be hospitalized. NS were self-collected, whereas OP and NP were collected by clinic staff, and RS were either self-or clinic staff-collected. As concurrent, standardized swab collections were required for comparison, we excluded results from clinical specimens collected prior to enrollment into this study. qPCR was performed on study samples using the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) CDC qPCR Probe Assay research use only kit (Cat. # 10006770, produced by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). Two regions of the nucleocapsid (N) gene are targeted with the assay (N1 and N2), and an additional primer/probe is included to detect the human Ribonuclease P gene (RP) in the samples as a quality control measure. Samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values of <40 for both N1 and N2 were considered to be SARS-CoV-2 positive consistent with the instructions for use. Viral RNA load (genome equivalents (GE)/reaction) were determined using standard curves specific to each assay plate. Each curve was calculated based on at least three dilutions of known SARS-CoV-2 gene copy numbers. These plate specific curves represent the relationship between Ct and viral copy number for each plate and then allowed for conversion of Ct values to GE/reaction for each swab specimen [8] .",

RP gene Ct was higher in the alternative swab types. The majority of paired samples (N=420; 55.6%) were collected between 14-and 30-days post-symptom onset, while 29.8% (N=225) were collected within between 7 and 13 days, and 14.6% (N=110) were collected within 7 days (Table 1). The median days post-symptom onset for the collections in the first week post symptom onset was 4 days. When analyzed separately by days post-symptom onset category, N1 and N2 quantities were consistently higher in NP samples as compared with OP and NS samples in the first two weeks post-symptom onset, but they were not statistically significantly different in the 14+ day period (Supplementary Figure 2). When compared by agreement category (concordant NP+/NS+ and discordant NP+/NS-), concordant samples were found to have higher virus quantity than discordant samples (Supplementary Figure 3). The results were similar for those samples that were positive for the alternative types and negative for the NP swabs (data not shown). The EPICC study introduced the option of self-collection of nasal swabs at home in July 2020, thus allowing for comparison of the different settings (clinical vs home collection of nasal swabs), and no differences were observed in the amount of virus detected in the different settings (SupplementaryFigure 4).",
