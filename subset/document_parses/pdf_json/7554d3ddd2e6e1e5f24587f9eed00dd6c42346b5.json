The start date of the follow-up was the day they 110 received the medication. There were no differences in censorship for hospital discharge in 111 both treated and untreated groups. We tested the proportional-hazards assumption on the basis 112 of Schoenfeld residuals. This model may produce biased effect estimates when there are time-113 dependent confounders, which are affected by previous treatment or exposure. In this study, 114 the CRS status is both a time-dependent confounder of the causal effect of the treatment on 115 survival and is affected by past treatment [34, 35] . We thus conducted a marginal structural 116 model to estimate the causal effect of tocilizumab on the severe COVID-19 patients. We 117 carried out an unweighted pooled logistic regression, treating each person-day as an 118 observation (model 2). We fitted a pooled logistic regression weighted by the inverse-119 probability-of-treatment (IPWT). Each patient in the above logistic model received a time-120 varying weight inversely proportional to the estimated probability of having his/her own 121 observed history of tocilizumab initiation, as described [34, 36] . This weighting means that 122 observations on the same subject will correlate, we therefore used the robust standard errors 123 for clustering. Follow-up start day was the day of admission. 124",

Second, CRP and HDL levels increased according to disease severity 139 (CRS1<CRS2<CRS3), while lymphocyte concentrations were inversely correlated to this 140 pattern (Table 2). These results support the CRS stage definition, since inflammation-141 associated factors are associated to COVID-19 severity [3], and hypoxemia could exacerbate 142 inflammatory progression [37]. Third, SpO 2 levels at baseline and after oxygen 143 supplementation followed the CRS stage severity graduation (Table 2). SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratios were 144 obtained for CRS1, CRS2 and CRS3 patients on the basis of SpO 2 limit values, as FiO 2 was 145 35% for CRS1, while all CRS2 and CRS3 patients received FiO 2 =50% or MV after ICU 146 admission (Table 2). CRS stages were correlated to ARDS development, since SpO 2 /FiO 2 147 cutoffs of 100<200<300 predict ARDS [38]. Thus, for CRS1, SpO 2 /FiO 2 reflected lower 148 probability for ARDS and higher probability for CRS2 and CRS3 stages. Equivalent 149 PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios were estimated from SPO 2 /FiO 2 values [39] (Table 2) and were cautiously 150 considered, since they were not directly obtained. Thus, CRS1 stage corresponded to mild, 151 CRS2 to moderate and CRS3 to severe ARDS, according to established criteria [40,41]. 152 Based on the above results, we considered the disease of CRS1 as mild/moderate, CRS2 as 153 moderate/severe and CRS3 as severe/critical, since at baseline CRS3 patients received high-154 flow oxygen or MV after ICU admission. 155",

We found that tocilizumab did not 213 provide significant benefit on disease progression for mild/moderate CRS1 patients 214(estimated PaO 2 /FiO 2 >240 mm Hg). This concurs with randomized trials, which showed no 215 benefit after tocilizumab treatment in patients with mild/moderate disease severity 216 For CRS2 patients, multivariate Cox analysis showed an association between tocilizumab 218 treatment and reduced outcome (death or ICU) risk. The clearest risk reduction was detected 219 for CRS2 stage treated-patients (estimated PaO 2 /FiO 2 <150 mm Hg), and this was further 220 confirmed by significantly decreased proportion of patients that reached the endpoint. These 221 results concurred with another study showing reduced risk of disease escalation in treated-222 patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 <150 mm Hg [46]. 223 Our results suggested a greater tocilizumab effect in CRS2 compared to CRS3 stage 224 patients, supporting the view that tocilizumab increases effectiveness when delivered at 225 earlier disease stages [45,47]. This might be explained by more severe respiratory deficiency 226 in CRS3 compared to CRS2 patients. Effectiveness of tocilizumab in CRS3 stage is 227 corroborated by other studies focused on severe/critical patients, showing beneficial effects of 228 tocilizumab for patients on MV [48], or tocilizumab delivery two days after ICU admission 229 [45]. Finally, as CRS2 patients did not require ICU admission at baseline, tocilizumab 230 treatment could be an option for moderate/severe patients on high-flow oxygen supply. 231",

In addition, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed significantly 235 lowered risk in the case that mortality alone was the outcome. 236 Adjustment for CRS stages was decisive for the estimated therapeutic effect of tocilizumab 237 in all patients, since after excluding the CRS stage classification, as confounding variable, 238 tocilizumab benefit was no longer evidenced. 239 Preliminary data from clinical trials COVACTA and EMPACTA (19-20) that included 240 broad ranged patient populations, showed that tocilizumab was not as efficacious as in 241 observational studies that focused on advanced disease stages. The COVACTA study did not 242 meet the primary outcome, as tocilizumab did not reduce clinical worsening or mortality. The 243 wide-ranged severity of the patients could be a drawback, considering that the inefficacy of 244 tocilizumab in mild/moderate severity patients might have obscured relevant therapeutic 245 effects [44]. The EMPACTA trial [50] showed reduced risk of MV or death, but not of 246 mortality alone in tocilizumab-treated patients. 247 On the basis of our findings, we believe that future clinical studies could draw more 248 accurate conclusions by considering disease stage classification and including it as a 249 confounding factor in regression analyses. 250 Overall, using a single tocilizumab appears to be safe for the patients and does not increase 251 secondary infections, as shown by us and other studies [17,45,50]. Perhaps a second 252 consecutive tocilizumab delivery might result in increased secondary infections [12]. 253",
