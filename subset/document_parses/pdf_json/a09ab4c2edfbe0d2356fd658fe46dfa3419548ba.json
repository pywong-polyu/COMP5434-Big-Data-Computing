Water scarcity affects over 40% of the global population and is expected to rise over the next years, in which, by 2025, half of the world's population will live in areas that suffer from water shortage [1] . According to the United Nations' 2030 agenda, the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6) aims to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all [2] . This remains a huge challenge for low-income countries, where 3 out of 10 people lack access to safely managed drinking-water services. It is estimated that water-related issues cause 485,000 deaths by diarrhea each year [3] . These vulnerabilities become worse in the case of natural or man-made disasters such as global climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic; according to the UN, stopping the pandemic requires accessibility to safe water for people living in these areas [2] .",

Worldwide, China and India are at the top of the list of countries with the highest water footprints, followed by the USA. The SDG6 s aim is \"to improve water quality by reducing pollution, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally\" [4] . Therefore, the use of non-conventional sources of water, including WW recovery technologies and rain and storm water treatment, has become an increasingly important strategy to offset scarcity. In this context, disinfection of WW effluents or any other non-conventional freshwater sources is key to producing biorisk-free freshwater resources and avoid undesirable public health and food safety issues.",

Furthermore, the use of these disinfectants is connected to a high level of microbial resistance, which can involve re-growth of resistant pathogens after disinfection [6] . Likewise, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the infections by pathogens that are resistant to antimicrobials, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), as one of the major risks for global health. The problem is aggravated if the pathogenic bacteria that bear antibiotic-resistant genes (ARG) pass on this resistance trait, through the ARG, to other bacteria in the water, thus preserving the antimicrobial property even after disinfection [7] . Therefore, new methods for water disinfection that are effective against these emerging pathogens as well as being affordable and environmentally sustainable are very necessary. This is the case of solar water disinfection (SODIS), which was recognized by the WHO as a simple, effective methodology for treating water polluted with pathogenic microorganisms and for reducing the incidence of diarrheic diseases through solar exposure [8, 9] . The SODIS technique consists of placing raw water in transparent, plastic containers (usually 1-to 2-L PET bottles) and exposing them to direct solar light for at least 6 h (on a cloudy day the exposure time should be increased to 48-72 h) ; afterwards, the water should be stored in the SODIS bottles and drunk within the next 24 h [10] . The mechanisms that explain the germicidal effect of SODIS are based on the generation of reactive oxygen species upon the absorption of UVA and UVB photons by chromophores in the microorganisms; the efficiency of the process is improved by increased temperatures due to solar exposure [11] .",

In addition, SODIS has been demonstrated to be effective against several water pathogens, i.e., Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteriophage MS2, Hepatitis A virus, and Cryptosporidium parvum [12] . However, it has several drawbacks that have been the subject of recent studies for their mitigation: (i) The water treated with SODIS, as mentioned, must be drunk within 24 h to avoid the reemergence of pathogenic organisms' activity after solar exposure [13] ; (ii) The action of sunlight on the plastic material may release chemical products into the drinking water.",

            "text": "Photocatalysis emerged at the end of the past century as an alternative or complementary technology to traditional disinfection methods. It is divided into heterogeneous and homogeneous processes, which are part of the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and in both cases sunlight can be used to promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals ( \u2022 OH), which exhibit a strong disinfectant activity [19] . During heterogeneous photocatalysis, the inactivation of pathogens in water occurs in the presence of a photocatalyst and UV radiation. Although many catalysts have been tested, in disinfection processes TiO 2 is the most studied [20] . However, when sunlight is used as an energy source in heterogeneous photocatalysis the activity of the process is low because photocatalysts are only excited by UV radiation and the proportion of this type of radiation in sunlight is low (3-5%). The process is much more efficient when the catalyst is in the form of suspended micro-or nanoparticles, which can be immobilized to avoid contamination by nanoparticles [21] , although immobilization limits the large-scale applications compared to homogeneous processes. In homogeneous solar photocatalysis the most investigated process is solar photo-Fenton treatment, which consists of a series of reactions involving solute iron acting as the catalyst, hydrogen peroxide and solar radiation [22] . Pathogens that are highly resistant to conventional disinfection technologies can be inactivated by solar photo-Fenton such as Bacilus subtillis, phytopathogenic fungi, antimicrobial resistant bacteria and genes, as well as viruses from surface water and WW [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . At present, this field research is focused on limiting the pH of the process in the search for good results at neutral or nearto-neutral pH, assessing the effect of organic matter or of using iron oxides, iron-chelating agents, etc., to retain the iron in solution [28] . In addition, in recent years intensive research has been carried out under continuous mode operation, which shows the possibility of applying this technology at an industrial scale [29, 30] . Table 1 presents a summary of the main events, breakthroughs, and contributors in relation to SODIS and water disinfection by solar photocatalysis.",

The aim of this work is to identify the key research topics, research gaps and main challenges that allow establishing future lines of work in this area. With this objective in mind, we have conducted an ample, bibliometric study, in which we have made a critical and detailed assessment of the scientific production on water disinfection driven by solar radiation. Finally, based on an in-depth discussion of the results, we have attempted to answer the following research questions (RQs), which we believe could be of interest to researchers in this field: RQ1: What are the global trends of scientific publications on the topic of solar-driven water disinfection? RQ2: Which are the institutions and their collaboration networks that work more intensely on this issue? RQ3: Which peer-reviewed journals publish the most on this topic? RQ4: How has the field evolved over time and what are its main, future research directions? Table 1 . Principal events, breakthroughs, and contributors for solar water disinfection (SODIS) (above) and water disinfection by solar photocatalysis (below).",

Both bibliographic databases are the main sources of information used in bibliometric studies [40, 41] because of the large number of documents they contain. The number of peer-reviewed journals indexed in Scopus (41,462; SCImago Journal Rank, 2019) is almost double to that of WOS (24,717; Thomson Reuters, 2019). In our case, WOS was used to search for impact indexes, whereas an exhaustive search was carried out in Scopus using (TITLE-ABS-KEY (Solar and Disinfection)) as the search field. This search returned 1241 documents between 1977 and 2020. Frequency of cooccurrences was calculated obtaining 533 keywords repeated more than 10 times. Note that the occurrences attribute indicates the number of documents in which a keyword occurs. When analyzing the keywords, those that had no relation with the topic of this study were manually removed, such as article, paper, review, etc. Quantitative data processing, positioning and visualization of the corresponding units of analysis in two-dimensional maps were carried out with VOSviewer software (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) using the VOS (visualization of similarities) technique, which builds a similarity matrix from the co-occurrence matrix to allow the execution of a clustering algorithm for positioning and classifying the keywords to be mapped. This software, widely used in bibliometric studies, creates graphs for keywords or institutions, representing them with nodes that can be joined by lines that signify the collaboration between both terms of the two nodes [42] .",

A very different scenario is observed in Spain, second in the lead in total number of publications with 201 documents, where the Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research (CIEMAT)-Plataforma Solar of Almer\u00eda concentrates most of the publications. Next, the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (Switzerland) stands out on a European level. China is also the third potential in the world (along with Switzerland) on solar-driven disinfection (Figure 2) , with a total of 137 publications, and as with the USA, its production is spread among many research centers and authors. In terms of the number of investigations that receive funding, however, this country is highest in the list (Table S1; Supplementary Material), but if all the research carried out within the European continent is considered as well as the research funded by the European Union and the research from Spain and Switzerland, Europe would be world leader with the financing of a total of 128 publications. The USA also ranks highly, with funding for a total of 29 publications. Table 2 . Affiliation (sorted alphabetically) and authors with publications on solar-driven disinfection.

Next, the keywords used in the scientific literature will be analyzed to identify the research trends and gaps in the field. Figure 4 represents the network formed by the main keywords from publications on solar-driven disinfection. To discuss these results, only keywords with concurrency greater than 10 have been considered, but for better understanding only those with greater repeatability are shown in Figure 4 (complete keywords' matrix available from Supplementary Materials: File S1). Each rectangle-shaped node represents a keyword, and the larger the rectangle the more frequent the keyword. In Figure 4a , keywords are classified into six clusters using VOSviewer, and each cluster has a different color attending to the relations established among keywords (characterized by the frequency of occurrences and the similarity index). Nodes are connected by lines that join terms that tend to appear in the same work, broad lines standing for a more frequent coexistence than thin lines. Regarding the location of the clusters in the network, the closer they are to each other the stronger their relatedness. The evolution of the relevance of the keywords over the last decade (2010-2020) is depicted in Figure 4b , in which keywords are mapped using a color scale that assigns each node with a score (in this case, the scores are years 2010 to 2020). To interpret this figure, it should be noted that the most frequent terms closer to 2010 are in blue (lowest score), intermediate scores are in green, and scores closer to 2020 are mapped in yellow.

This set of keywords is related to one of the areas of greatest interest to the field of disinfection of water for agricultural uses, which is the largest water-consuming sector (approximately 70% of the total, as previously pointed out). Water for agricultural use very frequently has phytopathogens and it is common to use fungicides and antagonistic microorganisms to avoid this problem. Many of the articles that describe the use of solar energy in disinfection have shown good results in the inactivation of phytopathogens [23] . Even the mere sunlight-H 2 O 2 combination has recently been considered as a sustainable option, compared to other solar-powered AOPs in advanced municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), for reuse in crop irrigation [43] . Recent articles clearly show the current research trends in this area, including the investigation of microbial risks associated to the practice of WW reclaim in agriculture [44] , the implementation of large-scale continuous solar treatments [29] and the control of emerging pathogens, such as antimicrobial resistance for irrigation and food production [45] .",

It includes keywords such as solar radiation, photochemistry, chlorination, etc. An outstanding area to consider in disinfection studies is the presence of disinfection byproducts (DBPs), hence keywords such as chlorination or chlorine. Solar-driven disinfection processes have become particularly important in this area because, although the lack of a residual disinfection effect is a disadvantage, these processes do not generate any harmful byproducts and are environmentally friendly. Moreover, it has been widely demonstrated that these processes are efficient in eliminating DBPs generated by other classic water disinfection processes [6] . It is also well known that organic matter reduces the efficiency of most AOPs, although it can also help maintain the iron catalyst in solution when pH-neutral reactions are carried out [46, 47] . NOM has also been found to favor SODIS under specific conditions-photosensitization effects-but it also can compete with microorganisms for the oxidizing radicals generated during photo-assisted processes, hence decreasing the disinfection efficiency [48] .",

However, to treat the volumes required for real applications (a few hundred liters per day per household, for drinking water, and a few cubic meters per day, for irrigation) new solar raceway pond reactors operated continuously appear as a good solution [29] , despite having lower efficiency optics compared to CPCs. This is evidenced by the also present keyword pond as, in recent years, ponds have become a class of successful and practical reactors that clearly allow increasing the treatment volume of SODIS. Currently, solar photocatalysis, photo-Fenton and solar disinfection have been taking steps in the right direction to expand promising results at these large scales [29, 50, 51] . Additionally, the integration of technologies based on photocatalytic and photothermal nanomaterials to increase the daily productivity of SODIS has been proved recently [34] . Other types of reactors have also been used, such as the photocatalytic membrane reactor, which integrates photocatalysis and membrane separation, photoelectrocatalytical reactors [49] , etc. However, most of this technology is designed for water decontamination but not specifically focused on disinfection as the main objective, as explained by Keane and collaborators [39] . These authors recommend that efforts should focus on specifically designing efficient reactors for disinfection purposes, taking into account key technological parameters related to design of solar CPC modules (ratio of illuminated volume to total volume, catalyst load in slurry reactors, immobilized versus suspended photocatalyst, and flow rate), oxygen transfer kinetics, mass transfer of bacteria to the catalyst, and the catalyst support configuration.",

Especially cheap is SODIS technology, which is considered the lowest-price household-based disinfectant system, with an estimated cost of US$0.63 per person per year [52] . However, there is a great paucity of research regarding the true cost of photocatalytic disinfection treatments. A recent study (Fe 3+ -EDDHA/H 2 O 2 /solar treatment) carried out with compound parabolic collector reactors estimated the cost of the treatment (EUR 1.10 \u20ac/m 3 ) as a sum of the investment and operational costs based on the calculation of their annual cost. The authors concluded that the estimated treatment cost is too high for industrial-scale applications because some techno-economic aspects are still unclear [53] . Each investigation must be considered in its own context: the first study mentioned here-SODIS in PET bottles-presented estimates for household interventions to provide safe drinking water, while the second-photo-Fenton-referred to large-scale treatment of wastewater for irrigation reuse; two completely different applications and end-users. Treatment costs must be kept in mind, especially in countries with populations that have limited access to potable water and sanitation. For example, in India (the worst country in the world for the number of people without safe water) the cost of 50 L of water is 17% of a typical poor person's salary [54] .",

E. coli is a gram-negative coliform bacterium that is responsible for childhood diarrhea and is used as an indicator of fecal contamination, so it is widespread in disinfection articles. However, the WHO has recommended monitoring the gram-positive bacterium E. faecalis as an indicator of fecal contamination in water, and it is usually more resistant than E. coli to the different disinfection techniques [49] . It is important to note that each country has different indicators, but there is a consensus between organizations such as WHO, US EPA, etc., over which species should be studied to ensure water disinfection. Therefore, studies that arbitrarily employ other infective agents may even be of little relevance, depending on which microorganism they use.",

Furthermore, it is also the most recent and the most studied cluster (Figure 4b) , which shows that the current trend is to focus more on solar photocatalysis with TiO 2 . Typical keywords of this process are photocatalysis/catalyst/heterogeneous photocatalysis, and titanium/titanium dioxide/TiO 2 . Much of the research conducted to date has been applied to the inactivation of E. coli, the most salient keyword. Furthermore, many words also feature very prominently in relation to nanoparticles, such as nanocomposite, nanomaterial, metal nanoparticle, silver nanoparticle, etc. There is a great diversity of TiO 2 -doped nanomaterials with metals and non-metals, such as nitrogen, silver, copper, sulfur, carbon, etc., and recently graphene, used to inactivate various strains of bacteria in different sources of water [20] . These doped materials and the combination of TiO 2 with graphene composites have mitigated the main drawbacks of photocatalytic disinfection, i.e., limited activity, which is conditioned by the lack of visible light activity and the rapid re-combination of photocatalyst's charge carriers, but most of these studies have not been carried out for real applications. Recently, there has been great interest on visible light-active materials, focusing especially on electric and photonic properties [8] . This cluster is far away from the rest, and it presents very limited collaborations with the other topics. This is clearly seen in Figure 4a , where the red and yellow/green clusters are far apart, pointing out the need to work together to connect the world of nanomaterials to the real-world applications. In addition, this area of research has other potential applications in air purification and the sterilization of surfaces in healthcare environments. Figure 4b shows that the keywords colored in green to yellow (intermediate to high scores, which means that those keywords are frequent in recent years) belong mostly to the red cluster (Figure 4a ), which shows that the current trend is to focus more on solar photocatalysis with TiO 2 and nanomaterials. Recent progress has been made in catalyst modification research to boost its light-harvesting capacity towards the visible; new Vislight active catalytic materials for disinfection have been tested, including plasmonic [60] and carbon nitride-based photocatalysts [61] . There have also been advances in disinfection with TiO 2 , based on the applications of its different types of structures (nanotubes, nanoparticles, nanofibers or nanopowder) doped with silver, selenium nanoparticles, ZnO, copper, zinc or yttrium, and for several waterborne microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteriophages F2 and MS2, Cryptosporidium spp. and Candida albicans [62] .",

According to the WHO, the mitigation of antimicrobial resistance will have a major impact on SDG6, estimating that the health costs will be 1.2 billion dollars by 2050 owing to increased antimicrobial resistance (https://www.who.int/healthtopics/antimicrobial-resistance, accessed on 9 June 2021). This issue becomes particularly serious when pathogenic bacteria carrying antibiotic-resistant genes (ARG) re-grow after disinfection treatments are applied to WWTP effluents. In the recent years, due to the high consumption of antibiotics, ARB and ARG have been increasingly found and monitored in waters of different origins such as municipal and hospital WW, surface water and groundwater, sediments, water used in agriculture, drinking water, and even in the air, crops, and soils [43, 63] . Various disinfection methods based on sunlight or artificial sunlight, such as UV/solar/H 2 O 2 , Fenton and photo-Fenton, and heterogeneous catalysis with TiO 2 , have been tested for treating numerous ARG and ARB [27] ; however, although the majority of AOPs have yielded very high levels of inactivation, further investigation is still needed to find solutions to secondary contamination, for example, the release and transfer of ARG among microbial cells, photo-reactivation, etc. [63] , which imply the use of post-treatments following AOP [64] . Figure 4a offers a view of the research work that has been carried out in the field, while Figure 4b gives an idea of the past and present trends over the last decade.
