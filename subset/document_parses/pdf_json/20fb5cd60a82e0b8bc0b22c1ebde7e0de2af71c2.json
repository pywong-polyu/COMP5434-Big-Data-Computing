In particular, the application of a series of specific measures to contain and to counteract the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are envisaged (WHO, 2020b; WHO, 2020c), including the often-mandatory use of various COVID-19-specific personal protective equipment (PPE-COVID- 19 ) for carrying out several activities outside one's home (both outdoors and indoors) (Chu et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f environment for long periods (ECDC, 2020) . Based on the fabric thermal proprieties of insulating suits, and depending on the environmental thermal conditions, heat exchange between the body and the environment might be significantly limited or impeded, this way increasing the thermal stress of a person and leading to a decrement in physical performance capabilities and increased risk of heatstress-related injuries . In the case of the general public, therefore, the effect of heat can lead to overloads in the healthcare system (Wondmagegn et al., 2019) and, in the situation of very high patient loads requiring intensive care due to the COVID-19 emergency, the capacity of health services and systems to prevent and manage heat stress may be compromised or unavailable. A technical brief focused on the managing of heat risk during the COVID-19 pandemic, provided by the Global Heat Health Information Network (http://www.ghhin.org/), a system of experts spearheaded by the WHO and WMO Joint Office for Climate and Health, and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), clearly stated that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic amplifies the health risks of hot weather for many people (all people are potentially at risk of ill to both heat stress and COVID-19 if exposed). Then a double jeopardy is expected: people infected with, or recovering from, COVID-19 are presumed (as they are associated with acute kidney injury) more vulnerable to heat stress, including outdoor workers returning to the workplace. In general, the communities ravaged by COVID-19 also include people most vulnerable to extreme heat. In addition, due to COVID-19-related restrictions and policies to contain the pandemic, vulnerable populations may be in more precarious social and economic conditions for various reasons, including from lost wages, increasing isolation, incorrect or inaccurate information obtained through social media networks, and limiting healthcare access because difficulties in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 making movements with transportation (http://www.ghhin.org/assets/technical-brief-COVID-and-Heat-final.pdf). The more complex management of air conditioning and industrial ventilation systems (effective systems to combat the heat effects and for preventing workplace infection and ill health) for both residential and high occupancy buildings, further complicates the situation because these systems should be inspected, maintained, and cleaned more frequently (together with a frequent sanitization of surfaces) than in a typical summer condition to prevent COVID-19 transmission (Quian and Zheng, 2018). In addition, the use of fans for air circulation in collective spaces and in spaces with minimal outside air exchange should be avoided when several people are present in these spaces (http://www.ghhin.org/heat-and-covid-19/ac-and-ventilation).",

WHO/Europe (http://www.euro.who.int/en/healthtopics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/5/preparing-for-a-long,-hotsummer-with-covid-19) recommends countries and regions to review existing HHAPs to take into consideration measures in place to reduce and prevent COVID-19 transmission. In addition, it is also urgent to comprehend quickly how PPE-COVID-19 behave when used by the general public in daily life and by workers, evaluating the consequences related to the management of heat stress at local (face and hands) and general (whole body) discomfort level, and identifying the most accurate measures for a correct use of PPE according to the type and duration of activity envisaged. The potential synergistic effect with the specific measures to contain and to counteract the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has to be carefully evaluated by treating specifically public and worker's health issues.",

In addition, the vulnerability of many people is further compounded in this generalized situation of fear of contagion caused by COVID-19 pandemic and people may be reluctant or may have greater problems moving because reducing access and options to use of transportation due to local COVID-19-related restrictions and policies, therefore they can be unable to reach cooling centres to counteract the heat stress or to seek emergency medical help.",

Consequently, especially outdoor workers or those working indoors without air conditioning or inadequately cooled conditions for long periods, even if engaged in generally pleasant thermal conditions (if dressed normally), can also experience critical thermal stress conditions if wearing various PPE, with significant dehydration depending also on the type, the duration of the work activity carried out and the time to recover before returning to work. With the aim to enhance the endurance and cognitive performance of workers while wearing PPE, they should lower their body's core temperature at the onset of work and should avoid its significant increase during work (Alhadad et al., 2019) . In this case, the appropriate strategies of intervention must concern the thermal status of the worker at the beginning of the work (start work hydrated, cool and recover between shifts) and the behaviour during work addressed to reduce the rise of the body core temperature (i.e. revise work/rest schedules, reduce clothing layers underneath PPE, cool down during breaks prevalently in cool spots or shaded areas, improve efficiency of movements). provides only a partial contribution on this topic.",

In the case of the use of facemasks, which protect the mouth and nose, the limitation of the heat effects can be even more complex, and the situation could potentially become very critical. The hot and wet air cushion that will be created immediately under the mask, therefore in contact with the mouth and nose, will hinder the normal process of breathing. Several authors (Yip et al., 2005) explained that wearing a facemask for a certain period of time could increase the temperature inside the oral cavity by minimising the convection and evaporation of heat from the mouth to the surrounding. Particularly critical microclimatic conditions (very high temperatures and humidity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f rates, and total absence of ventilation) in contact with the mouth and nose will be created if exposed to heat sources and solar radiation. This situation negatively impacts respiratory and dermal mechanisms of human thermoregulation (Roberge et al., 2012) and, in addition, high temperature and humidity can produce adverse skin reaction such as contact dermatitis (Foo et Furthermore, when people are exposed to hot conditions, the frequency of breathing tends to increase (also depending on the activity level) and thermal discomfort will not be only local (i.e. limited to the facial surface affected by the mask or in the surrounding areas) but it will be generalized to the whole human body. This aspect was already highlighted many years ago when several authors (Martin and Callaway, 1974; Nielsen et al., 1987) revealed that the use of protective facemask represented an additional factor aggravating heat stress and that the facemask air temperature significantly influenced the thermal sensations of the whole body. Hayashi and Tokura (2004) revealed that during some tests carried out in a climate chamber controlled at an air temperature of 28 \u00b0C and a relative humidity of 60%, both the air temperature and the absolute humidity inside the mask significantly increased in subjects wearing a mask made of non-woven fabric and without exhaust valve compared to subjects wearing a mask with exhaust valve. They concluded that preventing an excessive increase of microclimate temperature and humidity inside the facemask was fundamental to reduce the whole-body heat stress. Another study showed that wearing a facemask may increase the oral temperature in healthy subjects (Yip et placed between non-woven fabric. In some cases, also the FFP1 (generally used as a mask against powders and liquids without particular toxicity) or the N95 respirator (particulate-filtering facepiece respirator) facemasks could also be worn by the general public. While the FFP2 and FFP3 facemasks were generally used by healthcare workers and the staff engaged in intensive care respectively. The gloves usually used by the general population were often plastic or latex models.",

In fact, the performance requirements of the surgical facemasks (UNI EN 14683, 2019) include bacteria filtration efficiency, breathability, differential pressure, splash resistance, microbial cleaning and biocompatibility. Although the air permeability of the mask is measured by determining the pressure difference across the mask in specific conditions of air flow, temperature and humidity, no tests are specifically addressed to the microclimate and the evaluation of thermal comfort. Therefore, no reports on the thermophysiological responses in participants wearing masks in outdoor warm environments and directly exposed to solar radiation are available. Some authors (Roberge et al., 2012) have stated that the intolerance to the thermal effects of protective facemasks leads to decreased use and concomitant decreased protection for the user.",

In particular, several monitoring of different healthy people over an hour and during various activities 30 and 55% and calm wind (depending on the tests), both the air temperature and humidity inside the mask (the air between the mask and the skin) were significantly (p <0.001) higher than the external ones (above 4 \u00b0C and 10% for air temperature and humidity respectively), revealing a general increase of the perceived thermal discomfort at local (face and hands) and global (whole body) level, further increasing if exposed to direct solar radiation. These findings are confirmed by the fact that the heat strain caused by PPE is a result of excess body heat storage which can be attributed to the combined effect of PPE characteristics, environmental conditions, and the level of physical activity (Xu et al., 2016) .",

In this way it will be possible to develop effective adaptation measures to manage the heat stress while keeping the anti-COVID-19 measures as a priority. With the aim to be able to integrate the essential measures against the spread of COVID-19 and those to counter the known heat-stress effects, it will therefore be necessary to review also the previous HHWSs and planning the use of personalized ones (Table 1) . Personalized information, based on individual (e.g. weight, height, age), behavioural (type of activity carried out and clothing worn) characteristics, and depending on the environment and occupational situation (if outdoors exposed to the sun or in shaded areas, or indoors), are able to provide useful advices (in terms of recommended breaks, rests in shaded areas, hydration, management of shifts and working hours, distribution of the various tasks breaks, etc.) that aim to alleviate the heat-stress situation. In this way, it will be possible to avoid health complications for the general population and in particular in subjects with chronic diseases (i.e. lung diseases) with consequent overloads of healthcare systems, and to allow the continuation of work activities taking appropriate precautions, also reducing the productivity losses and economic consequences.

On the basis of a review (Roberge et al., 2012), local dermal effects, increased temperature of breathing air, elevated core temperature, or psychophysiological responses, were identified as facial heat complaints negatively associated to the use of protective facemasks, including surgical facemasks. Just the latter have been widely distributed to the whole population in Italy as a measure to counteract the SARS-CoV-2 infection (however considering that many people J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f organized themselves with homemade cloth masks or other improvised face coverings).

            "text": "Adaptation strategies to counteract the heat effect by keeping anti-COVID-19 procedures active At the international level, there are few examples that go precisely in this direction. For example, as part of the ongoing European H2020 project (HEAT-SHIELD, https://www.heat-shield.eu/), a team of international experts with skills in the field of physiology, clothing science, medicine, meteorology, climatology and public health with particular attention to the occupational sector, developed a multilingual web-platform concerning a customized occupational heat-related warning J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f system valid for all of Europe (Morabito et al., 2019). This already operational system allows to take into account the use of some PPE (not yet anti-COVID-19 facemasks and gloves) as well to provide personal daily maximum heat stress risk levels by using ISO-standard thermal stress approaches and behavioural suggestions (hydration and work breaks recommended) to be taken in the short term (5 days) together with long-term heat risk forecasts, up to 46 days, useful for planning working activities for employers, organizations and operators in charge of safeguarding health and productivity in various occupational areas. Another example is the ongoing EU ClimApp project (http://www.jpi-climate.eu/nl/25223441-ClimApp.html) which aims to translate climate service information into personalized warnings and adaptation strategies to cope with thermal stress (Petersson et al., 2019). Even this tool, which uses part of the knowledge acquired with the HEAT-SHIELD project, allows a personalization of the information considering also the physical work intensity (metabolic rate) and clothing thermal insulation data. The integration of multi-node thermo-physiological models with weather forecast data represents a future challenge to predict accurately thermal stress accounting for the impact of various PPE (such as masks and gloves) at local level and evaluating the potential impact on thermal stress at a whole-body level (Xu et al., 2016; Petersson et al., 2019). In this way it will be also possible to perform modelling analysis to predict specific endurance times under representative environmental conditions (Xu et al., 2016). These and other tools that could be developed in other projects, e.g. in the Italian WORKLIMATE project which will continue the research to improve HHWSs and to carry out further case studies in various occupational areas, represent useful tools and strategies also helpful to plan a better management of these adjunctive PPE in hot conditions and a fast heat-related adaptation strategy for the general public at a time where the priority is to live avoiding SARS-CoV-2 infection. These are particularly useful interventions in light of the fact that based on a recent scientific evidence (Zhang et al., 2020) the use of facemasks in public represents one of the most effective measures to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, and then to face and manage other future health emergencies that will require similar measures. Another important aspect that will be investigated in the project will be the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 perception of heat risk and how it will interconnect with the perception of the COVID-19 risk (Cori et al. 2020). These aspects may be useful in planning communication actions for the health and safety of workers and more generally of the population.",

Suggested interventions to review Heat-Health Warning Systems in the context of COVID-19 Adjustments of both epidemiological (based on human health outcomes, i.e. mortality, hospitalization, work injury data, etc.) and biometeorological (based on various heat-stress-related indicators) thresholds. This may lead to rise the warning risk level (yellow \u2192 orange; orange \u2192 red) compared to the pre-COVID-19 situation. Customization based on personal characteristics (e.g. weight, height, age), the type of activity carried out, the clothing worn (including the use of various PPE-COVID-19), depending on the environment (outdoors exposed to the sun or in shaded areas, indoors) and the occupational situation (contact with other sources of heat). For the general public: \uf0b7 Integrate operational heat warning levels with measures to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 (i.e. the physical distancing) and include behavioral suggestions to counteract the heat stress (i.e. access to public spaces and cooling facilities) without interfering with anti-COVID-19 measures. Provide suggestions on how to manage the use of adjunctive PPE-COVID-19 (i.e. facemasks and gloves) during different heat J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f warning levels (i.e. recommended breaks). Increase awareness that people infected with, or recovering from, COVID-19 are likely more vulnerable to heat stress. For health workers: \uf0b7 Include information on the intra-daily heat warning level (morning, afternoon, evening, night) in order to promote effective work scheduling (reschedule the most physically demanding work tasks to the coolest time of day). Include hydration and work/break schedule recommendations also accounting for the use of specific PPE and physical exertion (cooling breaks in cool spots or shaded areas). Encouraging rehydration even outside the shift and before feeling thirsty, reducing clothing layers underneath PPE and the additional heat from exertion when critical heat-risk levels are forecasted. Integrate the heat warning message with specific behavioral infographics for various occupational sectors (i.e. medical and health care, agriculture, construction, transport, tourism, manufacturing, etc.) Evaluate to review COVID-19 restrictions by coordinating across different levels of government and various stakeholders when high heat-risk levels are forecasted and minimize the risk of heatwave",
