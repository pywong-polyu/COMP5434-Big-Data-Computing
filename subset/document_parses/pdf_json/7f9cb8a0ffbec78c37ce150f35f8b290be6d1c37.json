Nurses and midwives make up the majority of the health workforce and play key roles in maternal and newborn healthcare [3, 4] . Midwives are a critical skilled birth attendant (SBA) cadre associated with improved quality care and rapid and sustained reductions in maternal and newborn mortality [5] . Midwives should work within an enabling environment, following guidelines for maternal and newborn care, providing and tailoring care to the social and cultural needs of women living in the community [6] . However, the UN report on the progress of the SDGs shows that many countries are still facing the challenge of shortages of qualified health workers, i.e. fewer than 1 doctor per 1000 population and fewer than 4 nurses and midwives per 1000 population [7] . Most sub-Saharan countries are amongst those countries [8, 9] and, within countries, there are serious distribution inequities between urban and rural areas [10] .",

Ituri, like some other provinces, faces challenges in attracting and retaining midwives in rural districts and has a high maternal mortality rate far beyond the national average and other rural provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo [20, 24] (a situation confirmed by a personal communication with the Ituri Provincial Health Office). A recent study highlights the availability and distribution of midwives, nurses and doctors in Ituri province and the associated challenges (Box 2). Understanding midwives' experiences in providing services in Ituri province is critical to addressing attraction and retention issues. A recent study documented these experiences, including the coping mechanisms deployed by midwives who demonstrate bravery and resilience as they navigate the interface position between under-resourced health systems and poor marginalised communities (Box 3).",

The following districts were selected: Bunia district, where the Provincial capital is found and where all the facilities are in the urban area, including the district health office (Bunia); the peri-urban district of Aru, where there is a concentration of people, with some facilities in remote areas (Aru); and the rural district of Adja, where all facilities are in rural and remote areas [25] .

Table 1 provides details of the different participants, including the reasons for their selection. In the previous study we had asked the midwives and head nurses if we could contact them again for participation in this study. We then contacted them directly by phone to recruit them to the workshops. Participants from the Provincial Health Office, Provincial Reproductive Health Coordination, District Health Management Team (DHMT), church medical coordination, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and nursing schools were invited to the workshops through invitation letters and a participant information sheet. At the start of the workshop, the participant information sheets were shared again, discussed and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. In total, we recruited 49 participants to the three workshops, as described in Table 1 (15 in Bunia district, 19 in Aru district and 15 in Adja district).",

In step 3, the current policies on attraction and retention of health workers in rural areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo were presented. In step 4, participants were divided into groups (Table 2) so that they could discuss in detail the research findings and the policies. These discussions were facilitated by the research team (AB, JK and MM) using a topic guide that focused on policy implementation and reasons why some policies are implemented and others are not. The group discussions were summarised and fed back to the plenary for further discussion. Finally, in step 5, the groups discussed new and existing strategies to promote the attraction, retention and support of midwives, and how they could be implemented in their districts. They discussed challenges related to each strategy and how they could be overcome. After completion, each group reported to the other groups for further comments and discussions.",

Including midwifery courses in rural nursing schools can have an impact on improving the attraction and retention of midwives in rural areas [40, 46] , yet this may be challenging to implement in Democratic Republic of Congo, where only 32% of the schools of nursing are government run and the government may be reluctant to invest in schools of nursing and midwifery in rural areas [20] . Churches own the majority of health facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo [20] and, therefore, creating church-funded nursing schools in remote areas where there are none or including midwifery in the existing nursing schools could be considered as an alternative viable solution. The recruitment and training of students with a rural background can be an effective strategy to improve the attraction and retention of health workers in rural areas [11, 40, 41] and this was an important element of conflict-affected Liberia's workforce rebuilding strategy [42] . In eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, most graduates from rural medical schools worked in rural health facilities [46] . Involving the local community in the selection and support of students is a potentially powerful strategy; however, open and transparent processes for selection and dialogue and agreement with provincial district health authorities about the deployment of the students is crucial [43] . Central to this is the selection of women students as female midwives are more accepted in rural areas; this requires cross sector collaboration and long-term support so that girls, their families and their communities are encouraged to support their schooling, delay marriage, and focus on their education and career [47] .",

It is critical that midwives are able to support themselves and their families whilst continuing to serve their communities [11, 41, 44, 50, 51] . However, it is clear from this study and others that very few health workers in Ituri province receive salary or allowances, and this is particularly the case for those working in rural areas [33] . Ituri province may well be specifically disadvantaged as it is estimated that, in the whole country, 33% of health workers receive a salary from the government and~65% receive their risk allowances [18, 20, 52] ; the majority of these health workers are based in urban areas [52] . This is one of the reasons why health workers remain in urban areas. Therefore, in rural contexts, health workers rely on income generated locally from user fees [18] . Workshop participants proposed that local income generation should be continued and strengthened. However, this raises important moral issuesmost communities in rural Democratic Republic of Congo are poor and asking them to support health workers will place additional burdens on them and push them into more poverty, promoting a situation of inverse equity, whereby those with the most need are expected to pay for services. There are many who will not be able to access services because of these fees.",

For instance, recruiting and training rural background students through a communitybased sponsorship scheme requires collaboration between the sponsorship scheme managing committee, who select and send candidates for midwifery training, and the Provincial Health Office and the DHMT, who are responsible for deployment [20, 21] . Without sustained collaboration, community selected and supported students, once graduated, may be deployed elsewhere, creating tension between the different groups and community mistrust of the scheme, which will limit its sustainability. Good collaboration and systems and processes that build trust and principles of reciprocity and mutuality between these health systems actors can help promote positive outcomes [56] [57] [58] [59] such as a more informed recruitment and deployment system.",

The approach includes presenting relevant data from routine information systems and research to help ground the discussion in reality. The availability of staffing data is a major strength of the region, as it is often lacking in fragile and conflict-affected contexts [49] and in other parts of Democratic Republic of Congo [60] . Thus, the current study used reflection on locally generated evidence and policies and the rich and detailed knowledge of the local contexts to develop feasible and potentially effective strategies. This is a learning health system in actionstepping back, taking stock of what is happening and why, reflecting on evidence and real-world experience, debating and discussing options, and coming up with solutions. Such an approach can embed learning into all aspects of decision-making in health systems [61] . It was facilitated by a research team knowledgeable about the topic and embedded in the context, with strong and trusting relationships with the participants built over several years. Local credibility, a good knowledge of the context and trust are key components needed for the co-production of knowledge [59, 62] and generally lacking in fragile settings.",

The engagement of managers in the workshops show that they are committed to change, though they should be supported somehow. Secondly, such suggestions for changes made in the workshops may well be accepted in principle, but so often organisational inertia prevents them from actually being implemented until an appropriate 'window of opportunity' arises. Such a window became available in Sierra Leone in 2010, whilst it was still recovering from conflict, with the introduction of the Free Health Care Initiative [65] . In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the aftermath of Ebola and COVID-19 may possibly provide the window of opportunity needed in Ituri Province and elsewhere.",

One of the limitations is that we only included midwives who have worked in rural areas. The inclusion of midwifery students in their final year, midwives newly recruited and deployed in urban health facilities as well as midwives working in private for profit facilities, would provide views about what strategies would encourage them to opt for rural employment.",

These strategies were based on local evidence, their rich and detailed knowledge and experience, and their reflections on the unique context of the Democratic Republic of Congo. This participatory approach can promote learning health systems and develop pragmatic strategies to attract and retain health workers in fragile, remote and rural settings.",
