On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, scientists in different fields made strides to participate in interdisciplinary research and multi-sector collaboration to strengthen the public health response, such as the vaccine and fast diagnostic test kit development, and the therapeutic strategies to mitigate the symptoms. One early need was the development of a reliable molecular assay for identifying SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostic surveillance has sometimes been limited due to a variety of obstacles, including limited availability of tests during periods of high demand (e.g., at the onset of the pandemic or during subsequent infection surges) or changes in public behavior over time. This highlights the need for alternative tools to monitor COVID-19 infection incidence or disease prevalence for local decision-making. Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) has historically been used to monitor numerous diseases like norovirus-associated poliovirus (Deshpande et al., 2003) , gastroenteritis, influenza A, and hepatitis A (Heijnen and Medema, 2011; Hellm\u00e9r et al., 2014) . WBS is now showing great potential as a complementary resource for public health response to COVID-19 (Ahmed et al., 2020a; Anand et al., 2021; Peccia et al., 2020; Polo et al., 2020) , particularly since shedding of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is so common in the excreta of both symptomatic and asymptomatic virus carriers (Chen et al., 2020; Larsen and Wigginton, 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Michael-Kordatou et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . The duration of the shedding through feces can be as long as 33 days, with a decrease shedding rate, ranging from 10 6 to 10 12 gc/L, which is lower than some other infectious viruses, like MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 (Gupta et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, more studies should be focused on developing countries, like sub-Saharan Africa, where sewer collection systems and sanitation are lacking (Pandey et al., 2021) . The SARS-CoV-2 viral gene markers may be transported differently in water and wastewater systems and may be different with the developed countries (Sunkari et al., 2021) . All those issues should not be ignored if we want to effectively address the application of WBS in the pandemic management.",

For example, Kumar et al. (2021) observed that virus concentrations in wastewater were associated with one to two weeks advanced notice of COVID-19 cases in India. Similarly, Stadler et al. (2020) used a cross-correlation analysis to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA markers in wastewater predicted the positivity rate of COVID-19 up to two weeks in advance in Houston, Texas. Betancourt et al. (2021) also used this approach to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and potentially avert a larger outbreak within the whole university. Therefore, the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater may disclose predictive data on COVID-19 prevalence and incidence as an early warning in a community and needs to be studied further in more geographical regions of the world.",

Recent literature includes efforts to describe correlations between SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA levels in wastewater and clinical case data, with the ultimate goal of developing predictive models to estimate COVID-19 incidence or prevalence (Ahmed et al., 2020a; Galani et al., 2022; Gerrity et al., 2021; Kaplan et al., 2020; Stadler et al., 2020) . Based on a daily mass balance of viral RNA shedding into wastewater, Ahmed et al. (2020a) set up a predictive model to reflect the prevalence of COVID-19 within an Australian sewershed. Gerrity et al. (2021) also applied a mass-balance model coupled with COVID-19 incidence to rationalize observed wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in southern Nevada, USA. The correlations observed in these studies provide preliminary evidence that changes in viral concentrations in wastewater indicate changes in infection totals within communities. Haak et al. (2022) used SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations to identify spatially clustered patterns of viral RNA concentrations in neighborhood-scale sub-sewersheds in Reno-Sparks metropolitan area, Nevada, USA. They found that the SARS-CoV-2 concentration may reveal critical information about the patterns of disease spread and hot spots of disease. Based on this study, we continued to monitor SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the influents of untreated wastewater in the same study area. The objectives of this study were to 1) conduct long-term monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 viral marker concentrations in wastewater in the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area, Nevada, USA; 2) identify correlations between SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA signals in wastewater and COVID-19 incidence; 3) assess whether wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 provide a leading indicator of COVID-19 incidence, and 4) estimate the total number of infections in the community during the study period.",

WRF-A is the largest WRF in the region, with the capacity of 121,000 m 3 /day (Lacroix et al., 2020) . WRF-A receives wastewater through two interceptor sewer lines, one routed from the Sparks metropolitan area serving a population of 116,000 (indicated as WRF-A1) and a second routed from the Reno metropolitan area serving a population of 204,000 (indicated as WRF-A2). The flows from both interceptors were mixed directly in the main headworks of WRF-A, where wastewater flow was sustained at approximately 96,000 m 3 /day during the sampling study period averagely. The influent of WRF-A consisted of approximately 50% domestic wastewater and 50% wastewater from industrial or commercial facilities. WRF-B is the smallest facility of the three sampling sites. As the facility serves 18,000 people, it manages approximately 4% of the total wastewater generated in the sampling region and receives mostly domestic wastewater. WRF-C is a biological suspended growth activated sludge process for nitrogen and organic carbon removal, serving approximately 52,000 people in south Reno.

Briefly, the reaction contained 5 \u03bcL 4\u00d7 Reliance One-Step Multiplex Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), 5 \u03bcL of the total genomic RNA template, probes (0.4 \u03bcL, 0.2 \u03bcM) and primers (0.4 \u03bcL, 0.4 \u03bcM each) in a total volume of 20 \u03bcL. RT-qPCR was carried out according to the following program: reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 10 min, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 3 s denaturation at 95\u00b0C, 30 s annealing/extension, and plate read at 60\u00b0C. The threshold cycle (Ct) was determined using the default algorithm in CFX Manager Software (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). As per US CDC recommendation, the RT-qPCR assay used N1 and N2 primers and probes (Table S1 ). Positive and non-template controls were included in each run.

Correlation coefficients (R 2 ) > 0.99 were obtained for all calibration curves, with 90% to 110% amplification efficiencies. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined to be 2 gc/\u03bcL, which was the lowest concentration after serial dilution of the positive controls that showed positive amplification in more than 50% of RT-qPCR reactions. Equivalent sample volumes (ESV) were calculated according to Gerrity et al. (2021) shown as Eq.

These data suggest that holidays (i.e., Halloween (October 30, 2020) and Thanksgiving (November 26, 2020) Holidays) led to a steady increase in COVID-19 infections and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA concentrations in wastewater, likely due to group celebrations and increased social contact during these periods (Mehta et al., 2021) . After the Thanksgiving holiday (November 26, 2020), COVID-19 infections and SARS-COV-2 viral RNA concentrations started to decrease, presumably due to implementation of stringent pandemic mitigation measures by local authorities. This observation is in agreement with the study by (Mehta et al., 2021) . This led to low daily case loads and wastewater concentrations through the spring and early summer of 2021. In fact, from May through the second week of July 2021, most wastewater samples failed to amplify due to low SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA concentration in the wastewater. However, due to the circulation of the Delta variant, the second wave of COVID-19 infections and SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater occurred in the middle of July (Yu et al., 2021) .",

One possible reason is that we changed the sampling strategy from grab samples to 24-h composite samples (N = 73), which may cause more 'averaging' of the wastewater throughout the day and, hence, attenuate peaks in SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations (Ahmed et al., 2020b) . Another possible explanation is that more businesses were open in 2021 than in 2020, and those businesses may have contributed more commercial wastewater to WRF-A, thereby causing dilution of domestic wastewater. A third reason may be related to the Delta variant and its effects on symptoms and viral shedding. Specifically, since diarrhea is not a common symptom of COVID-19 caused by the Delta variant sequences, virus shedding may have decreased, at least via feces. Only one in 24 COVID-19 patients with the delta variant sequence showed the diarrhea symptom according to a clinical study in Poland (Mazur-Panasiuk et al., 2021) . The symptom of diarrhea can cause a 3-fold higher SARS-CoV-2 shedding rate in the feces . Therefore, we presume the Delta variant may cause a decrease in the virus shedding rate, even though the shedding rate is agnostic.",

The WRF-A1 interceptor showed minimal viral levels until the beginning of October when daily new reported cases increased in the study area, consistent with the overall results for WRF-A. The peak concentration of 9.28 \u00d7 10 5 gc/L was observed near the Thanksgiving holiday (November 26, 2020, Fig. 3 (a) ), again consistent with WRF-A. In contrast, for the WRF-A2 interceptor, we observed a peak concentration of 5.46 \u00d7 10 5 gc/L ( Fig. 3 (b) ) near the Halloween holiday weekend (October 31, 2020). As this peak occurred approximately one month before that of WRF-A1, it was necessary to assess differences in population that might contribute to the discrepancy in peak concentrations and clinical cases between the two sub-sewersheds. In particular, WRF-A1 has a more stable residential population in comparison with WRF-A2, which has a more transient university/student-dominated population. Therefore, it might be expected for the Thanksgiving holiday (November 26, 2020) to cause a surge in cases and wastewater concentrations for WRF-A1 and at least a short-term decrease in cases and wastewater concentrations for WRF-A2 when students leave campus for the long weekend. In contrast, social events during Halloween (October 30, 2020) might have a more significant impact on WRF-A2, which is a highly commercial community in the study area. According to the local university records, COVID-19 cases among active students increased in two weeks after the Halloween holiday from 9 cases on October 28, 2020 to 30 cases on November 6, 2020, suggesting the significance of Halloween gatherings among students and younger populations, as opposed to other areas with mostly single-family homes.

WRFC, which serviced a larger sewershed with more commercial and industrial users, was observed to have weak correlations between the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations with clinical cases (Spearman r was 0.353) for daily results and moderate correlations (Spearman r was 0.472) for weekly results. The weekly average did not improve the correlation much because of the lower sampling frequency at those two sewersheds. We sampled twice per week in 2020 and only sampled once per week in 2021. The slight improvement in correlations may be attributed to the average clinical cases, which may decrease the variability.",

To accomplish this, we once again determined Spearman correlation coefficients between SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and daily new COVID-19 cases, but the concentration data were associated with case data reported 7 days later. We found that SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations were still correlated with the lagged clinical data, but the correlations did not consistently improve after the adjustment (Table 2) . For example, the Spearman r for WRF-A increased from 0.533 to 0.550 (daily data) and from 0.790 to 0.793 (7-day average data) after adjusting Table 2 Evaluation of nonparametric Spearman r correlation coefficients between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater and daily new COVID-19 cases. All the data were based on weekly average, from Sunday to Saturday. for the 7-day lag. While the Spearman r for WRF-A1 increased from 0.595 to 0.635 for the daily data, the correlation coefficient decreased from 0.695 to 0.689 for the 7-day average data. The Spearman r correlation coefficients for WRF-A2 both decreased after accounting for the 7-day lag. However, WRF-A1 is a more residential sewershed whereas WRF-A2 is more commercial, which suggests that commercial contributions may dampen correlations between viral concentrations and clinical cases. In WRF-B and WRF-C sewersheds, the Spearman r increased from 0.602 to 0.606 (7-day average data) for WRF-B but decreased from 0.472 to 0.415 (7-day average data) for WRF-C after adjusting for the 7-day lag. However, the correlations of daily results for both WRFs were weak (Spearman r was 0.232 for WRF-B and 0.248 for WRFC). Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations can be used as a 7-day advanced predictor of COVID-19 case trends, but the 7-day lag has a more muted impact relative to the effect of calculating 7-day averages for the two datasets.",

After integrating the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentration data for WRF-A from July 2020 through September 2021 and accounting for flow rate, it was estimated that 1.09 \u00d7 10 16 gene copies were shed into the wastewater in three WRFs. The wastewater-derived estimate for total infections during that timeframe was 108,382 (28% of the service population), whereas there were 54,772 confirmed cases (14% of the population) according to clinical data posted on the Washoe County COVID-19 Dashboard (Washoe County Health District, 2021). Therefore, there were 53,610 asymptomatic or unconfirmed cases in the study area, which constitutes 14% of the service population (Table 3) . The results from this study clearly suggest that clinical data underestimate actual infection totals. Interestingly, in the sewersheds of WRF-A and WRFB, the results produced similar of estimations for the ratio of asymptomatic or unconfirmed cases. This may because those two sewersheds are largely residential, whereas WRF-C sewershed has higher level of commercial activity. The Reno international airport is located in WRF-C sewershed and can cause a relatively high level of population mobility and tend to have more non-resident population in this area. Those reasons can contribute more difficulty when estimate COVID-19 cases using SARS-CoV-2 monitoring data in this sewershed.",
