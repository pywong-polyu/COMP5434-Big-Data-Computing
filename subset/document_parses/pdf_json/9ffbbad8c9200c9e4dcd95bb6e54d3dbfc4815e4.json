            "text": "Purpose: Lung diseases are the third leading cause of death worldwide. Stethoscope-based auscultation is the most commonly used, non-invasive, inexpensive, and primary diagnostic approach for assessing lung conditions. However, the manual auscultation-based diagnosis procedure is prone to error, and its accuracy is dependent on the physician's experience and hearing capacity. Moreover, the stethoscope recording is vulnerable to different noises that can mask the important features of lung sounds which may lead to misdiagnosis. In this paper, a method for the acquisition of lung sound signals and classification of the top 7 lung diseases has been proposed for improving the efficacy of auscultation diagnosis of pulmonary disease. Methods: An electronic stethoscope has been constructed for signal acquisition. Lung sound signals were then collected from people with COPD, upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), pneumonia, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis, asthma, and healthy people. Lung sounds were analyzed using a wavelet multiresolution analysis. To choose the most relevant features, feature selection using one-way ANOVA was performed. The classification accuracy of various machine learning classifiers was compared, and the Fine Gaussian SVM was chosen for final classification due to its superior performance. Model optimization was accomplished through the application of Bayesian optimization techniques. Results: A test classification accuracy of 99%, specificity of 99.2%, and sensitivity of 99.04%, have been achieved for the 7 lung diseases using the optimized Fine Gaussian SVM classifier. Conclusion: Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has the potential to be used as a decision support system for the classification of lung diseases, especially in those areas where the expertise and the means are limited.",

            "text": "Lungs, the principal organs of the human respiratory system, can be affected by a variety of disorders. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis, and other disorders are examples. COPD is a common chronic inflammatory lung disease that is primarily caused by smoking. [1] [2] [3] It causes breathing difficulty, cough, production of mucus (sputum), and wheezing. 2, 3 These symptoms are also common in asthma disease, 4 which is another most common and widespread lung diseases that is associated with airway obstruction in the lungs. [4] [5] [6] It causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or early in the morning. 5 Pneumonia is an infection that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi and inflames the air sacs called alveoli in one or both lungs. 7 It causes coughing that may cause mucus production, fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath. An upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a respiratory illness that occurs commonly in both children and adults and is a major cause of mild morbidity. 8 It is caused by several families of viruses, such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, enterovirus, and the recently discovered bocavirus. 8 URTIs affect the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, sinuses, pharynx, or larynx. 9,10 LRTI symptoms, on the other hand, vary and depend on the severity of the infection, and it is the leading cause of pediatric mortality and morbidity in low and middle-income countries. 10 The less severe infections can have the same symptoms as bronchiolitis or bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened. 11 It can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection, resulting in a build-up of excess mucus. It causes a persistent cough which usually brings up phlegm (sputum), and breathlessness. Bronchiolitis is also a common lung infection among infants that occurs when small breathing tubes (bronchioles) become infected.",

For the diagnosis of pulmonary problems, imaging modalities such as chest x-rays, CT scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are employed. In contrast, the risk of repeated doses of harmful radiation, the cost of machines, and the inconvenience of deploying them in remote regions are only a few of the challenges of adopting imaging modalities, particularly for many third-world patients. Spirometers are also commonly used to measure the volume of inspired and expired air by the lungs, as well as to detect abnormal ventilation patterns. However, a spirometer requires a skilled operator, is expensive, ineffective at detecting obstructiverestrictive defects, and necessitates a large number of patient breathing motions and forceful breathing. 12 An arterial blood gas analyzer (ABG) can also be used to assess lung problems using arterial blood gas exchange (pO2 and pCO2). 13 However, the ABG test is expensive and requires an invasive procedure.",

They provide vital information regarding the health of the lungs. 15, 16 A stethoscope is a handy, easy, low-cost and completely non-invasive diagnostic tool used to identify lung disorders based on lung sounds. On the other hand, auscultation with a stethoscope gives a limited and subjective perception of respiratory sounds. Subjectivity leads to discrepancies in the interpretation of lung sounds by various medical experts. Subjectivity and inconsistency are caused by the physician's hearing capability, experience, and ability to distinguish and define various sound patterns. Furthermore, the stethoscope recording is highly susceptible to noise. Noise signals mask crucial characteristics of lung sound signals, thus leading to incorrect diagnosis of lung diseases.",

Similarly, Haider et al, 20 proposed a respiratory sound-based classification of pulmonary diseases as normal or COPD using SVM and an accuracy of 83.6% was reported. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep neural network (DNN) techniques have been also proposed in the literature for the classification of lung abnormalities. 15, 23 Demir et al, 15 employed a CNN-based approach for the classification of lung diseases (crackles, crackles combined with wheezes, wheezes, and normal) and an accuracy of 63.09% was reported using spectrogram images.

The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is a time-frequency signal analysis approach that provides good localization in both the time and frequency domains. DWT was used to denoise lung sound signals in three steps: decomposition, detail coefficient thresholding, and reconstruction. Denoising the lung sound signals was accomplished using several wavelet functions and threshold selection criteria. For the final denoising procedure, a wavelet function and level of decomposition with a higher SNR value were used. The first (decomposition) phase involved selecting a suitable wavelet function and determining the level of wavelet decomposition (sym13 at 6th level of decomposition). In the second step, for each wavelet decomposition level 1 to N, soft thresholding was applied to the detail (high frequency) coefficients of the signal. The final step, reconstruction, was done using the original approximation coefficients of level N and the modified detail coefficients of levels from 1 to N. Furthermore, the performance of the two thresholding methods (soft and hard thresholding) for the denoising of lung sounds was investigated using four well-known standard threshold selection rules: heursure, rigrsure, minimaxi, and sqtwolog. 25, 26 Feature Extraction",

In the first step, using the training data, the method estimates the probability distribution of the parameters by assuming each predictor is conditionally independent given the class. Then, in the prediction step, for any new data, the method computes the posterior probability distribution of that sample belonging to each class. KNN classifiers, on the other hand, classify the object based on the distance between the new object and the defined objects. The new object is assigned to the class K that has the shortest distance to class K which is defined as the nearest neighbor. 28 Ensemble classifiers mix results from many weak learners into one high-quality ensemble model. The SVM algorithm represents the training data as points in a flat separated space by an apparent gap. Then, the new objects are mapped into space with the forecast category based on which side of the gap they fall. It classifies the data by finding the best hyperplane which separates data points of one class from those of the other classes.

Many spectral analysis techniques including Fourier transform (FT), fast Fourier transform (FFT)-Welch, autoregressive (AR), AR-Burg, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) have been used in the literature for lung sound signal analysis. 19, 20, 30, 31 Time domain analysis techniques such as empirical mode decomposition and multiscale entropy techniques have been also used for analysis of lung sounds. [32] [33] [34] However, frequency-domain or time-domain analysis techniques alone cannot provide enough information of the nonstationary lung sound signals. Due to this, time-frequency domain analysis techniques have been also employed in literature for analysis of the non-stationary lung sound signals. 15, 19, 35 Short-time Fourier transform (STFT)-based analysis techniques provide both time and frequency information of signals but unable to extract multiple features due to single and fixed window regions.

Lung sounds of 7 top lung diseases and health subjects were recorded using a custom designed and constructed electronic stethoscope. In addition, online annotated lung sound signals were also included in our dataset. All the lung sound records were normalized at the same sampling rate of 44.1KHz and bit-depth of 16 bits. Furthermore, DWT-based denoising of the lung sound signals involving decomposition, detail coefficient thresholding, and reconstruction was performed on all signals. Four wavelet functions (Db4, Db10, Sym5, and Sym13) and four different threshold selection rules (Rigrsure, Sqtwolog, Heursure, and Minmax) were compared in denoising the lung sound signals. The SNR results for the different wavelet functions were calculated at different levels of decomposition (3rd to 7th) for comparison. After evaluation, the Sym13 wavelet function at 6th level decomposition with soft thresholding method and Sqtwolog threshold selection rule outperformed the others and was selected for denoising operation.",

A one-way ANOVA feature ranking method using minmax normalization scheme was implemented and 13 out of 16 most discriminative features were selected to train different machine learning models. Then, feature normalization was performed to all extracted feature values to avoid bias to the classifier during model training and classification. After feature normalization, the whole data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%). Then, an eightfold cross-validation technique was applied to the training dataset. 8 machine learning models from 4 families were trained and validated to select the best performing model.",

KNN classifiers typically have best predictive accuracy in low dimensions but might not be good in high dimensions. 22 Additionally, KNN classifiers have high memory usage and are not easy to interpret. Naive Bayes classifiers are easy to interpret and useful for multiclass classification. 22 However, the Naive Bayes algorithms need a small amount of training data for estimating the vital parameters which made the algorithms extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods. 36 In addition, ensemble algorithms, RUS Boosted trees and Bagged trees were trained, and an accuracy of 96.5% and 97.3%, respectively, were achieved. Ensemble classifiers tend to be slow to fit because they often need many weak learners. 36 SVM algorithms including Cubic SVM and Fine Gaussian SVM were also trained and a relatively higher accuracy of 97.5% and 97.8%, respectively, were achieved. Accordingly, the model with the highest classification accuracy, Fine Gaussian SVM was selected and further optimized using Bayesian The proposed method delivered considerably improved results compared to similar lung sound signal processing, analysis and classification methods proposed in the literature.
