At the same time, WHO published a series of general recommendations to reduce the chances of an individual being infected or spreading COVID-19, and these were further disseminated by the Romanian Ministry of Health via media: washing hands regularly, maintaining social distance and avoiding crowded places, avoiding touching one's eyes, nose and mouth, self-isolation even when minor symptoms occur, wearing masks. 1 However, the recommendations have not been followed by everyone at the same rate, in line with previous studies that have shown that, generally, education and information are not enough for achieving behaviour change. 2 As the experiences from previous pandemics have shown, various psychological factors, such as health anxiety, can influence people's adherence to recommendations 3, 4 and identifying these factors can optimise individual and societal response. 5 Furthermore, mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression have been on the rise since the pandemic started. Statistics have shown significant increases in virus-related fear and worry in the general population since the beginning of the pandemic, 6 and health anxiety specifically has also increased, especially in individuals who are already vulnerable. Health anxiety in particular has been linked to excessive safety behaviours, such as reassurance seeking, 7 which further exacerbate distress. 6 On the other hand, too little anxiety has been linked to lower adherence to preventive measures, such as hand washing or social distancing, 8 so it is not clear if in times like this, anxiety is more of a friend or a foe. More specifically, as health anxiety has increased during the COVID pandemic, to what extent is it harmful, and how does it influence adherence with recommended preventive measures?",

Perceived susceptibility is defined as beliefs about the likelihood of getting a disease or condition, whereas perceived severity is represented by beliefs about the seriousness of contracting the disease, 18 both further representing the components of perceived risk, defined as the perceived individual vulnerability to a particular health risk. 19 According to the protection motivation theory postulated by Rogers, 20 a high perceived risk of a disease is associated with the adoption of preventive measures.",

To determine if any significant relationships exist between the variables that would justify further examination, we initially performed a correlational analysis, using Pearson's r coefficient. Next, we employed multiple regression analyses in order to test the predictive power of our theoretical models. We tested the assumptions of linearity and multivariate normality for each regression model by inspecting the Q-Q and residual plots, and collinearity diagnostics were also employed. Furthermore, the forced entry method was used in the case of each regression model as previous work has shown that it is the most appropriate method for theory testing. 32 Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted by using the 'medmod' package in Jamovi. For mediation and moderation analyses, in addition to the large sample z-test of the mediated/moderated effect, which is a slightly more accurate version of the Sobel test, we also employed a nonparametric resampling procedure, namely bootstrapping (with 1000 samples), for the calculation of the standard errors of the mediated/moderated effect.",

We explored those dimensions in response to the pandemic in Romania in March to May 2020, when a national state of emergency was declared and recommendations for public health and safety were issued, with some restrictions legally enforced. In our study, health anxiety was a statistically significant predictor in all relationships, while perceived risk and perceived control were taken into consideration as mediators/moderators of the relation between health anxiety, on the one hand, and preventive measures (both adaptive and excessive), as well as COVID-19 anxiety, on the other hand. More specifically, we looked into: (a) perceived risk as a mediator between health anxiety and preventive measures and COVID-19 anxiety and (b) perceived control as a moderator of In line with our hypotheses, health anxiety significantly predicted all constructs, whereas perceived control only predicted adaptive behaviours, and perceived risk only predicted COVID-19 anxiety. In our study, health anxiety was the most important predictor of COVID-19 anxiety and preventive measures, confirming recent literature on the role it has in engaging in protective and adaptive behaviours during the coronavirus pandemic. 6 Interestingly, our data showed that perceived risk did not significantly predict adaptive and excessive preventive behaviours, contradicting previous research, 33 and was not a mediator between health anxiety and preventive measures. More precisely, the way in which participants perceived (COVID-19) risk did not predict the preventive measures they engaged in, nor determined the influence that health anxiety had on their preventive behaviour. A possible explanation for this is the timing of the data collection, as we looked into the first months of the pandemic. When the first preventive measures were enforced in March 2020, Romania had reported under 200 people with COVID-19, albeit a national state of emergency was declared. As panic ensued, people may have respected the recommendations indiscriminately, regardless of how risky they perceived COVID-19 to be (i.e. for themselves as individuals). This hypothesis could also be backed up by the fact that we found a high mean figure for adaptive preventive behaviours in our sample, meaning that the majority of people engaged in an above average level of healthy responses. However, perceived risk was a mediator of the relation between health anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety, indicating that health anxiety may lead to a heightened perceived risk, which further could increase COVID-19 anxiety.",

That is, for people with a higher level of perceived control the relationship between health anxiety and excessive preventive behaviours was stronger. Based on the findings of recent studies involving a false sense of control 34, 35 and the increasing number of conspiracy theories, 36 a plausible explanation is that excessive preventive behaviours are anxiety-driven responses following excessive media coverage of the pandemic. More specifically, exposure to an overwhelming amount of information around COVID-19, and (probably) also to fake news, influenced people who were both health-anxious and also 'in control' to exert control in any area they could do so (for example, stockpiling food). We also need to take into consideration that perceived control did not moderate the relationship between health anxiety and adaptive behaviours. This implies that people with a higher level of health anxiety engaged more often in preventive behaviours, as indicated by previous literature, 6 regardless of the level of perceived control. However, we have to take into account the fact that our data were collected in the early months of the pandemic, when people were likely scared and willing to respect the recommendations, regardless of how much control they thought they had. Things may have looked different in more recent months, as data have shown that the initial 'complete adherence' from March 2020 declined by the summer of 2020 37 and that in Romania specifically, adherence rates decreased along with increasing mistrust in government policies. 38 ",

Our regression results indicate the importance of health anxiety and perceived control in the way individuals engage in adaptive preventive behaviours as a response to the pandemic. The implications behind these results suggest a key role for control and self-efficacy, and the practicality would be to convey their importance when communicating about the pandemic. However, perceived control also had a role as a moderator of the relationship between health anxiety and excessive prevention, meaning health anxiety can drive maladaptive preventive behaviours particularly in people with a heightened sense of control.",

            "text": "There are some limitations in our study. First, we cannot make any causal interpretations, since the study employed a cross-sectional design. It could be that taking preventive measures against COVID-19 predicts the perceived control one has over the situation and not vice versa. Future research should address these issues through experimental designs or longitudinal studies. Second, the sample showed low variability. The data was collected from 26 March to 5 May, a time period in which Romania had just been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and during which a fairly harsh lockdown was imposed. At that time, 95% of the sample had not experienced any typical symptoms and 63% were very unlikely to have been in contact with someone infected with the virus. The data could show more variability at this time with regard to exposure to the virus, since Romania experienced a spike in infections during the Spring of 2021. We also need to take into consideration that the data was collected early in the pandemic and measures may have been more strictly followed then compared with at the time of writing (February 2021), when complete adherence to prevention measures has declined, 37,39 along with a relaxation of governmental restrictions. Moreover, the majority of the sample reported high perceived control with regard to preventive measures, so there was little variability in these data. Another limitation refers to the instruments that we adapted for measuring perceived control and preventive behaviours (adaptive and excessive). In the case of perceived control, there is a chance that its items were too closely related to the recommendations given by the government. In the case of excessive behaviours, although correlations between the scale items and total score were adequate, leading us to believe that removing items was unnecessary, the low Cronbach's alpha that we observed represents a limitation, with regard to the interpretability of the results. Third, the gender imbalance in the study limits the generalisation of the results. The majority of our sample were women. A recent study 40 showed that men may be more inclined to dismiss preventive measures, such as wearing a mask or social distancing.",
