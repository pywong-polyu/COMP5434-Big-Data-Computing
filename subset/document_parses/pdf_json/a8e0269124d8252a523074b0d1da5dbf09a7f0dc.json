A few studies have successfully identified SARS-CoV-2 in the air of hospital rooms using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or viral cultures. [2] [3] [4] [5] However, air contamination in households has yet to be characterized. The household setting has high secondary-attack rates, and members of the same household have been shown to experience up to 10 times greater risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than other contacts (ie, healthcare workers, workplace contacts, and nonhousehold contacts). [6] [7] [8] Understanding the degree of air contamination in household settings would help us tailor prevention interventions in these high-risk settings. To address this knowledge gap, our study aimed to characterize and compare the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples obtained in household settings against air samples obtained in inpatient rooms both selected based on the presence of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients.",

Briefly, the air sampler was positioned 0.305-1.83 m from the patient's head to collect 1,000-4,000 L (50 L/minute). We evaluated shorter distances and higher volumes until we were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in air samples. For samples that obtained 4,000 L, 2 air samplers were used concomitantly for 40 minutes (50 L/minute; 2,000 L each). Gelatin filters were placed in 6 mL viral transport media (VTM) (Remel M4RT, ThermoFisher, Lenexa, KS). If 2 air samplers were used concomitantly to achieve 4,000 L, then both gelatin membranes were placed in a single container with 6 mL VTM. These plates were incubated at 37 o C for 1 minute to allow the gelatin filter to dissolve. This mixture was then spun in a vortex machine and centrifuged at 13,000\u00d7g for 1 minute, and 1 mL supernatant was used for nucleic acid extraction. Nucleic acid extraction and RT-PCR were performed on the Cobas 6800 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's emergency use authorization (EUA)-approved product insert. For patient specimens, combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from each patient, and both the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were placed into 3 mL VTM (Copan, Murrieta, CA). RT-PCR was performed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on each sample using the Cobas 6800 according to the manufacturer's EUA-approved product insert.",

Inpatient rooms only tested positive when the volume of air sampled was quadrupled and the distance between air samplers and patients was minimal. Thus, these positive results may represent contaminated respiratory droplets being expelled by patients rather than actual air contamination. Given that room ventilation (ie, air changes per hour) was the main difference between these settings, our findings may suggest that the degree of ventilation in a room is more important in determining the degree of air contamination than the acuity of illness that a SARS-CoV-2 patient may be experiencing. Previous studies have characterized the air contamination in inpatient areas with a wide range of findings between 1.3% and 63.2% [2] [3] [4] [5] ; however, the viability of the virus in air samples is still controversial. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of air contamination by SARS-CoV-2 within household settings.",

Furthermore, we did not measure the temperature or humidity of the rooms, which are environmental variables that may potentially affect the viability of the virus. In addition, we obtained more air samples per household than per inpatient room; therefore, we increased the likelihood of detecting positive samples in households. Despite these limitations, our preliminary findings suggest that household settings may have high degree of air contamination, signaling a major impact of room ventilation on this outcome. Future studies should characterize the variables determining the degree of air contamination in households and explore innovative ways to ameliorate this problem, especially in crowded households without access to natural ventilation.
