The study was conducted at the MaxilloFacial Surgery Unit of \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro, on two different groups of patients: a group of follow-up patients (A 1 : patients in oncological follow-up after surgical treatment performed before the COVID-19 pandemic; A 2 : suffering from chronic lesions such as precancerous lesions), and a group B of patients with first urgent visits (B 1 : patients with suspected oncological pathology; B 2 : patients with suspected urgent disease such as medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ), odontogenic abscesses, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation, etc.). Participation in the study required possession of a smartphone with Internet access, e-mail and the use of a messaging service (WhatsApp or Telegram) to send photos and messages; completion by the patient of a COVID-19 screening questionnaire; submission of a satisfaction questionnaire by the doctors and patients. A total of 90 patients were included in this study. A high percentage of satisfaction emerged from the analysis of the satisfaction questionnaires of both patients and doctors.TM thus represents an excellent opportunity to improve accessibility to oncological and non-management activities, reducing the risk of Covid-19 dissemination and should be promoted and implemented in the post-pandemic era.",

TM can be defined as the set of telematic technologies used to provide the patient with health care services-diagnosis, monitoring, therapy-at distance. It is therefore a distance delivery of health services. For the World Health Organization, TM literally means \"remote healing\" and indicates the use of technologies, information and communication to improve the health outcomes of patients, increasing access to medical care and information. What qualifies the TM is therefore the prefix \"Tele\", that is the distance from the health worker who provides the service, regardless of the technology with which the contact is made. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, TM, although available for years, was gradually entering medical practice [3] and in any case used above all in chronic patients to offer home remote monitoring solutions that guaranteed continuity of care by Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 7365 2 of 11 preventing emergency situations and avoiding hospitalizations. Usage was somewhat limited due to numerous regulatory restrictions.",

            "text": "In Italy as early as July 2012, the Superior Health Council approved the Italian guidelines on telemedicine, and according to experts of the time, technological innovation would have been able to reorganize healthcare through innovative care models, which would have facilitated access to services on the national territory. With the stipulation of the Pact for Digital Healthcare in 2016, we continued to talk about TM as a means of providing healthcare services and the need to implement tele-visits, tele-consultations and tele-cooperation healthcare to achieve important system changes, as well as to achieve big savings. But what developments and benefits have there been in the meantime? What real benefits has the use of this \"new\" technology brought to doctors and patients? Unfortunately, it is not easy to find data on the effective implementation of the Pact and an emergency like COVID-19 was necessary to return to talking about the usefulness of TM, although it is certain that communication technologies, such as smartphones, tablets and laptops, have supported the rapid development of telemedicine as a new concept of health care to provide remote assistance [4] [5] [6] . The most significant advantages of TM are consultation in real time and archiving and forwarding of data; however, TM is not without drawbacks: in fact, the first concern when it comes to telemedicine is always its accessibility because a availability of stable connections in remote areas is often problematic and increases the concern for poorer patients with limited access to the Internet [7] . Another obstacle is the impossibility of carrying out an adequate clinical examination at a distance, but the main problem is the selection of patients to be visited in the clinic and those to be subjected to remote visits [8, 9] . From the experience acquired by the authors during the COVID-19 pandemic, it emerged that TM is indicated above all in the follow-up of cancer patients, because they are immunosuppressed for previous chemo/radiation treatments and therefore subject to greater risk of contagion, and chronic as well as urgent visits for suspected malignancy [10] . Certainly, the COVID-19 emergency made us talk about the usefulness of TM as it made it essential to resort to tele-medical practices to avoid overcrowding in hospitals and the risk of a massive spread of the virus also in hospitals. More precisely, this study describes its advantages in the management of outpatient maxillofacial surgical pathologies during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The high percentage of satisfaction that emerged from the analysis of the satisfaction questionnaires administered to the patient shows that telemedicine was well accepted especially by the patients residing in areas rather far from the structure, who had to travel a long way and above all be exposed to other patients who could be carriers of COVID-19 and other more common infectious agents. Above contact, although remotely, has positively influenced the patient's state of well-being, motivation and sense of security specially in this uncertain period. Of all patients, 37 were resident in the province of Catanzaro and 53 were from other provinces of Calabria with an average distance of 103 km between home and hospital. In some of these countries, severe restrictions had also been adopted to strengthen the containment of COVID-19. Without digitization and an online conversation, the imposed social isolation would not have allowed for the follow-up of their clinical development. The limitations to the method were the impossibility of carrying out a complete clinical evaluation and a data connection that is not always reliable. This can be overcome by better documentation, shared decision-making and pragmatic management, because the COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity for healthcare organizations to reassess the crucial role played by telemedicine in the clinical mission, through the optimization of the software and procedures, together with the development of telesurgery due to improvements in 5G data transmission [18] . If implemented, the telemedicine platform will bring a variety of potential benefits for both patients and healthcare organizations [3, 19] . In the field of maxillofacial surgery, it will be possible to think of a wider use as in the traumatology which, as is known, does not represent an emergency condition but a deferrable urgency [20] . Through a telematics meeting of a multidisciplinary team, it is possible to plan the treatment, through the visualization of the radiological images, and program the surgical intervention to minimize the duration of the hospital stay beyond that health spending.",

The experience acquired by the authors during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that telemedicine is indicated above all in the follow-up of cancer patients, because they are immunosuppressed for previous chemo/radiation treatments and therefore subject to greater risk of contagion, in chronic as well as urgent visits for suspected malignancy and in patients who live far from a hospital. Social distancing measures have made it difficult to access health facilities without while eliminating the risk of contagion between health personnel and patients. The government limitations implemented, the patient's awareness of being constantly monitored for his pathology through teleconsultation, contributed both to increasing patient compliance and to establishing a more effective doctor-patient relationship. The post-pandemic role of telemedicine depends on regulatory solutions which, in our opinion, will always have to take into consideration the empathic doctor-patient relationship, which would risk, pushing technology extremely, to a dehumanization of care. Although the priority today is to limit the spread of COVID-19, also we must think of an optimal and safe recovery of non-urgent medical activities that have been delayed due to the emergency and not to increase the spread of the infection within the healthcare facilities. In fact, the social distancing measures will make access to medical clinics difficult and will not eliminate the risk of contagion between health personnel and patients.",
