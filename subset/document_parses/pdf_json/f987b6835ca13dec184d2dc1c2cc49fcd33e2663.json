            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with a genome size of ~29.9 kilobase pairs which spans 29 open reading frames. Studies have revealed that the genome encodes about 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp), four structural proteins, and six or seven accessory proteins. Based on prevalent knowledge on SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, functions have been assigned for majority of the proteins. While, researchers across the globe are engrossed in identifying a potential pharmacological intervention to control the viral outbreak, none of the work has come up with new antiviral drugs or vaccines yet. One possible approach that has shown some positive results is by treating infected patients with the plasma collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Several vaccines around the world have entered their final trial phase in humans and we expect that these will in time be available for application to worldwide population to combat the disease. In this work we analyse the effect of prevalent mutations in the major pathogenesis related proteins of SARS-COV2 and attempt to pinpoint the effects of those mutations on the structural stability of the proteins. Our observations and analysis direct us to identify that all the major mutations have a negative impact in context of stability of the viral proteins under study and the mutant proteins suffer both structural and functional alterations as a result of the mutations. Our binary scoring scheme identifies L84S mutation in ORF8 as the most disruptive of the mutations under study. We believe that, the virus is under the influence of an evolutionary phenomenon similar to Muller's ratchet where the continuous accumulation of these mutations is making the virus less virulent which may also explain the reduction in fatality rates worldwide.

            "text": "What started off as an unusual outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan China has reached the farthest corners of the world as a global pandemic. Till date there are over 60 million people affected by this novel strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and has been named as SARS-CoV-2 with the disease named as COVID-19. Genomic structures and phylogenomic studies reveal that the causal agent of COVID-19 belongs to genera Beta coronavirus. It is similar to the human Beta coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) but there are important differences at the genotypic and phenotypic levels which ultimately influence their pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV-2 contains a single stranded positive sense RNA encapsulated in a nucleoprotein matrix. The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 consists of approximately 29,800 nucleotides, encoding for 29 known proteins, though we find the expression of 28 to be constant with one remaining unexpressed. Each of the 28 proteins that are reported to be encoded perform different functions in the viral pathogenesis cascade though we are still not fully aware of the plethora of functions that they perform (Zeng et al., 2004) . Four proteins make up the viral structure of which the most studied and important protein is the S protein or spike protein since they are the regulators of viral entry into the host. This protein binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and gains entry into the host cell. A pair wise amino acid comparison using the amino acid sequences reveal that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 share more than 80% sequence homology to SARS-CoV. Conservation is found in residues which interact with the ACE2 receptor; however, the other residues are a bit different with a few insertions as well. Till date the reports indicate that the interaction of the spike protein of SARS CoV-2 is much stronger as compared to the previous coronaviruses . A nonpeer-reviewed preprint posted on medRxiv hypothesises that since ACE2 is overexpressed in the lung tissue of people with chronic respiratory disorders, they are likely to be more affected by this prevalent strain of the virus (Pinto et al., 2020) . However, the infectivity of the virus is not restricted to its affinity for ACE2. If we dig deeper into the structure of the S protein we shall find that they are composed of two segments, S1 and S2 that require a double cleavage to expose the peptide which initiates the fusion with ACE2. The first cleavage is mediated by a host cell encoded enzyme furin. This ability to get human enzymes to do its work increases its infective ability as well. Few non-structural proteins of the virus are involved in the evasion of the host immune system and also function towards the assembly and replication of the virus. These proteins are expressed as part of two large polyproteins which are produced from a ribosomal frameshift event and are cleaved by the protease into 16 different proteins each with specific functions (Seah et al., 2020) . The rest of the proteins are the accessory proteins which are technically non-essential as they are not required for viral replication in vitro and are the least well understood of the total proteome (Kim et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Since this is a new pathogen, researchers worldwide are looking towards both primary and secondary prevention strategies in the form of vaccination as well as an over the counter medication which can be afforded by citizens around the world. Whatever strategy is being envisaged, the threat lies in the appearance of new strains with resistant mutations to vaccines and therapeutic agents. As a large proportion of humanity is already infected and we have no strategy in place currently to identify the asymptomatic carriers due to the lack of infrastructural and manpower resources around the world, there is high possibility of the successful escape mutations in the genome of the virus. Very few studies till date have focused on mapping the mutations on the important protein components of SARS-CoV-2. During the preparation of this manuscript we came across two studies which attempt to map the effects of significant mutations on the protein structure and stability. Benvenuto et al (2020) reports in more recent isolates of SARS CoV-2,the presence of two mutations affecting the non-Structural Protein 6 (NSP6) and the Open Reading Frame10 (ORF 10) in adjacent regions. Amino acidic change stability analysis suggests both mutations could confer lower stability of the protein structures. Namely, at amino acid position 3691 (corresponding to NSP6 position 37), most of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences have a leucine residue while some more recent sequences from Asian, American, Oceanian and European isolates show phenylalanine. At the amino acidic position 9659 (corresponding to ORF 10 position 3 to 4), most of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences have an arginine residue while some sequences from Australian and American isolates have a histidine residue. In the second study by Bhattacharya et al (2020) the 614 amino acid position in the S protein was found to be conserved among species (Bat, Pangolin, Civet and Human SARS-CoV and Human SARS-CoV-2), until the A2a subtype defining mutation occurred (D614G) (Bhattacharya et al., 2020) . Authors report that an additional serine protease (elastase) cleavage site around S1-S2 junction was introduced due to D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2. The Glycine at 614 (aa) is predicted to be the nearest substrate site for elastase to perform proteolytic cleavage in the adjacent residue.",

Though currently there are reports of other mutations that have been identified by large scale viral genomic sequencing studies undertaken globally, (Mercatelli and Giorgi 2020) , the following dataset can be considered to be comprised of the initial founder mutations which resulted in the variations in the strain of the virus before the international borders were closed down (Callaway, 2020) following which the selection pressure on the virus became more country and population specific. Following the identification of the mutations we utilised the NCBI Genome Browser to extract the protein sequences using the Wuhan strain as the ancestral strain. Using a generic sliding window approach we were able to pinpoint the sites of mutations and we created two data sets -wild type protein sequences which were directly the ones from the Wuhan strain and the Mutant Data Set -which consisted of the protein sequences carrying the mutations in them ",

Linear B cell epitopes were predicted by using ABCpred (crdd.osdd.net/ Raghava/abcpred/) and LBtope (webs.iiitd.edu.in/Raghava/lbtope/protein.php) servers. ABCpred requires an amino acid sequence as input and generates epitopes using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (Janahi et al., 2017) . A window length of 16 amino acids and threshold of 0.51 were considered for generating the results (Kumar et al., 2018) . \"LBtope: Linear B cell epitope prediction server\" was also used to reveal B cell epitopes of viral origin with a threshold probability score of 60% and above. The T cell epitopes of viral proteins binding to class I and class II Major histocompatibility complex molecules were mined using NetCTL 1.2 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ NetCTL/) and Propred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/propred/). Viral peptides capable of binding to cytotoxic T lymphocytes and MHC I molecules were recognized using NetCTL 1.2 server which facilitates the prediction by combining the scores for proteasomal cleavage, TAP transport efficiency and MHC I binding (Larsen et al., 2007) . The single letter code of amino acid sequence was entered in the user interface, the C terminal cleavage, weight on TAP transport efficiency and threshold for epitope identification was set at values of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.75 respectively. The viral proteins were screened against 12 most recognized supertypes of HLA alleles. The results were generated with a specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 80%, by integrating the scores based on multiple parameters as weighted sum with a relative weight on MHC I binding. For the prediction of MHC class II epitopes, Propred uses quantitative matrices methods which scan the antigen sequence against a profile of HLA-DR binding pockets, each having a unique quantitative representation of the amino acid interactions within the peptide binding cleft (Sturniolo et al., 1999) . Amino acid sequence was provided as input at threshold value of 3, which enabled us to view the top 3% of best scoring peptides with respect to their probability of binding to different Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules. Epitopes were predicted for all the 51 HLA-DR alleles that account for 90% of the MHC molecules on antigen presenting cells (Palanisamy & Lennerstrand, 2017) .",

In our analysis we used the ConSurf web server (http://consurf.tau.ac.il) (Ashkenazy et al., 2016) , for predicting the evolutionary pattern of the amino acids of the macromolecule to reveal regions that are important for structure and function. The structures were submitted as inputs from which the sequences were extracted by the server and top 50 homologues were identified using three PSI -BLAST iterations against the UNIPROT database. Redundant homologous sequences were removed using the CD-HIT clustering method (Li &Godzik, 2006; Fu et al., 2012) . The resulting sequences were then aligned using MAFFT (Katoh & Standley 2013) and the generated multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was used to generate the phylogenetic tree. The tree and the MSA were then considered together and the Rate4Site algorithm (Pupko et al., 2002) was used to calculate the position-specific evolutionary rates using an empirical Bayesian methodology (Mayrose et al., 2004) . The raw data obtained was then normalized and grouped into nine conservation grades where 1 represented the rapidly evolving positions, 5 denoted positions with intermediate rates, and 9 was the threshold for the most evolutionarily conserved position. These were then mapped on the 3D structure on a position specific basis. We performed this analysis using both the Wild type and mutant structures.",

We observed a change in the number of epitopes and their mean binding score for N protein and nsp4 proteins. While the number of epitopes remained unaltered, the mean score showed discrepancy for the ORF8 protein. An epitope holding the alteration site in wild type ORF8 protein had a binding score of 0.64, which was altered to 0.67 post mutation. Again, in proteins like nsp4 and N protein, mutation resulted in recognition of new epitopes covering mutation region, which was not predicted previously in wild type proteins. No fluctuation in epitope count and score was noted in case of ORF3a, S protein, nsp2 and nsp6 proteins (Figure 4) Table 4 ).

The analysis of potential drug binding pockets and their druggability was further evaluated and all the proteins had alterations not only in the total number of drug binding pockets but also the average drug scores when wild type and mutant structures were compared. It was interesting to note that apart from nsp4 and orf8a all the other proteins, suffered a decrease in average druggability as a result of the mutations whereas the former two proteins exhibited an increase in potential druggability (Figure 13 a and 13 b) .

Once the scoring scheme was populated with the corresponding values a heat map was generated to diagrammatically exhibit the contributions of each parameter under study towards the overall cumulative score obtained (Figure 14 a) . The ranking of the mutations were then performed using a histogram in which the cumulative scores were plotted (Figure 14b) . From the histogram we were able to clearly predict the L84S mutation in ORF8a as the most disruptive of the mutations followed closely by nsp4 mutation (ORF1a 3220V) and the mutations in N protein (S202N); or f3A (G251V) and S protein (D614G).

In our analysis nsp2, nsp4 and ORF3a were observed to show an increase in aliphatic index value from wild type to mutant which suggests probable increase in the thermostability of these proteins due to mutation. Interestingly ORF3a protein has a significant role in the functioning of S protein in the host system to increase infection which may be affected by the increased thermostability of ORF3a. Momen-Roknabadi et. al. (2008) , in their study predicted that accessible surface area can be used to improve the prediction of secondary structure of a protein (Momen-Roknabadi et al., 2008) . According to Lins et al (2003) , different secondary structures correspond to different accessibility of residues. In their study, they found that random coils, beta sheets were more accessible folds with average 30% accessibility, while the alpha helices have 20% accessibility.

While gain of function mutations can improve the binding affinities of epitopes to host lymphocyte receptors, loss of function mutations arising through positive selection can be crucial for B and T cell immune escape (Ramaiah et al., 2019) . Each of the seven mutant proteins investigated, exhibited either change in free energies of binding or recognition by specific alleles, thus necessitating further exploration to evaluate their impact on immune escape and viral persistence. Besides, changes in the number of linear B-cell epitopes were spotted in proteins like nsp4 and N protein. In our study, we observed an epitope covering mutation region, recognized by A3 supertype in wild type of N protein but no changes in corresponding epitope was spotted by the same supertype in the mutant N protein (loss of function mutation); in contrast we spotted a mutation spanning epitope in mutant nsp4 protein perceived by A3 supertype, which was not detected by the same supertype in the wild type nsp4 protein (gain of function mutation). Another significant finding was the decline in the number of MHC II binding T-cell epitopes in the ORF8 and S protein, where the mutant protein was found to have 4 and 3 less immunogenic determinants respectively. Each of the seven proteins were assigned a score of either '-1' or '0', for each of the four computational tools used for epitope prediction, where '-1' corresponds to any change in number or binding efficacy of antigenic determinants, that may have surfaced because of mutation and '0' corresponds to no changes between wild type and mutant forms.",

RMSF is averaged over time, depicting a value for each particle i, while in case of RMSD, the average is taken over the particles, giving time specific values. Zhao et al (2015) have probed into the effect of mutations in the Zinc Binding B box1 domain protein (Zhao et al., 2015) . In their study they have looked into the changes in the dynamics of the backbone atoms and also calculated root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values at each time point of the trajectories of the native and mutant structures. They found that mutations induced higher RMSF which led them to suggest that the much larger side-chain of valine extends its steric hindrance to other zinc-binding residues. Supporting the increased flexibility, they also measured the RMSF values for second zinc-binding residues (C134, C137, H150, H159); which led to the final conclusion that: larger RMSF values indicate increased random motions of residues leading to disruption in the structural integrity of the proteins. In our analysis we have also observed a similar phenomenon with the increase in the RMSF values in mutant structures ultimately causing randomness in the 3D structures which is evidenced by their increased RMSD and more negative Q mean scores. The significance of Q mean scores have been extensively reported by de Carvalho and De Mesquita (2013) in their work on human superoxide disputes 2 where they com-pared wild type and mutant structures and reported the effect of mutations (de Carvalho & de Mesquita 2013). Using the TM align and Q mean methodology Datta et al (2015) have explored the effect of 124 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the ribonuclease L gene (RNASEL) in prostate cancer (Datta et al., 2015) . All the SNP's were mapped on the protein structure and TM Align was used to classify the most disrupting mutants. In our analyses we have been able to clearly show that mutations caused significant changes in protein structures where highest RMSD value was observed for S protein (5.67), while maximum number of mismatches were observed in case of N protein (24 out of 419). N Protein also had a high RMSD of 4.93. Thus from the structural comparisons of wild type and mutant proteins we were able to understand that almost all the mutations destabilised their native conformation.",

Our final scoring revealed that ORF8 protein mutation L84S was the most disruptive of the mutations under study.

These data suggest that this mutation was one of the earliest of the mutations that could have occurred naturally as it does not exhibit any population specificity and may be attributed to a random event. This data was however consistent with the predictions made in the I Mutant server which had assigned the most negative value for L84S and classified it as the most disruptive. This data justifies our scoring scheme and the parameters considered towards the prediction of the most disruptive mutation and thus can be explored further for future studies. Recent works suggest that the lowering of the stability of viral proteins as a result of accumulation of mutations (Banerjee et al., 2020) could be the reason behind the low National fatality rate in India. It may also be a phenomenon similar to Muller's ratchet where this accumulation of mutations in fresh strains of the virus and lack of stabilising recombination events may result in the reduction in fitness of the virus as is being indicated by the effect of the mutations on protein stability.",

Also 4 less antigenic determinants were detected in the mutant protein above the standard mark. In case of the S protein, the mutation resulted in both abolishment and establishment of new epitopes enclosing the mutation site, recognized by several alleles in wild type and mutant proteins, pointing to the changes in binding capabilities emerging out of mutation. The nsp4 protein showed dissimilarities in the number of epitopes faring well above the cut off score, with 2 antigenic determinants (surrounding mutation site) remaining unrecognized by the same allele in the mutant protein and 4 epitopes (spanning mutation site) showing altered probability score. Changes in the number and binding specificity of epitopes and deviation of scores were also noted between wild type and mutant forms of nsp6 proteins.
