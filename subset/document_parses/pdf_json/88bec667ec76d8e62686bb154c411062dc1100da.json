The dental caries risk is determined by biological, behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental factors, commonly known as caries risk factors [1, 2] . According to the Indonesian government's 2018 basic health surveillance results, the prevalence of dental caries in Indonesia is 75.3%; the average DMF-T index among 15-to 24-year-olds (college students, in general) is 3.1, which lies within the moderate DMF-T category according to the World Health Organization [3, 4] .",

Health promotion allows individuals to be able to control the determinants or risk factors of dental caries in order to reduce the caries risk and, ultimately, reduce the prevalence of dental caries [5, 8] . This can be performed using media teaching aids/props to convey and demonstrate information during the educational or teaching process, thus making it easier to understand and more attractive to the student [9, 10] .",

Dental students learn about oral health in college either directly from lecturers or independently by using educational media, such as Youtube, video, internet, etc. One of the effective ways to reduce dental caries disease in dental student is to practice oral health self-care, and dental student can measure the risk of dental caries independently [11, 12] . Recently, online learning using educational media is increasingly being incorporated into the medical and dental teaching methods due to the pandemic Covid-19 [13, 14] . With the development of information technology in the modern era, information about oral health such as dental caries risk should not be difficult to obtain. Web applications can play a role in improving oral health via the sharing of educational materials, which could motivate dental students to change their oral health behaviours in a way that decreases the dental caries risk [15, 16] . College students are one of the groups in society who mostly use the Internet as a source for learning activities. Web media, which present data through audio, visual, and audio-visual means, can increase student's interest and are proven to be more effective for sharing information [17] [18] [19] . According to a survey conducted by the Association of Indonesian Internet Network Providers, a total of 132.7 million Indonesians were connected to the Internet in 2016 [20] .",

The results showed an improvement in caries risk knowledge and reduction in caries risk score after using the application. However, only the group who were given educational materials in addition to the web application (intervention group) showed a significant increase in caries risk knowledge. Aside from the background of the study, the respondent was an undergraduate pre-clinical dental students from the grade 1st, grade 2nd and grade 3rd of education, whereas learning process does not motivate them to practice the oral health self-care that they have learned. Dental students learn about oral health in college either directly from lecturers or independently by using educational media [11, 12] . Providing intervention with web application media and additional dental caries risk material using power point slide to the intervention group, shows that the message conveyed will be more interesting to increase attention in the learning process, because with high attention it will increase the motivation of the intervention group students to learn better, however the additional dental caries risk material using power point slide will be more recorded that important in learning process so that students will remember it better, Diah [24, 25] . In addition, by getting messages through the web application and dental caries risk materials using power point slide once a week can communicate messages quickly to increase oral health knowledge which has an impact on students' understanding of dental caries risk faster which impact to oral health literacy, increase attitude and behaviour of dental student in intervention group compared to control group that only get web application, whereas control group only get the information from web applications that must be viewed at least once in 21 days of study. So the results of this study can be said that the use of web application media and power point slide media is more effective than only using web application media which is given to the control group. The results of this study are in line with McGrath's (2019) statement, namely the more often someone gets oral health promotion that supports behaviour change the tend to be more successful [26] .",

A statistically significant difference in caries risk knowledge was noted before and after using the web application in the intervention group, but not in the control group. This might be because, unlike the intervention group, the control group only used the web application and did not receive any educational materials through power point slide. According to Edgar Dale's theory in Ken Master (2020), the intervention group received information through what they saw or read and interpreted it as knowledge. The more the senses are involved in an educational process, the easier it will be for the educational target to accept and remember [27] . In addition, the use of educational media that are interesting and easy to understand can significantly boost the increase in knowledge [28] . The educational material that the respondents were given about dental caries risk through Power Point presentation could also be easily found through Google search. However, for students to implement the educational material regarding caries risk in their everyday lives, it is necessary to provide all the information at once in an easily accessible platform such as a web application (accessible from their smartphone, tablet, laptop, computer, etc.).",

The dental education system in Indonesia accepts candidates from various socioeconomic backgrounds who become eligible to study in faculty of dentistry based on their score in state entrance examinations. Lisa et al.

During a pandemic covid -19 from 2020 until now the faculty of dentistry in Indonesia using a blended learning, the blended learning provides better student's satisfaction, motivation, student engagement and performance. In line with the learning system implemented by dentistry students in Indonesia, it can support research results using web applications more effectively to increase knowledge and motivation of dental students in reducing the risk of dental caries [29] . Dena [30] elucidated that dental students acquire knowledge regarding oral healthcare maintenance and disease prevention within the various dental courses as they progress in their dental training. The findings of this study provides a synthesis of a web application media as a digital media which use at least once a week for 21 days in intervention group of dental student can give a benefit, including audience engagement and information retention to increasing their knowledge and motivating the attitude of dental student to improvement in their oral health behaviour as well as elucidating by Mc Grath [26] about the common behavioural models and theory of planned behaviour and the health believe model, that is, the more often the intervention group of dental student gets advocacy and health promotion from web-application media, their knowledge will increase and effect the attitude and oral health behaviour that support to decrease the dental caries risk score, compared to the control group who got knowledge about the risk of dental caries only from learning at the faculty.",

This finding was in accordance with the statement by Aljafari et al. [25] , who suggested that caries risk was decreased after a behavior change was made by implementing suggestions for the prevention or improvement of caries risk factors. In the present study, the web application was used not only as educational media but also as media/tool to examine the caries risk. This allowed students to be able to assess their caries risk independently, making them aware of the factors that were assessed, the caries risk factors present, and the caries risk category they belonged to. The perception of susceptibility to dental caries is developed when the Caries Risk Assessment is carried out and the results are shown. The health belief model theory suggests that a person will perceive those conditions as a vulnerability to risk factors, namely, the risk of dental caries [27, 28, 31] . This situation might have motivated the students to improve their oral health behavior based on their respective risk factors, and eventually, the outcome of a decreased caries risk score was achieved. This finding was in alignment with the study conducted by Schmidt et al. [32] , which stated that the application of the health belief model in oral health education can improve the behavior of maintaining oral health.",

However, the weak negative linear relationship between the frequency of accessing the web application and the caries risk score in this study might be because the decrease in caries risk was influenced not only by the individual's understanding about something but also by other factors such as their attitudes and behavioral practices [25, 32] .",
