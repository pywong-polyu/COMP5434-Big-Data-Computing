Here we address this question by characterizing the historical evolution of human coronavirus 229E. We identify human sera from the 1980s and 1990s that have neutralizing titers against contemporaneous 229E that are comparable to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We test these sera against 229E strains isolated after sera collection, and find that neutralizing titers are lower against these \"future\" viruses. In some cases, sera that neutralize contemporaneous 229E viral strains with titers >1:100 do not detectably neutralize strains isolated 8-17 years later. The decreased neutralization of \"future\" viruses is due to antigenic evolution of the viral spike, especially in the receptor-binding domain. If these results extrapolate to other coronaviruses, then it may be advisable to periodically update SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",

Here we investigate the second hypothesis in the context of the common-cold coronavirus 229E. We test how well antibodies in old human sera neutralize both contemporaneous old 229E viruses, and more recent viruses that evolved after the sera was collected. We find that as 229E evolves, its spike protein accumulates mutations that escape neutralization by older human sera.

In any case, the fact that common-cold coronavirus re-infections occur at some appreciable rate has led to concerns that coronavirus immunity is not \"durable.\" These concerns initially focused on the possibility that the immune response itself is not durable [12] .

For example, infection with influenza virus elicits antibodies that generally protect humans against that same viral strain for at least several decades [17, 18] . Unfortunately, influenza virus undergoes rapid antigenic evolution to escape these antibodies [19] , meaning that although immunity to the original viral strain lasts for decades, humans are susceptible to infection by its descendants within about 5 years [17, 20] . This continual antigenic evolution is the reason that the influenza vaccine is periodically updated.",

However, mutation rate is just one factor that shapes antigenic evolution; influenza and measles virus both have high mutation rates, but only the former undergoes rapid antigenic evolution. Furthermore, the assumption of minimal coronavirus antigenic evolution is not supported by the limited evidence to date. In the 1980s, human-challenge studies found that individuals infected with one strain of 229E were resistant to re-infection with that same strain, but partially susceptible to a different strain [23] . Additional experimental studies suggest that sera or antibodies can differentially recognize spike proteins from different 229E strains [24, 25] . From a computational perspective, several studies have reported that the spikes of 229E and OC43 evolve under positive selection [26] [27] [28] , which is often a signature of antigenic evolution.",

We show that historical sera that potently neutralize virions pseudotyped with contemporaneous 229E spikes often have little or no activity against spikes from 229E strains isolated 8-17 years later. Conversely, modern sera from adults generally neutralize spikes from a wide span of historical viruses, whereas modern sera from children best neutralize spikes from recent viruses that circulated during the children's lifetimes. These patterns are explained by antigenic evolution of the spike, especially within the receptor-binding domain. If SARS-CoV-2 undergoes similarly rapid antigenic evolution, then it may be advisable to periodically update vaccines to keep pace with viral evolution.",

Of the four human-endemic common-cold coronaviruses, the two alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL63 are similar to SARS-CoV-2 in binding a protein receptor via the spike's receptor-binding domain (RBD, also known as S1-B) [6,32,33]. In contrast, the two betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 bind glycan receptors via the spike's N-terminal domain (NTD, also known as S1-A) [34] . Antibodies that block receptor binding dominate the neutralizing activity of immunity elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection [35-37], so we reasoned that even though SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, its antigenic evolution is more likely to be foreshadowed by the two human alphacoronaviruses that also use their RBD to bind a protein receptor. Of these two viruses, we chose 229E since it was first identified in humans >50 years ago [38], whereas NL63 was only identified in 2003 [39] .",

There are several important features of the tree. First, it is clock-like, with sequence divergence proportional to virus isolation date (Figs 1A and S1). Second, the tree is \"ladder-like,\" with short branches off a single trunk (Fig 1A) . The ladder-like shape of the 229E phylogeny has been noted previously [26, 27, 40] , and is a signature of viruses such as influenza for which immune pressure drives population turnover by selecting for antigenic variants [41] [42] [43] . Third, sequences group by date rather than country of isolation (in Fig 1A, sequences from different countries but the same year are nearby). Phylogenies that organize by date rather than geography indicate fast global transmission, another signature of human influenza virus [44, 45] . Finally, although there is some intra-spike recombination, it is among closely related strains and does not affect the broader topology of the tree (S2 Fig) . For our study, the key implication of the above observations is that date of virus isolation is a good proxy for evolutionary position, since 229E evolves primarily along a single trajectory through time.",

Again, nearly all sera (18 of 19) detectably neutralized the 1992 spike, with about a quarter (5 of 19) having titers >1:90 (S4 and S5 Figs). These potent sera also neutralized the older 1984 spike with high titers, but again generally had lower activity against spikes from viruses isolated after the sera were collected ( Fig 2B) . Together, the results from the two sera collection timeframes indicate that the 229E spike is evolving antigenically, such that immunity elicited by infection with prior viruses is often ineffective at neutralizing future viruses.",

The adults were alive during circulation of all five 229E spikes in our panel (i.e., they were born before 1984), but the children could only have been exposed to the more recent spikes. We screened 31 modern sera against the 2016 spike, and found that 25 of 31 detectably neutralized at a threshold of 1:10 (S4 and S5 Figs). We again focused further analysis on the more potent sera with titers >1:90 (7 of 31 sera, S5 Fig) . The neutralizing activity of human sera is lower against \"future\" viruses than those that elicited the immunity. (A) Sera collected between 1985 and 1990 was tested in neutralization assays against spikes from viruses isolated between 1984 and 2016. Each plot facet is a different serum, and black points show its neutralizing titer against viruses from the indicated year. Blue shading indicates the portion of plotted timeframe during which the individual could have been infected prior to serum collection. The dotted gray horizontal line indicates the limit of detection (titer of 1:10). Plot titles give the year of serum collection, the individual's age when the serum was collected, and the serum ID. (B) Plots like those in (A) but for sera collected between 1993 and 1995. (C) The fold change in neutralization titer against viruses isolated 8-9 or 16-17 years in the \"future\" relative to the virus isolated just before the serum was collected. Box plots show the median and interquartile range, and each point is the fold change for a single serum. For a few sera (triangles), the fold change is censored (as an upper bound) because the titer against the future virus was below the limit of detection.",

However, neutralization by children's sera generally extends further \"back in time\" to viruses that preceded birth than neutralization by adult sera in Fig 2A and 2B extends \"forward in time\" to viruses that circulated after the sera was collected. Similar time asymmetry in antigenic evolution has been described for influenza virus [50, 51] . Overall, the results in Fig 3 show that neutralizing immunity can encompass the entire spectrum of spikes an individual has been exposed to, consistent with the notion that reduced neutralization of future viruses is due to antigenic evolution rather than a lack of durability in immunity itself.",

However, this trend did not hold for some sera that were more resistant to antigenic evolution: for instance, serum from the 29-year old did not neutralize the 2016 spike, but neutralized the chimera with the 2016 RBD ( Fig 4C) . Overall, these results suggest that when the neutralizing activity of potent human sera is rapidly eroded by viral evolution this is often due to mutations within the RBD, but that antigenic evolution also occurs elsewhere in the spike. In this respect, it is worth noting that while the neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-2 immunity elicited by infection primarily targets the RBD [36,54], mutations to the NTD also reduce neutralization by some antibodies and sera [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] -and some regions of the NTD undergo significant sequence evolution in 229E (Fig 4A) .",

Remarkably, we could find no studies that measured how quickly influenza evolution erodes neutralization by human sera. However, numerous studies examine influenza antigenic evolution using hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assays with sera from ferrets infected with single viral strains [63] . The rate at which 229E escapes neutralization by human sera is several fold slower than the rate at which influenza A/H3N2 escapes HAI by ferret sera, but comparable to the rate of such escape by influenza B [19, 64] . However, the sera of ferrets infected by a single influenza virus strain tend to recognize fewer viral strains than sera from humans who have been repeatedly infected with many strains [65] [66] [67] . Therefore, ferret sera HAI may overestimate how quickly influenza evolution erodes neutralization by actual human sera. For this reason, further work is needed to enable head-to-head comparisons of antigenic evolution across these viruses.",

But the rate of phenotypic evolution is not equal to mutation rate; evolution also depends on the effects of mutations and how selection acts on them. These other factors explain why influenza undergoes rapid antigenic evolution while measles does not, despite having a similar mutation rate. Specifically, mutations to influenza hemagglutinin are often well tolerated [68] , and single hemagglutinin mutations can have huge effects on escaping polyclonal sera [69] . In contrast, measles surface proteins are less tolerant of mutations [70] , and the single mutations that are tolerated never more than modestly affect measles neutralization by polyclonal sera [71] . In these respects, coronaviruses unfortunately seem more similar to influenza than measles. The neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is often focused on just a small portion of spike [36, 61, 72, 73] , and key receptor-binding loops are mutationally tolerant in the spikes of both 229E [25, 53] and SARS-CoV-2 [74] . Therefore, even though mutations to coronaviruses occur at a lower rate, they are acted on by selection in a fashion more similar to influenza than measles [27] .",

Some sera that potently neutralize contemporaneous virus have no detectable activity against viral strains isolated 8 + years later. But other sera maintain neutralizing activity against strains isolated over two decades later. This finding is reminiscent of how mutations to influenza virus can have vastly different effects on neutralization by sera from different individuals [69] . Identifying what factors determine how rapidly an individual's coronavirus immunity is eroded by viral mutations is an important area for future work, as it would be desirable for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to elicit immunity that is relatively robust to viral evolution.",

While it is impossible to know if SARS-CoV-2 will evolve similarly to 229E, it is ominous that mutations affecting neutralization by polyclonal human sera are already present among SARS-CoV-2 lineages [54, 59, 61, 73, [75] [76] [77] even though a large fraction of the human population is still naive and so presumably exerting little immune pressure on the virus. But two facts provide hope even in light of our observation that human coronaviruses evolve to escape neutralizing immunity. First, the level of immunity required to prevent severe COVID-19 may be low [3] , perhaps because the slower course of disease provides more time for a recall immune response than for \"quicker\" viruses such as influenza. An optimistic interpretation is that disease might often be mild even if viral antigenic evolution allows re-infections. Second, many leading SARS-CoV-2 vaccines use new technologies such as mRNA-based delivery [78] that should make it easy to update the vaccine if there is antigenic evolution in spike. For this reason, we suggest that SARS-CoV-2 evolution should be monitored for antigenic mutations that might make it advisable to periodically update vaccines.",

To mitigate any possible well-to-well differences in transfection efficiency in a 96-well plate format, we first bulk transfected a dish of 293T cells, followed by seeding the 96-well plates routinely used in neutralization assays and viral titering. Specifically, an approximately 90% confluent 10 cm dish of 293T cells was transfected with 8.5 \u03bcg APN-expressing plasmid, 1 \u03bcg of TMPRSS2-expressing plasmid, and 0.5 \u03bcg of carrier DNA (Promega, E4881) to achieve an 8.5:1 ratio of APN:TMPRSS2. We found that this ratio gave sufficient TMPRSS2 expression, while maintaining low levels of cell toxicity. Cells were transfected using the Bioland Scientific BioT transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol but incubating transfection complexes for 15 minutes at room temperature instead of the recommended 5 minutes as we have anecdotally observed that this extended incubation increases transfection efficiency. After 5-6 hours, transfection supernatant was removed and the APN and TMPRSS2-transfected 293T cells were trypsinized (Fisher, MT25053CI). Cells were then seeded in clear bottom, black-walled, poly-L-lysine coated 96-well plates that were either professionally precoated (Greiner, 655936) or hand-coated (Greiner, 655090) with poly-L-lysine solution (Millipore Sigma, P4704) at 1.75x10e4 cells per well in 50 \u03bcL D10 growth media (DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin). Plates were incubated at 37\u02daC with 5% CO 2 for 20-24 hours, and cells were infected with serial 2-fold serial dilutions of the pseudotyped lentiviral particles. These viral dilutions were made in TC-treated \"set-up\" 96-well plates and then transferred to the pre-seeded 293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells from the previous day.",

Specifically, 100 \u03bcL of media in each well was removed-while being sure to leave the cells undisturbed-leaving approximately 30 \u03bcL of media left over. Then an equal volume of Bright-Glo reagent (Promega, E2610) was added to the remaining 30 uL of media in each well and the solution was mixed up and down to ensure complete cell lysis. In order to minimize the potential for premature luciferase excitation, special care was taken to protect the assay plates from light. Mainly, assay plate preparation was performed in a biosafety hood with the lights off and plates were covered in tin foil after the addition of the luciferase reagent. The luminescence was then measured on a TECAN Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader with no attenuation and a luminescence integration time of 1 second. S3 Fig shows the titers achieved for each 229E spike variant, and also demonstrates the importance of the spike cytoplasmic tail deletion and the expression of APN and TMPRSS2 for efficient viral infection.

First, the heat-inactivated serum samples were diluted 1:10 in D10 growth media followed by 3-fold serial dilutions in TC-coated 96-well \"set-up\" plates, ultimately giving seven total dilutions per sample. These dilutions were done in duplicate for each serum sample. Each 229E spike-pseudotyped lentivirus was then diluted to achieve luciferase readings of approximately 200,000 RLUs per well (the exact dilution factor varied among viruses due to differences in titers; see S3 Fig ). An equal volume of virus was then added to each well of the virus plus sera \"set-up\" plates, and these plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u02daC with 5% CO 2 , after which 100 uL of each virus plus sera mixture were transferred to the 293T-APN-TMPRSS2 cell plate that had been seeded the day prior.

The fraction infectivity was computed at each serum dilution as the fraction of the signal for the positive control (averaged across the two positive control wells for each row) after subtracting the background reading for the negative control. We then fit 2-parameter Hill curves with baselines fixed to 1 and 0 using neutcurve (https://jbloomlab.github.io/neutcurve/). Note that the serum concentration reported in these curves is the concentration at which the virus was pre-incubated with the sera for 1 hour. All of the neutralization curves are plotted in S4 Fig. All of the IC50s are tabulated in S3 Data. See https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_229E_ antigenic_drift/tree/master/exptl_data for raw and processed plate reader data and all of the computer code used for the fitting. Note that all assays were done in duplicate, but some seravirus pairs have additional readings as we re-ran selected sera-virus pairs to confirm that results remained consistent across different assay days. In all cases the day-to-day consistency was good, and the reported values are the mean IC50s across all assays. The best-fitting model had a single recombination breakpoint at nucleotide 1089 that improved the AIC by 60 units. The trees for each partition were then rooted and branch-re-scaled using TreeTime, and the resulting tanglegram was rendered using dendextend.

The dotted gray line is the limit of detection, and the titers in the absence of spike were below this line (undetectable). (B) Efficient entry by the pseudotyped virions depends on expression of APN and to a lesser extent TMPRSS2. Virions pseudotyped with the 2016 spike with the C-terminal deletion were infected into 293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing one or both of APN and TMPRSS2, and titers were determined by luciferase luminescence. Titers are normalized to one. (C) All of the 229E spikes and chimeras used in this study mediated efficient viral entry.

Each sera was tested against the most-recent virus isolated prior to the serum collection date: in other words, sera collected between 1985-1990 was tested against the 1984 spike, sera collected between 1992-1995 was tested against the 1992 spike, and sera collected in 2020 was tested against the 2016 spike. Each point shows the neutralizing titer for a different serum (see S4 Fig for full neutralization curves). Sera above the cutoff of 1:90 (blue dashed line) was then used for further studies against the full panel of viruses (e.g., Figs 2, 3, and 4). The numbers at the top of the plot indicate the number of sera above the cutoff out of the total sera tested in each timeframe.
