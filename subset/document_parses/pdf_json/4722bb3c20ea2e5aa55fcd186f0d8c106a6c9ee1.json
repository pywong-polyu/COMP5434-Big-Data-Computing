The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made on the basis of a positive SARS-CoV-2 result in respiratory material. 7 Data analysis was done with regard to the Declaration of Helsinki. According to the local Institutional Review Board for Human Studies, a formal approval was not required for this analysis due to the retrospective nature of the study and notification to the Institutional Review Board for Human Studies was considered adequate (EK 080/20). BAL was performed using flexible bronchoscopes (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The bronchoscope was wedged into a segment where lung infiltration was present or was most severe. A total of 160 mL sterile saline solution was instilled into aliquots of 20 mL and the fluid was recovered by aspiration. Samples were sent for microbiological and virological testing, as well as for cytological analysis. Standard personal protection equipment including FFP-2 masks was worn by the performing physicians. Original data were retrieved from electronic patient record systems (Medico, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany and ICCA, Philips Health Systems, Hamburg, Germany) and collected in a database. Demographic data (age and sex), data about treatment in the intensive care unit (days on ventilator) and findings from BAL (culture results and cytology) were recorded. Antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on all physicians (n = 5) who had done the bronchoscopies using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Unless otherwise stated, all data are presented as mean AE standard deviation (normally distributed data) or median (interquartile range (IQR)) (non-normally distributed data). Two-group comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Statistical significance was defined as a P-value of <0.05. BAL was performed for 58 patients treated at our institution for COVID-19-associated ARDS. Patient characteristics and details concerning microbiological yield of the BAL fluid are summarised in Table 1 . The overall microbiological yield (any bacteria, fungi or viruses apart from SARS-CoV-2) was 53.4%. Bacteria were detected most frequently (diagnostic yield: 37.9%), whereas the detection rate of fungi (13.8%) and viruses (10.3%) apart from SARS-CoV-2 was low. Testing of the BAL fluid for SARS-CoV-2 was done in 56 out of 58 patients of whom 42 (75%) were tested positive. Univariate analysis revealed an association between the probability of a negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and the duration from the onset of symptoms until BAL was done (P = 0.0115). Among the different cell types, monocytes/macrophages were most abundant in BAL fluid followed by neutrophils and lymphocytes (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). Total cell count (36.2 \u00c2 10 6 (IQR 16.6-53.4) vs 15.8 \u00c2 10 6 (IQR 10.1-37.5); P = 0.0232) and the number of neutrophils (14.3 \u00c2 10 6 (IQR 4.3-25.5) vs 5.2 \u00c2 10 6 (IQR 1.9-11.9); P = 0.0376) were significantly increased in BAL samples positive for bacteria. We did not find an association of BAL cellularity with clinical parameters, for example, survival, ventilator days, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or time span from the onset of symptoms/initiation of invasive ",

A considerable proportion of patients (53.4%) was tested positive for other microbiological agents, mainly bacteria, apart from SARS-CoV-2. Recently, a study demonstrated that the prevalence of co-infection with additional pathogens was even higher (more than 90%) among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and was highest among patients with severe COVID-19. However, as this study used a PCR-based technique for the detection of pathogens in throat swabs, it is difficult to determine whether this reflects clinically relevant pulmonary infection rather than infection of the upper respiratory tract or colonisation. 8 In addition, a considerable proportion of patients was tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the BAL fluid, likely due to the variability in the time span from the onset of symptoms until BAL was performed. So far, no study has investigated the cellular composition of BAL in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. According to other forms of ARDS, we found an increased total cell count and an increased number of neutrophils. As expected, the number of cells was higher in patients suffering from bacterial co-infection. Nevertheless, total cell count or cellular composition was not associated with any clinical end points possibly due to the small sample size and the variability of the time points until BAL was performed. 5, 6 In conclusion, in patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, bronchoscopy with BAL seems to be safe for the endoscopist and can reveal co-infection with other pathogens thus providing important information for the guidance of antimicrobial therapy.",
