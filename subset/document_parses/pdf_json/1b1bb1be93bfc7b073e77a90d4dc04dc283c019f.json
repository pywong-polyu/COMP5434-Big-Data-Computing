            "text": "After the occurrence of a public emergency, it is often easy to cause a heated public discussion on network platforms and form online public opinion about the emergency. Research on the evolution life cycle of online public opinion shows that the evolution of online public opinion in emergencies goes through the three periods of formation, climax, and dissipation, or the four periods of gestation, transmission, upsurge, and decline [1, 2] . After the outbreak of an event triggers a high level of public opinion, with the disposal of the event and the shift of people's attention, discussion or the event on a network gradually fades. For example, Ma et al. summarized online public opinion of two fire accidents, and found that the attention of netizens would rapidly decline after exponential growth, with a peak value [3] . Through the analysis of a typhoon event in the Philippines, Ma et al. found that heated online public opinion gradually fades away within 24-48 h after the event [4] . However, with the spread of the hazard, information is released in an untimely manner, and other reasons may make online public opinion regarding emergencies rebound in a certain period of time after a complete public-opinion cycle, and become the catalyst for derivative online public opinion [5, 6] . The rebound of online public opinion refers to the situation of it appearing a second or multiple times, with high popularity, after already experiencing a high level of public opinion and decline. As shown in Figure 1 below, the \"fake milk powder leads to the emergence of big head babies\" incident triggered heated Figure 1 .

This may be related to the continuous spread of risks. With the expansion of the scope of hazards during an event, people's risk perception continuously increases, which has aroused widespread attention [13] . After the event, low-efficiency risk-information communication factors, such as the release of false news, failure to promptly meet the public's information demands and distrust of messengers, may also lead to continuous panic and worry among the public [14] [15] [16] , and induce repeated high public opinion, generating the rebound of network public opinion. Some studies have also confirmed the relationship between the type of emergency and online public opinion.

            "text": "Communication refers to a social relationship between individuals in which messages emanating from one member of the relationship may enable another member to reduce their \"uncertainty\" [18] . The message must be based on language that refers to various possible discriminations that an individual can make among features of their environment. Schramm pointed out that risk communication is the process of information sharing with others with three basic elements: messengers, message attributes, and audiences [19] . Lasswell summarized the process of information transmission from transmitter to receiver through the media into five elements, namely, communicator, information, media, audience, and feedback [20] . With the development of risk-communication research, attention has been paid to the interaction between information transmitter and information receiver in risk communication. The American Committee on Risk Cognition and Risk Communication proposed that risk communication is a process of interactive debate on risk information among multiple subjects [21] . Risk-information communication on the network is a process in which multiple subjects, such as the government, experts, opinion leaders, and the general public, discuss and exchange views on events in cyberspace [22] . In risk-information communication after the occurrence of a public emergency, a public-emergency meta-event is the starting point of online public opinion and the initial carrier of online public-opinion topics. The meta-event causes different degrees of online discussion and public attention due to different impact scale and damage scope [9] . On this basis, this paper divides the factors that affect the rebound of online public opinion on emergencies into five categories: the type of emergency, messengers, message attributes, audience and information feedback. Figure 2 is the theoretical framework of this paper.",

The impact, scope and scale of emergencies affect the public's risk perception [23] , thus affecting the public's attention to risk [24] . Saleem believes that the duration and severity of disasters affect people's participation in discussion on Twitter [25] . According to analysis of the Three Gorges Project fire accident by Jiang et al., meta-event information impacts online public opinion [26] . Dong et al., through their study of online public opinion of natural disasters found that the evolution trend of online public opinion was different even for similar natural disasters due to different properties such as duration and damage degree [27] . Han indicated that the change in online public opinion during COVID-19 was synchronized with the development trend of the pandemic [28] . The development characteristics of online public opinion of emergencies are closely related to the change characteristics of the emergencies themselves. Generally, public health emergencies may affect the living environment, and threaten people's lives and health, having lasting negative effects. Therefore, compared with other types of event, public health emergencies are more likely to cause a rebound of online public opinion. On this basis, the first proposition is set: the type of emergency influences the rebound of online public opinion of public emergencies.",

With the development of social media, trust plays an important role in almost all risk fields, such as nuclear power and climate change [30] [31] [32] , and trust in information sources affect people's choice of risk information and the interpretation of information released by these information sources [33, 34] .

Due to the timely handling of these emergencies, and the government formulating effective policies for post-disposal, there was often no rebound of public opinion in earthquake and fire emergencies, although they were very harmful. However, almost each individual involved in the public health emergency focused on it for a long time, making it easy to cause repeated high-heat public opinion, such as with biological vaccines and fake milk-powder events, when people were very concerned about whether they had been harmed and expressed anger over the government's lack of timely supervision, inducing the rebound of online public opinion.",

The above results partly prove the applicability of Propositions 2 and 3. For example, during COVID-19, rumors constantly occupied the page of hot search on Weibo, making the amount of online public opinion on the epidemic situation continue to rise. The reason for the online public opinion rebound of other public emergencies, such as the bus incident in Anshun, Guizhou Province, is that official media such as people.com.cn reported the cause of the incident, which attracted extensive social attention. Due to the longer duration of public health emergencies, the degree of harm is larger, and development trends and disposal information receive more attention. During public health emergencies, people pay more attention to information related to the identification, transmission and prevention of diseases [61] . Furthermore, in order to draw more attention, some network users often post false information, and widely spreading false information is easy to arouse people's negative emotions, then inducing the rebound of online public opinion.",

Five to seven days later, the cause of the accident was released, which triggered condemnation and anger on the Internet and led to the fermentation of public opinion once again.",

The main reason for the lack of risk communication is that the local government is slow to leak information [63] . For a public health emergency with widely spreading hazards, people pay more attention to the situation and the government's handling. Therefore, the scope and extent of the harm of the emergency should be tracked and relevant interest groups should be informed in a timely manner. For public emergencies with non-spreading hazards, people are more concerned about the cause. Therefore, a timely investigation of the cause of an accident and its timely disclosure are very important to prevent the occurrence of repeated high-popularity public discussions.",

Lastly, the rebound of online public opinion may also be related to such factors as the information environment, the government's disposal, from the perspective of risk information communication, and failing to take into account other factors influencing the rebound of online public opinion. Future studies could discuss the generating mechanism of online public opinion regarding public emergencies from the perspective of government intervention. ",
