In this vein, we propose the idea of sentinel cells, cellular biosensors capable of detecting viral antigens and responding to them with customizable responses. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a test case, we developed a live cell sensor (SARSNotch) using a de novo-designed protein binder against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. SARSNotch is capable of driving custom genetically-encoded payloads in immortalized cell lines or in primary T lymphocytes in response to purified SARS-CoV-2 Spike or in the presence of Spike-expressing cells. Furthermore, SARSNotch is functional in a cellular system used in directed evolution platforms for development of better binders or therapeutics. In keeping with the rapid dissemination of scientific knowledge that has characterized the incredible scientific response to the ongoing pandemic, we extend an open invitation for others to make use of and improve SARSNotch sentinel cells in the hopes of unlocking the potential of the next generation of smart antiviral therapeutics.",

Progress has been fueled by investments in synthetic biology tools that are capable of functioning orthogonally or in parallel with natural cellular systems [8] [9] [10] . A particularly exciting opportunity resides in the rise of de novo-designed proteins as in silico and on demand building blocks for cellular engineering [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .

We demonstrate that these sentinel cells can detect purified Spike protein and a model of infected cells that are expressing Spike, and we show that this sensing approach is portable between different cell types, including primary human T lymphocytes and adherent cells. We suggest that this system, when coupled with appropriate therapeutic payloads, represents a potential next-generation targeted therapeutic against future pathogenic threats.",

Our ideal system would feature a swappable antigen-sensing domain, for use against a potentially rapidly evolving target, and a customizable genetic response. The modular SynNotch receptor 10,28 provided a suitable platform for these requirements. A SynNotch receptor comprises an extracellular sensor domain that recognizes a desired epitope, fused to a user-defined cleavable intracellular domain that retains a transcription factor (TF) at the membrane. Antigen recognition induces the cleavage of a TF, which translocates into the nucleus to activate output expression ( Figure 1A) . Notably, Syn-Notch has previously been used to successfully detect the hepatitis B virus (HBV) 29 , thus we were optimistic that it could be adapted for use as an extracellular sensor to detect the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and generate a customizable transcriptional output upon this detection.",

Cells expressing only the output transcriptional circuit but not SynNotch (No Notch) showed no change in expression in response to increasing Spike concentrations. To our surprise, ACE2-Notch was not appreciably activated even at large Spike concentrations, despite showing higher basal activation than the No Notch background. Remarkably however, LCB1-Notch showed robust activation, with 5-fold increase in mean TagBFP expression with as little as 0.3\u00b5g/ml Spike, a 20-50-fold increase for 1 and 3.16\u00b5g/ml Spike, and a slight decay in activation with a 20-fold increase in expression at 10\u00b5g/ml Spike.

However, none of these previous SynNotch variants have included a de novo-designed antigen sensor. To ensure SARSNotch functions in therapeutically relevant cells, we transduced primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes (T Cells) with the output circuit and SARSNotch and assessed SARSNotch function in the purified spike assay. T Cells expressing SARSNotch showed a similar dose range of activation, albeit with higher basal activation in comparison to Jurkats ( Figure 1E and 1F, Supplementary Figure  1E ). These data establish SARSNotch's potential utility in cell-based therapeutics. Further, it confirms that de novo designed protein binders may be a promising modular class of antigen sensors for SynNotch.",

Unlike in Jurkat sentinels but similar to T Cells, we saw leakiness in SARSNotch activation in the absence of stimulus ( Figure 4A ). However, despite this increased basal leakiness, SARSNotch BHK-21 sentinels showed dramatic activation in the presence of Spike, without the slight decrease in activation seen at high doses in the SARSNotch Jurkat sentinel cells (Figure 4B) . A similar pattern was observed in the cell-cell assay, with almost 100% activation seen when SARSNotch BHK-21 sentinels were co-cultured with Spike-K562s at equal density for 72 hours (Figure 4C, 4D) .

Activation of SARSNotch also robustly occurs when Spike-expressing cells are present at as little as 1/10th the density of sentinel cells. Crucially, SARSNotch expression is not sufficient to increase the susceptibility of sen-tinel cells to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.

All the SynNotch receptors described so far in the literature rely on either single chain variable fragment antibodies (scFvs) or nanobodies to recognize their antigen. Although both now exist against SARS-CoV-2 Spike 22,39 , no such reagents were available when we embarked on this project. We first speculated that the endogenous binder of Spike, ACE2, might be usable as an antigen sensor. The ACE2-Spike interaction is estimated to have a K D ranging between 1.2 and 22nM 24, 26, 40, 41 , whereas the scFv used to target the original SynNotch to CD19 has a K D of 0.3nM 42 and the scFv successfully used to adapt Syn-Notch to target HBV has a K D of~0.35nM 29 . However, we suspect this affinity difference is not the main reason ACE2-Notch didn't yield a detectable signal output in the presence of Spike, given that an scFv against the human protein Her2 with K D of 210nM has been recently described to enable Syn-Notch activation 43 . Perhaps more likely, the 600 amino acid-long ACE2 extracellular domain is between 2 and 3 times the size of the scFvs and nanobodies that have been used as antigen sensors previously, sug- .

However, neither of these explanations are sufficient to explain ACE2-Notch's deficit given the properties of LCB1, the de novodesigned binder that was successfully incorporated into SARSNotch. LCB1, and its partner lead candidate LCB3, are both 55 amino acids long with binding affinities below 1nM, yet only LCB1 lead to strong Syn-Notch activation downstream of Spike binding, whereas LCB3 produced only modest activation even at high doses (Supplementary Figure 6 ). This suggests that in addition to size, specific binding geometry may be required for SynNotch activation. Given these findings, we would still recommend a varied approach in developing future Syn-Notches with novel binders, exploring a wide range of proteins as antigen sensors. We also envision studies that use libraries of nanobodies, different proteins truncations, and synthetic antigen binders with different sizes, structures, and affinities to dissect the bio-mechanical properties of SynNotch.",

SARSNotch meets both of the first two requirements, but falls short in the third. We suspect that sentinel cells expressing SARSNotch are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 because expression of both a viral receptor and a specific cell surface protease are important for SARS-CoV-2 infection 44 . It is also possible that LCB1 binds Spike in an orientation that does not enable cell entry, although ACE2-Notch also does not confer infection susceptibility to otherwise unsusceptible cells (Supplementary Figure 3D) . The inability of SARSNotch to detect virions is puzzling, especially given the previous adaptation of SynNotch to sensing HBV 29 . SynNotch, like Notch itself, is suspected to require force applied to the extracellular domain in order to activate, but insufficient force generated by the virions themselves seems unlikely given that both SARS-CoV-2 and the lentiviral pseudotyped virus used in this study produce virions 100nm in diameter, twice the size of HBV particles [45] [46] [47] [48] . We suspect that in the case of the anti-HBV SynNotch, activation was due to presentation of virions in trans, either as they were bound to a hydrophobic tissue culture plate or by cells in the process of getting infected. If this is true, our SARSNotch sentinel cells may be more effective in vivo than our current data might suggest.",

Upon detection of infected cells, sentinel cells could produce and release virus-neutralizing proteins such as monoclonal antibodies 49 , multivalent nanobodies 22 , or even soluble versions of the de novo-designed binders used by the cells to detect the threat in the first place 23 . Such programs enable local delivery of otherwise systemically applied therapies. However, the power of sentinels lies in their ability to detect multiple signals and integrate them to produce even more specific responses than can be achieved through standard therapies. For example, longitudinal studies of COVID-19 patients have demonstrated immune misfiring present in severe cases that is absent in moderate cases 50 . Advanced sentinel cells could combine sensors like SARSNotch with synthetic sensors of endogenous immune signals 51-53 , using cellularly-implemented boolean logic 33 to modulate immune function in an effort to mitigate disease severity.",

Even if successful, cellbased therapies are presently costly and slow to generate. However, this may change in the future, as ongoing work generating allogeneic cell therapies shows significant promise 54 . We hope that this work, along with the prior art with HBV 29 and HIV 55 , may lead to successful antiviral cell-based therapies in order to combat future threats, much as work on mRNA vaccines starting in the 1990s is proving useful to us today. In the meantime, these systems could be adapted for other use cases. Our specific interest is positioning SARSNotch, with its genetic gate, upstream of directed evolution systems. SARSNotch could be adapted to a system like VEGAS 38 , where a highly mutagenic virus could produce SARSNotch mutants that could be selected for higher binding affinity to Spike or pseudotyped virions. Alternatively, novel therapeutic compounds could be screened in SARSNotch cell-cell assays, where loss of fluorescent output from sentinel cells could identify compounds blocking SARSNotch and Spike interactions. Beyond these ideas, we suggest that there might be other uses of this anti-SARS-CoV-2 system that we have not yet envisioned.",

On the day of infection, a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus was added to the plated cells. Virus with equal titer to the highest dose used of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, as determined by p24 assay above, from the VSVG and vector pseudotyped controls was added to control wells. After incubation for 24 or 72 hours, cells were split in half for use in activation assay as described above, or for luminescence assay as described below.",

All data points are the mean of 3 replicates, with error presented as either standard deviation or \u00b195% confidence intervals where indicated. For flow cytometry experiments, means were calculated for all cells within a single replicate, and the presented means and error are calculated between replicates. Events collected from flow cytometry were filtered to remove small events and then density gated on FSC and SSC to capture singlet populations. Where presented, density estimates represent all events for all 3 replicates in a flow cytometry experiment, and are calculated via seaborn's kdeplot function with bandwidth adjustment of 0.2. To calculate activation, conditions were first assessed for bimodality via exploratory data analysis. For experiments where no bimodality was observed, activation is expressed as mean fluorescence intensity of BFP. For experiments where bimodality was apparent, a 2 component Gaussian mixture model was fit to data pooled from all conditions to identify the means of the on and off components. Then percent activation was calculated by scoring the component memberships of all cells in a given condition. A similar process was used to calculate cell densities, using mCitrine fluorescence. All data analysis was conducted using custom Python scripts, available on github (https://github.com/weinberz/ .
