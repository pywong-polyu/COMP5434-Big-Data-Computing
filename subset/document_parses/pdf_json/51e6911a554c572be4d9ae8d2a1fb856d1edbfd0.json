As in Parts II and III, we assume that after lifting the lock-down, the group of vulnerable people and people of 70+ is going to be rather well isolated with c = 0.25. For the value of R 1 , we assume the following model. Initially, we suppose that every infected person will still infect all others in the same household, so that R 1 could be larger than 1 for t close to March 23 and we assumed R 1 = 1.25 during the week March 23 -March 29. Once the household has been infected, R 1 drops to 0.95, a value slightly lower than 1 and what is recommended by a study [3] made for Germany (that is, we set R 1 = 0.95 for t \u2265 March 30) as there will be fewer new infections during the lock-down period.",

There is no true value for R 0 as it varies in different parts of the UK (and the world). In particular, in rural areas one would expect a considerably lower value of R 0 than in London. Authors of [6] suggest R 0 = 2.2 and R 0 = 2.4 as typical; the authors of [8] use values for R 0 in the range [2.25, 2.75]. We shall use the value R 0 = 2.5 as typical, which, in view of the recent data, looks to be a rather high (pessimistic) choice overall. However, R 0 = 2.5 seems to be an adequate choice for the mega-cities where the epidemics develop faster and may lead to more causalities. In rural areas, in small towns, and everywhere else where social contacts are less intense, the epidemic is milder. The flow-chart in Figure 41 describes the process of illness. We assume that the person becomes infected \u03c4 I days after catching the virus, where \u03c4 I has Poisson distribution with mean of \u03bb I days. Parameter \u03bb I defines the mean of the incubation period during which the person cannot spread the virus. Recommended value for \u03bb I is \u03bb I = 5. We then assign probabilities q and 1 \u2212 q for a person to get a severe or mild case correspondingly. The value of q depends on whether the person belongs to the group G (then q = q G ) or the rest of population (in this case, q = q other ). In Section 5.3 below we will relate the probabilities q G and q other to the mortality rates in the two groups.",

It may be tempting to multiply our expected death tolls by 22=66/3 but this would give very elevated forecasts.

However, SIR modelling using numerous age-classes and many equations for each age-class different across different parts of the country resulting in an astronomical number of parameters; this makes any sensitivity analysis to various parameters uncheckable.

Consider first Figure 53 showing proportions of infected people and reflecting the demand for hospital beds. Since in the scenario t 2 = April 13 we start isolating people from G earlier than for t 2 = April 22, the number of infected from group G (red solid line) is slightly lower during the end of April -beginning of May for t 2 = April 13 (purple solid line). The total number of infections from the rest of population is clearly slightly higher for t 2 = April 13 (blue line) than for t 2 = April 22. Taking into account the fact that infected people from G would on average require more hospital beds than the rest of population, the expected number of hospital beds required for the whole population stays approximately the same during the whole epidemic which has to be almost over in July. Figure 54 , showing expected deaths numbers for both scenarios with t 2 = April 13 and t 2 = April 22, show similar patterns concluding that there is very little gain in keeping the lock-down, especially taking into account huge economic loss caused by every extra day of the lock-down [18] . Overall, the total expected death is higher but the difference can be considered as very small. Expected deaths tolls for t 2 = April 22 and t 2 = April 13 are 15(5.2+9.8)K and 15.3(5.6+9.7)K, respectively.",

Late call for a lock-down (when x = 0.8) helps to slow down the epidemic and guarantees its fast smooth decrease but does not save as many people as, for example, the call with x = 0.9. Note that in both cases, when x = 0.8 and x = 0.9, the second wave of the epidemic is not expected as by the time of lifting the lock-down, a large percentage of the population (about 25% in case x = 0.9 and almost 40% in case x = 0.8) is either infected or immune and the 'herd immunity' would follow shortly. In a certain sense, the decision of making a lock-down at around x = 0.9 seem to be a very sensible decision to make as this saves many lives and guarantees smooth dynamics of the epidemic with no second wave.",

With an early lock-down, there is a clear gain in hospital bed occupancy and expected number of death at the first stage of the epidemic. However, the second wave of the epidemic should be expected in both cases x = 0.95 and x = 0.97 with a peak at around 2 months after the first one, and the second peak could be higher than the first one. This can be explained by observing that, even after 2 months of an epidemic with large x, even with lock-down and strong isolation of the group G and relatively small reproductive number (recall R 2 = 2), there is still a very large proportion of non-immune people available for the virus; a large part of these people is going to be infected even with smaller reproductive number. This prolongs the epidemics. Expected deaths toll for x = 0.95 is 13.8(5.5+8.3)K and for x = 0.97 it is 13.4(5.7+7.7)K. These numbers are naturally lower than 15(5.2+9.8)K for x = 0.9 but not by much. Figures 61-64 and the discussion above imply the following conclusion. Conclusion. A lock-down at an early stage of an epidemic is not a sensible decision in view of the economic consequences of the lock-down and the measures required for all the remaining (much longer) period of the epidemic. Moreover, in the case of an early lock-down, the second wave of the epidemic should be expected with a peak at around 2 months after the first one.",
