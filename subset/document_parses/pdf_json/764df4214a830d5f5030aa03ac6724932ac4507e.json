            "text": "Machine Learning (ML) has been categorized as a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) under the Computer Science domain wherein programmable machines imitate human learning behavior with the help of statistical methods and data. The Healthcare industry is one of the largest and busiest sectors in the world, functioning with an extensive amount of manual moderation at every stage. Most of the clinical documents concerning patient care are hand-written by experts, selective reports are machine-generated. This process elevates the chances of misdiagnosis thereby, imposing a risk to a patient's life. Recent technological adoptions for automating manual operations have witnessed extensive use of ML in its applications. The paper surveys the applicability of ML approaches in automating medical systems. The paper discusses most of the optimized statistical ML frameworks that encourage better service delivery in clinical aspects. The universal adoption of various Deep Learning (DL) and ML techniques as the underlying systems for a variety of wellness applications, is delineated by challenges and elevated by myriads of security. This work tries to recognize a variety of vulnerabilities occurring in medical procurement, admitting the concerns over its predictive performance from a privacy point of view. Finally providing possible risk delimiting facts and directions for active challenges in the future.",

            "text": "In this era of technology and advancements, we have come across multiple transformations made by ML/DL systems in industries such as governance, manufacturing, and transportation. Over the past couple of years, the utilization of intelligent systems has increased manifold in various domains, including our routine life. One such realm is healthcare [1, 2] , which earlier had been impervious to large-scale technological disruptions. The Healthcare industry across the globe has evolved extensively with the advent of machine intelligence. Nasr et al. [3] explore current state-of-the-art smart healthcare systems, highlighting significant topics such as wearable and smartphone devices for fitness monitoring, ML for illness prediction, and assistive frameworks, including social robots designed for assisted living environments. Bharadwaj et al. [4] confer applications of ML algorithms integrated with the Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT) in terms of their compensations, choice, and potential future aspects. The acceptance of ML/DL techniques has sustained exceptional results in versatile tasks such as brain tumor segmentation [5] , Saliva sample classification of COPD patients [6] , Chronic Neurological Disorder assistance [7] , anomaly recognition in the Artificial Pancreas [8] , clinical image reconstruction [9] , cancerous cell classification, to name a few. It is expected that in the coming years' intelligent software systems will take over much of the human labor, put by radiologists and physicists in examining medical documents. ML will transform conventional medical practice and research. Healthcare has emerged as an active application area for ML/DL models in achieving humanlevel performance in various pathological tasks [10] . Some of the investigations reported that the intelligent models outperformed clinical experts in certain respects. Esteva et al. [11] illustrate the categorization of skin lesions with a single CNN evaluated against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical diagnosis of the scariest skin cancer The findings show that AI can classify skin cancer with a degree of accuracy equivalent to dermatologists. Rajpurkar et al. [12] build the CheXNet algorithm, which can diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays at a higher level than experienced radiologists CheXNet outperforming them on the F1 measure. The drive to enhance the performance of ML models in comparison to humans has resulted in a marvelous increase in the conception of computer-aided investigative systems. The potential of AI systems for healthcare applications increased by the development of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, cloud computing, etc. Unitedly with the technologies, AI can produce profoundly accurate monitoring and prediction systems that can facilitate human-centric emergency medical assistance.",

In this digital era healthcare services have now extended to wearable devices, IoT, and cloud applications, as we attain a deeper understanding of embedded and automated systems in the clinical context [4] . Developing targeted therapies for personalized treatments, accurate localization of disease hubs, and identifying morbidities will be apparent if intelligent systems are critically developed ascertaining the liabilities united with it [16] .",

Development is often associated with the advent of automated machinery and mechanical systems as we grow towards becoming a data-centric world. Management and effective use of data at the industrial level is an irksome task if humans run the errands, this is where the applicability of various ML/DL-based intelligent systems gain its importance. ML algorithms are developed specifically for supporting models to solve a problem in different domains (e.g., Healthcare, Fintech, Industrial, etc.) [33] . Okay et al. [34] demonstrate that applying (Interpretable Machine Learning) IML models to sophisticated and difficult-to-interpret ML approaches provides thorough interpretability while preserving accuracy, which is challenging when crucial medical choices are at stake. Ileberi et al. [35] implement an ML-based framework, Synthetic Minority over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), for credit card scam exposure since it outstrips other prevailing methodologies. Ahsan et al. [36] propose a unique prognostics framework based on statisticsdriven ML modeling for forecasting qualification test results of electronic components, allowing a decrease in qualification test cost and time. Hari et al. [37] offer a supervised ML method built by modeling the behavior of Gallium Nitride (GaN) power electronic devices for reliably forecasting the current waveforms and switching voltage of these innovative devices. Seng et al. [38] concentrate on how computer vision (CV) and ML practices may be applied to existing vinification actions and vineyard organizations to obtain industry-relevant outcomes. Rehman et al. [39] provide an ML technique for the localization of brain tumor cells utilizing the textonmap image on FLAIR scans of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). Singh et al. [40] offer a unique ensemble-based classification technique that combines AI, fog computing, and smart health to create a reliable platform for the early identification of COVID-19 infection. Comparatively, Vyas et al. [41] offer an ML model powered by a multimodal method for assessing a patient's readiness to suggest the hospital plays an important part in action design based on patient choice. Some ML algorithms and their purposes are discussed in the forthcoming sections. A summary of the different ML algorithms discussed in this chapter is depicted in Fig. 1. ",

The relationship is represented Fig. 1 Illustration of various ML algorithms and their categories by a linear function (regression technique) with a formidable perfection. In the ML arena, Linear regression models outperform simplicity while preserving considerable interest and ease of interpretability. Velez et al. [43] , presented a straightforward definition of ML as \"the capacity to explain or show human eccentricities in understandable terms\". Linear regression targets to access a direct relationship (function) f that justifies the relationship between an input vector x having dimension d and a real-value output y (i.e., f(x)) as where 0 \u2208 R is identified as the intercept of the function and R d is the coefficient vector corresponding to the individual input variables. To calculate the regression coefficients 0 and , a training set ( A , A ) is required where A \u2208 R k\u00d7d denotes k training inputs, a 1 , a 2 , \u2026 .., a k and, A denotes k training outputs where each a i \u2208 R d is affirmed with the real-entity output B i . The prime objective is to reduce the empirical risk, quantifying via j the relation between predictor A j and the response, for each j = 1, 2, 3 \u2026 , d. Loss functions are a measure of the amount of deviation resulting from the actual outputs concerning model performance. The least squared estimate is one of the widely used loss functions for regression models and also has minimal variance amongst all unbiased linear estimates. Working a regression model by reducing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) between the predicted outputs and the labels is expressed as [44] Certain downsides include high variance, where a model may properly reflect the data set but may overfit to noisy or otherwise unrepresentative training data, reducing prediction accuracy and making it unsuitable for fitting. However, alternative approaches like Linear Dimension Reduction (LDR), this approach generates a low-dimensional linear mapping of the original high-dimensional or noisy data that maintains some characteristic of interest, denoises or compresses the data, extracts important feature spaces, and other benefits, further, forward or backward elimination allows to avoid overfitting and reduce robustness. The processing and manipulation of data are often associated with noise, creating a diminishing impact on the model's performance [45] . The link between regularization and robustness due to noise is represented as:",

The principal intention behind shrinkage methods is penalizing the regression coefficients on the loss function towards a fundamental point, like the mean. Some common shrinkage methods include Ridge Regression which penalizes the norm-2 of the regression coefficients where controls shrinkage magnitude, lasso regression penalizes norm-1 and tries to minimize the quantity by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) Regression is an extension of linear regression supplemented by shrinkage. The lasso approach favors models with fewer parameters, well-suited for models with high degrees of multicollinearity, or for developing automation of some rudiments of model selection. Lasso models are more interpretable as compared to ridge regression due to large which compels some of the estimated coefficients to be equivalent to absolute zero.

DL and ML methods help simplify the arduous methods to automate the task for actionable insights. Besides, the sources of data can intensify healthcare service information into distinct quarters such as medical data, social media data, environmental data, and genomics. Table 1 accumulates the contributions of various researchers in different domains of ML applicability over time. ML/DL techniques can serve to automate and improve performance in major healthcare applicative sectors such as prognosis, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical workflow. A depiction of the extensive amount of heterogeneous data sourcing into healthcare systems is shown in Fig. 4. ",

It has been observed in studies that the prediction for the diagnosis process gets degenerated when historical records are trained upon by ML models and tested on new (unseen data). Stojanovic et al. [68] presented a study where they coupled EHRs with advanced ML tools for predicting major parameters of healthcare quality. The study is dedicated to reduced dimensional vector representations of patients' clinical procedures and conditions. Brisimi et al. [69] developed ML methods to predict hospitalization probabilities because of the two most important chronic diseases, i.e., diabetes and heart ailments. The predictions rely on the clinical history of patients recorded in EHRs. The previous era has seen an enormous increase in the volume of digital information of medical data collected in EHRs. Shickel et al. [70] surveyed the present research on the application of DL to clinical tasks on EHR data and identified several loopholes in the current EHR-based research. Likewise, Fuente et al. [71] presented a survey where they studied the behavioral patterns in EHRs of patients using the Random Forest Algorithm. Their study mainly focuses on finding a correlation between different diseases or factors associated with them. Analytics plays an important role when considering datadriven systems for medical facilitation. Harerimana et al. [72] offered an intuitive review of optimized DL approaches in managing and utilizing data from EHRs. The exponential rise in the availability of data might reduce the need for data demand in ML processes. However, performance is traded-off for computation time that can become critical at times considering medical emergencies. Diabetes is one of the most common conditions found amongst the Indian population. The early discovery of type 2 diabetes (T2D) helps in treating patients more pragmatically and prevents severity. Bernardini et al. [73] introduced an ML algorithm known as Sparse Balanced Support Vector Machine (SB-SVM), trained extensively on the abundant data recorded in EHRs to detect the novel T2D early and efficiently. The SB-SVM produces promising results to overcome present competitors in providing the best trade-off between computation time and predictive performance. Similarly, with the help of EHRs, the protagonists of clinical welfare have developed several mechanisms such as admission prediction of Dementia patients [74] , classification of Opioid usage for Joint Replacement patients [75] , morbidity identification [15] , to consider a few.",

Recent advances in computational hardware are allowing physicists to revise old AI algorithms and experiment with new mathematical ideas [76] . The mechanically produced images enable diagnosis of the kernel of illness and localization of abnormalities in various parts of the body. The significant tasks in clinical image analysis comprise detection, segmentation, localization [77] , classification, enhancements, reconstruction, etc. [78] . As a result, a completely automated intelligent system for medical image analysis is predicted to successfully provide services such as segmentation, localization, detection, and classification. M. Li et al. [79] presented an experimental study in computeraided lung-cancer diagnosis based on histopathological imaging. Their proposed best classifier, i.e., the Relief-SVM (relevant features-Support Vector Machine) model achieved the highest accuracy, thereby verifying the potential of auxiliary diagnostic models using medical images. ML and AI have influenced treatment procedures in numerous ways. A detailed review of how AI is remodeling the medical imaging spectrum is presented by Mandal et al. [64] . Likewise, Umamaheswari et al. [80] propose an algorithm for the classification and segmentation of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Cells.

The medication process follows a threestep procedure of prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment. In the diagnosis phase, medical images are studied by expert clinicians and radiologists to interpret the possible risks and cures. An extensive amount of medical data is produced daily from various small and big healthcare facilities, the information collected is put through rigorous supervision, and findings are recorded in reports. However, preparing such reports requires expertise and if handled with less experience in areas of nascent healthcare services may result in misdiagnosis or may conclude at a critical synopsis. On the other hand, preparing textual medical documents at an organizational level can be a tedious and weary task for clinical experts and radiologists, therefore researchers have attempted to address some clarifications on specific problems using ML techniques. Zech et al. [77] proposed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based method for the annotation of radiology reports. A similar study conducted by Jing et al. [78] resurrected a multi-tasking ML framework for the automatic description and tagging of clinical radiology images. Similarly, researchers and physicians have found ways to blend methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), RNN, and LSTM to explain automated state of art architecture for predictive design systems in localizing affected areas of body parts [84, 85] . Zhao et al. [86] presented a study where they developed ML algorithms for possible drug repositioning in case of Depression and Schizophrenia disorders. SVMs outperform others amongst the list of experimented algorithms. The Covid-19 outbreak has claimed thousands of lives and has put forward a profusion of difficulties. Researchers and medicinal experts since then have worked enormously to find ways of saving lives, technology has been an integral part. Jamshidi et al. [87] have curated a collection of diverse DL approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19 patients. On the other hand, we can witness how gracefully Li et al. [88] have utilized ML approaches for assessing the degree of severity of Liver Fibrosis for chronic HBV. In our prior discussion diabetes remained one of the most researched conditions. Noaro et al. [89] presented a study where they conferred the abilities of ML models in improving the Insulin Bolus Calculation in type 1 diabetes. Moving on with more recitals of ML for treatment, we witness a few more studies that exemplify the statement [90, 91] .",

The workflow takes into account various DL/ ML techniques like Fisher score discriminator, t-test and chi-square test, and several traditional processes including predictive algorithms, Computer Vision, Image processing methods. Sayg\u0131l\u0131 et al. [92] examined several classification models to support early computer-aided diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19 using image processing and ML. Their proposed approach achieved an astounding accuracy of 99.02% on the X-ray images dataset. Correspondingly, Abdelsalam et al.

Predictive ML methods instigate the means of early prognosis and diagnosis from medical data which subdues the time required for acting upon the disease for treatment. Surveys stating that certain ML algorithms have been successful in the prediction of cardiovascular risk with clinical data [96] and studies culminated that ML adeptness raised effectuality in prognosis and diagnosis predictability. The inherent use of ML-based methods for prognosis and prediction of cancer, apprehension of various diseases like virulent infections, dengue, hepatitis, heart problems, malaria, diabetes, etc. have proved to be capable [97] . Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a variety of abnormal mood disorders observed under biological psychiatry. It has been very prevalent amongst youngsters these days. Diagnosis for it demands the root cause be unravelled. Kim et al. [98] studied MDD and applied ML to classify peripheral biomarkers using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) serum proteomic analysis data. ML has been observed to assist in a lot of cognitive diagnosis procedures, Pellergrini et al. [99] presented a systematic review which is evidence of it. Following this, Akbulut et al. [100] proposed several ML techniques for monitoring and predicting foetal health status based on maternal clinical history. ML has been developed extensively through the years. The decision support provided by ML models has reduced the workload on clinical professionals to a considerable extent. Karhade et al. [101] developed a Bayes Point machine for the prediction of 5-year survival in spinopelvic chordoma. The ML model was developed specifically for this rare pathology yet accuracy was not compromised. Likewise, Abdar et al. [102] proposed ML techniques for the diagnosis of coronary artery diseases. Burdick et al. [103] employed ML for the prediction and diagnosis of respiratory decompensation in Covid-19 patients. Hashem et al. [104] developed predictive models for the diagnosis of chronic liver diseases along with Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Magesh et al. [105] presented their study on early detection of Parkinson's disease, likewise, diagnostic models for Escherichia coli infection [106] , multiple sclerosis [107] , and others have been developed.",

The applications of it include interaction-less services with speech communication, automation of transcript generation, clinical notes synthesis, correspondence for an emergency in staff unavailability, etc. These methods are time and cost-effective and increase productivity, to manage the healthcare infrastructure internally well, applications of clinical audio and speech processing have been successful where automation is a new modality for patients as well as clinicians [115] .
