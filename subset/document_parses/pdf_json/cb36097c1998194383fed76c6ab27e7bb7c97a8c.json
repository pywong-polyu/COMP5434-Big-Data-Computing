Most vaccinated subjects are na\u00efve to SARS-CoV-2, however almost all have previously encountered other coronaviruses (CoVs) and the role of this immunity in shaping the vaccine response remains uncharacterized. Here we use longitudinal samples and highly-multiplexed serology to identify mRNA-1273 vaccine-induced antibody responses against a range of CoV Spike epitopes and in both phylogenetically conserved and non-conserved regions. Whereas reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes showed a delayed but progressive increase following vaccination, we observed distinct kinetics for the endemic CoV homologs at two conserved sites in Spike S2: these became detectable sooner, and decayed at later timepoints. Using homolog-specific depletion and alanine-substitution experiments, we show that these distinctly-evolving specificities result from cross-reactive antibodies as they mature against rare, polymorphic residues within these epitopes. Our results reveal mechanisms for the formation of antibodies with broad reactivity against CoVs.",

Now, global immunization to a fifth species -SARS-CoV-2 -is underway, through widespread natural infection, and increasingly through vaccination with formulations designed to immunize against the Spike protein, sometimes alongside other viral proteins. To date, the most effective and widely-studied vaccines contain modified mRNA encoding a stabilized full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (such as mRNA-1273 (Baden et al., 2021) ), which generate robust T and B cell responses, including high titers of neutralizing antibodies that correlate with protection against disease (Bergwerk et al., 2021) . It remains incompletely understood how pre-pandemic immunity to coronaviruses shapes this newly-acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",

Cross-reactive antibodies and memory B cells of this type support accelerated responses, but can have divergent functional consequences, ranging from life-threatening antibody-dependent enhancement (exemplified by dengue virus ( (Halstead and O'Rourke, 1977) ), to 'imprinting' that may constrain the specificity of subsequent responses (exemplified by influenza virus (Davenport et al., 1953; Gostic et al., 2016; Halstead and O'Rourke, 1977) , and the maturation of antibodies with broad neutralizing capacity (exemplified by HIV ( (Liao et al., 2013) ).",

In contrast, the S2 subunit, containing the fusion apparatus, is more conserved and contains regions of high sequence identity to the other circulating betacoronaviruses, and in some cases also to members of the alphacoronavirus genus. Consistent with this conservation, antibody responses that cross-recognize Spike proteins from pandemic and endemic CoVs have been reported (Aguilar-Bretones et al., 2021; Anderson et al., 2021) , and in some cases mapped to defined epitopes within S2 (Ladner et al., 2021; Pinto et al., 2021; Shrock et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021) . These cross-reactive epitopes include the Fusion Peptide (FP) region, whose sequence is conserved across SARS-CoV-2 and the 4 endemic HCoVs, and the Stem-Helix (SH) region, conserved across many of the betacoronaviruses and involved in the conformational rearrangement that mediates membrane fusion. At the SH epitope, clones with the ability to broadly-neutralize across the betacoronavirus genus have been isolated (Pinto et al., 2021) , however antibodies like these appear to comprise only a small fraction of the overall neutralizing response to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Piccoli et al., 2020) . A contribution to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by antibodies binding the FP epitope has also been reported (Poh et al., 2020) .",

SARS-CoV-2 peptides were reactive at all 8 of these epitopes. In contrast, reactivity to the three endemic HCoVs was restricted to two regions in the S2 subunit: the Fusion Peptide (FP) and Stem Helix (SH) regions (Figure 1c : cyan, gold, green shading). In each case, the pattern of reactivity detected by PepSeq reflects epitope sequence conservation with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1c : black traces). Specifically, the FP region which is highly conserved across both the alpha and betacoronavirus genera (which include all human-infecting CoVs), was targeted by the vaccine response in all four of the aligned Spike proteins. In contrast, the SH region, which is conserved across only the betacoronavirus genus (including SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43, but not HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-229E), was recognized by vaccine-induced antibodies targeting only the respective betacoronavirus-derived sequences.",

Time-resolved reactivity patterns partitioned into 2 groups: a \"late-progressive\" pattern for SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and an \"early peak\" pattern for endemic epitopes (Figure 2a,b) . Specifically, reactivity to each of the 8 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes was not significantly increased at day 8, intermediately and variably increased at day 28, and universally and maximally increased at day 140 (Figure 2b) . In contrast, reactivity to endemic homologs at the FP and SH epitopes was elevated as early as day 8, maximal at day 28 and then declined from day 28 to day 140 (Figure 2b) .",

Similar to the results of the epitope-resolved assay, we observed significant vaccine-induced antibody responses to both targets, but with different kinetics. Whereas the response to SARS-CoV-2 Spike increased from day 0 to day 140, the response to the endemic betacoronavirus OC43 was elevated at day 28, but decreased back to baseline by day 140 (Figure 2c) .

To avoid noise, we restricted this analysis to cases in which there was some overall detectable reactivity at the region of interest by excluding those donor-timepoint combinations in which no peptide (from any species) at the focal epitope exceeded a Z-score threshold (Methods). Applying this criterion, we detected FP reactivity in 3, 8, 10 and 15 donors, and SH reactivity in 4, 4, 8, 15 donors, respectively, at days 0, 8, 28 and 140 (Figure 4a) . Although this metric of maturation varied widely across donors at each timepoint, there was a significant increase over time for both the FP and SH epitopes.

For each position in both epitopes, we calculated a 'residue dependency index', representing the log2 ratio of signal from the wild-type peptide versus a mutant peptide with alanine substituted at the focal site. Analysis across Spike positions 810-839 (containing FP) and 1136-1165 (containing SH) in day 140 post-vaccination samples revealed core regions of dependency for each epitope (positions 814-825 for FP and 1148-1156 for SH) that were largely consistent across donors (Figure 5a ). For each epitope, the core closely matched the region of maximum sequence identity across CoV species, consistent with the observed cross-reactivity. However, for both epitopes we also observed some dependence on positions that were polymorphic between viruses: positions K814 and I818 in the FP epitope were involved in binding for most donors, and in >90% of subjects the anti-SH response was heavily dependent on the Y1155 residue. Two polymorphic sites outside of the core binding region (D830 and I834) also contributed to antibody binding in most donors at the FP epitope. Overall, the contribution of polymorphic sites within otherwise conserved regions to antibody binding provides a mechanism by which the response may distinguish closely-related homologs at each of these cross-reactive epitope regions.",

Most fundamental is our observation that responses against the endemic versions of both epitopes -as well as the full-length HCoV-OC43 Spike protein -are significantly induced following vaccination (Figure 1) , indicating that antibodies stimulated by the SARS-CoV-2 immunogen also bind the endemic homologs, consistent with prior studies (Amanat et al., 2021) .

The exception to this rule is the response to SARS-CoV-2 FP at day 140, a substantial component of which is depletable by the SARS-CoV-2 sequence but not the endemic homolog. This indicates that a late mono-specific reactivity arises at this epitope, and could be explained by the acquisition of somatic mutations that reduce the endemic-specific binding of cross-reactive clones and/or the emergence of new clones specific for SARS-CoV-2 alone.",

            "text": "Consistent with the observed cross-reactivity, fine mapping at the FP and SH regions of Spike ( Figure 5 ) confirms that the core antibody recognition sites reside in regions of high amino acid sequence identity -within much of the betacoronavirus genus in the case of SH, and spanning the alpha and betacoronavirus genera in the case of FP. Within each core recognition site, the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes differ by 2-3 amino acids from their endemic homologs, indicating residues whose differential participation in antibody binding can allow the response to distinguish between species. In support of this mechanism, our alanine-scanning results reveal several examples in which the response shows selectively increased dependence on non-conserved residues as it evolves from day 28 to day 140. The ability to focus the evolving specificity of recruited antibodies on a small minority of non-conserved residues is consistent with the sustained germinal center responses observed after infection (Dugan et al., 2021; Sokal et al., 2021) and vaccination (Turner et al., 2021) and underscores the remarkable discriminating power of such responses, which can serve as an important safeguard against the production of autoantibodies in cases of molecular mimicry between self and non-self (Burnett et al., 2018) . Future studies tracking the sequences of individual cross-reactive antibody clones as their specificities evolve from endemic to SARS-CoV-2-dominant recognition, including in combination with structural analysis, will allow the molecular basis of the evolution between Spike S2 homologs to be resolved in further detail.",

Interestingly, however, they observe a prevalence of antibodies directed to this epitope (~20% of vaccinees,~20% of convalescent subjects) that is substantially lower than the rate described here (>90% of vaccinees) and in previous work (~50-80% of convalescent subjects: (Kaslow et al., 2014; Ladner et al., 2021; Shrock et al., 2020) ). Together with evidence that antibodies against non-RBD targets generally account for <10% of the overall neutralizing activity in convalescent donors (Piccoli et al., 2020) , these observations suggest that antibodies with measurable neutralizing function against multiple human-infecting CoV species may arise commonly following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, but play a limited role in overall neutralization. Possibly exacerbated by hindered antibody access to the Spike stalk (ref), a lack of widespread, strongly cross-protective anti-S2 responses (and the associated selective pressure for immune escape) would be consistent with the high conservation of this region across human-infecting CoV species.",

Finally, a reverse transcription reaction, primed by the adaptor hairpin, was used to generate cDNA, and the original mRNA was removed using RNAse. To perform serological assays, the resulting DNA-barcoded peptide library was added to diluted plasma and incubated overnight.

The PepSIRF norm module was then used to normalize counts to reads per million (RPM). RPM normalized reads from seven buffer-only control samples were subsequently used to create bins for Z-score calculation using the PepSIRF bin module. To normalize for different starting peptide abundances within each bin, reads were further normalized by subtracting the average RPM from the buffer only controls (--diff option in norm module). Z-scores were calculated using the PepSIRF zscore module using the 75% highest density interval within each bin. Finally the PepSIRF enrich module was used to calculate peptides that were enriched in each sample using a minimum Z-score threshold of 10.",

Specifically, we downloaded 913 linear B cell epitopes covering 17 virus species: Alphapapillomavirus 7, Alphapapillomavirus 9, Chikungunya virus, Human gammaherpesvirus 8, Human immunodeficiency virus 1, Human mastadenovirus A, Human polyomavirus 1, Human polyomavirus 2, Japanese encephalitis virus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus, Mumps rubulavirus, Orthohepevirus A, Primate T-lymphotropic virus 1, Rabies lyssavirus, Rubella virus, West Nile virus, and Zika virus. All IEDB epitopes were \u226448 aa long. For each epitope >30 aa, two peptides were designed, one starting at the N terminus and one ending at the C terminus. For each epitope \u226430 aa, a single peptide was designed, with extra residues obtained, when necessary, from the longer protein sequence to which the epitope was linked. The final HV2 design included 404 peptides designed with this approach.",

Specifically, we focused on 12 genera, each of which contained \u22652 virus species in our design: Alphacoronavirus, Alphapapillomavirus, Betacoronavirus, Betapapillomavirus, Betapolyomavirus, Enterovirus, Flavivirus, Mastadenovirus, Roseolovirus, Rotavirus, Rubulavirus, and Simplexvirus. For each genus, we generated protein-level alignments with one representative from each species. Then, for each HV2 peptide selected from HV1, SCV2 or IEDB, we designed peptides covering the homologous region from all congeners. However, these new peptides were only included in the final HV2 design if they were distinct from all existing design peptides (<70% of 5mers shared). The final HV2 design included 3566 peptides designed with this approach.",
