In India, the countrywide lockdown has been imposed since 24th march 2020, and has got multiple extensions with different guidelines for each phase. Among various models of epidemiology, we use the SIR(D) model to analyze the extent to which this multi-phased lockdown has been active in 'flattening the curve' and lower the threat. Analyzing the effect of lockdown on the infection may provide a better insight into the evolution of epidemic while implementing the quarantine procedures as well as improving the healthcare facilities. For accurate modelling, incorporating various parameters along with sophisticated computational facilities are required. Parallel to SIRD modelling, we tend to compare it with the Ising model and derive a quantum circuit that incorporates the rate of infection and rate of recovery, etc as its parameters. The probabilistic plots obtained from the circuit qualitatively resemble the shape of the curve for the spread of Coronavirus. We also demonstrate how the curve flattens when the lockdown is imposed. This kind of quantum computational approach can be useful in reducing space and time complexities of a huge amount of information related to the epidemic.",

            "text": "Here, we use the time-dependent SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model to predict the evolution of this epidemic in India. The SIRD model is one among several compartmental studies in epidemiology 4 such as SEIR, where E stands for exposed and rest staying the same; SEIRD, SIR, SIS model, etc. They have their origin from the Kermack-McKendrick theory of infection spread, a very rigorous statistical analysis performed in 1927. Here, the population is divided into various compartments, and their interactions are studied further. It is a simple yet an instrumental model of epidemiology since it takes into account various factors such as the rate at which the infection spreads, the rate at which the active cases recover, etc. Since more compartmentalization allows us to study the population in a detailed manner, models like SEIRD are always better than the chosen SIRD. However, SEIRD model needs the data for 'Exposed' individuals. Here, we use the crowd-sourced COVID 19 tracker 5 database that provides the data for the number of infected (I), recovered (R) and deceased (D) individuals, while not being explicit about the number of exposed individuals. Even though the database gives the data for number of testings performed, it wasn't found suitable enough to be considered as the tallies for exposed individuals since mild or asymptomatic carriers aren't usually tested until found via contact tracing or travel history. Hence, SIRD model is suitable enough to be followed owing to its ease of data availability. In this current study, we use classical computation to demonstrate how a change in spread rates might stabilize figures related to infection, recovery, and death.",

We break the time scale into smaller intervals (a period of 10 days) and analyze them individually by applying a SIRD model over them, we find the values of the associated parameters in these periods, and thus obtain an approximate trend followed by the infection rates. We later use these curves to extrapolate and get a rough prediction of the infection rates for the next few days after the extended lockdown ends (17th May). Further, this set of predicted parameters are used to deduce the progress of the system in the near future with a fixed population. These deductions with current constraints on the system are put up against a system with no such constraints to demonstrate the efficacy of multi-phased lockdown on widening and delaying the peak of infection reporting.",

We also demonstrate how the considered parameters must be varied to reduce the number of infections when at its peak and also to delay the time by which viral spread peaks in the country. This delay of the peak with lowering of its height is given a term called 'flattening the curve' and this becomes crucial, as the affected population is more spread out for a given time interval. Hence, this might not flood the country's healthcare facilities, unlike otherwise. The reduction of the number of cases at its peak also ensures that the current healthcare facility doesn't face a shortage of resources while treating the patients.",

I is the population that has been infected and has the potential to spread the infection. R is the group which has successfully recovered from the disease.

A spin of + 1 2 (p = probability of getting infected [success]) depicts that the person is infected with the virus and the spin of \u2212 1 2 (q= 1-p, probability of not being infected [failure]) indicates otherwise, while considering the total population being N. Hence, just like the Ising model, here also the spins (infected or susceptible individuals) interact with each other.

We can derive its time evolution factor with the probability of cases (or spin states) by implementing a Hamiltonian operator of its function dependent on time. As in the spin system, the spins interact with each other by the exchange interaction, it is defined by a Hamiltonian operator 41,42 as where A n , B n and C n are the strength of the exchange interactions (in the form of probability distribution) of the lattice points along the respective directions. Even though it is futile to consider different distributions of transmission along different directions when applied in Covid-19 simulation, still, we would first derive the quantum circuit for the generalized Hamiltonian of Ising model, and then later specialise it for Covid-19 scenario.

So, we employed the approach mentioned to carry out our analysis. As per this fitting, in Fig. 8 , the peak of the infection curve suggests that a maximum of 10 9 people will get infected for a particular set of parameters. However, data plotting suggests a change in the concavity of the curve it follows, hence in its slope. Thus taking a single fitting for the whole period might not be a well scientific method. Hence, we tried to break the time interval into smaller legs (here we have chosen 10 days, because 10 day time period also would prove to be quite resistant to fluctuations in daily data and would help us get an overall trend) as per Table 1 and record the values of the parameters (Table 2) in the respective leg. The simulated curves are thus made to nearly fit the data points in Fig. 9 .",

To know the future of \u03b1 under the lockdown, we consider the rate of infections of the . The important conclusion we can draw from this plot, that the infection rate has been lowered by this lockdown. And since the points seem to obey the exponential decay fit upto some consistency, we can deduce that they confirm the mathematical analysis that the infection rate has the tendency to reduce exponentially when the population is under lockdown. As it can be seen from the plot, the points tend to have some deviation from the fit curve, which is due to the changing nature of the lockdown from time to time. Since we already know that 99% of the infected individuals www.nature.com/scientificreports/ start exhibiting symptoms in 14 days of getting infected, the true effect of any containment step can be visible only in the next 2 legs. We observe a pretty low drop for \u03b1 in leg 4, while a heavy and significant drop can be noted for leg 5, which only portrays the effect of lockdown of its previous 2 legs. Gradual relaxation of the lockdown beginning from the 20th April (in the 6th leg) resulted in a mass movement of individuals and thus a higher infection rate could be noted for the 7th leg. The fit curve provides a very rough trend of the infection rate during the lockdown. The deviation of the point from the estimate curve can be attributed to the changing nature of the lockdown based on its variation in relaxation limit. We extrapolate this curve to have a general idea of what values alpha can presume in the coming legs. These values can help predict how the infection spreads over a long span of time. As shown in Fig. 10 , we later use a straight-line fitting to extrapolate \u03b2 for subsequent legs.",

We use the obtained values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 for the next legs and simulate the SIRD curve and present it cumulatively. We have tried to analyze how the future numbers might be if the lockdown continues as it is until the disease is entirely null. After 3-4 legs further, the change in \u03b1 would have started becoming negligible (and R 0 value slowly tending to 1) due to the asymptomatic nature of an exponential decay. The recovery rate also would have become nearly constant, since the healthcare facilities will achieve saturation in a few months. We have taken the values of the parameters at the end of the leg of period 132-142 to be constant throughout, for time to come. We extrapolated the curve to obtain a trend (Fig. 11) .",

We discussed how the pandemic can be viewed as an Ising model simulation. From there on we assumed the Hamiltonian of the Infection spread being the same as that of Ising system without being under the influence of an external magnetic field. We went on to formulate the quantum circuit out of that Hamiltonian. In Eq. (6), we observed that the Hamiltonian is dependent upon the interaction functions (the probability distributions), so in order to simulate the infection we needed to find out the function representing the interaction among the atoms (or the people). But already prior to that, we used the binomial distribution analogy and derived a Poisson distribution function suitable enough for later being used in the Hamiltonian based quantum circuit to yield a curve (Fig. 12) quite with a considerable resemblance to the SIRD simulated Table 2 . Values of \u03b1(t) and \u03b2(t) for various intervals for making the curve fit with the respective data sets. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ curve and the infection curves for different countries. In the Hamiltonian, the parameter R 0 signifies the ratio of \u03b1 to that of \u03b2 . We can observe that when R 0 is lowered while keeping other variables and parameters constant, the peak of the curve shifts forward in the time axis with a reduction in its height and making it broader. From these, we can infer that a decline in the rate of infection ( \u03b1 ) will infect lesser people than before, thus flattening the curve. Also, an increase in the rate of recovery ( \u03b2 ) will imply an improvement in healthcare facilities, changing demographics of the infected patients, etc. and show a change in the height and position of the peak. Using proper parameters and constants, this can be a novel way to simulate approximate curves for a given situation. An analysis of epidemic spreads can be carried out with the inclusion of more and more factors that otherwise gets difficult for classical computers.",

So latter case parameters postponed the attainment of carrier limits and are not as rapidly growing as the former case. Also, the no lockdown case is started from the day of data collection, along with lockdown trends and post lockdown trends growing by two parameters to give an effective picture of what would have been the picture without a lockdown and how it would evolve once a lockdown is lifted off considering the extreme case scenario too.

The first limitation of this analysis is the use of the slope-estimation of data plotted curves to find the simulated curve in the lockdown period while obtaining a periodic split up www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of parameters. This might account for errors in the analysis. The assumptions like not considering birth and mortality rates, the permanent immunization of a recovered patient, unavoidable migration and interactions, etc. make the model lose its precision. Here, the susceptible are considered to be the entire population except the infected, recovered, and deceased individuals, initially at a time t. No considerations have been made to distinguish the exposed individuals out of the susceptible and model them accordingly. This might be a significant drawback of the model. The trend in recovery and its rate also is incomprehensible due to the lack of data on the demographics of the recovered patients in terms of their age, sex, etc. In this model, the number of tests performed and their rate has not been considered, but they might play a significant role in reporting the cases, hence the \u03b1(t). Our N (the total population) has been assumed constant, but immigration, new birth, and deaths might vary the N, thus making us compromise on its accuracy. More efficient models like the SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased), and higher compartmental models can be implemented for better prediction and analysis. Figure 11 .
