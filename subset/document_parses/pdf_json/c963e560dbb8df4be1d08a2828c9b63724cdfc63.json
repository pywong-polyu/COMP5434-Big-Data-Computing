In addition, since the sample group consists only of nurses, no comparison can be made among other groups such as physicians, technicians, administrative staff, etc. The descriptive type of the study, the limited sample size and the inability to use random sampling methods may affect the data analysis results and limit the ability to interpret causal relationships between different variables. On the other hand, this study evaluates the prevalence of symptoms at some point in time. These symptoms can be temporary and require long-term follow-up.
