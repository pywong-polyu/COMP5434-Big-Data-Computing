Following successful preclinical studies with mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP), we tested an mRNA-LNP formulation (CV7202). Methods: In this phase 1, multi-center, controlled study in Belgium and Germany we enrolled 55 healthy 18-40-year-olds to receive intramuscular injections of 5 lg (n = 10), 1 lg (n = 16), or 2 lg (n = 16) CV7202 on Day 1; subsets (n = 8) of 1 lg and 2 lg groups received second doses on Day 29. Controls (n = 10) received rabies vaccine, Rabipur, on Days 1, 8 and 29. Safety and reactogenicity were assessed up to 28 days post-vaccination using diary cards; immunogenicity was measured as RABV-G-specific neutralizing titers (VNT) by RFFIT and IgG by ELISA.",

After two 1 or 2 lg doses all recipients had titers ! 0.5 IU/mL by Day 43. Day 57 GMTs were not significantly lower than those with Rabipur, which elicited adequate responses in all vaccinees after two doses.

Use of RABV-G presents several advantages in the early stages of development: the antigen has been clearly defined and characterized, and there is a WHOdefined level of immune response that is considered adequate for the assessment of new vaccines.

Further preclinical research in animal models has found that formulation of the mRNA in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) protects the mRNA and enhances the immune response [9] . Preclinical studies found that CV7202, a novel mRNA-LNP formulation which includes the same mRNA antigen as CV7201 encapsulated in LNP, elicits immune responses in non-human primates comparable to those induced by licensed vaccines (CureVac, data on file). We now report on the first use of this new formulation in adult human volunteers in an ongoing phase 1 study to assess the safety and immunogenic potential of this new vaccine model, which is now being applied to other novel pathogenic viruses, notably SARS-CoV-2.",

The study protocol was approved by the respective Ethical Committees of the two institutions and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03713086). Trial procedures were done in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. An internal safety review committee (iSRC) consisting of internal medical experts and the investigators, and an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) consisting of external vaccine experts reviewed safety data on a regular basis and made recommendations regarding the sequential enrolment of participants into dose escalation or deescalation groups according to the DSMB charter and the protocol. The study is ongoing at the time of this report for long-term safety and immunogenicity follow-up, but database lock for the presented data was May 2020, at least four weeks after the second dose of experimental vaccine, CV7202.",

A control group enrolled without stagger received three doses of a licensed rabies vaccine according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The planned staggered enrolment consisted of the first participant in the 5 lg group receiving their first vaccination, followed by the second and third participants two working days later. The fourth and fifth participants were then enrolled and vaccinated one week after the first. Two days after these vaccinations the iSRC and DSMB reviewed the safety data from the first five participants before agreeing to the enrolment of further participants in this group. This process was to be repeated for the next groups, with the exception that safety data for sentinel safety groups comprising the first four participants was considered by the iSRC before enrolment of the remaining participants in each group. As described in results, following observation of excess reactogenicity to 5 lg CV7202 the protocol was modified to assess lower (1 lg and 2 lg) rather than higher dosages.",

Following observations of high reactogenicity when using the 5 lg dose of CV7202 we found 1 and 2 lg dosages were better tolerated, with no safety concerns and two doses elicited immune responses in terms of neutralizing activity and IgG antibodies that were comparable with three doses of licensed rabies vaccine. Preliminary investigation of the 5 lg response suggest that high innate immune responses driven by type 1 interferon and cytokines and strong induction of toll-like receptor signaling pathways observed in most participants, might have contributed to unfavorable reactogenicity and immunogenicity profiles. This will be investigated in further studies.",

Although over half the recipients of the highest dose of CV7202 reported severe solicited systemic or unsolicited AEs, the reactogenicity profiles of the lower doses of CV7202 (1 and 2 lg) were more acceptable. The 2 lg dose elicited a limited number of severe AEs in the first 24 h postvaccination. Local reactions to these dosages consisted almost exclusively of transient mild to moderate injection site pain. Systemic AEs mainly consisted of transient mild or moderate headache, fatigue and chills, and any cases that were described as initially severe rapidly moderated and resolved, most within 48-72 h and all within the 7-day reporting period. There were no major changes in reactogenicity after the second dose when compared with the first, although the numbers of participants are small. This contrasts with recent reports of mRNA-LNP vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic which had similar rates of reactogenicity and in which reactogenicity noticeably increased after a second dose [17, 18] .",

As already mentioned, using rabies as a model antigen presents several advantages in this early development program, but the principles being investigated can be applied to other viral pathogens. Although initial studies of mRNA vaccines were targeted against tumors for cancer immunotherapy [19, 20] , their potential for prophylactic use has led to an increasing amount of research into this aspect, notably the recent focus on vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 during the Covid-19 pandemic [21] . Several mRNA vaccine candidates using this approach have been reported to be in development [22, 23] . Our initial studies of the mRNA technology using rabies mRNA, CV7201, found that there was potential for a human mRNA rabies vaccine, but the mode of delivery of the molecule was critical to elicit an adequate immune response due to its known instability in physiological conditions [8] . Intracellular delivery of oligonucleotides can be improved by encapsulating them in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) [9, 23] , and preclinical studies showed that protecting the mRNA by lipid encapsulation significantly enhanced the response to the CV7201 [9, 24] . Studies to develop efficacious COVID-19 vaccines using mRNA have employed larger quantities of mRNA in LNP-formulations, 10-100 mg [17] or 25-250 mg [18] , from which final doses of 30 mg and 100 mg were selected, respectively.",

Further studies are underway to apply this mRNA technology to other antigens, notably the development of a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04449276, EudraCT 2020-001286-36).
