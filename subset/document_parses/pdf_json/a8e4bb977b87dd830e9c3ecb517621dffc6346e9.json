We briefly describe the Australian welfare system and present, in descending order of frequency, the elements of welfare mentioned by the Australian respondents. Again, healthcare was mentioned most often, followed by income support and aged care (as care for elderly is called in Australia). The chapter ends by comparing Australian and Canadian responses: While the main issues mentioned were similar, less attention was paid to education, and almost none to basic income.",

Social expenditure is the biggest among these expenses, however, as it comprises just under 20 percent of the GDP.

The Federal Government is the main revenue raiser through taxation and is the direct funder and administrator of major welfare tranches. These are aged pensions, unemployment benefits, disability support (such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, NDIS), and the Medicare universal healthcare payment system, which offers free public hospital care and subsidized or no-cost local doctor care to all. The Federal Government largely funds the hospital, aged care, public housing, and education systems, but passes responsibility for the design and running of these to the state (or territory) governments. Unlike in Sweden, local governments in Australia have a relatively restricted role often referred to as \"roads, rates, & rubbish\". The fact that individual state governments act as a postbox for federal welfare-related money and have significant autonomy in deciding how this money is applied, means that the way welfare is produced can depend on where one lives. For example, on the health front: Safe (supervised) injecting rooms for drug users are only available in two of the seven states and territories, assisted dying (euthanasia) is legal and is supported in only one state (Victoria), and abortion is essentially illegal in the largest state (New South Wales). Similarly, the supply of public housing and the criteria to qualify for access to same varies markedly across Australia.",

Indeed, the aging of the population is a main trend in the context of Australia's welfare, with 3.5 million (or 15 percent of the population) aged over 65 in 2014, compared to an estimated 8.4 million (or 21 percent of the population) in 2054. Although the proportion of people with a disability has held steady, it is very significant at around one in five, or 20 percent of the population (AIHW 2015). The ability of governments to fund such demands faces obstacles because of an uncertain world economic outlook and fluctuating tax revenues flowing from the highly volatile commodity sector, where prices are at the mercy of many factors, including trade tensions with China and Brexit uncertainties. These cost and revenue challenges mean there are huge long-term pressures that require continual action to ensure that the social welfare system is well targeted, fiscally sustainable, and provides value for money.",

Certain changes have made the system more wasteful and costly to administer than it ought to be, and have created disincentives for some people to work. Complexity abounds, as there are currently around 75 income support and supplementary payment types, resulting in a system that is difficult for recipients to understand and navigate-especially for those with mental health or other debilitating conditions-and difficult for public officials to administer. Existing financial-means testing arrangements, based on income or assets, add to this complexity and result in a system that is confusing for income support recipients. This complexity leaves recipients unsure about the potential rewards from work and, as such, demotivates them and undermines community confidence in the fairness and utility of the social welfare system. The Australian welfare system is a product of changing political priorities and ad hoc policy responses, and as a result has become a patchwork of policies and procedures that lacks coherence and is inequitable. To quote an example of this hotchpotch: Those seeking work may fall into one of three income support schemes, each of which is governed by different payment amounts, and differing indexation or qualification measures. As a consequence, people with similar basic living costs and similar capacities to work may receive very different levels of financial support and have different participation requirements.",

It has been argued that a new and less complex social support system is needed to improve employment and social outcomes, and a variety of mechanisms are being introduced that range from raising the retirement age, to introducing a new, more coherent (but controversial) set of mutual obligation requirements for job seekers (such as cumulative demeritpoint-based penalties for not applying for jobs or failing random drug tests), and for parents who receive working age income support. Also, a cashless debit card has been introduced for payments to welfare recipients deemed to be vulnerable or at risk, which limits what items they can purchase to \"desirable\" things such as rent, food, health and the like. While the government has moderated its explicit rhetoric of supporting \"lifters\" (those purportedly adding value to society) but discouraging \"leaners\" (those purportedly being propped up by society), it has continued to pursue a number of arguably draconian or stigmatizing proposals for welfare recipients-despite past \"failures to launch\" caused by a lack of political capital. Such proposals included raising the age at which one can receive unemployment benefits, creating a waiting period before unemployed young people can receive benefits, and widening the categories subjected to mandatory drug testing and payment via restricted debit cards.",

The objective of an activation policy is to increase the work-search efforts of working-age people who are receiving social security payments. The rationale is based on the idea that unemployment is primarily an issue of deficient labor supply, rather than insufficient demand, thus, the greater a person's efforts in actually seeking work, the greater the likelihood of finding employment. Specific tactics of activation via the social welfare system include strict requirements for people on unemployment payments to look for work actively (as measured by job applications submitted per fortnight), penalties for failing to satisfy the \"work test\", and a \"work-forthe-dole scheme\" according to which some people receiving unemployment payments are required to work 15 hours a week to remain eligible for benefits.",

The NDIS takes a lifetime approach, investing early in people with disability to improve their outcomes later in life, and is designed to give people peace of mind that if their child or loved one is born with or acquires a permanent and significant disability, they will get the support they need-including programs to build skills and capability so the disabled can participate in the community and employment.",

Australians have a tradition of volunteering in many areas of community life such as education, sport, safety and emergency services, and welfare services-as exemplified by in excess of six million people doing some voluntary work for the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare each year (AIHW 2015). In addition, informal carers of people with disabilities or the aged could reduce the load on government welfare payments and services. In 2012, about 2.7 million Australians were informal carers, providing help, support or supervision to family members, friends, or neighbors with a range of physical and mental health conditions and disabilities. Informal care can include personal care (such as showering and support with eating), in-home supervision, transport, and help with shopping and medical needs. Most carers (71 percent) lived with the person receiving care. The person responsible for the majority of informal caring is called the primary carer, and nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of primary carers found it hard to meet everyday living costs because of their caring role (AIHW 2015) . \"Teething problems\" are to be expected in the roll-out of any major welfare reform (Palmer 2017) , but early experiences of recipients indicate that as benefits are tied to the acceptance by the government of an approved plan submitted for each individual, 5 it is the ability of the client or their agents to shape and drive that plan that determines welfare outcomes. Additionally, the plan hinges on things like varying levels of comprehension, education, articulateness, and insistence and persistence of recipients and their supporters.",

For 50 percent of this segment of the population aged 18-64, government payments are the main source of income, versus 16 percent for non-Indigenous Australians (AIHW 2015) . Indigenous Australians are the least well-off sub-population in terms of health status and life expectancy. Although some statistics continue to improve slowly, there is wide acknowledgment that the rate of improvement must accelerate-but the political rhetoric has typically and historically not been matched by action and outcomes (Russell 2016) . For example, in the introduction to the Prime Minister's 2016 report on Closing the Gap on Indigenous disadvantage, the then incoming Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull stated \"[b]ut it is not until Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the same opportunities for health, education, and employment that we can truly say we are a country of equal opportunity\". 6 Yet, in contrast to such grand words, the following federal budget did not list Indigenous disadvantage as a priority issue (Russell 2016) . Indeed, the 2017 Closing the Gap Report acknowledged that improvements have not met the majority of the outcomes set by the Council of Australian Governments. 7 For both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, a lack of affordable housing-either through rental or ownership-is an ever-increasing impediment to social welfare. This problem is exacerbated by high levels of migration, purchases of property by foreign absentee landlords, and limited expenditure on public housing by state governments. Two surveys of affordability and housing (Troy and Martin 2017) , give a dire picture for low-income households wanting to rent a house in capital cities and in many regional areas. When low-income households have to over-spend on housing, they are under \"housing stress\", whereby they start to go without or reduce other necessities that are good for the body and soul-such as meals, health care, and outings. Housing stress is increasingly impacting on moderate income earners as well. Low-income families priced out of capital cities and major regional centers may find more affordable housing in more isolated areas where homes might be affordable, but that is not where the jobs and better education, health, and other support services are located.",

As the resources will become thin, the systems will change. What is good for a mother and a baby will be an economic decision made by an accountant. There will be many vulnerable people, as many medical services will be too expensive for them. The quality of life will diminish; it is \"a slippery slope\".

And we have never been better educated, smarter\u2026 access to technology is incredible, so everything can speed up. (\u2026) young people today have a very highly developed social conscience.

In Australia education has a lower priority, whereas the care for the elderly has a higher one, and these concerns were expressed in an intense and palpable manner. Australia has one of the highest home ownership rates in the western world with relatively low emphasis on the rental market or public housing-yet, like the Canadian interviewees, Australian respondents identified a need to make housing more affordable. In Australia there is a general opinion that people should work and save for the future; only one person mentioned the idea of basic income. 11 The costs and burden of the welfare should be shared by the government, charities, and people themselves.",
