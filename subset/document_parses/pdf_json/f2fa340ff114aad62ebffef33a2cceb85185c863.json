Combining computational methods and clinical expertise, we curated clusters that represent 46 clinical conditions as potential risk factors for death after a COVID-19 infection. We trained age-stratified generalized linear models (GLMs) with component-wise gradient boosting to predict the probability of death based on what we know from the patients before they contracted the virus. Despite only relying on previously documented demographics and comorbidities, our models demonstrated similar performance to other prognostic models that require an assortment of symptoms, laboratory values, and images at the time of diagnosis or during the course of the illness. In general, we found age as the most important predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients. A history of pneumonia, which is rarely asked in typical epidemiology studies, was one of the most important risk factors for predicting COVID-19 mortality. A history of diabetes with complications and cancer (breast and prostate) were notable risk factors for patients between the ages of 45 and 65 years. In patients aged 65-85 years, diseases that affect the pulmonary system, including interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and a smoking history, were important for predicting mortality. The ability to compute precise individual-level risk scores exclusively based on the EHR is crucial for effectively allocating and distributing resources, such as prioritizing vaccination among the general population.",

Yet, it is a disease that has appeared after many millions of dollars invested in the worldwide informatics infrastructure. The greater availability of electronic health record (EHR) data has enabled an explosion of studies on COVID-19. At an extremely rapid pace, hospital systems have been developing COVID-19 data repositories to track patient data and try to discover risk factors and treatments for the disease. Standard terminologies have been expanded to include new diagnosis codes and laboratory tests to make the disease analyzable by statistics and machine learning algorithms. In just 3 months, tens of thousands of COVID-19related studies were published. Early studies were primarily population descriptions, but more recent work has used hospital data to identify risk factors [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

Few studies use the entire longitudinal medical records. This is likely because EHRs are rife with missing and miscoded data, making analysis potentially misguided by confounders and overfitting. EHR data may not perfectly suit the definition and scope of classic epidemiological studies. Yet, the sheer vastness of the EHR is also an advantage: by using the full medical records, it becomes possible to perform predictive analytics, simply because there is so much data. This possibility is more prominent during pandemics, when access to large-scale research-grade data are not feasible.",

We demonstrate that the data already routinely collected and stored in EHRs can be rapidly leveraged to address pressing questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial models we trained by May 2020 (<3 months after the COVID-19 surge in the United States) achieved comparable predictive power to the models described in this study (which were trained in October 2020). Applying a computational algorithm, Minimize Sparsity, Maximize Relevance (MSMR) 11, 12 , enhanced with clinical expertise, we constructed clusters of mortality predictors from EHR data for COVID-19 patients. Using these covariates, we developed a set of nested generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict mortality and understand the relationship of various demographics and diseases with COVID-19 mortality.

We controlled for the confounding effects of age by stratifying models into age-separated cohorts.

The first step of the MSMR algorithm reduced the dimensionality to under 9500 distinct features, which we then reduced to 1000 using the joint mutual information (JMI) score. Using clinical expertise, we grouped these medical records into 46 clusters of prior clinical conditions, to which we added other available relevant diagnosis or medication records in the MGB EHR repository. These clusters represent pseudo-cohorts of diseases and we used them as covariates for mortality after COVID-19. For example, the pseudo-cohort of CAD patients encompassed COVID-19-positive patients who had International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revisions (ICD-10) codes such as \"Diagnosis of Old Myocardial Infarction\" and \"Atherosclerotic Heart Disease of Native Coronary Artery.\" In certain cases, if a medication was specifically associated with a disease, the medication code(s) was used to identify a disease cluster. For example, the patients taking levothyroxine were designated as having hypothyroidism. Table 1 also includes the list of the 46 clusters of prior conditions. Certain disease pseudo-cohorts were subdivided into two clusters between a non-severe and severe subtype. For example, HTN was divided into a category of HTN and urgent/emergent HTN.

In a well-calibrated model, the calibration curve appears along the main diagonal-the closer the more reliable.

For each patient, the model predicted a probability for death, solely based on the past medical records. We demonstrated the clinical reliability of the models through calibration curves. This has substantial implications, especially as the virus continues to spread rapidly. At the point of care, the estimated probabilities can be used to construct risk strata to quickly separate low risk patients from those with a high risk of mortality. This technique could be extremely valuable for determining who is most likely to benefit when resources are limited, such as informing vaccination distribution. Currently, the CDC recommendations for vaccinations rely on generalizations that are based on age, occupation, and the living environment 20 . Such recommendations are imprecise and do not leverage the wealth of information in the EHR. A model, such as the one proposed in this study, could assess the individual risk of every participant in a healthcare system based off of demographics, diagnoses, and medications found in the EHR. This could ensure resources are being equitably distributed by identifying and then prioritizing the highest risk individuals in each of the groups.",

Although previous COVID-19 epidemiology studies have identified chronic diseases that independently have an impact on prognosis, many of the risk factors identified were highly correlated with one another and therefore when combined do not necessarily lead to a significantly higher likelihood of an adverse outcome. For example, in our overall model, HTN had a correlation with age of 0.36, with hyperlipidemia of 0.67, and with DM type 2 with complications of 0.41. Although early research findings observed higher rates of HTN among severely ill COVID-19 patients [21] [22] [23] , in the case of HTN, it is not clear if the disease actually caused a higher mortality or if it is a confounder. Our model provides a framework for understanding how multiple risk factors can collectively be interpreted to predict death after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Of note, certain risk factors like HTN were not included in our final model.",

Among the 85+ years age group, it is one of the most important features for predicting mortality. Interestingly, the top features of the overall model span a number of different organ systems.

Future studies should evaluate specific features by attempting to control for confounders.

This possibility is more prominent during pandemics, when access to large-scale research-grade data is not feasible. We showed that EHR data can be leveraged to predict death after COVID-19.

We utilized the 1000 initial features (including diagnosis and medication records) provided by the MSMR algorithm as an initial set of indicators for potential covariates that could predict death in COVID-19 patients. Using these medical records, a clinician in our team constructed clusters of records to identify patient pseudo-cohorts with similar prior clinical conditions, which we used as clinical covariates in this study. To increase robustness of the clusters, we include additional diagnosis and medication codes into the construction of clusters that were not initially included in the top 1000 codes by MSMR, which may happen due to the variability in the healthcare utilization processes across time. For example, if multiple ICD codes related to HTN are recommended by the MSMR algorithm, the clinician would create one (or more) cluster(s) of hypertensive patients, using all the codes in the EHR that are used to define HTN cohorts. Each cluster was considered a predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients.",

Due to the highly unbalanced data, we under-sampled the alive patients to improve model training. That is, we limited patients to those who survived for at least a specific number of days after contracting COVID-19, depending on the age group model. In the overall, 45-65, and 65-85 models, we specified a 28-day buffer for the alive patients, but in the 85+ model, where death incidents were more balanced, we only required a 7-day buffer to assume a patient's survival. We computed ORs by exponentiating the regression coefficients obtained from the GLMs to compare relative importance of the variables for predicting mortality within and across age groups. It is important to note that the ORs from the boosting GLM are expected to be smaller than those obtained from a standard GLM, as boosting has a shrinkage effect.",
