The COVID-19 outbreak is currently responsible for major educational crises globally as most of the world has been faced with a mandated lockdown, and forced closure of educational institutions, including medical colleges. Anatomists have therefore been challenged to unlock technology in effort to achieve best deliverables for their discipline, without the use of traditional teaching aids such as the cadaver, osteological banks, prosected specimens, models, and microscopic slides. At present, the virtual classroom is the only option for the anatomist, thereby omitting vital aspects of the hidden curriculum such as ethical-reasoning, empathy, respect, professionalism, interpersonal, and communication skills. As body donations dwindle, the era of teaching in a cadaverless environment is upon us. This marks the beginning of a paradigm shift in education and research for anatomists worldwide. Given the variable pathological-morphological presentation in COVID-19-related deaths, it is also likely that the autopsy component of anatomic pathology will be resuscitated to demystify the underlying mechanisms of the virus. Since COVID-19 may never disappear completely, we would like to recommend that international anatomical societies collectively reach out to statutory bodies to devise a standardized method of teaching anatomy, employing readily available cost-effective resources, in the face of pandemics. However, if anatomy as a discipline has survived a millennium, surely anatomists can fight the \"scourges\" that have plagued them as various perspectives have been bandied about to welcome in a new normal.",

The stark reality of these advances is further appreciated when paralleled to an historical account of the Spanish Flu pandemic from the 1918 November edition of the Canadian Dalhousie Gazette: \"This year the college curriculum seems doomed to interruption, much to the joy of the slothful, but decidedly to the inconvenience of those who really want to learn something before they leave Dalhousie \u2026 The shut-down lasted for nearly five weeks and, besides driving the faculty to despair, did not bring any satisfaction to the holiday inclined as no movies were open and the rain was practically continuous\" [1] . While at the same time, further afield in Kansas, a student embraced the supposed normalcy of life as the global public health emergency continued: \"Ralph and I are fine, and have not gotten the \"flue\" yet altho it is pretty bad down here at present \u2026 I certainly like my school work and time goes so fast, have all my classes in the forenoon but the lessons are so long it takes all P.M. and until 10 P.M. to prepare lessons for next day\" [2] . As articulated by these historical pieces, irrespective of time or This article is part of the Topical Collection on COVID-19 place, the changing terrain of education is inevitable in the face of a pandemic.",

Until this time, cadaveric dissection was seldom performed in anatomy education and constituted a crime as it was banned through the issuance of a papal bull by Pope Boniface VIII in the early 1300s [6] . However, as a few Bolognese medical schools related this injunction to a \"religion-induced medical ignorance\", they supported biannual public dissection events [7] . These events were held in makeshift venues and were facilitated by three individuals: a surgeon who dissected a corpse provided by the Duke of Anjou; a Latin-speaking general physician who communicated each step of the dissection to the audience; and a prosector who indicated the dissected structures-a theatrical mental image comparable to \"The Anatomy Lesson\" painted by Rembrandt [7] .",

In fact, undergraduate students at a non-dissectionbased medical school reflected on the variety of digital educational resources available to bridge the gap left by the removal of cadaveric dissection [22] . That being said, cadaveric dissection embodies kinesthetic learning and provides a route of investigation for the student; hence, it is necessary to evaluate how the absence of that first incision will affect the thought experiment [22, 23] . If cadaveric dissection becomes obsolete, does this mean we are divesting students of intangible devices of imagination?

[28] highlighted the need for cadaveric dissection which helps to incorporate a plethora of useful skills that are critical to the development of a student across the spectrum of medical education. Dissection enables a medical student to appreciate the concept of variability and prepares them to accept the anatomical minutiae as they present themselves in the dissected body, rather than developing a narrow vision or fixed attitude, which is the case when they come across anatomy in the form of reconstructed images. Dissection also encourages a student to trust his/her own observation skills, thereby reflecting upon individual learning and critical thinking which are key ingredients toward building clinical ability. Furthermore, the dissection laboratory also offers an opportunity to hone communication skills within peer groups, which could be beneficial later on in students' careers while dealing with patients [29, 30] .",

To this end, many institutions have veered down the pathway of technological solutions, incorporating web-based and immersive virtual reality simulators, eAutopsy, and/or video teleconferencing of lives cases [42] [43] [44] . These alternatives have proven to be especially useful in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases as they allow for the training of brain autopsy when the availability of real specimens is limited [42] . Similarly, the study conducted by Talmon et al. [44] reinforced the effectiveness of the eAutopsy but highlighted the apparent lack in emotional impact and hands-on experience. In terms of the medico-legal field, training on web-based simulators has provided users with a logical approach to execute investigation and interpret forensic findings [43] . Moreover, through novel imaging modalities, pathology can now be examined at the molecular level, eliminating the need to dissect the corpse, and replacing anatomic pathology with molecular pathology [45] .",

In fact, Yasinski [47] reported the ensuing necessity of autopsy amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the potentially renewed respect for the pathologist's work. To date, several COVID-19 autopsy registries have been established worldwide to help gain knowledge about this new virus and to facilitate global pandemic control [48] . In light of the variable pathologicalmorphological presentation in COVID-19-related deaths, one particular autopsy study proposed a four-level classification scheme to account for this variability in deaths [49] . Along with the creation of an effective disease catalogue, as a HG3 pathogen, investigation of COVID-19-related deaths also requires focus on risk assessment, interpretation of the findings, universal precautions, and standard operating procedures [47, 50, 51] . Hence, the return and practice of autopsy may be the key to demystify the underlying mechanisms causing organ injury of COVID-19-related cases, thus developing clinical management and effective treatment strategies, with the ultimate goal of decreasing mortality.",
