            "text": "The European Commission (EC)'s Horizon 2020 framework program introduced Public Procurements for Innovative Solutions (PPI) and Pre-Commercial Procurements (PCP) [4, 5] . These initiatives allow researchers and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to collaborate in understanding health and care priorities and thereby allow focusing on new areas of product and solution development [6] . By promoting innovation on the demand side and orienting development towards unmet needs, innovative procurements avoid costs from unnecessary functionalities, prevent lock-in to a single vendor, and take into account the long-term needs of the public sector [7] . Addressing the needs of an ageing population translates into supporting independent living at home, self-management of age-related conditions and the reduction of isolation. Such a proactive, user-centred system requires citizens to take greater responsibility for their health and well-being, by providing information on their health status and adherence to healthy lifestyles in order to stay active and healthy as long as possible [8] . Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disorder, affecting a third of the adult worldwide population [9] . Hypertension often occurs in the absence of symptoms, contributing to low awareness among the affected population. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease, and represents a major cause of premature death worldwide [10] . Proactive management of hypertension is key in limiting the increasing resources required to address the complications of hypertension by health and social care systems [11] . All of this requires an integrated approach to enable the more effective delivery of care and to address the complexity of the different services that patients navigate [12] . It is widely recognised that health care systems must shift from reactive disease management to health promotion and disease prevention, from a focus on disease to a focus on an individual's wellbeing, and from fragmentation to integration of services along the continuum of care [13] . This shift can be supported by an ever-increasing volume of health data. Making this data available to patients and healthcare professionals (HCP) and the adoption of digital solutions is critical to the continuous improvement of diagnosis, treatment, and personalization of care [14, 15] . Patient engagement is seen as a global concept that encompasses adherence, compliance, empowerment, health literacy, shared decision-making, and activation. Shared decision-making tools can empower patients in their disease management decisions, as well as online platforms which can support patients in communicating with their peers and health professionals, promoting self-management and health literacy [16] . Digitally supported health coaching interventions improve patients' motivation to change their behaviours, promoting goals and reducing health risks [17] . The European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP on AHA) [18] has developed a Blueprint on the Digital Transformation of Health and Care in Europe [19] to facilitate the exploitation of digital solutions addressing the unmet needs of the target population, based on the \"personas\" user-centred approach [20] .",

The five procurers then launched a Call for Tenders that was published on the project website and in the EU official journal. The competitive development of the solutions is articulated in three phases: The purpose of this article is to describe the approach adopted to set up the specifications for a value-based research and development services procurement for the purpose of integrated management of hypertension. Thereby, it takes into account the related state-of-the-art on the demand and supply side of digital health market, and the unmet needs of patients and health systems of the HSMonitor regions.",

On the part of the health system and healthcare professionals, clinical information systems and decision support tools play a key role. The patient draws on self-management support from community resources. It is the productive interactions between the two sides of the model which lead to improved health outcomes [21] . According to the desirable components for an effective chronic disease management identified by the CCM, a proactive health care team has been identified to communicate regularly with self-activated hypertension patients [22] [23] [24] [25] . Based on this integrated management model, the HSMonitor procurers established a framework for requirements and solution design that consists of nine building blocks (Figure 1 ), divided into three domains: (a) service delivery, (b) devices and integration, and (c) health care organisation. The building blocks represent areas where HSMonitor procurers intend to provide significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art through innovative digital solutions.",

The platform should facilitate the finding of training partners (R9.23), sharing of the data from (e.g., scores from the shared care plan)(R9.24) and creation of thematic user self-help groups (R9.25). The community platform should incorporate trust concepts to help identify users (patients or professionals) that often share good quality advice (R9.26), and rate content (R9.28).

The proposed approach considers patient and HCP as equal partners in the HSMonitor care planning and delivery, resulting in a digitally enabled integrated approach, engaging the citizen in leading healthy lifestyles while receiving comprehensive, individualized treatment in close collaboration with healthcare professionals. HSMonitor also provides the opportunity to target persons at risk of developing hypertension through personalized decision support, education, and coaching that are pivotal to avoid or delay disease onset and progression. Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease, and although relatively easy ease to treat, it shows heterogeneous outcomes that are influenced by educational background, ethnicity, and age that, for example, can hinder access to primary care [29] . mHealth solutions such as HSMonitor can play a crucial role in addressing some of these inequalities, providing the opportunity for remote management and telemonitoring that have already proved effective for such patients. Further efforts should be devoted to overcome the elements preventing a broader use of mHealth solutions: the approach provided by innovative procurements offers the opportunity to customize tools towards user-friendly, interoperable solutions that can also support, locally, the integration of multiple data sources (e.g., from EHRs, patient-held data, data from genetic testing, data from wearables and smart scales) and improve diagnostic-therapeutic planning in terms of outcomes, cost and quality of life for patients and quality of work for professionals.",
