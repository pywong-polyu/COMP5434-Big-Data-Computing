Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the patients who underwent bronchoscopy from December 2018 to November 2019 in Tongji Hospital. The patients with positive tuberculosis culture or positive GeneXpert in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were selected as the case group, and those without tuberculosis served as the control group. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of LAMP, GeneXpert, culture, smear microscopy, TSPOT, and TBAg/PHA ratio. Results: For the patients with positive cultures as case, the sensitivity of LAMP, GeneXpert, smear microscopy, TSPOT and TBAg/PHA ratio was 73.49%, 89.16%, 25.30%, 80.00%, 33.85%, respectively, the specificity was 99.00%, 100.00%, 99.00%, 86.00%, 100.00%, respectively, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.849, 0.938, 0.633, 0.830, 0.669, respectively. For the patients with positive GeneXpert as case, the sensitivity of LAMP, mycobacterial culture, smear microscopy, TSPOT and TBAg/PHA ratio was 73.20%, 74.23%, 22.68%, 68.92%, 29.73%, respectively, the specificity was 99.00%, 100.00%, 99.00%, 86.00%, 100.00%, respectively, the AUC was 0.853, 0.878, 0.623, 0.775, 0.649, respectively. Conclusion: The sensitivity of GeneXpert was best. The sensitivity and diagnostic value of LAMP were slightly lower than those of GeneXpert, and were similar to tuberculosis culture. The sensitivity of smear microscopy was low. The specificity of TSPOT was low. When TBAg/PHA ratio >0.2 was used as a diagnostic index, the specificity was improved, but the sensitivity was low.",

According to the report of WHO, tuberculosis is one of the ten leading causes of death. Before the outbreak of COVID-19, it had surpassed HIV/AIDS as the leading cause of death from a single infectious disease [1] . About a quarter of the world's population has been infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis, with a lifetime risk of 10%-15% of developing tuberculosis. China has the second highest burden of tuberculosis, accounting for about 9% of the world's annual cases [2] . For a long time, the diagnosis of tuberculosis has been dependent on traditional smear microscopy and culture techniques. The sensitivity of smear microscopy is poor. And it cannot exclude other mycobacteria. The time for culture is too long, which cannot meet the need for early diagnosis.",

In recent years, many researches have been devoted to the development of molecular diagnostic techniques for tuberculosis. The nucleic acid amplification technology (NAAT), a most common kind of molecular diagnostic technology has developed rapidly. GeneXpert is a NAAT method recommended by WHO for tuberculosis diagnosis and rifampicin resistance screening. A half-set of realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification technology is used in GeneXpert to automatically extract deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and amplify rpoB genes [4] . More than 95% of rifampicin resistant strains had rpoB gene variation, so that drugresistant strains could be identified simultaneously [4] . However, GeneXpert requires sophisticated laboratory facilities and severe environmental conditions. Hence it is difficult to develop in the underdeveloped areas in China. Another mycobacterium tuberculosis NAAT technology is called tuberculosis loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) which is invented by Notomi in 2000 [5] . LAMP is a fast, simple and effective method for DNA amplification. It can accurately amplify several strands of DNA several times in an hour [6] . The current tuberculosis LAMP application is based on the amplification of target gene gyrB and IS6110 of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex [7] . LAMP is convenience, economy and energy saving. Thus, it can be widely used, especially in countries or regions with lagging resources [8] . However, there are few diagnostic researches on LAMP in China.",

In addition, acid-fast staining positive specimen may also be non-mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium leprae [15] . In this study, the specificity of the smear microscopy of bronchoscopy lavage fluid was high in the positive culture group the same as that of the positive GeneXpert group, but the sensitivity was very low, only 20%-30%, which was similar to the previous research [16] . Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture is the gold standard in the diagnosis of tuberculosis at present. A study showed that in the sputum smearnegative suspected tuberculosis patients, the sensitivity of bronchoalveolar lavage mycobacterium tuberculosis culture was 57.1% [17] . Our study showed that the sensitivity of bronchoalveolar lavage mycobacterium tuberculosis culture was 74.23% in GeneXpert-positive patients. The biggest drawback of tuberculosis culture is the long culture cycle, which can't meet the needs of clinical diagnosis. The median time for mycobacterium tuberculosis culture in our study was 21 days.",

In recent years, the World Health Organization has recommended molecular diagnostic methods such as GeneXpert to promote the diagnosis of tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis [18] . A result of a multicenter study using mycobacterium tuberculosis culture as the diagnostic criteria suggested that the sensitivity and specificity of GeneXpert were 92.2% and 99.2% respectively [19] . Another study on the diagnostic efficacy in some countries and regions has shown that GeneXpert, as a preliminary screening method for suspected mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, had a total sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 98% [20] . Studies have suggested that the sensitivity and specificity of GeneXpert may be decreased in smearnegative patients and HIV patients [21] . The sensitivity of GeneXpert in smear-negative patients was about 68%, but the specificity was more than 97% [21] . In different studies, the sensitivity of GeneXpert in the detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is different, which varies from 81% to 97%. In addition, GeneXpert can be used to confirm culturenegative tuberculosis [22, 23] . In our study, the sensitivity of GeneXpert was 89.16% when positive tuberculosis culture was taken as the standard, which was consistent to the results of previous studies.",

A recent meta-analysis showed that its detection sensitivity and specificity of sputum specimens were similar to those of GeneXpert [26] . However, there are few studies about the LAMP method in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to detect mycobacterium tuberculosis. A research in China comparing LAMP with tuberculosis culture included a total of 51 clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients, and found that the positive rate of LAMP method in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pulmonary tuberculosis patients was 54.9%, significantly higher than 5.9% for acid-fast smear and 35.3% for mycobacterial culture [27] . In our study, the sensitivity and specificity of LAMP in the detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were 73% and 99% respectively. Its diagnostic value was also similar to that of tuberculosis culture method, slightly lower than that of GeneXpert. LAMP has low requirements for equipment and environment. Besides, it showed high stability, even those technicians who have no experience in molecular biology experiments can operate it skillfully. It is fast, simple, economical and efficient.",

GeneXpert has the best sensitivity, diagnostic value, and can complete drug resistance tests simultaneously. But it's expensive and requires advanced laboratory equipment and is not yet widely available. LAMP is economical and fast, and its sensitivity and specificity are slightly lower than those of GeneXpert, which is similar to those of mycobacterial culture. LAMP is worth promoting, especially in settings where GeneXpert is not available and where drug-resistance is not of concern. The sensitivity of blood TSPOT in the positive culture tuberculosis patients was higher than that of positive GeneXpert tuberculosis patients. In general, the specificity of blood TSPOT was low. When TBAg/PHA ratio >0.2 was used as a diagnostic index, the specificity was improved, but the sensitivity was low. The combination of all approaches can help to improve the detection of tuberculosis, but it also increases the costs. In clinical practice, detection techniques can be selected or utilized comprehensively according to their advantages and the local medical conditions.",
