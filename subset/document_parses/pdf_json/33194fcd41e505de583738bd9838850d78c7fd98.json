More specifically, we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models, where the transmission rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub-populations; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups. We content, that contact between infected and susceptible individuals, especially during the early phases of an epidemic, takes place over a (possibly diffused) boundary between the respective subpopulations. As a result, the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead. The intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells, in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub-populations. We validate the hypothesis of fractional exponents i) by numerical simulation for disease propagation in graphs imposing a local structure to allowed disease transmissions and ii) by fitting the model to a",

The justification for such a model stems from the fact that, at least during the initial phase of an epidemic, infection propagates outwards from infected cells to the general population. In such a scenario, where for instance S(t) I(t) (much greater), the boundary of infected cells which would roughly account for most new infections, scales as a fractional power \u03b3 < 1 of the area of the cells, hence I(t) \u03b3 . In actuality, due to the diffusive nature of infection-propagation amongst the general population, the exponent is expected to be larger than 1/2, as it would be in the continuous limit when the boundary is a smooth curve. Moreover, at least in the early phases of an epidemic, the exponent of S(t), which is significantly larger than I(t) may turn out to be negligible.",

In the model, the parameters a and b quantify anabolism (growth) and catabolism (death), respectively. Equation (3) may be interpreted as asserting that the net growth rate of an organism results from the balance of synthetic and degradative mechanisms. While the rate of the former process follows a law of allometry (i.e., the rate is proportional to the volume V (t) via a power function), the rate of the latter process scales linearly with V (t). It is important to note that the two special cases of (3), (i) power law b = 0, and (ii) second-type growth \u03bb = 2/3 have already been successfully applied to describe tumor growth [15] , [6] . The general case, 0 < \u03bb < 1, was introduced in [14] to explain the self-seeding hypothesis. Moreover, an important geometrical interpretation was provided in [13] , [2] . In these works, the authors relate the exponent \u03bb = d/3 to the fractional Hausdorff dimension of the proliferative tissue, where d denotes the fractal dimension of the tissue. Moreover, the model (3) has been derived mechanistically by linking tumor growth to metabolic rate and vascularization [8] .",

To this end, we seek to explain the origin of fractional power in (2) by i) numerical experiments, and ii) fitting such models to data sets. Specifically, with respect to i), we postulate a discrete model where infection propagates over nodes of a network. The network, representing individuals, is not planar (in general), yet it is immersed in R 2 . While (physically) neighboring nodes may be densely connected, precluding the graph from being planar, the likelihood of being connected as well as infecting each other depends on their physical distance. It is observed that such models lead to fractional exponents in the transmission rate, in agreement with (2) . With regard to ii), we have also numerically studied data on recent COVID-19 epidemic that is available at [5] . For this dataset, as we note in the results, the exponent \u03b3 in (2) ranges from about 0.6 to 0.8, which is similar to the empirically determined exponent of the NSM model.",

Contagion takes place at the boundary of infected cells and as a result it is the topology of the distribution of infected cells that dictate the spread. An analogous situation takes place in tumor growth, where models suggest (see [3] , [12] , [14] ) fractional exponent for the contribution of tumor volume, as this more accurately captures the size of the boundary that affects growth. Thus, based on an analogous rationale, we propose a fractionalpower alternative, fSIR, to the standard SIR model of disease dynamics. The value of exponents depend on a number of factors including the nature of the boundary between infected cells and the general susceptible population. Specifically, the exponent relates to the level mixing between infected and healthy individuals at interface between the two sub-populations, and may be quantified by the diameter of the graph that represents contacts between individuals.",

Several limitations of our experiment are noted. Firstly, the value of I(t) is only an estimated value since recording of all infected individuals is not guaranteed. Secondly, the value of \u2206I(t) is estimated as being the difference I(t) \u2212 I(t \u2212 1); we cannot take into account individuals who may have recovered.
