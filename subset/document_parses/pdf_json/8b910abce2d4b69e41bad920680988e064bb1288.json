[2] [3] [4] On the other hand, the empirical reproductive ratio of new cases per time unit divided by cases during the preceding time unit (R e ) is a directly observable epidemiologic correlate of disease dynamics in the real world. 5 In the early course of a pandemic caused by a novel pathogen, little is known about issues such as the timing of infectiousness and generation of new cases. Thus only measures such as R e are available to inform policymakers for decision making and justifying the introduction or lifting of interventions that may reduce disease spread but that may come at substantial social and economic costs. 2, 3 Governments worldwide have taken unprecedented measures to slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 3, 6 It has been suggested that the pandemic might be particularly detrimental in less-developed countries. 7 However, empirical evidence on whether COVID-19 net reproduction is higher in disadvantaged countries is lacking.",

The purpose of the present study was 2-fold, namely to explore the global pattern of observed R e values during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyse if COVID-19 transmission dynamics as measured by R e are less controlled in socio-economically disadvantaged countries, which could result in a vicious cycle leading to yet greater inequality and hampered socio-economic development.",

[12] [13] [14] [15] In brief, the World Bank provides access to a large compilation of socio-economic country-level indicators but also incorporates health-related data. This encompasses data of the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database, which is based on a regularly conducted questionnaire study and provides estimates of health expenditures per capita 16 ; data of the WHO Global Health Workforce Statistics, which estimates the number of physicians per population, based on a standardized national reporting framework 17 ; data on maternal mortality from a joint study of multinational organizations 18 ; data on fertility rates, combining information collected from the United Nations Population Division, the United Nations Statistical Division and national and international statistical offices; data on the mortality rate of children <5 y of age estimated by the Group for Child Mortality Estimation, a cooperation of international agencies (www.childmortality.org); standardized and comparable data on the prevalence of child malnutrition based on the joint child malnutrition estimates provided by the United Nations Children's Fund, the WHO and the World Bank. Household size data were estimated by the United Nations based on a compilation of censuses and household surveys. The country-level burden of disability-adjusted life years was derived by the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, which estimated these measures based on a multitude of sources, for example, survey data, inpatient admission records and health insurance claims. 19 The World Bank Gini coefficient was calculated by the World Bank Development Research Group and provides an esti-mate of how income is distributed among the population of a country; a Gini coefficient of 0 implies perfect equality, whereas a Gini coefficient of 100 implies perfect inequality.",

Since the R e values within each country are not independent measurements, but are less correlated the more time has elapsed between two measurements, a continuous autocorrelated error structure was used to correctly estimate regression parameters and confidence intervals (CIs). 22 All models were fit using the robust time period as the time scale.

The association of each indicator with R e was estimated by including a categorical predictor defined by its tertiles in the regression model. This approach was taken to allow for non-linear associations, while avoiding problems with too small numbers in each category. Based on exploratory results of the time trends, these models were restricted to the data beyond the 28th robust day, when R e estimates within country appeared stable and there were no significant time trends left.",

The exponentiated coefficient then indicates the ratio of the average R e in the highest vs lowest tertile. For example, an exponentiated coefficient of 1.5 would mean that the average R e in the highest tertile is 50% higher than in the lowest tertile (i.e. COVID-19 transmission is less controlled in the highest tertile). As shown in Table 1 , the effect estimates of most development indicators analysed featured CIs excluding the null effect. The direction of every single association was consistent with a higher R e in more disadvantaged countries, regardless of whether indicators relevant to health infrastructure, disease burden or other aspects of human well-being and development were considered. For example, the average R e in countries in the highest tertile of average household size was 24% higher than in the countries in the lowest household size tertile. The strongest association was seen for extreme poverty prevalence, where the highest tertile was associated with a 29% higher average R e . In contrast, for indicators such as gross domestic product or health expenditure per capita, the highest tertile was consistently associated with a lower average R e (\u221213% and \u221215%, respectively, for these examples).

Months into the COVID-19 pandemic, transmission dynamics as estimated by the 7-d R e remained less controlled in socio-economically disadvantaged countries, which is worrisome on numerous levels. The steep decline in observed R e during the first weeks of the pandemic spread of COVID-19 probably cannot be explained entirely by altered transmission dynamics per se, given the minute intervention effect estimates compared with the overall time trends. In a recent interrupted time-series analysis of an earlier version of the Government Response Tracker dataset, the introduction of physical distancing reduced COVID-19 incidence by 13%. 6 As most interventions were introduced early during the pandemic (Supplemental Figure S3 ), when observed R e showed a strongly negative correlation with time, time and intervention effects may be hard to disentangle in a reliable way. This is also supported by the smallest p-values being observed for implausibly short time lags in the present study, although immediate impacts on the epidemic curve have also been described by others. 23 Given the altogether small proportion of the population that presumably had experienced disease during the first few months of the pandemic, 7 the time trends also cannot be explained by a depletion of susceptible individuals due to acquired immunity. The consistent early R e declines presumably result from a complex interplay of behavioural changes-partially caused by formal interventions-with increasing awareness, testing and reporting yielding more and more complete denominators.",

Differences between the different indicators should not be overinterpreted and longitudinal microdata are needed to better understand the detailed causal relationships producing these patterns. Some additional remarks are nonetheless warranted. The rather general indicators of socio-economic prosperity, such as gross domestic product per capita, median age and life expectancy, consistently showed a positive association with disease control. On a structural level, this may reflect the general challenge of public health authorities needing sufficient resources to implement pertinent interventions, 25 and the R e was also significantly lower in the countries with higher health expenditures and more physicians per population. On an individual level, economic disadvantages are associated with reduced compliance with shelter-inplace protocols, even in highly developed settings. 26 Average household size is a development indicator that has a particularly close link to infectious disease transmission processes. 27 Household studies have been conducted for COVID-19 and found a substantially elevated risk of infection of household contacts. 28 The present results also showed that populations already experiencing a higher burden of poverty-related ill health struggle more with controlling COVID-19, i.e. the R e remained higher in countries with more disability-adjusted life years lost due to communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional disease or higher mortality rates for children <5 y of age and maternal mortality ratios. Apart from average household size, the strongest associations with higher R e were observed for more prevalent extreme poverty and for greater economic inequality as measured by the World Bank Gini coefficient. Interestingly, a similar association has recently been described for the state-level Gini coefficient with COVID-19 incidence and mortality in Brazil. 29 All these aspects of development, health and well-being are highly interrelated and the associations should not be interpreted as indicating causal relationships.",
