The model divided a community into subpopulations composed of young and elder persons considering a higher risk of fatality among elder persons with severe CoViD-19. From the data collected in S\u00e3o Paulo State, we estimated the transmission and additional mortality rates. Based on the estimated model parameters, we calculated the basic reproduction number R 0 , and we retrieved the number of deaths due to CoViD-19, which was three times lower than those found in the literature. Considering isolation as a control mechanism, we varied the isolation rates in the young and elder subpopulations to assess the epidemiological impacts. The epidemiological scenarios focused mainly on evaluating the reduction in the number of severe CoViD-19 cases and deaths due to this disease when isolation is introduced in a population.",

In mathematical modeling, there is a threshold (see Anderson & May, 1991) called the basic reproduction number denoted by R 0 , which is the secondary cases produced by one case introduced in a completely susceptible population. When a control mechanism is introduced, this number decreases and is called the reduced reproduction number R r . Ferguson et al. (2020) proposed a model to investigate the effects on the CoViD-19 epidemic when susceptible persons are isolated. They analysed two scenarios called mitigation and suppression. Roughly, mitigation decreases the reduced reproduction number R r , but not lower than one (1 < R r < R 0 ), while suppression decreases the reduced reproduction number lower than one (R r < 1). They predicted the numbers of severe cases and deaths due to CoViD-19 without control measure and compared them with those numbers when isolation (mitigation and suppression) is introduced as control measures. Li et al. discussed the role of undocumented infections (Li et al., 2020) .",

Using b = 0.153 in S\u00e3o Paulo State (SEADE-Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Sistema Estadual, 2020), we obtained \u03d5 = 6.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 days \u22121 , hence, N y (0) = N 0y = 37.8 \u00d7 10 6 (s 0 y = N 0y /N 0 = 0.847) and N o (0) = N 0o = 6.8 \u00d7 10 6 (s 0 o = N 0o /N 0 = 0.153).

For other variables, using p y = 0.8 and m y = 0.8 from Table 2 , the ratios asymptomatic:symptomatic and mild:severe (non-hospitalized:hospitalized) CoViD-19 are 4:1. To set up initial conditions, we may use as an approximation these same ratios for elder persons, even though p o and m o are slightly different. Hence, if we assume that there is one person in D 2o (the first confirmed case in the elder subpopulation), then there are four persons in Q 2o . The sum 5 is the number of persons in class D 1o , implying that there are 20 in class A o ; hence, the sum 25 is the number of persons in class E o . Finally, we suppose that no one is isolated or tested and also immunized. We assume that the young subpopulation's initial conditions are equal to those assigned to the elder subpopulation.

From Figs 8 and 9, the difference between percentages of I/S(0) and S(180)/S(0) is the percentage of all persons who harbor the new coronavirus. Hence, the second wave of the epidemic will be triggered after elapsed a very long period of waiting for the accumulation of susceptible persons to surpass its critical number (Yang, 1998 (Yang, , 2001 ). Simulating the system of equations (2), (3) and (4) Let us estimate roughly the critical number of susceptible persons S th from equation (11). For R 0 = 6.915, we have S th = 6.450 \u00d7 10 6 . Hence, for S\u00e3o Paulo State, isolating 38.15 million (85.5% ) or above persons is necessary to avoid the epidemic's outbreak. The number of young persons is 3.5 million, less than the threshold number of isolated persons to guarantee the eradication of the CoViD-19 epidemic. Another rough estimation is for the isolation rate of susceptible person \u03b7 2 , letting \u03b7 3 = 0 in equation (12), resulting in \u03b7 th = 2.19 \u00d7 10 \u22124 days \u22121 , for R 0 = 6.915.

Hence, one of the curves shown in Fig. 10 may correspond to the isolation applied to S\u00e3o Paulo State.",

Figure 12 shows the curves of accumulated cases of severe CoViD-19 \u03a9 j , for young (a) and elder (b) subpopulations, without and with isolation for different values of \u03b7 2 . As the isolation rate \u03b7 2 increases, the accumulated number of severe CoViD-19 cases \u03a9 decreases. For instance, at t = 180 days, for \u03b7 2 = 0, the accumulated numbers of patients in the young (first coordinate) and elder (second coordinate) subpopulations are (1.799 \u00d7 10 6 ,5.632 \u00d7 10 5 ), for \u03b7 2 = 0.01 we have (1.278 \u00d7 10 6 ,4.065 \u00d7 10 5 ), and for \u03b7 2 = 0.035, (0.323 \u00d7 10 6 ,1.135 \u00d7 10 5 ).

At t = 180 days, for \u03b7 2 = 0, the accumulated numbers of deaths in the young (first coordinate) and elder (second coordinate) subpopulations are (1.604 \u00d7 10 4 ,6.298 \u00d7 10 4 ), for \u03b7 2 = 0.01 we have (1.14 \u00d7 10 4 ,4.546 \u00d7 10 4 ), and for \u03b7 2 = 0.035, (0.2921 \u00d7 10 4 ,1.268 \u00d7 10 4 ).

Again, this phenomenon is understood recalling the rubella transmission model (Yang, 2001) . As the vaccination rate increases, the fraction of susceptible persons decreases following damped oscillations when R r > 1, attaining the non-trivial equilibrium point. However, for R r < 1, the trivial equilibrium point is an attractor, and the trajectories follow two patterns: (a) if R r is not so low, the fraction of susceptible persons decreases to lower values than the trivial equilibrium point and takes increasing trend to attain the equilibrium value, but not surpassing it (then there is not damped oscillations); and (b) if R r is low, the fraction of susceptible persons decays exponentially and tends to the equilibrium point. Figure 15 shows the curves of the number of isolated susceptible persons S is j , for young (a) and elder (b) subpopulations, for different values of \u03b7 2 , from equation (9). At t = 180 days, for \u03b7 2 = 0, there are not isolated persons, for \u03b7 2 = 0.01, the numbers of isolated young (first coordinate) and elder (second coordinate) persons are (1.091 \u00d7 10 7 ,1.885 \u00d7 10 6 ), and for \u03b7 2 = 0.035, (3.086 \u00d7 10 7 ,5.415 \u00d7 10 6 ).

The decreasing pattern in curve D 2y follows that observed in regime 1. Still, in the pattern of the curve D 2o , as \u03b7 2y increases, the epidemic peaks displace faster to the right. The curves become more asymmetric (increased skewness) and spread beyond the curve without isolation.

Still, the decreasing sigmoid shaped curves of S o , as \u03b7 2y increases, move from bottom to top, which is an opposite pattern to that observed in regime 1. As the isolation in the young subpopulation increases, the number of susceptible young persons decreases, but the number of susceptible elder persons increases. However, from Fig. 17 , severe CoViD-19 cases drop for both subpopulations. This can be explained by the decrease in the number of immunized persons: young immune persons decrease 41 times when \u03b7 2y decreases from 0.015 to 0.1, while elder persons decrease 4 times (see Table 3 ). When \u03b7 2y = 0.1, the susceptible elder persons approach an asymptote at t = 500 days (calendar time, July 10, 2021).",

Using equation (A.15), we obtain 1/R 0 = 0.1446. Clearly, s * is not the inverse of the basic reproduction number R 0 , and f (s * , s * y , s * o ) in equation (A.15) is not s * = s * y + s * o , neither R 0y s * y +R 0o s * o . The analysis of the non-trivial equilibrium point to find f (s * , s * y , s * o ) is left to further work. To understand this question, we suppose that the new coronavirus is circulating in non-communicating young and elder subpopulations, then young and elder subpopulations approach to s * y = 1/R 0y = 0.178 and s * o = 1/R 0o = 0.764 at steady state (non-trivial equilibrium point P * ). But, the new coronavirus is circulating in homogeneously mixed young and elder subpopulations (this is an assumption of the model). Using equation (1), we calculate the forces of infection \u03bb 1 = (\u03b2 1y A y + \u03b2 2y D 1y )/N (contribution due to infectious young persons), \u03bb 2 = (\u03b2 1o A o + \u03b2 2o D 1o )/N (elder persons) and \u03bb = \u03bb 1 + \u03bb 2 (both 30 H.

However, the second estimation method provided 3.3 times lower for fatalities due to CoViD-19, hence the difference relays mainly in the estimation method for the additional mortality rates. 5 Suppose the currently adopted lockdown is indeed based on the goal of decreasing hospitalized CoViD-19 cases. In that case, our model agrees since it predicts that a higher number of young and elder persons must be isolated to achieve this objective. However, if the goal is to reduce the number of deaths due to CoViD-19, elder persons must be isolated in a higher number than young persons. Remember that in mixed young and elder subpopulations, the infection is much harmful in the elder than in young persons, which is a reason to avoid contact between them. Optimal rates of isolation in young and elder subpopulations to reduce both CoViD-19 cases and deaths can be obtained by optimal control theory (Thom\u00e9 et al., 2009) .",
