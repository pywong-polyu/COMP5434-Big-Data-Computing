It is possible much of lexical diffusion happens via the changing rates of existing word categories or concepts (those that are already being used, at least to some extent, regularly) rather than new ones. In this study we introduce a new metric, contrastive lexical diffusion (CLD) coefficient, which attempts to measure the degree to which ordinary language (here clusters of common words) catch on over friendship connections over time. For instance topics related to meeting and job are found to be sticky, while negative thinking and emotion, and global events, like 'school orientation' were found to be less sticky even though they change rates over time. We evaluate CLD coefficient over both quantitative and qualitative tests, studied over 6 years of language on Twitter. We find CLD predicts the spread of tweets and friendship connections, scores converge with human judgments of lexical diffusion (r=0.92), and CLD coefficients replicate across disjoint networks (r=0.85). Comparing CLD scores can help understand lexical diffusion: positive emotion words appear more diffusive than negative emotions, first-person plurals (we) score higher than other pronouns, and numbers and time appear non-contagious.",

Building on models of disease contagion, which are often seen as dichotomous events (infection or not), much of such work focuses on the diffusion of new terms (i.e. the term is either present or not for an individual). For example, researchers have analyzed lexical emergence in Twitter [15, 16] , investigated the history of language borrowing between cultures [20] , and characterized relationship of lexical influence across demographics and geography [10] . In such studies, language change is operationalized as a process of introducing and spreading new lexical innovations. Few have studied the spread of ordinary language (i.e. that which most people of a particular language use on a regular basis; example given in Figure 1 ), which leaves a gap in our understanding of diffusion.",

We evaluate this method by applying it to common clusters of words in social media, calculating the CLD coefficient of ordinary LDA topics. Evaluation is facilitated through showing the CLD coefficient (a single feature) is by itself quite predictive for many tasks such as like and retweet prediction as well as guess whether pairs of nodes are friends, in addition to agreement with human judges. Finally, we extend the model to other categories of language, the lexical Inquiry and Word Count categories and examining which common categories are more likely to spread among friends.",

However, there are some exceptions. For example, frequency has been used to estimate latent trajectories of phenomena [31] and to capture differing semantics across geographical regions [27] , but both of these are fundamentally different tasks than contagion of a lexical phenomenon (we use trajectories as a baseline). In this paper, we took a rather unique path compared to the majority of the body of research: (1) we investigate language diffusion with focus on usage frequency of ordinary language units over people, and (2) we characterize language phenomena (here, clusters of common words) using social networks rather than characterizing networks/nodes using language.",

Temporality: the effect, current language (L c ), happens after the cause, friends' past language (F), in time. Plausibility: we show agreement with human judges. Coherence: there is no serious conflict with the relationship of people's language and that of their surroundings.

We first randomly select 500 users from twitter, separate from our train users, forming test group. Then, corresponding to each user we randomly pick two other users: a friend and a stranger. The task is to see if we can predict which of these two potential friends is the actual friend. Putting the emphasis on CLD score, we make this selection by utilizing the k topics with highest CLD scores, then calculate weighted Jaccard similarity of the test user's topic representation with each of his/her potential friends. The potential friend with higher Jaccard similarity, will be selected as the predicted friend of that test user.

For each pair of topics, annotators were shown the 10 most representative words from each, and asked to pick the topic that they assume to be more diffusive.

Human judgements cannot be considered a gold-standard due to cognitive biases and difficulty of the task. 6 Still, taken in the context of our previous objective evaluations, we consider human subjective judgements as a complimentary piece of evidence for whether our proposed metric is capturing diffusion. Specifically, the human task consisted of distinguishing the top and bottom 50 most diffusive topics. Here the inter-rater agreement, which is the average agreement of judges with each other is is 0.712 while the average agreement with majority vote is 0.828, This shows while the annotators are not compliant with each other, their individual agreement with majority is relatively high. Table 3 demonstrates how CLD coefficient compares to the majority vote from the human judgements and accurately identifies what the majority found more diffusive in 92% of the cases, outperforming the average accuracy of annotators which is 83%. We see that CLD coefficient is well-aligned with the human notion of lexical diffusion while Lexical Emergence (based on frequency) is not able to capture lexical diffusion. Since diffusion or stickiness might be seen slightly different in raters' minds, one might expect human judgement to be difficult to match based on the objectively defined CLD coefficient and ranking. However, by only comparing the top vs. bottom topics, in terms of CLD coefficient, we make the task coarser for humans to subjectively judge between sticky and non-sticky language.

While work on dissemination of language over social networks has begun to provide a rich understanding of lexical emergence, it has left a gap in understanding of diffusion as a frequency-based process covering changes in ordinary lexical units (rather than introduction of new lexical units). We evaluated our CLD coefficient against indicators of influence (retweets, likes, and spread), as well as for distinguishing friends from non acquaintances, and versus human judgments. While past studies showed friends language are similar to each other, we have deduced that such similarity is facilitated mostly among the most sticky topics. Comparing CLD score of topics with their personality scores revealed topics associated with emotionally stability are more probable to be more likely to spread through friends, while those characteristic of agreeableness and extroversion have less chance to stick in their friends language use. Furthermore, CLD coefficient of lexical categories suggested new lexical diffusion information such as positive emotion being more sticky than negative or plural first-person pronouns (e.g. we) being more likely to spread than singular first-persons (e.g. I) and second-persons (e.g. You). We see this introduction and evaluation of the novel CLD coefficient as enabling greater computational study of diffusion of the ordinary language.",

Red edge represents significant negative relationship, green edge represents significant positive relationship, and gray edge represents not significant relationship. In the context of all personality factors, emotionally stability scores were the most uniquely predictive of CLD coefficient while topics related to extraversion were less likely to be sticky in friendship communications. Five topics with high CLD coefficient (blue topics) vs. Five topics with low CLD coefficient (red topics): 'meeting', 'government', 'job', and 'donation' are among high CLD topics, while topics related to negative thinking and emotion, and global events, like 'school orientation' and 'thanksgiving' are among non-sticky ones.
