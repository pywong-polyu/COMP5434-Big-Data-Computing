The case is clinically consistent with a post-transplant recurrence of FSGS and the timing of recurrence in relation to immunization suggests a possible association. While this is an intriguing and plausible hypothesis, we caution an inference of causality. We would also be curious to know if patient developed a serologic response to the vaccine.",

While numerous potential culprits have been proposed, it is unclear if this factor is represented by an unidentified antibody against podocyte targets or a non-immunogenic permeability factor that leads to toxicity of the podocyte. As the authors note, a T-cell-mediated inflammatory response is hypothesized to facilitate potential vaccine-associated glomerular disease relapses. The mechanism linking T-cell response to proliferation of a potential circulating factor is uncertain. While theoretically possible that mRNA vaccination leads to downstream B-cell activation and autoantibody circulating factor production, the lack of similar reports in a setting of widespread vaccination in an at-risk population makes this unlikely.",
