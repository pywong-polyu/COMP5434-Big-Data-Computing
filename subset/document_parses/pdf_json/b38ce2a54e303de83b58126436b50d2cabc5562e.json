            "text": "Background: Due to active involvement with patients for COVID-19 treatments, nurses are susceptible to adverse psychological outcomes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the distress, studies have suggested that nurses are able to experience positive changes (i.e. posttraumatic growth; PTG) during the pandemic. Research on other populations has also indicated that COVID-19-specific worries and work-related coping resources are associated with people's positive changes during the pandemic. Objective: This study examined how socio-demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related worries, and work-related variables (satisfaction with work and workplace pandemic guidelines) were associated with PTG among nurses in Hong Kong. Methods: Nurses (N = 1510) working in hospitals and community settings were recruited through nursing associations in Hong Kong between 8 August 2020 and 22 September 2020. They were invited to complete a cross-sectional survey measuring their sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 worries, and satisfaction with work and workplace pandemic-control measures. Results: Results from hierarchical regressions found that those working non-full-time (\u03b2 = \u22120.06), affiliating with a religion (\u03b2 = 0.24), having higher COVID-19-related worries and psychological distress (\u03b2s ranging from 0.12-0.15), and having higher work satisfaction (\u03b2 = 0.14) were associated with higher PTG (ps < .05). Moreover, a significant interaction between psychological distress and satisfaction with workplace pandemic control guidelines emerged in explaining PTG (\u03b2 = 0.08, p < .05), such that guideline satisfaction was only associated with higher PTG among those with higher distress (\u03b2 = 0.09, p = .03), but not those with lower distress (\u03b2 = \u22120.05, p > .05). Conclusions: Nurses in Hong Kong did report positive changes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies could focus on the contributing factors of PTG to design for effective strategies to enhance resources for nurses to promote positive psychosocial outcomes.",

The coronavirus pandemic has become an international public health emergency, posing continuous threats to lives and healthcare systems worldwide. Since the first reported case on 23 January 2020, Hong Kong has reported 12,302 COVID-19 cases and 213 deaths as of 20 October 2021 (The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 2021). Studies have also found that the COVID-19 and its relevant pandemic control measures bring enormous psychological impacts (e.g. depression and anxiety) on the general populations in Hong Kong (Choi, Hui, & Wan, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Compared with prepandemic levels, the prevalence of anxiety has risen by 42.3% and depressive symptoms were found to have doubled under the COVID-19 pandemic (Zhao et al., 2020) . Those indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has been highly stressful for people in Hong Kong.",

            "text": "Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been growing attention towards the needs of healthcare workers. A recent quantitative study also indicated that 12.9% of healthcare workers in Hong Kong reported probable depression . Among the healthcare workers, nurses constitute the largest part of the healthcare workforce in an epidemic (Chau et al., 2021) . They usually undertake most of the tasks related to infectious disease containment and involve in much closer contact with patients, and spending longer time with patients than physicians (Hamama-Raz & Minerbi, 2019; Walton, Murray, & Christian, 2020) . Qualitative studies have found that local nurses report increased workload caring for patients at the hospitals, concerns about the sufficiency of protective equipment and isolation beds/wards at the workplace, worries about contracting COVID-19 and infecting their family members during the pandemic, plus difficulties in coping with rapidly changing pandemic control protocols (Chau et al., 2021; Cheung, Fong, & Bressington, 2020) . Another quantitative study in Hong Kong also found that nurses experienced high work stress during the COVID-19 pandemic (Kwok et al., 2021) . Such concerns were also observed from prior research on healthcare workers in Hong Kong coping with the pandemic situations of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2003 (Chan et al., 2005; Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, & Wong, 2005) and H1N1 in 2009 (Wong et al., 2010; Wong, Wong, Lee, Cheung, & Griffiths, 2011) . Similarly, nurses in Hong Kong are highly susceptible to distress brought forth by the COVID-19 pandemic situation and their job responsibilities.",

Prior research has examined PTG among those having experienced chronic health conditions, natural disasters, and man-made disasters (Zoellner & Maercker, 2006) , fewer studies explored that in the context of emerging infectious diseases. Recent studies have suggested that nurses and healthcare professionals in China, Taiwan, and Israel experienced PTG (Chen et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2021; .

Workplace arrangements also matter in employees' well-being during the pandemic.

Prior studies have suggested that the contributions of certain coping variables to people's well-being might differ according to people's stress perceptions. For example, in the context of chronic illnesses, among Chinese husbands of breast cancer survivors (Yeung, Zhang, Li, Lu, & Lu, 2020) , positive reframing was only associated with higher PTG among those with higher caregiving burden, but not those with lower caregiving burden. Similarly, among siblings of patients with schizophrenia, Avc\u0131o\u011flu and colleagues also found that the positive association between social support (as a coping resource) and subjective well-being was stronger at higher levels of stress appraisal for caregiving (Avc\u0131o\u011flu, Karanci, & Soygur, 2019) . Theorists have suggested that individuals might need to perceive the stressors as sufficiently threatening in order to challenge their worldview, elicit subsequent coping processes, and facilitate PTG (Creamer, Burgess, & Pattison, 1992; Janoff-Bulman, 1989) . It implies that some coping variables might facilitate PTG even more in the presence of higher distress. To the best of our knowledge, there are only limited studies exploring the moderating relationship between coping processes and stress perceptions in PTG among healthcare workers. This study attempted to examine if two coping resources (work satisfaction, satisfaction with workplace pandemic control guidelines) would interact with current distress in explaining PTG, such that the beneficial role of such coping resources in PTG would be stronger among nurses with higher level of current distress.",

All registered members of the Association of Hong Kong Nursing Staff (n = 16,500), the labour union of nurses in Hong Kong, were approached and invited to this study using their email contacts. This is one of the feasible ways to approach a representative population of nurses in Hong Kong . The selfadministered questionnaire was distributed to the nurses in an internet-based link along with an invitation email. An information sheet about the study was included at the beginning of the questionnaire, followed by an electronic consent form. The participants who agreed to join the study filled in the questionnaire on their own electronic devices. A reminder for participation in the survey was sent two weeks after the first invitation email. Responses from 1,566 participants were collected via the online platform. Among them, 56 did not fulfill the eligibility criteria (e.g. not being a nurse, being retired, or being a nursing student). The remaining 1,150 responses were retained in the analyses to represent working nurses (i.e. those working full-time or parttime in health care settings). The sample characteristics were also compared with local statistics of the nurse population to explore the potential selection bias. Although the response rate was low (1,510/ 16,500), the sociodemographic characteristics of this sample were highly matched to the nurse population in Hong Kong according to the latest statistics from Department of Health (Department of Health, 2016). After completing the questionnaire, participants received HKD$50 (approximately USD$6.43) for compensation of their time. The study was conducted between 8 August-22 September 2020 (when there were 5,059 diagnosed cases and 105 individuals dead from COVID-19 in Hong Kong) (The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 2021).

However, the score was lower than those reported in Chinese and Taiwanese nurses coping with the COVID-19 pandemic (Chen et al., 2020) and healthcare professionals in Spain (Moreno-Jimenez et al., 2021). Those findings imply that Hong Kong's relative success in combating COVID-19 (indicated by its lower COVID-19 incidence and death rates) may not have led nurses to experience more PTG in comparison to their health professionals in other countries. The discrepancies in the levels of PTG might be also attributed to the different time frames of the surveys, specific health service contexts, pandemic control measures in particular countries/regions, and individual's subjective appraisals about COVID-19-related stressors. More systematic investigations on the relative importance of those factors in contributing to healthcare workers' PTG are warranted. Consistent with prior studies, being affiliated with a religion was associated with PTG (Kucharska, 2020) . It has been suggested that religious beliefs may provide a framework to facilitate more positive reappraisal of threatening situations (e.g. less threat appraisal, more challenge appraisal), thereby revealing positive Table 3 .

One question that emerges in PTG research and in our own work is the possibility that some PTGI items (e.g. the Spiritual Change subscale) may overlap with variables like the affiliation of a religion. Among the PTGI subscales, we did find the Spiritual Change subscale reported the highest correlation with religious affiliation in our supplementary analysis. However, we also found that having a religious affiliation was significantly associated with the composite of PTG without the 'Spiritual change' subscale. It seemed to support that having a religious affiliation could also be associated with higher PTG in areas beyond the spirituality aspect. Age, years in the profession, marital status of the nurses were not significantly associated with their PTG Juri\u0161ov\u00e1, 2016; Peng et al., 2021) , implying that those variables did not significantly differ in the tendency to experience PTG. On the contrary, having full-time employment was associated with lower PTG. It is important to note that full-time and part-time nurses did not report significantly different level of distress, perhaps parttime employed individuals could have more time to process their nursing duties and stress experience, which might facilitate PTG. Additional resources might be necessary to facilitate growth among fulltime nurses.",

To better understand the potential causal relationships among the variables, future studies could examine how the independent variables at different time points could predict PTG using longitudinal designs. Second, we recruited nurses through nursing associations in Hong Kong using non-random sampling, where self-selected bias might be apparent. Comparable to response rates in some prior studies targeted at healthcare workers conducted online during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Alenazi et al., 2020; Ammar et al., 2020) , our response rate was low at 9.2% (1,510/16,500). Despite the low response rate, characteristics of this sample were highly matched to the nurse population in Hong Kong according to the latest statistics (Department of Health, 2016). Readers should note that the findings might not be fully generalizable to the nurses and healthcare professionals in other countries with different medical systems. Third, the model only explained a moderate proportion of variance in PTG, implying that other factors might be at play. For example, other intrapersonal coping resources (e.g. sense of coherence) (Ragger, Hiebler-Ragger, Herzog, Kapfhammer, & Unterrainer, 2019) , exposure to prior stressful events (Chi et al., 2020) have been found to be associated with higher PTG among healthcare workers. Considering these variables may increase the explanatory power of model. Fourth, some measures (e.g. COVID-19 distress, work-related stress) were newly developed for the context of COVID-19 and have yet to be fully validated in this population. However, specifically-developed items have been commonly used as predictors of mental health outcomes among different Asian populations during the COVID-19 pandemic (Choi et al., 2020; Lin, Hu, Alias, & Wong, 2020; Yeung et al., 2021) . Even though our self-developed scales reported satisfactory psychometric properties, validating our findings by measuring similar concepts (e.g. stress-related growth, work engagement) (Boals & Schuler, 2018; Fong & Ng, 2012) with other standardized scales is worthwhile.",

This study was also unique in the literature to reveal that satisfaction with workplace pandemic control guidelines contributed to PTG resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic only among those with higher distress. Practically, our findings implied that increasing work satisfaction might be important in enhancing PTG among nurses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Among those with higher psychological distress, it is also important to provide better pandemic control guidelines to facilitate PTG. Interventions that facilitate people's adjustments to work-related adversities in the context of COVID-19 should be designed. A recent study found that providing psychological interventions during the pandemic is beneficial to PTG among Chinese healthcare workers (Cui et al., 2021) . Outside the context of COVID-19, a positive psychology intervention (including psychoeducation, emotional management training, and group sharing sessions) has been found to be useful in promoting PTG among Chinese healthcare workers who have experienced a range of traumatic events (Xu et al., 2016) . It will be meaningful to see if such intervention could also facilitate PTG among healthcare professionals exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
