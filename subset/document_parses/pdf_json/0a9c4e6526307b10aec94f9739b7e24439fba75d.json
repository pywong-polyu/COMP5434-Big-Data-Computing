However, although considerable resources are invested in improving safety, patients still suffer avoidable harm. The aims of this study are: (1) to examine the extent, range, and nature of patient safety research activities carried out in the Republic of Ireland (RoI); (2) make recommendations for future research; and (3) consider how these recommendations align with the Health Service Executive's (HSE) patient safety strategy. A five-stage scoping review methodology was used to synthesise the published research literature on patient safety carried out in the RoI: (1) identify the research question; (2) identify relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) chart the data; and (5) collate, summarise, and report the results. Electronic searches were conducted across five electronic databases. A total of 31 papers met the inclusion criteria. Of the 24 papers concerned with measuring and monitoring safety, 12 (50%) assessed past harm, 4 (16.7%) the reliability of safety systems, 4 (16.7%) sensitivity to operations, 9 (37.5%) anticipation and preparedness, and 2 (8.3%) integration and learning. Of the six intervention papers, three (50%) were concerned with education and training, two (33.3%) with simplification and standardisation, and one (16.7%) with checklists. One paper was concerned with identifying potential safety interventions. There is a modest, but growing, body of patient safety research conducted in the RoI. It is hoped that this review will provide direction to researchers, healthcare practitioners, and health service managers, in how to build upon existing research in order to improve patient safety.",

There has been considerable investment in patient safety improvement efforts, for which there may be limited evidence of effectiveness [5] . It has been found that the majority of safety interventions tend to be person-focused (e.g. education and training), with more effective systems focused interventions far less commonplace [6] . Moreover, high-quality research on the effectiveness of safety intervention is lacking [5] . Therefore, there is a need for rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of interventions to ensure that they are having the desired effect, and the resources required to implement such interventions are justified. Crucially, given the recognised impact of context on intervention implementation and effectiveness, such assessments must be conducted within different healthcare systems and services [7] .",

The hierarchy of interventions was extended by Woods et al. [18] , who added three additional levels (staff organisation, risk assessment, learning from errors, and personal initiative) as this was deemed necessary in order to appropriately classify solutions to improving clinical communication and patient safety.

Six studies employed surveys to measure past harm. Two of these studies used surveys to estimate the frequency of a range of adverse events [19] and to examine nurse adverse event reporting rates [20] . Of the four remaining studies that used a survey design, two examined the association of burnout with self-reported medical error and poor-quality care [21, 22] , and two studies explored nurse incident reporting [23, 24] . Four studies measured past harm by retrospectively to reduce errors and to promote and ensure patient safety (e.g. intervention on improving attitudes towards patient safety) [15] reviewing patient records. Two of these record reviews were undertaken as part of the Irish National Adverse Events studies [1, 25] , and examined trends in adverse event rates in the Irish healthcare system. The two remaining record reviews were conducted to estimate the economic cost of nursesensitive adverse events [26] and to compare the health system performance of 15 Organisation for Economic Cooperation (OECD) countries across seven patient safety indicators [27] . Furthermore, one study used a combination of survey and interview methods to examine the nature and frequency of medical error among junior doctors [28] , and one study comprised a review of medico-legal claims to identify current adverse event reporting trends in Irish surgical specialties [29] .",

Ireland was below the mean for accidental puncture or laceration, and foreign body left in during procedure [27] \u2022 Across surgical specialties, the majority of reported adverse events occur in orthopaedic and general surgery (73% of all claims) [29] \u2022 Nurses and midwives report adverse events with a much greater frequency than doctors [29] \u2022 Reluctance to report adverse events is influenced by fears of retribution [23, 24] \u2022 A survey of junior doctors found that 60.5% of respondents reported making an error that \"played on their mind\" [28] \u2022 Burnout is associated with higher rates of self-reported medical error [21, 22] Reliability of safety critical processes \u2022 The use of surgical checklists was high in Ireland [30, 32] \u2022 Participating in Time Out as a team was reported as occurring in 57% of cases [30] \u2022 Although attitudes towards the effect of the checklist on safety and teamwork were positive [30, 31] , barriers to use such as lack of time were reported [30, 31] -particularly among nurses [31] Sensitivity to operations \u2022 Healthcare providers described the poor working conditions in the hospital, but also recognised the importance of teamwork and communication in maintaining patient safety and had a strong appetite for change regarding the safety culture in the hospital [34] \u2022 8-9% nurses gave their hospital a poor or failing safety grade [19, 20, 33] Anticipation and preparedness \u2022 Studies that used the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) found that hospitals scored higher than international benchmarks in the domains: \"Teamwork Climate\" [35] [36] [37] ; \"Safety Climate\" [35] [36] [37] ; \"Job Satisfaction\" [35] [36] [37] , \"Stress Recognition\" [35] [36] [37] ; \"Perceptions of Management\" [35] [36] [37] ; and \"Working Conditions\" [35, 37] \u2022 At ward level, factors such as the ward practice environment and the proportion of nurses with degrees were found to significantly impact safety outcomes [20] \u2022 Nurses' main concern was how to minimise risk [38, 39] \u2022 Many healthcare providers reported not feeling supported by hospital management [34] , and doubted that safety was a management priority [19] \u2022 In situ simulation was used to identify latent safety hazards [40] \u2022 Over 85% of staff liked their job and would feel safe being treated at the hospital as a patient [35] Integration and learning \u2022 Statistically significant changes in clinical activity were identified in the 28 days following five of the six severe perinatal adverse events [41] \u2022 A steady improvement in transfer time was demonstrated between the first and last simulation of a series of four simulations aimed at identifying latent safety hazards [40] Intervention studies \u2022 The percentage adherence to the Good Surgical Practice Guidelines was higher in an intervention group that received an adhesive ward round checklist (91%) in comparison with the control group (55%) [47] \u2022 Participating in the Online Patient Safety Education Programme resulted in immediate improvement in skills such as knowing when and how to complete incident forms and disclosing errors to patients, in self-rated knowledge and attitudes towards error reporting [44] \u2022Of 72 incident forms received in the first 4 months of the Clinical Risk Management project, 25.3% related to actual clinical incidents and 12.6% related to near misses. Potential risk was present in 62% of the reports [45] \u2022 The implementation of a 30-day complication proforma led to a 73% increase in morbidities reported using the proforma as compared with traditional Morbidity and Mortality reporting (547 vs 316), and an increase of 10.8% in the reporting of mortalities [46] \u2022 The implementation of training based on Crew Resource Management was associated with a significant increase in knowledge as a result of the training, and there was some evidence to support a shift in attitudes in the desirable direction relating to the need to speak up to seniors. No effect of the training was found on behaviour [43] \u2022 A significant change in the reporting behaviour of junior doctors was observed in one of the two hospitals following the intervention, a serious board game \"PlayDecide patient safety\" [42] of safety culture that were important to the staff at the time of the interviews [34] .",

Staff surveys are a commonly used source of information on adverse events. However, a survey approach is constrained by the extent to which conclusions can be drawn about adverse event prevalence. Patient record review has been considered the \"gold standard\" patient safety research method [50] , and was used in four of the reviewed studies. Such data are useful in demonstrating the scope of the problem in the Irish healthcare system, allows for international comparisons, and for an assessment of any changes over time. However, patient record review data are limited in terms of identifying specific areas for safety improvement [50, 51] . Therefore, there is a need for measures tailored to distinct aspects of patient harm (e.g. specific care-related injuries, missed diagnoses that lead to harm) [50] . Such data is important to address the HSE goal to \"measure and monitor safety, to evaluate the effects of safety improvement initiatives, and to inform further emerging priorities\"(p.19) [4] . Data on specific aspects of patient harm will allow the alignment of adverse events with failures in care, and the development and evaluation of interventions to address these issues [52] .",

            "text": "Safety culture/climate surveys were the most frequently used approach to measuring and monitoring anticipation and preparedness. Again, this is consistent with the large amount of research devoted to these types of measures more broadly in the safety literature [53, 54] . Safety culture/climate data is useful in identifying areas of both strength and weakness. However, it has been suggested that such survey measures may be best viewed as a trusted \"wet finger\" to find out which way the wind blows [55] , and do not identify specific areas for improvement. To illustrate, working conditions were identified as an area for improvement across four of the included studies [34] [35] [36] [37] . However, further data is required to identify the specific working conditions that should be prioritised for change. This is why, in some safety culture interventions, the survey data is used to inform discussion in qualitative safety culture workshops to identify the specific issues that need to be addressed [56] . It is recommended that future research should consider how to measure safety culture/ climate in a way that is practical, sufficiently specific to identify areas for safety improvement, and can be used to measure whether improvements have occurred. This will likely require a combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection methodologies. A consideration of how to measure safety culture/climate is particularly important in the RoI as this has been identified as a specific action in the HSE patient safety strategy [4] .",

These proportions are similar to the findings from a systematic review of MMS in prehospital care [51] . Although the studies in our scoping review that assessed one of these three dimensions of MMS provided informative data, they were largely based upon staff survey responses. Only one study [41] utilised clinical data. It is suggested that consideration should be given to the identification of feasible methods to MMS in these three under-researched dimensions beyond that derived only from survey data. A robust safety surveillance system should comprise multiple methods and address all five MMS domains. Research is recommended to critically appraise the existing safety monitoring system in the RoI healthcare system in order to identify blind spots as well as where there may be duplication of effort. Such research is consistent with the HSE patient safety strategy aim to \"further develop and enhance local and national suites of key patient safety indicators\" (p. 19) [4] .",

            "text": "Although MMS is important, what is also essential is that this data is used to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to improve patient safety and quality of care [52] . In fact, there is arguably little point in collecting safety data if it is not then used to bring about improvement. Three out of the six safety interventions identified were focused on education and training-a person-focused intervention at the lowest level of the hierarchy of intervention effectiveness [15] . Although two interventions [45, 46] with a focus on simplification and standardisation were identified, no interventions were found at the highest two levels of the hierarchy-forcing functions, automation and computerisation. The evaluations of the interventions included in the review were positive. However, similar to the majority of assessments of patient safety interventions, the quality of the evidence of effectiveness was low, with limited evidence of an impact on patient outcomes [5, 57, 58] . It is recommended that future research focuses on the evaluation of more effective system-focused interventions. It is further recommended that interventions are closely aligned to appropriate, and meaningful, measures of MMS in order to support rigour in evaluation of the impact of interventions on patient safety. This alignment will be necessary to achieve the HSE patient safety aims of putting in place appropriate actions to mitigate risks to patients, prioritising specific safety improvement initiatives, and evaluating the effects of safety improvement and risk mitigation initiatives [4] . It is also suggested that the co-design approach used by Ward et al. [48] may offer a useful approach to identify specific interventions that healthcare staff believe will improve safety.",

Firstly, a quality assessment was not carried out, although this absence is consistent with the majority of other scoping reviews [59] . Secondly, our scoping review provided a more descriptive summary of the literature than would be the case from a systematic review. This is a result of the goal of a scoping review to provide a map of existing research, rather than to answer a specific question [60] . Thirdly, as in any synthesis of the literature, scoping reviews are at risk for bias [60] . Fourthly, studies that focused on patient safety in the context of patients with a particular medical condition or focused on the safety of one process were excluded from our review. The rationale for this exclusion was that it would have been impossible to devise a search strategy that included every possible medical condition, and process. Therefore, we chose to take an approach that included all papers that met the inclusion criteria rather than an approach that, although broader, may have missed particular studies. Finally, we did not carry out a search of the grey literature. These searches were not carried out as there are methodological issues with including grey literature searches in systematic reviews (e.g. compromised methodological reproducibility, difficulties in interpreting these publications [61] ).",
