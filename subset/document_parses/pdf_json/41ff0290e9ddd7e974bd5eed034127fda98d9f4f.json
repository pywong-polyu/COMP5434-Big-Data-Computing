There were more activations for violent trauma (VT) in 2020 than 2019 (44 vs. 32). This increase in activations for VT was offset by a decrease in non-trauma activations (54 vs. 66). There was a significant increase in the number of components used in VT activations. Discussion: During 2020, the initial mild decrease in MTP activations was followed by a dramatic increase in the number of activations and component usage for VT in June and July of that year. (MTPs) are pre-set algorithms intended to prevent a dilutional coagulopathy following critical blood loss which leads to worse outcomes. 2 Common situations triggering MTP activation are severe physical trauma (gunshot wounds [GSW] , motor vehicle accidents [MVA], etc.), or medical complications of obstetrical patients, or those undergoing major procedures such as organ transplantation or cardiovascular surgery. 3 The number of MTP activations varies according to the hospital services provided. The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and the heightened civil unrest following the death of George Floyd in 2020 presented our community with a unique chance to gain insight into \"environmental\" factors affecting MTP activation and blood resource utilization to better understand and predict community blood product needs.",

Waseem et al., 12 of 20.3-84.6% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They also identified a relative increase in interpersonal (violent) trauma, an increase in trauma from falls from height, and a decrease in MVA trauma. This somewhat matches our experience, with a roughly 30% increase in VT events, and no notable change in the total number of MVA or OT activations. The latter is somewhat surprising, as a report was issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 13 that the number of people killed on the nation's highways rose 4.6% in the first nine months of 2020 despite coronavirus lockdowns that curtailed driving early in the year. This may be due to risky driving behavior that developed when there were fewer vehicles on the road during the pandemic. Locally, preliminary data from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety shows an increase in annual traffic fatalities from 364 in 2019 to 394 in 2020. 14 Diving into subgroup analysis of VT component usage; there were 37 activations for VT in June and July of 2020 and 2019. Twenty-eight were for GSWs, and 9 were for SWs. The average number of components used for a GSW activation in this period was 15.9, with a SD of 27.3. The average number of components used in a SW case was 8.3 with a SD of 6.5. The implication of this, as supported by the significant increase in components used for 2020, is that a minor increase in the number of VT activations for GSW may result in an unpredictably large increase in the number of components used.",
