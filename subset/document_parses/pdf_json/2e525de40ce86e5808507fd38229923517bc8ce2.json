While increased social distancing typically reduces the spread of an infectious disease, the magnitude varies greatly depending on the topology of the network, indicating the need for policies that are network dependent. Our results also reveal the importance of coordinating policies at the 'global' level. In particular, the public health benefits from social distancing to a group (e.g. a country) may be completely undone if that group maintains connections with outside groups that are not following suit.",

(ii) What is the distribution of the peak infection rate over the lifecycle of the epidemic? The reason for focusing on (i) is that the level of herd immunity attained is an important policy tool in knowing how, when, and by how much social distancing measures can be relaxed. The reason for focusing on (ii) is that the peak infection rate corresponds to the most overloaded instance that a healthcare service encounters over the lifecycle of an epidemic. Success in both the above dimensions is not simultaneously possible because as one goes up the other goes down. Our results help to guide what the relative trade-offs are.",

'Std.' and 'Med.' are the standard deviation and median of peak infection rates across 1000 simulations. 'Removed' is the fraction (%) of population removed (recovered) by the end of the epidemic. 'Peak | Immunity' is the mean peak infection rate conditional on acquiring herd immunity. 'Herd immunity' is the fraction of simulations (%) in which herd immunity was acquired network. For all three social network structures, ERG, WS, and BA, that we consider, strong measures of social distancing (limiting everyone's daily interactions to 3 or fewer) stops an epidemic with high probability (see Fig. 3 ). However, for societies structured according to WS, the fraction of individuals who are in state R ('removed') after the epidemic has passed is much less over this range (see rows labelled 'Herd Immunity' in Table 1 ). Moderate social distancing (defined as 4-5 interactions per period) delays the peak of an epidemic but has little effect on the size of the peak and on the number that the disease ultimately reaches. The effect of mild social distancing (limiting individuals to 10 social interactions) differs greatly across network structures. With ERG networks, the effect is negligible. With WS networks, the outcome is the same as no intervention. With BA networks, the peak is significantly reduced. While we begin with comparing the outcomes of no social distancing with those to social distancing, our framework is flexible enough to address a host of other policy experiments. For example, we consider a network comprised of two densely connected components, interpreted as 'countries', that have a small number of connections between them that we interpret as international friendships. We show that the public health benefits to a country that imposes strong social distancing measures are dramatically reduced, and perhaps eradicated entirely, if that country continues to allow international connections, interpreted as maintaining open borders, with a country that is not implementing similar measures. In a hyper-connected world, this points to the need for 'global' cooperation to eradicate an epidemic. In particular, if the global approach is uncoordinated with each country unilaterally applying social distancing measures without taking into account the policy choices of its neighbours, then an infectious disease may cycle around for far longer than otherwise desired.",

Our results show that even if only a small fraction of the population is deemed essential, the reach of the epidemic is similar to that wherein there are no essential workers. Finally, we consider another policy tool: time. Specifically, we consider a policy that begins with severe social distancing measures that are incrementally relaxed over time, and compare the outcome with that from a policy of mild but constant social distancing over a shorter window. We find that the public health outcome is better under gradual relaxation for ERG networks and WS networks, but worse for BA networks.",

Everyone in the population is currently in one of three states: susceptible (S)-has not had the disease and is therefore at risk; infectious (I )-currently has the disease and may therefore pass the disease to others; removed (R)-has had the disease and is no longer infectious (may be immune, isolated, dead, etc.). Time is discrete, starts at t = 0, and goes forever. Let S it , I it , R it \u2208 {0, 1} be the status of individual i at time t, where 1 means being that status and 0 means not being that status. (Clearly, S it + I it + R it = 1 for all i \u2208 V and all times t.) In every period, each infected vertex i randomly selects \u03ba(i) of its neighbours, and, if any of the selected neighbours are in state S, then they become infected with probability \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1). 6 The probability of removal (moving from state I to state R) is denoted by \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1). We assume that \u03b3 is constant over time and is the same for everyone. Once an individual enters state R, he stays there forever more. We say that the system has stopped when there is no individual in state I . 7, 8 To illustrate how social distancing works in practice, we refer to Fig. 1 . This figure can be thought of 'zooming in' on the local neighbourhood of individual who has 4 neighbours in the contact network. The leftmost image shows precisely this. The next three images illustrate what transpires when a social distancing policy with \u03ba( ) = 2 is imposed for three periods, with period t = 1 being the first period in which the policy takes effect. In each period t = 1, 2, 3, individual randomly selects two of their four neighbours to interact with. The interactions that occur are depicted by solid lines while those that don't occur are depicted by dashed lines. For the realisation depicted, interacts with neighbours h and k in period 1, with neighbours i and k in period 2, and with neighbours h and i in period 3. Note that never encounters neighbour j under this realisation. Thus the disease being transmitted (directly) from to j is impossible while social distancing is in effect but would be possible without.",

Erd\u0151s and R\u00e9nyi (1959) and Gilbert (1959) These networks are often referred to simply as 'random graphs'. Begin with the n vertices and an empty edge set. Now, for every pair of distinct vertices i and j, form edge i j with fixed probability p. The expected number of edges in the resulting graph is 1 2 n(n \u2212 1) p, because there are n 2 = 1 2 n(n \u2212 1) potential edges and each edge is realised with probability p. Watts and Strogatz (1998) The resulting network is often referred to as a 'small world'. Begin with the n vertices connected in a ring lattice where each vertex has k neighbours to the left and k neighbours to the right, where k n. Proceed clockwise around the ring one time, and for each vertex, rewire every edge that it has with the k vertices immediately to its right with rewiring probability q. Note that since the net change in the number of edges is zero, the number of edges in the resulting graph remains exactly nk, because each vertex has 2k neighbours and each edge is counted twice. Barab\u00e1si and Albert (1999) The resulting network is often referred to as 'scale free'. Begin with a complete graph on m 0 n vertices and allow time to increment forward from t = 1 to t = n \u2212 m 0 . At each point in time, a new vertex is born and the newly born vertex forms one edge with m \u2264 m 0 of the existing vertices, where the probability that the newly born vertex connects to existing vertex i is given by d(i)/ j d( j). In total n \u2212 m 0 , new vertices are added so the number of edges in the resulting graph is always exactly 1 2 m 0 (m 0 \u2212 1) + m(n \u2212 m 0 ). We choose to equalise average degree,d, across all network types. This ensures we are comparing like-for-like since it is the way in which the societies are organised, and not the overall level of interaction, that is being varied. Given that the number of edges in each graph will be nd/2, some straightforward algebra yields the following parameter requirements: p =d n\u22121 for ERG, k =d 2 for WS, and m = nd\u2212m 0 (m 0 \u22121)",

For each of the three network structures, the trial with moderate social distancing, N max = 5, delays the peak of the epidemic but has little impact on the size of the peak. The effect of mild social distancing, N max = 10, differs across network structures. With a random network (ERG), the effect is mild. With a small-world network (WS), the outcome appears equivalent to no intervention (N max = \u221e). This is because in the WS network, each agent hasd = 10 neighbours, so the restriction N max = 10 does not bind. (The histograms differ only due to sampling error.) With a power law network (BA), the peak is significantly reduced. This is because in the BA network there are a small number of individuals with very high degree. So, since many of the edges of the contact network have a high degree individual at one end, the same holds true for the infectious subnetwork regardless of what it may be. This means that these 'hubs' are very likely to become infected even under social distancing. However, due to social distancing, an infected hub infects nowhere near as many as when there are no constraints. These hubs no longer act as 'super-spreaders'.",

However, for the BA network, conditional on the disease not being eradicated the distribution of peak infection rate for N max = 5 is sandwiched between that of N max = 10 and N max = \u221e. At first glance, this may appear mysterious but in fact it is not. The explanation is that the distribution of peak infection rate presented says nothing about the precise moment, during a particular trial, that the peak infection rate was attained. For N max = 5, the peak infection rate will typically occur after the social distancing restrictions have been lifted (as can be seen for the trial in the left panel of ERG), but this is not the case for N max = 10. For BA networks, it would appear that setting N max = 10 is a superior policy to the policy to setting N max = 5. Table 1 presents further results. The variable 'Peak' denotes the peak infection rate. 'Std.' and 'Med.' denote its standard deviation and median, respectively. 'Removed' denotes the fraction of population that was removed (has recovered) by the end of the epidemic, which also equals the cumulative number of infections. Letting T denote the last period before the system stops, we say that the society has acquired herd immunity if \u03b2dx T \u2264 \u03b3 , where x T is the fraction of susceptible individuals at time T .

In most specifications, the probability of acquiring herd immunity and the average peak are both increasing in N max . This suggests that drastic social distancing policies are fragile in the sense that while they tend to contain the disease, it is less likely to achieve herd immunity and the society is susceptible to a recurrent epidemic. Furthermore, note that the variable 'Peak | Immunity' (meaning 'average peak conditional on herd immunity being attained') is decreasing in N max . This shows that when the disease control has failed, the peak is actually worse (higher) under more strict social distancing policies.",

Clearly, this a strong assumption as full compliance cannot be guaranteed without strong monitoring. We can easily incorporate this feature in our model is by defining a parameter \u03be \u2208 (0, 1) where \u03be is the probability that an individual violates the restrictions in a given period. A related point is made by the game-theoretic literature on epidemic control. In a game-theoretic model, individuals are assumed to be rational and rational individuals may themselves take mitigating measures. In such a set-up, increased social distancing reduces likelihood of infection but also comes with a cost in the form of reduced freedom, convenience, earning potential, and so on. Reluga (2010) considers a differential game capturing precisely these trade-offs. Valdez et al. (2012) allow for the possibility that individuals can identify infected neighbours and temporarily interrupt contact with them.",

Lastly, while we have focused on the benefits to public health of social distancing, this is far from the full story. Any amount of social distancing brings with it economic cost and, as evidenced by recent economic data, the policy responses to the COVID-19 outbreak have had an enormous effect on the global economy. 19 Given that, as of time of writing, the mass roll-out of a successful vaccine to COVID-19 is potentially far on the horizon, some form of relaxed social distancing measures need to be considered. 20 A richer model would also include the effect that social distancing has on economic output, and subsequently incorporate the interdependent relationship between output and public health (Bloom et al. 2004; Weil 2007 ). Such a model would allow policy makers to consider the full trade-off between absolute lockdown (everyone safe from exposure, economic activity greatly reduced) versus no lockdown of any kind (nobody safe from exposure, economic activity is maximal).",

Clearly, this is not realistic. In real-world epidemics, policy makers have an array of tools available.

(2020) document that the USA's week-ending jobless claims numbers from late-March 2020 have been an order of magnitude higher than any seen previously. Moreover, these numbers were as a result of the lockdown policy and not the virus itself. 20 Dingel and Neiman (2020) estimate that only one-third of jobs in the USA can be done from home. it is important to understand how the full set of policy tools complement each other in order to successfully operationalise a pandemic response plan.
