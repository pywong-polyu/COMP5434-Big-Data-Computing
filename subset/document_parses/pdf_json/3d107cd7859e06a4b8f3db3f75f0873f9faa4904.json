            "text": "Historically, there has be a close relationship between the nursing services and spiritual care provision to patients, arising due to the evolvement of many hospitals and nursing programmes from faith-based institutions and religious order nursing. With increasing secularism, these relationships are less entwined. Nonetheless, as nurses typically encounter patients at critical life events, such as receiving bad news or dying, nurses frequently understand the need and requirement for both spiritual support and religious for patients and families during these times. Yet there are uncertainties, and nurses can feel ill-equipped to deal with patients' spiritual needs. Little education or preparation is provided to these nurses, and they often report a lack of confidence within this area. The development of this confidence and the required competencies is important, especially so with increasingly multicultural societies with diverse spiritual and religious needs. In this manuscript, we discuss initial field work carried out in preparation for the development of an Erasmus Plus educational intervention, entitled from Cure to Care Digital Education and Spiritual Assistance in Healthcare. Referring specifically to post-COVID spirituality needs, this development will support nurses to respond to patients' spiritual needs in the hospital setting, using digital means. This preliminary study revealed that while nurses are actively supporting patients' spiritual needs, their education and training are limited, non-standardised and heterogeneous. Additionally, most spiritual support occurs within the context of a Judeo-Christian framework that may not be suitable for diverse faith and non-faith populations. Educational preparation for nurses to provide spiritual care is therefore urgently required.",

There is convincing evidence that many patients and their families have spiritual needs, that if addressed within healthcare, improve care (Selman et al., 2018) and cost benefits (Hall & Powell, 2021) . If spiritual and religious needs are supported, this can support effective recovery or lead to a peaceful death (Swift, 2014) . Spirituality is understood in this context as a search for connectedness and meaning, transcendence and belonging (Weathers et al., 2016) . One can be spiritual without being religious, but those who are religious are generally considered to be spiritual (Mercadante, 2014 , Fuller, 2001 . Being religious is the outward practice of spiritual beliefs in the context of an organised religion.",

Religiosity, spirituality and religious coping are associated with increased life satisfaction and quality of life (Tan et al., 2021) , in the context of chronic illnesses for example (Nkoana et al., 2021; Taskin Yilmaz et al., 2021) . The reliance on spiritual or religious coping is especially important when receiving bad news, noticing a serious health condition, or when facing serious or tragic events (Koenig, 2013) . Spirituality can also foster hope among patients with chronic illness, an important concept for well-being and be a source of support when moral injury occurs (Carey & Hodgson, 2018) . While there is an emphasis within the nursing literature on the support of both spiritual and religious needs, it is important to note that these concepts are often understood more broadly as pastoral care needs (Guthrie, 2014; Wells et al., 2021) . Both spiritual and religious needs can be effectively supported through pastoral care (Wells et al., 2021) . This service is usually provided by Healthcare Chaplains or Pastoral Care Workers to address the overarching spiritual needs of patients in healthcare settings (Wells et al., 2021) . Ultimately, pastoral care contributes in a meaningful way to the holistic care of the person and encompasses the many facets of spiritual, religious, sacramental, emotional, psychological care within the context of an increasingly secularised society without an overemphasis on the spiritual or religious, which can serve to lessen tensions and ambiguities that can exist around the care offered to patients to help them address existential concerns.",

The emerging literature evidenced the creative efforts made by Healthcare Chaplaincy and Pastoral Care services globally to support patients who were isolated and distressed Bowers et al., 2021) . It was revealed that the stress induced by the pandemic led to people seeking support through spiritual and religious means (Rigoli, 2021) . COVID-19 has also reminded populations of the importance of rituals (Imber-Black, 2020). Indeed, Healthcare Chaplains reported an increased and intensive demand on their services (Busfield, 2020) that presented challenges globally . Indeed, they often struggled \"to create some dignified space in which the dying process [for example], could be acknowledged\" (Busfield, 2020:219) . For some Pastoral Care Workers, access was denied during this time (Hall et al., 2020) . Therefore, the exploration of the nurse's role and indeed the mobilisation of the nurse to provide spiritual and pastoral care is now becoming more prevalent and topical (Chirico & Nucera, 2020) . However, to provide effective support a good understanding of spirituality and spiritual care provision is needed, and this is often where gaps exist.",

Added to the uncertainly that nurses feel about their roles, is their limited understanding of the role of Healthcare Chaplaincy and Pastoral Care Services. This is likely compounded by the dearth of research in the Healthcare Chaplaincy field, most notably in the area of their scope of practice and impact of services (Timmins et al., 2017) . Certainly, there are logistical and historical reasons for these gaps; however, there is a need to recalibrate that imbalance, through increased collaborative working, so that more is known about their work, their capacity to provide pastoral support within a more secularised context and their ability to work as co-collaborators with nursing and other allied health professionals in relation to their service provision. While adequate training for nurses in relation to spiritual care provision is important, part of this focus needs to be on greater understanding of Healthcare Chaplaincy and Pastoral Care and an encouragement towards a focus on co-responsibility and a greater understanding of respective roles and boundaries within pastoral care support and delivery.",

While the support that patients require arguably occurs more broadly in the pastoral care space, the language that is used by nurses, policy makers and within the nursing competency framework that is developed for European nurses refers to spiritual rather than pastoral care (EPICC, 2021) , and overall, this is a welcome initiative. However, there is also limited evidence of spiritual care education and training among nurses (Amiri et al., 2021 , McSherry et al., 2020 , Castaldelli-Maia & Bhugra, 2014 , and limited direction in practice for assessing spiritual needs and providing spiritual care.

The emerging competency framework , EPICC 2021 , used to form part of the survey in this project, provides overarching guidance with spiritual care provision by nurses and thus served as an effective framework to collect information about spiritual care provision across the healthcare sites. Intrapersonal spiritualty relates to self-awareness and being aware of one's own spirituality in order to adequately address another's. Interpersonal relates to the relationship between the nurse and patient and encourage the nurses to engage with the person's spirituality. Spiritual assessment relates to how spiritual information is collected and documented and intervention describes those activities carried out to support patients' spiritual needs. A final item included in the survey questioned whether digital technologies were available for use at the hospital site.",

A panel of international experts in the field reviewed, further developed, and finalised this, through consensus, over series of four international meetings. The idea for the short-form survey arose from the authors (SD). Two authors (FT and MC) prepared a first draft of this tool, derived from previous work in the area (Timmins et al., 2017) and core competencies outlined by the Erasmus project -Enhancing Nurses and Midwives' Competence in Providing Spiritual Care through Innovation, Education and Compassionate Care (EPICC) (2021) and further described in van Leeuwen et al., (2021) and McSherry et al. (2020) . This aforementioned project developed spiritual care competencies for use by European nurses and midwives. FT was an Associate partner in the project and contributed to their development. The finalised tool was revised and developed by FT and MC in consultation with six experts in the field. This was then discussed and finalised with the \"From Cure to Care\" Erasmus Plus partners/research team. The instrument was further refined (in terms of accuracy, language, and content) by the research team for this project.",

It is reassuring therefore to find that spiritual care provision is a prominent feature at the five study sites during this time. Healthcare Chaplaincy provision was also evident across all the sites, a feature of healthcare provision common across many countries internationally (Timmins et al., 2018) . Certainly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the support that Healthcare Chaplaincy can provide, especially when visiting was forbidden or restricted (Tracey et al., 2021) . COVID-19 resulted in both an increase demand for Healthcare Chaplaincy services (Giffen & Macdonald, 2020 ) and a serious depletion of these services in some areas (Vandenhoeck, 2021) with a recommendation for a more cohesive and far-reaching way to provide patients with spiritual support, especially for such crisis events (Papadopoulos et al., 2021) . Indeed recognised as a \"collective trauma\" it is likely that there were more far-reaching consequences, related to the pandemic including moral injury (Carey & Hodgson, 2018) and psychological effects (Abbott & Franks, 2021) . Indeed, some studies indicated an increase in loneliness and depression, among institutionalised older adults (Van der Roest et al., 2020). Thus, psychological and spiritual support among communities, and especially those receiving healthcare, is an ongoing and future requirement (Carey & Hodgson, 2018) . It was reassuring that this study finds that nurses provide spiritual support to patients, although it is remarkable that assessment of spiritual needs and/or religious affiliation is lacking. However, this is something that resonates within the literature on the topic (Timmins et al., 2017) and this is often due to lack of confidence, embarrassment around the topic, and/or the lengthy nature of suggested assessment tools (Timmins & Kelly, 2008) . Some innovative approaches to this have recently been put forward by experts in the field, suggesting a simple 2-question approach (termed 2-QSAM) that simply prompts nurses to ask \"'What's most important to you right now?' and 'How can I help?'\" (Ross & McSherry, 2018) . This approach will likely be very useful to future educational programmes that equip nurses for spiritual care practice.",

In some cases, patients were more fearful at this time, with older people exhibiting high levels of death anxiety (Rababa et al., 2021) . Certainly, major life challenges became more magnified . Nurses such as those identified by Criptoph & Smith (2020) highlighted the loneliness and isolation experienced when facing deaths during COVID-19 and their efforts to support both the dying and bereaved in a dignified way.

While there is limited exploration of this aspect of spiritual support within the literature, this finding is consistent with other work in the field (Timmins et al., 2017) . At the same time, multifaith Healthcare Chaplaincy services can coexist with this mono religious approach (Brady et al., 2021 , Timmins et al., 2017 . However, this does lead to concern by the public, who without more in-depth information are influenced by surface appearances (Irish Independent, 2019), for example, the presence of a chapel has singular religious connotations when this may not necessarily be the case. Multifaith approaches are common and deemed important among modern Healthcare Chaplaincy services (Brady et al., 2021) . Certainly, our Erasmus project will clearly address a multicultural and multifaith perspective for nursing students (From Cure to Care, 2021) .",

For this reason, there needs to be more collaborative work by health professionals with Healthcare Chaplains, Pastoral Care Workers and faith leaders to support patients and families (Moreira-Almeida et al., 2016) .

This blurring of role boundaries has the potential to induce conflict in the healthcare area, perhaps eroding an already depleted Pastoral Care service. We are at a point where a clear understanding of healthcare roles in the provision of healthcare would be very useful to the development of spiritual care for the future, especially in the context of changing demographics and increased interest in involvement of non-Healthcare Chaplains in spiritual care matters.",
