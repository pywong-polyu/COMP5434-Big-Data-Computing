            "text": "Antibiotic resistance is considered by the countries to be a global health issue and a huge threat to public health. The reduction of resistant microorganisms from water/wastewater is of importance in environmental sciences since they are resistant in the aquatic environment. In this study, a bibliometric analysis of literature from the field of environmental science in water ecosystems from 2015 to 2019 was carried out using the keywords \"Antibiotic Resistance (AR)\" and \"Escherichia coli\". Furthermore, using the keywords of \"Fresh Water,\" \"Sea Water,\" and \"Waste Water,\" 155, 52, and 57 studies were discovered, respectively. It is found that 217 studies of the total 2115 studies investigated on AR are mostly performed in the \"Waste Water\" by considering human health. Given the studies, an upto-date solution should be proposed since the release of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resis-tance genes (ARGs) from wastewater treatment plants needs to be mitigated. For this reason, it is obvious that working on micro and macro ecosystems will increase the probability of solutions in antibiotic resistance. A discussion of removal techniques for coliform bacteria, particularly antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli, was presented. One of the unique values of this study is to offer an innovative solution that removing them by metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging crystalline hybrid materials. MOFs are used for environmental, biological, and food antimicrobial substances efficiently. Therefore, we can give inspiration to the future studies of antimicrobial resistance removal via adsorption using MOFs as adsorbents.",

Wastewater and wastewater treatment plants are regarded as a source of antibiotic resistance. Wastewater has fecal residues including antibiotic resistance bacteria, antibiotic resistance genes, metals, organic pollutants, and the residue of antibiotics (Thakali et al. 2020; Voigt et al. 2020 ). In addition, these bacteria are able to spread their genes into water-indigenous microbes, which also contain resistance genes (Baquero et al. 2008 ). They are not completely mitigated during treatment processes in sewage treatment plants; therefore, they can be distributed to the aquatic environment Hembach et al. 2019; Voigt et al. 2020) . Given this spread of ARGs in surface water and insufficient degradation in sewage treatment plants, antibiotic resistance poses a great threat to public health and to ecology (Krzeminski et al. 2020; Thakali et al. 2020; Voigt et al. 2020) . Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations (UN), and the European Union consider antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a global public health threat (World Health Organization 2015; United Nations 2016; Krzeminski et al. 2020) .",

This analysis is an important and common method to assess research activity on a certain topic.

Escherichia coli is the most commonly studied microorganism since Escherichia coli is regarded an indicator. The studies in the field of Agriculture and Biological Sciences and Environmental Science in the various categories with their rates as percentage were given. According to these studies in Environmental Science, the first five categories were found to be of wastewater (24.53%), E (none) (23.52%), freshwater (15.58%), animal (11.83%), and water (6.64%). Other categories were included in the chart were found to be of food (4.47%), seawater (4.18%), faces (2.45%), illness (2.31%), soil (2.31%), human (1.15%), and plant (1.01%) (Fig. 1) . Figure 2 and Figure 3 present the country network visualization of publications on antibiotic resistance and Escherichia coli in Agricultural and Biological Sciences and Environmental Science from 2015 to 2019. We can identify the countries when the studies are frequently performed by using \"Network visualization map\". The countries included in the figures that were found at least 15 times within the 1376 studies. USA and China are of the two countries lead the study of antibiotic resistance in water environment and Escherichia coli studies in both study fields. Egypt is the other country that we often encounter in these studies, following the USA and China. In bibliometric analysis, the countries can be identified based on the studies most frequently or less frequently performed. Network mapping provide information on which countries have less studies in terms of the field of the study. The sizes of the circles are proportional to the studies frequency.",

Keywords should reflect the basics of the study in the best way, so that the researcher can easily obtain a preliminary idea. As a result of the examination, it is seen that a total of 114 studies from 739 articles, that is, 12% of these studies did not contain either one or both keywords. Moreover, the table shows that 59% of keywords did not consist of Escherichia coli in these 114 studies, suggesting that the keywords should be chosen more carefully. Table 4 shows the proportions of one or both of keyword are being included in the summary or title in the articles found while creating the large data tables in the study. As we can see in Table 4 , it was preferred to use similar keywords in the studies. The fact that these keywords are interconnected enables easy access to the publication while conducting research.",

            "text": "In this study, the results obtained are interpreted with an overview; thus, it is seen that in the literature, total 2115 articles were published from 2015 and 2019 on the \"antibiotic resistance\" and \"Escherichia coli\" in the fields of \"Agriculture and Biological Sciences\" (1376 articles) and \"Environmental Science\" (739 articles). According to the results of the analysis, Escherichia coli was the most studied bacteria in the wastewater environment. As it is known that wastewater treatment plants are considered as a source of releasing the ARB as traditional wastewater treatment plants are not completely removing the ARGs. Therefore, the release of ARB and ARGs from wastewater treatment plants needs to be reduced. After our results, fulfilling this justification should be the first thing that comes to mind. However, there are a few studies on the water we consume and use, such as drinking water, bathing water, and well water. Therefore, the studies of antibiotic resistance and Escherichia coli in these environments should be increased by prioritizing human health. The USA, China, and India were found to be the leading countries based on their number of publications. More studies led by leading countries should be supported and combined for this purpose. One of the unique values of this study is to offer an innovative solution proposal. Reducing the consumption of antimicrobials is not sufficient to mitigate the release of AMR; therefore, an effective treatment technique is significantly needed. A variety of treatment techniques such as UV-C/H 2 O 2 and sunlight/H 2 O 2 (S. G. Michael et al. 2020) , ultraviolet disinfection , oxidative damage (Zhang et al. 2020) , membrane filtration and 265 nm UV irradiation (Krzeminski et al. 2020) , and UVactivated persulfate (Zhou et al. 2020 ) have been applied for the removal of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant E. coli, and gene in wastewater. However, there is no particular treatment technique used for their treatment; it is, therefore, very significant to offer an efficient technique to remove them from wastewater. In this study, we accelerate new avenues for using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to remove or reduce them effectively from wastewater. MOFs are emerging crystalline hybrid materials that are formed by organic linker buildings and metal ions through coordination bonds (Furukawa et al. 2013) . MOFs can be easily tunable and designed to be able to use in a wide range of applications including gas storage and separation (Li et al. 2014) , energy storage devices (Baumann et al. 2019) , toxic material adsorption (Barea et al. 2014) , chemical warfare detoxification (Gil-San-Millan et al. 2017) , and biomedical applications (McKinlay et al. 2010; Shen et al. 2020) . Moreover, recently, MOFs have been utilized in various antibacterial fields owing to their porosity, tunability, and release capability. Although there are no actual studies on their removal/reduction by MOFs, MOFs are considered as alternative materials for potential techniques. Some studies revealed that MOFs are proven to efficiently use in antibacterial materials for environmental, biological and food antimicrobial (Shen et al. 2020 ) and antibacterial Furthermore, an outbreak of novel coronavirus started in 2019 and spread very quickly throughout the world. As a result of this rapid spread and the COVID-19 pandemic, coronavirus also found in sewage in different countries, so it will become vital to offer an number of a keyword for the analysis is 10 occurrences, that is, the criterion is country names to appear at least 10 times among 1376 retrieved studies) efficient solutions to be removing or tracing COVID-19 in the wastewater due to its long-term effect on human health. In general conclusion of this study, permanent solutions of the microbial problems can only be achieved by working under the umbrella of \"One Health\" which is considering the human-foodenvironment triangle.",
