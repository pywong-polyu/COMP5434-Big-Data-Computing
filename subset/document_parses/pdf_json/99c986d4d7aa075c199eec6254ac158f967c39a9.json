We investigated the validity of chest radiography as a tool for predicting aggravation in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases. Methods A total of 104 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were referred from the cruise ship \"Diamond Princess\" to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Japan from February 11 to 25, 2020. Fiftynine symptomatic patients were selected. Chest radiography was performed upon hospitalization; subsequently, patients were categorized into the positive radiograph (Group A) and negative radiograph (Group B) groups. Radiographic findings were analyzed with a six-point semiquantitative score. Group A was further classified into two additional subgroups: patients who required oxygen therapy during their clinical courses (Group C) and patients who did not (Group D). Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were collected for an analysis. Results Among 59 patients, 34 were men with a median age of 60 years old. Groups A, B, C, and D consisted of 33, 26, 12, and 21 patients, respectively. The number of patients requiring oxygen administration was significantly larger in Group A than in Group B. The consolidation score on chest radiographs was significantly higher in Group C than in Group D. When chest radiographs showed consolidation in more than two lung fields, the positive likelihood ratio of deterioration was 10.6. Conclusions Chest radiography is a simple and easy-to-use clinic-level triage tool for predicting the severity of COVID-19 and may contribute to the allocation of medical resources.",

A sixpoint semiquantitative score was used for the analysis. The distribution of chest radiographic abnormalities was sorted according to six affected lung fields (right upper field, right middle field, right lower field, left upper field, left middle field, and left lower field), and the abnormalities were classified into two common radiological manifestations [groundglass attenuation (GGA) and consolidation]. GGA and consolidation of each lung field on chest radiographs were scored separately. If there were two localized consolidations in the same lung field, the score was one. If GGA straddled two lung fields, the score was two. GGA and consolidation were scored independently regardless of their size and number. Fig. 1 shows the scoring method and examples.",

In contrast, the consolidation score was significantly associated with the presence or absence of oxygen administration. Specifically, our study suggests that there may be a risk of aggravation if chest radiographs show consolidation in two or more lung fields. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 may be less likely to progress to a severe disease state if their initial chest radiograph findings are normal or show only GGA. The typical CT finding in COVID-19 is patchy GGA in the peripheral area, and when it deteriorates, consolidations are found and increase in number (10, 11) . Consolidations are easily detectable, unlike GGA, on chest radiographs, even for doctors who are not familiar with chest radiography. In other words, patients at potential risk for deterioration may have chest radiographs that show easily identifiable abnormalities com-pared to those in mild cases. Chest radiography is simpler to administer and has a lower radiation exposure than CT. Furthermore, primary care physicians can perform radiography easily at clinics, unlike CT (12) .",

Second, the enrolled patients were mostly elderly people, and the data of young people are not shown. However, given the evidence that being elderly is an important risk factor of disease progression, the disproportional age distribution in the sample may be acceptable. Third, we were unable to strictly distinguish similar respiratory diseases, such as interstitial lung diseases, microbial superinvasion with influenza, mycoplasma, and other types of bacterial pneumonia, from COVID-19. Some of the patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and an abnormal chest radiograph may not have had true lung lesions due to COVID-19. Finally, the radiographic results may not reflect the exact clinical status of patients due to variations in the timing of chest radiography in each patient. It is important to avoid overlooking the timing of aggravation by comprehensively considering risk factors for aggravation, such as underlying diseases, other than chest radiographic findings.",
