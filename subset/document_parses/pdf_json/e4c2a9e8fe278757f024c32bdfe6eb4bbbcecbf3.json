It is estimated that a 5% decline in (per capita) income of people would result in an increase in the number of poor-compared to 2018-over 80 million for the poverty line of $1.9/day, more than 130 million for the threshold of $3.2/day and around 124 million for the higher poverty threshold of $5.5/day. With a contraction of 10%, the number of poor people would increase by about 180, 280 and 250 million people, respectively, but if the contraction is 20%, then the increases could be about 420, 580, and 520 million people, respectively (Sumner, Hoy, & Ortiz-Juarez, 2020) . Covid-19 pushes to the far future the United Nations sustainable development goal of ending poverty by 2030, since both the relative and absolute size of the number of poor below the three poverty lines are expected to increase for the first time after 1990, showing a decade progress setback to poverty reduction (Sumner et al., 2020) .",

However, the effects of the recent economic crisis, which led to the high rise in unemployment combined with the gaps in the social protection system, have led to a marked increase in poverty in Greece in the years of the major crisis, although since 2013 there has been a significant improvement. At the same time, the precise effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are not yet fully evident, but it is expected to lead to significant income losses in Greece, further reinforcing the poverty problem.

The mechanism which may result in such situation may refer to the following: (a) health improves productivity since healthier workers are stronger physically and mentally and there are no lost days due to illness. (b) Health leads to higher education and education of better quality, since healthier people live longer and improve their skills in order to earn higher income. (c) Higher life expectancy for healthier people makes them to invest more in physical capital as well. Increase of life expectancy leads persons to increased savings for retirement, where such savings lead to increased investment and therefore an increase in physical capital leads to increased income, and there are also inflows of foreign investments if there are healthy and skilled human capital). Grossman (1972) points out that health is a lasting, investment asset, which in terms of \"healthy time\" or \"illness-free days\" serves as a determining factor in work. People inherit an initial health capital, which, while decreasing by age, can be increased by investments throughout life. By approaching human resources from the point of view of the productive factor, it is important to highlight the changes that are taking place both in terms of health and in terms of economic, social, and technological developments.",

By 3 April, 2805 beds in the NHS were available for the hospital treatment of patients with Covid-19. By the end of March, the Ministry of Health had increased its NHS available intensive care beds from 565 to 952, of which more than 250 were for patients with Covid-19, by commandeering private and military hospitals (private hospitals have about 350 beds of intensive care units), as well as by converting facilities that had the necessary infrastructure, such as increased care facilities. 1 There is an urgent need for availability in beds and intensive care units to deal with possible subsequent waves of the pandemic. Care should therefore be taken to create new beds for treating patients with Covid-19 and new intensive care units. In addition, in the event of a new occurrence of the phenomenon in an intensive manner, patients that are not infected with the coronavirus can be transferred to intensive care units of private hospitals. Relevant solutions that could better prepare the national healthcare system are also the creation of intensive care units in special containers (prefabricated houses) in the reference hospitals for the coronavirus, the creation of intensive care beds in surgical and recovery rooms, and the further utilization of the private sector and military hospitals.",

Notes 1. It should be noted that in the case of the Netherlands of 17 million people, 1150 intensive care units were available before the pandemic, with a 70% full population under normal conditions. Soon after the onset of the pandemic, the Netherlands increased the number of intensive care units to 2500 beds for patients with Covid-19. Italy had before the pandemic 5090 intensive care beds and a total of 191,000 simple hospital beds (8.5 beds per 10,000 persons). Belgium had about 1900 beds in intensive care units before the pandemic, i.e. around 16.5 beds per 100,000 people. At the beginning of April the ratio had increased to 24 beds per 100,000 people. Germany also had 28,031 intensive care beds in 2017 (33.7 intensive care beds per 100,000 of population), with a capacity of 79%. By April 1st, the number of intensive care beds increased by 12,000 to 40,000, of which 30,000 are fully equipped with ventilators. The United Kingdom has more than 5000 intensive care beds. 2. The sectors that have been the most affected by the pandemic are hotels and catering, arts, entertainment and recitation activities and trade. Specifically, the biggest reduction in value added is expected for the Hotels and catering sector as before the crisis it was expected that in 2020 the added value of the sector would increase by 4.5%; after the crisis, it is ultimately expected to decrease by 16.6%. A significant reduction in value added is expected for the arts, entertainment and recreation sector as, before the crisis, for 2020, the value added of the sector was expected to increase by 2.7%. After the pandemic, it is expected to eventually decrease by 16.1%. Significant negative (and also with a change from positive to negative) new changes in added values are expected for sectors such as trade, other services, transport and communication, manufacturing, and construction. On the other hand, there are sectors which are presented as the winners of the crisis. This is the health sector (an increase of 2.1% was expected before the crisis, and an increase of 3.9% is expected after the crisis), the public administration (an increase of 1.4% was expected before the crisis, and an increase of 2.6% is expected after the crisis) and the public services (an increase of 1.6% was expected before the crisis, with an increase of 2.2% expected after the crisis) (see Petrakis & Kostis, 2020) .",
