Such perceptions are shaped by exposure to (mis)information amplified by the media, the community, and the health system. Social networks may either positively or negatively impact vaccination uptake, depending on their views on vaccines. Political issues contribute to vaccine brand hesitancy, resulting to vaccination delays and refusals. Perceived inefficiencies and inflexibility of the system also create additional barriers to the vaccine rollout in the country, especially among vulnerable and marginalised groups.",

Because of the significant and continued impact of COVID-19, vaccines have been developed at a rapid and unprecedented pace to control the spread of the virus, and prevent hospitalisations and deaths [2] . Many vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective with high-income countries having vaccinated more than half of their population [3] . Despite the availability of these vaccines, countries are faced with various challenges including vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccination sentiments, limited global supply, and vaccine deployment [4, 5] . These issues in vaccine uptake, together with declining community acceptance of other public health interventions, will mean a delayed recovery and prolonged pandemic [6] .",

Together with weak primary health care and other health challenges, countries especially low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) will struggle to meet the demands of the communities within their health system capacity. With the pandemic, countries are further burdened with many health systems overwhelmed throughout its course. The Philippines presently faces these challenges: vaccine hesitancy and increasing anti-vaccination sentiments, a weak primary health care system with efforts to strengthen it through the recently implemented Universal Health Care Law, and an overwhelmed health system because of the demands of COVID-19 and other public health problems [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . These challenges are further compounded by a global shortage of vaccine supply with inequitable vaccine distributions [14] .",

Following the dengue vaccine controversy in 2017 however, confidence levels have dramatically dropped and have impacted succeeding vaccination efforts including the COVID-19 vaccination campaign [9, 12, [15] [16] [17] . Dengvaxia, the world's first commercially available dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur, was introduced as part of a national school-based immunization programme despite the lack of empirical data on the risks associated with administration of the vaccine among those not previously infected with dengue or seronegative children [9, 12, [15] [16] [17] . By the time reports were released that the vaccine may cause more severe disease among seronegatives, the Philippines had already inoculated more than 800,000 Filipino school-age children [9] . This was highly politicised, and damaged trust in vaccines and the health sector [9, 12, [15] [16] [17] . As a result, immunisation rates dropped and the country saw outbreaks of previously controlled vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and polio [18, 19] . In addition to vaccine hesitancy, the Philippine health system is not prepared for additional health care demands. As early as the first phase of the pandemic, critical care capacity was overwhelmed with the influx of patients in hospitals [10, 11] . As of 16 September 2021, the Philippines ranks third among countries with the highest number of newly confirmed cases per one million population [1, 20] . Globally, 42.9% of the world population has received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with much lower rates in LMICs like the Philippines [20, 21] .",

However, we need to recognise that the adoption of all these interventions is influenced by individual risk perceptions and these perceptions are shaped by various sources of information and experiences [23] . Additionally, there are interpersonal and structural factors that influence health decisions of individuals. Recognising the multiple dimensions in which behaviors and decisions occur, theories and models have been proposed to explain how individuals make decisions on their health based on factors that change over time and context [24, 25] . The social ecological model provides a useful framework for investigating health behaviours and decisions by recognising that a multiplicity of factors interacts to influence health of individuals [25] . These include individual factors representing biological or behavioral characteristics, interpersonal factors representing networks and social capital operating within a defined boundary, and structural factors that include health systems and are mediated through laws and policies [25] . Published studies on vaccination that utilised this model reported that vaccine intentions and attitudes operate along multiple dimensions, with a series of events influencing decisions related to vaccination [17, 26, 27] . Improving adherence to interventions and vaccination rates therefore requires better understanding of the different reasons behind vaccine mistrust and not just determining their individual beliefs, knowledge, and levels of trust [17, 26, 27] . A recently published scoping review supports the use of the social ecological model in understanding attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination [28] . The review showed that influencing factors are embedded within the social ecological model and that multilevel interventions are needed to improve uptake of .

This scoping review of 50 articles had representation from various countries, but did not include data from the Philippines. We address this gap by exploring the vaccination narratives and challenges experienced and observed by Filipinos during the early COVID-19 vaccination period. We used qualitative data from a mixed-methods study conducted from June to August 2021 that aimed to understand how people in the Philippines view COVID-19 and what influences their behaviours. With these findings, we hope to provide insights to possible avenues of future research and directions for improving COVID-19 vaccine uptake and reach.",

We used coding language that was close to the participants' terms and phrases to ensure that we were co-constructing accurate categories reflective of their responses [32] . The codes were reviewed, and areas of disagreement were resolved through discussion within the team.

The choices for refusal were: conflict in schedule, choice of vaccine, and three other reasons. I chose choice of vaccine. After that, they scheduled me to another vaccination site to get my vaccine. When I went, I was still not in any way sure that it was Pfizer. But I knew it would not be Sinovac. So I was open to whatever vaccine it will be, except for Sinovac. So knowing that it was not Sinovac convinced me to go. Well, regardless if it was AstraZeneca or other vaccines, I was okay with it as long as it was not Sinovac. Because I heard that they used the same virus, they cased it in the vaccine, and it was like you will have the virus in your body? So the negativity as well as the news about it. I self-study medicine because I do not want to depend on doctors. If I did, maybe I died a long time ago. [\u2026] Once upon a time in my life, I was admitted in the hospital. I was later diagnosed with UTI [urinary tract infection] but was initially asked for an ultrasound because they thought I was pregnant. Another doctor asked me to drink beer for my UTI. From that [day] on, I just self-studied medicine. With COVID, I don't really believe [what I read and hear] without validation. A former scientist working at Pfizer . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review) insisted that vaccines do not help COVID-19. Because vaccines are not good for our body. [\u2026] And even the medical practitioners or doctors themselves cannot help if someone suffers the adverse reaction of the vaccine (A1, female).I was working in a school and was looking after a child whose mother was busy. The child was very smart, but was diagnosed with autism. When he had checkups, I would accompany him and observe. Then I researched about autism, and found that it is caused by vaccines. No wonder there are many children with autism; it is associated with vaccines (A2, female).When my child was in Grade 5, she was injected with Dengvaxia and had rashes and headaches. I did not know until my child told me because there were children dying from Dengvaxia. My child completed three doses causing her to feel unwell. I did not know it was Dengvaxia; I thought the form I signed was for anti-dengue. My husband and I just prayed because we were afraid. One classmate of hers even died because of Dengvaxia, although there was no proof and autopsy was not done. After that experience, I no longer allow my children to get any of the vaccines. I I am more afraid of vaccines. Once you inject that into your body, you will not be able to reverse its effects or take it out of your system. With COVID, if you are just careful and follow health protocols, and strengthen your immune system, I do not think you will immediately get sick. Compared to the vaccines we are not sure how safe they are (B2, female).So I told my son, \"Why do we need a booster\"? Because you know, if it's not really 100% [effective], you need a booster after 6 [months] or 1 year. You know what, my son answered me, \"You know mom, if you don't die from the first dose, they give you a second dose to make sure that you really die. If you don't die from the second dose, then they give you a booster\". It's funny, it's funny (A2, female).As early as now, we see that after vaccination, people are dying. Although medical professionals do not claim that it is caused by the vaccine. But if we really apply the law of proximate cause\u2026 Those individuals .

(which was not certified by peer review) who went to the site to get vaccinated are healthy, even though they have comorbidities they were okay prior getting the vaccine. Why is it after the vaccination, a person will just suddenly die? [\u2026] But then, the doctors would just say that it was not caused by the vaccine\u2026 that it was because of his comorbidity. Before vaccination, he was [alive] and kicking. But after vaccination, this senior citizen in our place just died. So this is what we are saying. If the vaccine is really a guarantee to solve this problem, then it should not cause mortality (A1, female).The elderly are just at home. In other words, they [we] do not go out and interact with people. The vaccine should just be given to the frontliners and those working in the health care sector (A2, female).The elderly and those with comorbiditiesthey need the vaccine more than I do. In my experience of getting COVID, I only had mild disease.",
