            "text": "A meta-analysis suggested that interdental brushing was the most effective method for cleaning residual plaque in interproximal areas [6] . Although young adults were periodontally healthy, interdental hygiene requirements in this population were high, and most of the interproximal areas could be accessed by an interdental brush [7] . Waerhaug [8] suggested that interdental brushing could remove plaque from 2.0-2.5 mm below the gingival margin. However, longitudinal clinical investigations have not supported the effects of using interdental brushes. Furthermore, there is little evidence for oral professionals to refer to while educating dental patients on the method and frequency of interdental brushing to manage healthy gingival tissues. 2 of 9 An interdental brush can be used as a tool for periodontal assessment. Hofer et al. [9] reported that interdental brushes could be a valid alternative to a periodontal probe for assessing marginal bleeding in patients with gingivitis. Rosenauer et al. [10] also suggested that the interdental brush could detect potential pathological processes in the interproximal areas; they also demonstrated a significant decrease in bleeding tendency in the group that used an interdental brush, relative to the control group. Bourgeois et al. [11] also investigated the use of an interdental brush as a tool to measure periodontitis and showed that daily use of calibrated interdental brushes reduced interdental bleeding.",

These indices mainly consider gingival bleeding at the interdental sites because one of the characteristics of gingivitis is bleeding upon provocation [13] . Biofilm-induced gingivitis is characterized by biofilm formation at the gingival margin, changes in gingival color and contour, changes in sulcular temperature, increased gingival exudation, absence of attachment loss and bone loss, and histological changes. The ideal parameter should be objective (i.e., not susceptible to subjective interpretation), inexpensive, not time consuming, and easy to use for clinicians to ensure widespread application [14] . Thus, gingival health, including the presence of dental plaque and gingival bleeding, needs to be assessed quickly with minimal instrumentation.",

Moreover, the time and technique required to perform interdental cleaning also impedes compliance [15] . Thus, the degree of interdental irrigation and associated bleeding can be used as a measure of gum health, and through exponential assessment, utilizing the most commonly available interdental brushes. We hypothesized that it is possible to evaluate oral health. The purpose of this study is to identify the bleeding reduction effect of the triweekly interdental toothbrush using the bleeding on full-mouth interdental brushing (BOFIB) index over a period of 6 months. In this way, we tried to establish an objective basis for utilization for self-oral health management and specialist oral health management as one auxiliary index to assist the evaluation of gum health.",

The dentist then observed the bloodstained interdental brush and recorded the BOFIB index (Table 2) as follows: BOFIB0, no bleeding and only little white plaque noted after full-mouth interdental brushing; BOFIB1, no bleeding and moderate yellowish plaque noted after full-mouth interdental brushing; BOFIB2, slight bleeding after fullmouth interdental brushing; BOFIB3, abundant bleeding after full-mouth interdental brushing; and BOFIB4, abundant bleeding during full-mouth interdental brushing.

Table 3 shows the subject characteristics according to changes in oral health behaviors after interdental brushing education. The univariate associations between the change in habits for interdental brushing and explanatory variables were confirmed using a chisquare test and ANOVA. The mean age of the participants was 36.41 years, 51.80 years, and 52.00 years in the IB-NN, IB-NY, and IB-YY groups, respectively. The IB-YY group did not have past and current smokers. \"S\" was the largest interdental brush size used in this study.

At baseline, the BOFIB scores were 2.88, 3.00, and 1.75 in the IB-NN, IB-NY, and IB-YY groups, respectively. The BOFIB score decreased after triweekly interdental brushing in all the groups, and the differences were significant (p < 0.001). In particular, the BOFIB score in the IB-NY group reduced to 1.40.

Previous studies have evaluated changes in bleeding using indices such as EIB, BOIB, or BOB; however, these indices only evaluate bleeding and may not reflect the interproximal plaque. Plaque is the primary factor in periodontal inflammation, and effective plaque removal is the basis for periodontal management. The BOFIB index allows quick assessment of interdental health and may help identify the interproximal plaque for removal.",

The information leaflet included predictable complications, such as pain, bleeding, or gingival recession, which could be acceptable during the healing of gingivitis. Unfortunately, 17 of the 26 participants in the IB-NN group had not used the interdental brush more than twice per week during the six months of the program. Moreover, 11 participants in the IB-NN group reported that interdental brushing was uncomfortable or unnecessary. These findings show the difficulties encountered with behavioral change in oral health education.",

Moreover, most people who do not experience oral pain (e.g., patients with mild periodontitis) seldom visit dental clinics or hospitals. For these reasons, only 26 of the 76 participants from the first visit remained in the study at six months. Second, the periodontal assessment was performed using BOFIB and not clinical attachment loss (CAL). Therefore, we did not assess the periodontal attachment level because the results were obtained from an oral health promotion program. However, this study used retrospective oral health promotion data, and participants who needed periodontal treatment were excluded because they should receive periodontal treatment in dental clinics or hospitals. Obtaining CAL and pocket depth measurements of the sextant area of the mouth is time consuming, especially in a busy clinic. Moreover, if recorded, these values may have a large standard deviation [18, 19] , making them unreliable without deliberate calibration training.",

The management of periodontal patients can be permanently adjusted, including self-management through a variety of oral care tools, less complex treatment and a more comprehensive and deterministic approach [20] . The results of this study showed that BOFIB was relatively well maintained by those who were educated to manage their teeth at least once every two days [21] and who continuously managed for three or more times per week. Therefore, interdental brush can be recommended using it at least once every two days in consideration of individual oral health status and oral health related habits such as smoking. Interdental brushes, which are representative tools for self-oral health management of periodontal disease, can use the state of periodontal health as a self-assessment and an evaluable index by experts, as in this study. It is considered that it can be used as a research result that can promote the global oral health in the non-face-to-face era by expanding and disseminating through subsequent research and presenting accurate indicators for self-oral health management.",

When planning future large-scale cross-sectional studies or longitude follow-up studies that measure the BOFIB comparing CALs and BOPs, it is possible that this study's results will be served as a pilot study when calculating sample counts. However, our data may present a basis for patient education and motivate them to use an interdental brush, and the results should be discussed and how they can be interpreted from the perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.",
