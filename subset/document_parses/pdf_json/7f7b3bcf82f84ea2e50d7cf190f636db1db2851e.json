From these complications nephropathy has more magnitude (80.6%) among anemic patients than among non-anemic diabetic patients (34.4%) [4] . Anemia is defined as hemoglobin level < 13 g/dl in men and 12g/dl in females [5] . In addition to this, deficiency in the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood caused by a diminished erythrocyte mass or reduction in the hemoglobin concentration of the blood may indicate anemia [6] . It is a condition in which the number of red blood cells (and consequently their oxygencarrying capacity) is insufficient to meet the body's physiologic needs. Specific physiologic needs vary based on a person's age, gender, residential elevation above sea level (altitude), smoking behavior, and different stages of pregnancy [7] .",

Diabetic patients are more affected by anemia when compared with non-diabetic patients. Socio-demographic characteristics and glycemic index are statistically correlated with anemia among type II diabetic patients [9] . An increase in evidence suggests that anemia in the diabetic population, whether type I or type II, is a potent and independent predictor of the increased risk for macro-vascular and micro-vascular complications of diabetes [10] .

This prevalence is in accordance with the studies conducted in different parts of Ethiopia [11, 12] . However, the prevalence of anemia in our study is lower when compared with findings of the study conducted among patients attending public hospitals in the Harari region of Ethiopia [13] , which was 34.8% and the over representation might be because of the inclusion of only type II adult DM patients in the study. In addition to this, greatly different life styles of the two populations also matters. Similarly, results of the study conducted among adult DM patients at Debre Tabor General Hospital demonstrated a higher prevalence of anemia29.8% [14] , when compared with findings of the present study. The findings from a study in Pakistan showed a significantly higher prevalence of anemia among type II DM patients [15] , which might be caused by a difference in the instrument used to measure the level of hemoglobin. The afore mentioned study used HbA1c to measure hemoglobin level. In another way, the mismatch can be explained by the composition of our study subjects. In this study, the study subjects were both type I and type II DM patients, whereas the mentioned study was conducted only in type II diabetic patients.

In contrast, our result indicates that females have nearly three times higher chance of developing anemia when compared with males. Higher rate of anemia in females can be because of monthly physiological blood loss in the form of menstruation and the culture of food eating in this study framework where females fed the rest of family members before having food for themselves. This result is comparable with findings from different studies [15, 18, 19] . A report from the University of Benin Teaching Hospital stated that there is no significant difference in the risk of anemia between males and females [20] , which contradict our findings.

This can be explained by the fact that patients with type II DM pass through a period of pre-diabetes and may experience renal impairment at the time of diagnosis, which exposes patients to a higher risk of anemia. Similar to our findings, it has been also suggested by other studies that anemia is related to type II DM patients [17] . Similar findings of study conducted in Northeast Ethiopia demonstrated that having type II DM is nearly 2.4 times risky in developing anemia, when compared with those who have type I DM [22] .",
