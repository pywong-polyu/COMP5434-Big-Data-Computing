COVID-19 has generated, and continues to generate, a plethora of social work literature. Our narrative literature review is designed to provide a snapshot of international research to inform the findings of our questionnaire. As such, the review focused on academic refereed papers published during 2020. The databases searched included EBSCO, Google Scholar, Proquest, Wiley online Library and Taylor and Francis, and key search terms were COVID* OR 'novel coronavirus' OR '2019-nCoV' AND Social Work*. The search produced 43 papers emerging from countries including USA, Israel, England, Netherlands, Hungary, Vietnam, Poland, Spain, Greece, Scotland, United Emirates, Australia, Turkey, Canada, Malaysia, Jamaica, India, Lebanon, China and countries of Africa.",

As well, twenty-six qualitative questions gave scope for respondents to provide more detail on the issues emerging in their practice, the impact of COVID-19 on the organisation and work environment, changes made to practice and the personal and professional impacts of COVID-19.

The project and online access point for the questionnaire were advertised through existing social work contacts, through the national social work professional bodies in both New Zealand and Australia, the Australia and New Zealand Social Work and Welfare Education and Research body and the Social Workers Registration Board in New Zealand. At the close-off of the questionnaire, 208 respondents had recorded their responses, 148 of these were from New Zealand and 60 from Australia.",

This process was undertaken by the research student (second author) and the lead author. Because the questionnaire had deliberately included several qualitative questions, it took approximately forty minutes to complete and the response rate indicates the desire by many social workers to give this time to the research. Table 1 provides a summary of the demographics of the respondents, indicating that 84 percent are female, 45 percent had caring responsibilities, 75 percent worked full time and 58 percent noted they had experienced a disaster in the last ten years. Of those who had worked in a disaster context, 38 percent noted the area had not yet recovered. Thus, there were several communities still experiencing the impacts of previous disasters that are now being called on to find the physical and mental resources to address the pandemic.",

This would appear to be a result of workers adjusting their practice to hard lockdown conditions. During lockdown periods, workers have adopted technology to reach vulnerable clients and this has brought new issues related to the adequacy of assessment of client needs, the potential risks to clients locked down in their homes with limited access to support systems and problems with connectivity.",

In this regard, gender is an evident and complex aspect of any analysis of the work of social workers during the pandemic. Our sample, and indeed the social work profession, is dominated by women. As a result, the complex interplay of work and family is a significant factor in our survey findings and our literature review (see e.g. Fargion et al., 2020 , in relation to Italian social workers and Necel and Zare R ba, 2020, in relation to Poland). In Australia and New Zealand, the closure of schools and the need to homeschool children occurred at the same time as workloads were increasing, client needs were expanding and many workers were working from home. In this environment, female workers experienced a particular overload.",

Some workers noted particular circumstances where clients and families were critically impacted in cases where they had no access to, or unreliable, Internet services (including those who were homeless); delayed family court hearings and the lengthening of waiting time for court sessions; the difficulties associated with visiting children who are in care and problems relating to needing documents signed. Issues associated with pandemic safety were also raised, including the need to practise social distancing; the need for PPE (and problems when this was not available); the need to screen staff regularly for the virus and the need to wipe down surfaces and the delays this caused on a regular basis. There were also strong indications of pandemic fatigue being experienced by workers.",

The timing of the survey also gave workers the opportunity to reflect on the 'new normal' of immediate post-lockdown working, whilst retaining certain lockdown practices such as the increased use of virtual communication and the changed incidence of reporting once restrictions were relaxed. Similarly, the prior experiences of disasters meant that social work services and their workers were arguably able to move more quickly to disaster mode. Disaster plans were quickly instigated, previous training was built on and good practices were quickly in place. Where Australian and New Zealand services appear to lag is in the problems encountered by workers relating to connectivity and Internet services. This is reflective of both the reliance of rural and remote areas on satellite connections and the slow rollout of fibre to replace copper wire connections in urban settings. This may raise a further issue of the diverse nature of social work within different technological environments. Further, there would appear to be room for the development of telehealth protocols to facilitate the delivery of services and training for workers to ensure they are confident in their online practice.",
