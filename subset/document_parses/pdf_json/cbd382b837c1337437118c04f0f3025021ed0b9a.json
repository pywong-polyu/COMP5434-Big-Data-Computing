In this study, we investigated how People's Daily communicated COVID-19 messages on Weibo. Drawing on the Appraisal Framework, we developed a three-stage mixed method approach to study 400 COVID-19 posts to identify the attitude resources employed and their association with public engagement. We found that attitudinal posts were more engaging than non-attitudinal posts. Judgment, both positive and negative, was positively associated with public engagement, whereas the use of positive Affect and Appreciation could be ineffective. These findings contribute to the understanding of how public engagement on social media can be enhanced through the use of attitudinal messages in health emergencies.",

            "text": "Although social media offers opportunities for health crisis communication, the expected impact of such communication heavily relies on what the crisis messages are and how they are communicated. To study such messages, extant research focused on dimensions such as content frames, narrative or nonnarrative styles, and emotions. For example, one study found that when reporting a health crisis, 'action' and 'consequence' were the two most salient frames employed in the New York Times (Shih et al., 2008) : the 'action' frame stressed actions taken against the disease and prevention measures that can be adopted, whereas the 'consequence' frame mainly focused on the disease's health and socioeconomic impact. Another study of People's Daily found that while 'action' was also salient, the other frames that were predominant included 'new evidence' and 'reassurance' (Ngai et al., 2020) . Further research also investigated the different message styles, i.e., narratives (information delivered in a storytelling manner) and nonnarratives (information delivered in a more direct manner, for example, by citing statistical evidence), used in health crisis communication (Ngai et al., 2020; Bekalu et al., 2018) . Additionally, some research examined message appeals (emotional and rational appeals) (Huang and DiStaso, 2020) and the differential use of positive emotions (e.g., reassurance and relief) and negative emotions (e.g., concern and frustration) (Guidry et al., 2017; Liu and Kim, 2011) . Such features in the sender's messages were found to have varying impacts on public engagement. For example, narrative style and emotional messages positively predicted social media users' intention to interact by 'liking' or 'sharing' the messages (Ngai et al., 2020; Huang and DiStaso, 2020) .",

From the perspective of discourse and linguistic studies, an attitude analysis is critical for fully understanding the sender's messages because this could reveal how the sender intends to interact with the receiver and the feelings the sender aims to share, and such an analysis is directly linked to how the receiver is positioned to feel (Martin and White, 2005) . The paucity of such studies hinders our understanding of the attitude resources that have been employed by health crisis communicators and the potential impact of such resources on crisis communication. This study is therefore presented as a modest attempt to address this gap by studying how attitudes were communicated by People's Daily to engage publics during the COVID-19 crisis in a social media context.",

Affect addresses people's emotional reactions (e.g., she is pleased by her speedy recovery), whereas Judgment and Appreciation are more concerned with shared community values, i.e., values by which people's behaviors can be assessed in terms of their ethics-Judgment (e.g., she is very kind to her patients); and values with which objects or events can be evaluated in terms of their impact, complexity, and worth-Appreciation (e.g., the current situation is rather complex).",

To understand the attitudes People's Daily exhibited in its public communication during COVID-19, this study considers adopting the Attitude system for analysis. Instead of making general comments based on the entirety of a text, the Attitude system offers a bottom-up approach of textual analysis grounded in the close reading of each linguistic choice made in the text that signifies a particular kind of attitude and, therefore, enables a systematic account of the sender's attitudes.",

Following extant research, we investigated the level of public engagement in terms of 'likes', 'shares', and 'comments' on social media (e.g., Ngai et al., 2020; Kang, 2014; Park et al., 2016; Yuki, 2015) . In this study, we focused first on the potential effect of different attitude dimensions, i.e., Affect, Judgment, and Appreciation on public engagement, as this could shed light on the dimension that was the most effective in eliciting public engagement. Moreover, we also explored the effect of different valences on public engagement during the health crisis, which is characteristic of negative feelings . By doing so, we aimed to reveal the impact of congruent attitudes (negative valence) and incongruent attitudes (positive valence).

            "text": "This study employed a three-stage mixed method approach incorporating content analysis (including quantitative and qualitative content analyses) and textual analysis. A quantitative content analysis, which was employed in both stages one and two in this study, is a unobtrusive method that allows researchers to \"assess words, phrases, or intext relationships\" (Boettger and Palmer, 2010:346) in media messages (Allen, 2017; Bock et al., 2011) in a scientific and systematic manner (Bock et al., 2011) . This analytic method can produce generalizable predictions (Krippendorff, 2004) and \"make conclusions about their presence\" (Boettger and Palmer, 2010:346-357) . Specifically, in a quantitative content analysis, predefined coding categories that are mutually exclusive are employed, and different raters are independently involved in the coding process (Boettger and Palmer, 2010) . The generalizability of the results of such an analysis could then be tested using inferential statistics (Boettger and Palmer, 2010) . In stage one, a quantitative content analysis was conducted to reveal the presence of attitudes in People's Daily's COVID-19 communication using the Attitude system in the Appraisal Framework. Then, we performed a statistical analysis to confirm the association between posts embedded with attitude resources and public engagement (RQ1). Next, we employed quantitative content analysis to reveal the distributions of the attitude dimensions (Affect/Judgment/Appreciation) and their valences (positive/negative) (RQ2a) in the attitudinal posts identified in the first stage using the Attitude system. Regarding inscribed and invoked attitudes (RQ2b), considering that an attitude may be co-constructed by both inscription and invocation rather than solely by either of the two, instead of conducting a quantitative content analysis, we conducted a qualitative content analysis as this approach allows a single unit to be coded under multiple categories (Boettger and Palmer, 2010) . A qualitative content analysis was also preferred for the examination of emotions of Affect, values of Judgment and Appreciation, and the appraised (RQ2c) as a predefined framework or specific items for coding are lacking. The researchers were required to scrutinize and interpret the text (Boettger and Palmer, 2010) to identify the related emotions, values, and the appraised. Categories were established and refined on an emergent and iterative basis (Boettger and Palmer, 2010) . Given that such qualitative analyses do not employ multiple raters and allow doublecoding, inferential statistics should be avoided as they may result in false inferences (Boettger and Palmer, 2010) . Textual analysis was also introduced in the second stage to provide an in-depth elaboration of the use of Affect, Judgment, and Appreciation. In the third stage, we performed an inferential statistical analysis to examine the effect of Affect, Judgment, and Appreciation and their valences on different levels of public engagement (RQ3).",

In defining the unit of analysis, we first considered the construct of 'clause'. Compared with the well-developed status of 'clause' in English grammar, clauses are not traditionally considered units in the rank scale of Chinese grammar, and the term has been less well defined (He and Zhong, 2017). Studies have revealed an ongoing debate regarding the operational definitions of the concept in Chinese grammar (e.g., Guo, 2013; He and Zhong, 2017; Song et al., 2017) . For example, some scholars proposed defining clauses as an extension of verbal groups following English grammar (Guo and He, 2012) , but were criticized for overlooking the fact that Chinese predicators can be filled by a range of elements in addition to verbal groups (e.g., adjectives) (He and Zhong, 2017). Others suggested that the presence of intonation could be taken as a key criterion in identifying Chinese clauses (Chu and Wang, 2009) , but this was also considered problematic due to the subjective nature of determining the presence or absence of intonation (Song et al., 2017) . Due to the indeterminacies in identifying clause boundaries in Chinese, we decided to use sentences as the unit for this analysis. A sentence is considered a meaningful unit in a content analysis of written documents (Krippendorff, 2004) , although sentences are only considered as a written textual unit rather than a grammatical unit in systemic functional grammar (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2014) . Specifically, we coded the presence of Affect, Judgment, and Appreciation based on their dominance on a sentence basis. In the case where more than one attitude dimensions appeared in the same sentence, we analyzed the attitudes in the text to determine which dimension was foregrounded. Example (1) serves as a case in point. The recounting of the behaviors of soldiers (who 'guard lives, guard hopes, guard the hustle and bustle of life') elicits Judgment toward their attribute, whereas the lexical choice of \u653e\u5fc3 'assured' at the end of the sentence indicates an emotion (Affect). Considering that the verb \u5b88\u62a4 'guard' that represents the soldiers' behavior is rendered with repetitions, the elicited attitude (i.e., Judgment) is further amplified (cf., Martin and White, 2005:144) ; therefore, we considered Judgment the dominant attitude exhibited in this sentence.",

In contrast, an attitude expressed with indirect realization, such as by presenting an event or a situation without explicit markers, was included as 'invocation'. For example, from the recounting of 'he reunited with his family', positive Affect can be inferred, and this Affect could therefore be counted as being invoked rather than inscribed.

To ensure interrater reliability in the coding of attitude resources, the coder was repeatedly trained on the coding scheme. All disagreements between the author/first coder and the second coder were discussed. The measure of interrater reliability was based on the co-coding of 80 posts from the data pool (20% of the total number of posts sampled) (Boettger and Palmer, 2010) .

We used SPSS to examine whether the assumptions of Poisson Regression are met. When there was a violation of the assumptions, such as the overdispersion of outcome variables, which is expected in the real-world dataset (Sroka and Nagaraja, 2018) , we replaced Poisson Regression with Negative Binomial Regression (NB2) (Herbison et al., 2015) to improve the Goodness of Fit, particularly Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). NB2 is effective in fitting various types of data seen in public health research (Gurland, 1959) , and \"the negative binomial model is a more general model compared with the Poisson regression model that relaxes the strong assumption that the underlying rate of the outcome is the same for each included participant\" (Herbison et al., 2015:7) .",

Here, 'admiration' is a respectful feeling directed at not only health care workers but also PLA soldiers, construction workers, and police officers, praising them for contributing admirably at the forefront. The second most frequent type of Affect toward frontliners was 'sympathy' (n = 16), which is negative in valence, as it involves feelings of empathy and sadness toward frontliners' plight brought on by stress, high risks, and overwork as they attempt to cope with the pandemic. 'Gratitude' was also expressed as the dominant emotion in seven sentences, thanking frontliners as they worked to ensure the well-being of patients and publics in general. In the remaining 7.7% Affect, 'gratitude', 'admiration', 'sympathy', and 'anxiety' appraised people/agents other than frontliners, i.e., international counterparts (n = 6, 3.3%), patients (n = 4, 2.2%), and publics (n = 4, 2.2%). Seven sentences of gratitude were expressed to thank China's international counterparts (e.g., Japan and the UK) for their support, COVID-19 survivors for donating their plasma, and members of publics for volunteering to help. Negative Affect, namely, 'sympathy' and 'anxiety', was also used to express empathy, sadness, and worry mainly over the physical and emotional sufferings of COVID-19 victims and the increasingly grim challenge of COVID-19 facing other countries.",

In contrast, the explicit use of attitudinal lexes was absent in 80 cases (43.5%) of Affect in which emotions were solely represented by invocation, as illustrated in Example (3). In addition to the exclusive use of either inscription or invocation, People's Daily also paired both within the same sentence to represent Affect (n = 23, 12.0%).

For example, 'incompetent/reckless' referred to actions assessed to be impotent, unsuccessful, and careless, whereas Judgment of 'immoral' behaviors included those that were unfair, cruel, dishonest, selfish, and malicious. Among the sentences of negative Judgment, 24 pointed to individuals (19 in the 'publics' category; five in the 'patients' category) who acted recklessly (e.g., not wearing masks) or behaved immorally (e.g., spreading rumors or not being honest about the travel history to high-risk areas); 20 sentences singled out individual government officials (n = 15) and non-governmental organizations such as local charity (n = 5), criticizing their incompetency and corruption. As for international counter- (n = 193, 58.8%) . In such cases, attitudes were elicited as People's Daily offered factual descriptions of how people behaved during the COVID-19 pandemic without explicitly appraising such behaviors as either good or bad and appropriate or inappropriate. In Example (5), the kindness of a Japanese city was highlighted not with any Judgment lexes but through presenting the actual actions it carried out in helping China. In addition to invocation, Judgment was also inscribed (n = 73, 22.3%). First, positive attitudinal lexes such as \u575a\u51b3 'resolute', \u6210\u529f 'successful', and \u5584\u826f 'kind' were used to directly evaluate people's actions. Second, directives were also considered inscribed Judgment because they directly indicate authorial approval/disapproval toward a behavior similar to lexicalized Judgment (Martin and White, 2005:55, 181) . Thus, such directives could inscribe Judgment toward actions to be carried out in the future through modulations of obligations (e.g., \u8981 'need', \u5fc5\u987b 'must', and \u4e0d\u5e94 'shouldn't') or direct commands (e.g., \u52e4\u6d17\u624b 'wash hands frequently'). Finally, Judgment was expressed by patterning both inscription and invocation (n = 62, 18.9%). In Example (6), negative Judgment was both inscribed (\u6076\u52a3 'abominable') and invoked (information regarding the actions carried out).",

To answer RQ3, the following analysis explored the question further to determine whether a difference exists in the public response generated by Affect, Judgment, and Appreciation. To that end, as introduced in Section 4.6, we selected Negative Binomial Regression (NB2) to test the effect of the three attitude dimensions on the number of 'likes', 'shares' and 'comments'. The Omnibus tests indicated that the overall model was a significant improvement in fit over a null model for predicting 'likes' (p < .0001), 'shares' (p < .0001), and 'comments' (p < .001). Specifically, in terms of 'likes', for each additional sentence in the Judgment dimension, the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) indicated that 1.326 (95% CI, 1.128 to 1.560) times more 'likes' were generated, which was a statistically significant result, p = .001. In terms of 'shares', both Affect (p = .007) and Judgment (p < .0001) were significant and positive predictors: the IRR indicated that each sentence increase in Affect generated 1.370 (95% CI, 1.089 to 1.724) times more 'shares', whereas each sentence increase in Judgment resulted in 1.567 (95% CI, 1.359 to 1.806) times more 'shares', an impact slightly larger than that of Affect. Finally, Affect was a negative and significant predictor of 'comments', p = .007.

            "text": "Furthermore, as a dominant dimension of the sender's attitudes, Judgment had a more consistent positive impact on public engagement than Affect and Appreciation. According to Martin and White (2005) , Judgment is distinct from the other two attitude dimensions because it is an institutionalized attitude that socially assesses people's behaviors according to shared ethical values. This ethical nature perhaps helps explain the prominence of Judgment in COVID-19 communication. As Kotalik (2005:424) argued, \"every discourse about health care has not only a scientific but also a moral dimension\". As with all public health crises, a key challenge faced in the COVID-19 pandemic is the overwhelming health care needs confronting the limited resources available. Thus, all decisions regarding resource allocation should be evaluated based onnot only medical science but also shared ethical concerns about fairness, accountability, trustworthiness, and transparency (Thompson et al., 2006) . When a crisis hits, such ethical concerns are magnified and would put the behaviors of key actors (e.g., government institutions) under intensified media scrutiny (Lee, 2009 ). Failure to address such concerns during health crises tends to incur heavy costs, such as the loss of public trust, lack of morale, confusion, and stigmatization (Bell et al., 2004; Bernstein and Hawryluck, 2003) . Furthermore, for a highly collectivist society such as China where people are very much 'we'-conscious, such ethical concerns are placed in an even more prominent position on the level of whether people's behaviors conform to the social norm shared by the 'in groups' (Hofstede, 2001) . The transgression of social norms is considered harmful to the interest of the \"in groups\" and is often strongly rejected. Proactively seeking to address ethical concerns, People's Daily employed a generous amount of Judgment resources. This effort in emphasizing Judgment paid off, as it attracted a high level of public engagement on social media. Although both valences of Judgment elicited a higher level of 'likes', an indicator of a higher awareness of the communicated message, positive Judgment and negative Judgment functioned differently in encouraging advocacy and interaction: negative Judgment stimulated more interaction by encouraging publics to voice their opinions, whereas positive Judgment played a role in generating more 'shares', suggesting a higher level of advocacy in the spreading of the desirable behaviors communicated with positive Judgment.",

Such dominance of positivity from the sender's end is consistent with what crisis communication scholars recommend on the ground that a greater amount of positive information should be communicated to counterbalance the overwhelming negativity during times of crisis (Covello et al., 2001) . Indeed, during outbreaks such as COVID-19, publics are likely to experience a range of negative emotions, including fear, anxiety, and helplessness, as their emotional disposition . Negative information in news reports updated on a daily basis, such as mortality and morbidity statistics indicative of the alarming speed of viral transmission, could create further tension and increase negative feelings (Bavel et al., 2020) . Such negative emotions can exert a detrimental impact on crisis management by causing anxiety, which harms people's health, and creating mental noise, which interferes with their cognitive ability to process rational information (Covello et al., 2001) . To counterbalance such negativity, positive valence in all three attitude dimensions was deemed essential: positive Affect served to alleviate negative feelings by reassuring publics and keeping them hopeful; positive Judgment functioned to shape a positive ethical evaluation of key actors in crisis relief; and positive Appreciation mainly highlighted the effectiveness and importance of crisis management.",

According to a survey of Hofstede's dimensional model of national culture, a strong orientation shared in Chinese culture is restraint (Hofstede, 2001) , which refers to people's tendency to control desires and impulses and a general feeling that it is not right to pursue mere gratification by indulging oneself (Hofstede, 2001) . Therefore, it is a possibility that people in a restrained culture may identify less with positive emotions and react critically to those who indulge themselves in meeting personal desires, especially at the cost of violating social norms. For example, a post criticizing those who went out with friends for pleasure-seeking activities without wearing masks generated heavy criticism, such as the one in Example (7). Although such a pleasureseeking activity occurred only in late February 2020 when the spread of the virus was largely contained in China, the social norms of mask-wearing and social distancing were still very much in place; therefore, violating these norms just for the sake of having fun was deemed unacceptable.",

In particular, the role of attitudes in promoting 'shares' on social media merits special attention because such an action is an indicator of the awareness of the information and advocacy for it to spread. The latter is especially important in health crisis communication. These attitudes can be designed to combine a variety of emotional reactions, behavioral judgments, and object/event evaluations, appraising the crisis management effort and the people, organizations, and countries involved.",

Another interesting implication is that the use of negative attitudes may create an even larger impact on public responses than positive attitudes. This might be particularly true in collectivist contexts that endorse restraint, such as in China, where negative attitudes may strike a stronger chord, and violations of social norms can trigger indignation and provoke heated discussion, which, in turn, reinforces shared norms that facilitate the containment of viral transmission during a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",
