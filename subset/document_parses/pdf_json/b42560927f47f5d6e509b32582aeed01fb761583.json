Given their experience with this syndrome, NCI quickly launched the trial and is conducting it with adult and pediatric patients affected by cancer and COVID-19 who have severe respiratory complications thought to be caused by cytokine storm. The protocol will evaluate whether the anti-IL6R antibody will reduce time on ventilators and time in the intensive care unit for these patients.
