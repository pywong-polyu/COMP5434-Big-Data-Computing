These marketing practices have been shown to influence children's taste preferences, purchase requests, and consumption patterns [2, 4, 6] . As a result, child-appealing marketing is contributing to poor diet quality and the growing burden of childhood obesity and diet-related chronic disease [1, 2, 7] . In response, the World Health Organization has recommended limiting the exposure and power of child-appealing marketing as a preventative action against childhood obesity [8, 9] . Many countries are considering or have already implemented mandatory or voluntary child-appealing marketing restrictions [10, 11] , and recent evidence points to the potential effectiveness of these policies in improving the healthfulness of the food supply and consequently, children's health [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

The CAP tool includes marketing techniques that are popular on product packaging specifically (e.g., cartoon characters, toys in the box), as well as techniques that have traditionally been used in other marketing platforms but are now appearing on packaging with evolving marketing practices (e.g., social media handles, scannable codes linked to websites).",

Core techniques are marketing techniques that could independently make a package appealing to children (e.g., cartoon characters or games on the package). Core techniques are also those that are typically included in marketing regulations or restrictions, as these are more \"objectively\" or defensibly appealing to children. Broad techniques are marketing techniques that would not on their own cause a product to be considered \"child-appealing\", however, in addition to the core techniques, these could increase the power of the marketing message as a whole (e.g., appeals to nutrition, health or value). Evidence has shown that marketing techniques such as promoting a product's health, nutritional or economic value were amongst the most popular techniques used in child-appealing marketing research, despite them not being typical child-appealing techniques [16, 17] . Broad techniques also include marketing techniques that may not appeal directly to children but may appeal to their parents or caregivers (e.g., product benefit claims, convenient packaging), and therefore be purchased for children. These techniques are important to monitor, given that when/if child-appealing marketing is restricted, a proliferation of broad techniques may occur as a means for manufacturers to circumvent regulations and ensure that their products are still consumed by children.",

Finally, the CAP tool scores marketing power by summing all the techniques (core and broad) displayed on the package, based on evidence that the number of marketing techniques displayed on the package increases the persuasiveness or intensity of the marketing message [19, 20] .

The demographic information for participants is presented in Table 2 . In one study session, each child individually completed a classification activity using the breakfast cereals, and then participated in a focus group discussion with all other children. During the individual classification activity, children were asked to observe all sides of the six cereal packages and were asked (1) to decide if each of the individual cereal boxes was for children (i.e., a binary (yes/no) response) and (2) to put the cereal boxes in order of which they liked the most to which they liked the least (i.e., a ranked (1 to 6) response). Children's responses were recorded by a member of the research team. The children who were awaiting participation were kept occupied by another member of the research team in a separate area as to not bias their responses by hearing the previous children's responses. Boxes were rearranged between participants into a predetermined random order to ensure consistency between participants. 1 The SES group was defined based on the percentage of the population that was below the low-income measure after tax (%LIMAT) in the participant's neighborhood of residence (according to the 2016 City of Toronto Census data: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/ neighbourhood-profiles/ (accessed on 10 February 2020)) determined by their postal code.

Overall, qualitative analyses suggest that the CAP tool has content validity in that it measures child-appeal using a list of techniques that correspond to the aspects of packaging that children discussed in the focus groups. Three key themes emerged from the content analysis related to the aspects of packaging that drove its appeal to children. Firstly, it was clear that the children were drawn to cereal boxes (and food packaging more generally), that were, in their words: \"Fun\", \"cool\", \"exciting\", and \"interesting\". They thought that packages that displayed these characteristics (e.g., \"fun\", \"cool\") were meant for them or other kids. Conversely, children thought that if cereals were \"boring and plain\", \"not really exciting\" or if \"they just look like normal cereal\", they were not meant for kids and should be for adults. These notions served as explanations for many of the children's decisions on whether a particular cereal box was \"for kids\" or not. Children were adamant that aspects of the package's design, such as color, the presence of characters, and a \"kiddie atmosphere\" were key for building its overall appeal (or how \"fun\" it was).

Having a cereal that \"looks yummy\" was also key in driving a cereal's attractiveness, according to children. Many of the aspects of packaging that children mentioned most often as generating appeal or making them think a cereal was \"for kids\" correspond to the core marketing techniques in the CAP tool, examples of which are shown in Table 5 . Importantly, it was apparent from the discussions that cereal boxes which were lacking these core techniques and were more \"plain\" or \"dull\", were not nearly as interesting or attractive to children.

Many of the broad techniques included in the CAP tool were also raised unprompted by participants as aspects of packaging that are important or attractive to them. For example, children mentioned various appeals to health and nutrition, however, whether this made them think a product was \"for kids\" was contentious. Some participants interpreted nutrition claims and other nutrition marketing as \"fun facts\" to have on children's food, while others perceived \"looking healthy\" as something meant for adults, and therefore not as important to them. Regardless, children were clearly drawn to aspects of health on product packaging and paid close attention to these marketing techniques. Children were also drawn to the concept of value, a characteristic they felt increased the attractiveness of the product. Children discussed value based on several different aspects, such as price, the size of the product or \"if you feel like you get something for buying it\", such as a prize. Participants also noted broad marketing techniques such as social media logos and giveaways that were not necessarily intended for children, discussing a prepaid gas card, in this instance as something of value to both them and their parents. Table 6 illustrates the pertinence of these broad marketing techniques. Table 6 . Examples of quotes illustrating children's discussion of broad marketing techniques.",

Contrarily, participants discussed that on plain or \"dull\" packages, \"there's no detail so its just less interesting\" to them. Put simply, the more \"fun\" and the less \"boring\" a package was, the more appealing it was to children. Participants explained that cereal boxes that looked more cool, more interesting, more exciting or a package that \"pops out on the shelf and doesn't fall back in all the brands\", are the ones they liked best. As discussed, there were several aspects of packaging that made a cereal stand out to kids, and consequently made them rank it higher than others during the activity. It was clear from the discussions that displaying multiple core techniques on product packaging was critical to creating a strong child appeal, and that lacking these core techniques made products less attractive to participants. Moreover, it became apparent that broad marketing techniques, while perhaps not as immediately salient and displayed alone, when appearing in combination with core techniques, were responsible for generating additional interest from children and ultimately building the package's overall appeal.",

            "text": "The goal of this pilot mixed-methods validation study was to evaluate the criterion and content validity of the CAP tool based on how children perceive marketing on product packaging. The results suggest that participants primarily thought cereals were \"for kids\" when they displayed core marketing techniques, and when they did not, participants did not feel these cereals were intended for them. The 80% agreement and \"moderate\" pairwise agreement between children's and the CAP tool's categorization of cereals as \"child-appealing\" was corroborated by the qualitative results which found that the display of core techniques was critical in driving the attractiveness of packaging for children. These findings suggest the validity of the CAP tool's binary measure of child-appealing packaging based on the display of one or more core techniques. This study also found validity in the CAP tool's marketing power score, defined by the number of marketing techniques displayed on the package. Quantitative results found a \"strong\" correlation between children's ranking of cereal boxes in order of preference and the CAP tool's ranking of cereal boxes according to the marketing power, with almost half of participants ranking in perfect correlation with the CAP tool. Moreover, each individual cereal was ranked either in perfect agreement between children and the CAP tool or within \u00b11 ranking, 88.9% of the time. The analysis of the focus group discussions confirmed that children were in fact more interested in packages that displayed more marketing techniques, and vice versa. While there were a very small number of gross-misclassifications (i.e., \u22653 rankings) in cereal rankings, these were not corroborated during the focus group analyses and results therefore suggest that the CAP tool's marketing power score is in line with children's attraction to packages with varying degrees of marketing. Additionally, two-thirds of the CAP tool marketing techniques were discussed by children at least once during this pilot study, suggesting that the types of marketing techniques included in the coding tool are in line with those that children find salient. It is worth acknowledging that one third of core techniques (n = 6/18) were not mentioned by children, inferring that those techniques are perhaps not actually critical in driving child-appeal. However, the CAP techniques that were not mentioned (i.e., presence of branded characters, licensed characters, celebrities, children/parents/families, and recipes (specifically appealing to children)) were not featured on the mock cereal packages and so may not have been specifically triggered in the minds of the children in this study. However, these unmentioned techniques are similar to techniques that were mentioned in the focus groups (e.g., \"other characters\") and are techniques that are frequently measured in the literature and found on food packages [16, 17, 47] . Therefore, these techniques were retained as core techniques in the CAP tool, but warrant further investigation in future studies. Importantly, qualitative analyses found that children were drawn to aspects of packaging other than typical child-appealing marketing techniques, namely, the CAP tool's broad techniques. These findings justify the inclusion of broad techniques within the CAP tool and its marketing power score, as these techniques, when displayed in combination with core techniques, are integral to building the overall appeal of the package-seen in children's consistently higher ranking of cereals displaying stronger marketing. This speaks to the importance of evaluating both core and broad marketing techniques as part of future child-appealing marketing monitoring activities, given that both seem to garner the attention of children.",

            "text": "The results of this work align with previous studies analyzing children's perceptions of food packaging. Previous research has highlighted the importance of core marketing techniques in creating product packaging that is appealing to children, such as the use of characters; color, and other visual elements; premiums and giveaways; games and activities; celebrity or athlete endorsements; etc. [16] [17] [18] [47] [48] [49] . The display of such techniques has also been shown to alter children's perception of taste and increase their attraction to the product [48, [50] [51] [52] , and have been further shown to translate into purchase requests and consumption patters [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . This body of evidence in the literature corroborates this study's findings that core techniques are critical to building children's interest in products and in determining which food products or instances of marketing should be considered \"child-appealing\". Additional studies have examined children's perceptions of broad marketing techniques, in particular, the use of appeals to health or nutrition. Nutrition marketing and nutritional components have been found to increase children's preference and/or choice of foods [48, [56] [57] [58] [59] . Others have found that packaging that \"looks healthy\" has a deterrent effect [60] . Regardless, these studies have shown that these aspects of packaging do not go unnoticed by children, despite not being specifically intended to appeal to them. These findings align with the results of the current study that found that appeals to nutrition and health, as well as other broad, non-children-specific marketing techniques were salient to children when observing packaged foods. This is an important consideration for policymakers if they wish to develop restrictions that will encompass the full spectrum of child-appealing marketing. Overall, this study builds on the broader body of literature by applying understandings of marketing on food packaging in a novel manner, by validating a coding tool to quantitatively measure child-appeal, in line with what children actually find appealing. Despite the preliminary nature of these results, their alignment with previous literature further supports the validity of the CAP tool in measuring child-appeal and marketing power.",

Moreover, the use of professionally designed, non-branded, nutritionally uniform mock cereals reduced several sources of bias in children's classification and ranking of the packages. Limitations arose due to the pilot nature of this study, particularly the small sample size and uneven gender ratio, and as such, the results of this work should be interpreted with caution. Some evidence has noted the varied influence of child-appealing marketing across different demographics of children [17, [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] and while these exploratory results suggest potential differences across age and SES groups in terms of the CAP tool's validity, this study was not adequately powered for subgroup analyses. The primary study plans to have an expanded sample size to allow for analyses to elucidate potential age, SES, and/or gender-based differences in what constitutes \"child-appeal\". Moreover, while this study had a relatively diverse sample in terms of age and SES, the thoughts and opinions reflected here are limited to those of the children in this urban Toronto cohort and may not be generalizable to the views of children more broadly in Canada or internationally. Additionally, while children were probed for their opinions on food packaging more generally, this study only tested the validity of the CAP tool using marketing on one type of food product (i.e., cereals) and it is possible that the concept of \"child-appeal\" could vary in different food groups (e.g., candy or junk foods, which could be inherently appealing to children, regardless of packaging). Lastly, while qualitative coding and analysis was conducted multiple times to ensure consistency and accuracy, it was carried out by a single researcher and may have incurred bias as such. The primary study will use dual coding by two independent researchers.",

The techniques in the CAP tool also appear to mirror those covered in existing or emerging children's marketing regulations, with the addition of broad techniques that are important to monitor due to their contribution to marketing power. It is important to note, however, that that the CAP tool's marketing power score weighs the presence of each technique equally (i.e., one point each), but it is possible that certain marketing techniques are more persuasive to children than others [17, 21] , and therefore contribute disproportionately to the power and influence of the marketing message. The power of specific marketing techniques in relation to-or in combination with-other techniques was not tested here and should be the aim of future research. The CAP tool could be easily adjusted to reflect the emergence of new evidence, and this methodology is nonetheless an important step in quantifying the persuasiveness of child-appealing marketing. Additionally, while this study focused on criterion and content validity, future studies should aim to test other types of validity (e.g., face validity with experts) to further validate this tool. Moreover, while the concepts that have been validated in this study could be extended to other marketing mediums, future research should aim to validate coding methodologies specific to other mediums to account for differential effects of marketing across marketing platforms. However, the specific marketing techniques in the CAP tool could be adapted to reflect the marketing techniques used on different marketing platforms (e.g., television, websites, etc.) or evolving marketing practices more generally, and could therefore have applicability in many current and future research settings.",

Regardless, the CAP tool presents an important methodological improvement in this field and could prove useful in future research, policy development, and child-appealing marketing monitoring activities. previously been used in child-appealing marketing research [16] . The CAP tool includes marketing techniques that are popular on product packaging specifically (e.g., cartoon characters, toys in the box), as well as techniques that have traditionally been used in other marketing platforms but are now appearing on packaging with evolving marketing practices (e.g., social media handles, scannable codes linked to websites). Marketing techniques included in the CAP tool were categorized into two categories: core techniques and broad techniques, described in detail further below.",

Finally, the CAP tool scores marketing power by summing all the techniques (core and broad) displayed on the package, based on evidence that the number of marketing techniques displayed on the package increases the persuasiveness or intensity of the marketing message [19, 20] .

Evidence has shown that marketing techniques such as promoting a product's health, nutritional or economic value were amongst the most popular techniques used in child-appealing marketing research, despite them not being typical child-appealing techniques [16] . Broad techniques also include marketing techniques that may not appeal directly to children but may appeal to their parents or caregivers (e.g., product benefit claims, convenience packaging), and therefore be purchased for children. These techniques are important to monitor, given that when/if child-appealing marketing is restricted, a proliferation of broad techniques may occur as a means for manufacturers to circumvent regulations and ensure that their products are still consumed by children.",
