Zigmond et al showed that behaviorally normal rats with large dopamine-depleting brain lesions became akinetic only when exposed to acute external stressors. 6 This suggests that the acute emergence of parkinsonism during stress may reflect preexistent damage to the nigrostriatal pathway, concealed in a preclinical phase via compensatory mechanisms. Hence, the significance of the cases reported by Cohen et al and Faber et al should be interpreted with considerable caution and, despite age and absence of clear monogenic risk, may simply represent unmasking of subclinical PD. It is possible that young age may play a role in the effective compensatory mechanisms that prevented them from being symptomatic.
