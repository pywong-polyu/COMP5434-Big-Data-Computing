            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected subjects displayed higher serum progranulin than those without infection [1] . Furthermore, elevated progranulin has been linked with other severe clinical phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and adverse disease outcomes. During the treatment, a patient who died had about 3.3-fold higher progranulin compared to the mean progranulin levels of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases [1] . A common genetic polymorphism at 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) in the granulin gene (C>T, rs5848) has been reported in different populations and has been associated with altered mRNA and protein levels [2, 3] . An in silico and in vitro analysis revealed increased binding of miR-659 with the T allele and suppressed progranulin translation compared to those of the C allele [4] . These observations triggered us to investigate the link between infected patients, and subjects who died during treatment of SARS-CoV-2 had more than three fold higher serum progranulin levels compared to infected cases [1] . As depicted earlier, the subject with rs5848-CC genotype is associated with elevated mRNA and progranulin levels [2, 3] . In addition, another independent investigation also revealed the significant binding of miR-659 to the allele T and suppressed the downstream translation process [4] . Subjects with CC genotype or allele 'C' linked with higher progranulin levels and are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and related mortality; however, the possible mechanism has remained unknown. It has been demonstrated that PGRN hampers the cytotoxicity of the natural killer cell through suppression of NK cell expansion, reduction in the transcription of granzyme B, and diminished NK cell-mediated lysis of target cells [5] . There are some shortcomings to the present study, and these must be summarized.",

Various information such as the country's name, SARS-CoV-2 infection rate per million persons, and the death rate per million inhabitants were extracted (the website was browsed on 19 th March 2021). The genotype and allele frequencies of granulin rs5848 polymorphism in healthy subjects from different countries were obtained from 1000 genome projects and gnomAD database. Furthermore, published articles were screened through a PubMed search tool for rs5848 polymorphism, and both allele and genotype frequencies in healthy controls were extracted. Reports with deviated Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium genotype frequencies were excluded from the present investigation. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a Taiwan, USA) comprise of 18560 healthy controls genotype or allele data for rs5848 polymorphism were considered for the present analysis. Details of the publications and source of data acquisition are mentioned in Supplementary Table-1 and Supplementary Table-2. The frequency of the major allele 'C' ranges from 22% (Nigeria) to 88% (Peru) The Spearman rank correlation analysis revealed a significant positive link between C allele frequency and SARS-CoV-2 infection (r = 0.612, p = 0.005) and mortality rate per million of the population of the country (r = 0.623, p = 0.004), indicating an essential role of rs5848 genetic variant with a predisposition to SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality in the worldwide population.
