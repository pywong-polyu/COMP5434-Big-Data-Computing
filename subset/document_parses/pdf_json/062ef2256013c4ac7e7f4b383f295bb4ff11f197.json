Using household survey data from thirteen low-and lower-middle-income countries, we find that missing or dropping out of school is associated with lower reading and numeracy outcomes. Drawing on global surveys conducted during the pandemic, we find that countries' remote learning responses are often inadequate to keep all children learning, avoid dropout, and mitigate the learning losses our findings predict, particularly for marginalized children and those at the pre-primary level.",

            "text": "Prolonged school closures following the 2013-2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa also highlight the severity of a recent epidemic's impact on learning (see Table 1 ). In Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the epicenter countries, an estimated five million children were affected by school closures (UNICEF, 2016) , with the number of hours of learning lost per-pupil estimated at 486, 582 and 780 respectively (United Nations Development Group-UNDG, 2015) . Furthermore, a sizable reduction in school attendance was documented after the reopening of schools, in most cases attributed to the loss of family income (World Bank, 2016a , 2016b , 2016c . Although rigorous assessments to measure learning losses due to this crisis are not available, studies suggest that students experienced a significant decrease in time spent on learning activities and in their motivation to learn. For Sierra Leone, Bandeira et al. (2018) show a decline of 12 h per week in girls' time dedicated to studying; this time was mainly re-allocated to income generation and household chores. Through ethnographic analysis, Kostelny et al. (2018) document that, in some communities, children lost interest in learning while schools were closed. 3 Moreover, events prompting school closures (e.g. extreme climate, epidemics.) may be accompanied by economic disruptions that can further deepen existing learning inequalities.

Source: Authors' calculations based on UNESCO COVID-19 school closures and latest UNESCO -Institute for Statistics enrollment data (pre-primary, primary, secondary, postsecondary and tertiary levels). 3 In addition to the adverse effects in education, other critical child-related outcomes such as the increased risk of violence and abuse, orphanhood, teenage pregnancy, child labour and malnutrition have also been recorded (Bakrania et al., 2020; Bandiera et al., 2019; Evans and Popova, 2011; Raluca et al., 2020; Selbervik, 2020; and United Nations Development Group-UNDG, 2015) . likely to be affected by these shocks are generally those with the least resources to support children's learning (Duryea et al., 2007; Glick et al., 2016; Grimm, 2008) and those most dependent on public education spending (Duncan et al., 2004; Shafiq, 2010) .",

These predictions are even higher for math, with losses estimated between 50-63 per cent. Kaffenberger (2020) creates different post\u2212 COVID-19 learning loss scenarios using data from seven low-and lower-middle-income countries. Assuming a one-third reduction in learning time (i.e. about one term outside of school), this study forecasts that learning level of a child in Grade 3 would be one year lower than expected by the time that child reaches Grade 10.

Second, it has been shown that learning is key to offsetting the developmental disadvantages facing younger children, especially those from deprived contexts (Evans and Kim, 2012; McCoy and Raver, 2014; World Bank, 2018) . Third, foundational skills losses are difficult and costly to regain. Young children who fall behind are the hardest to reintegrate, especially when the education system focuses on high achievers and does not target children at-risk (Banerjee and Duflo, 2012; Glewwe et al., 2009; Muralidharan and Zieleniak, 2013; World Bank, 2018) .",

The main conclusion of the empirical analysis does not differ in the logit model. 7 Two questions from MICS6 were used to construct this variable: \"At any time during the current school year did (name) attend school or any early childhood education programme?\"; and \"At any time during the previous school year did (name) attend school or any early childhood education programme?\" in place by low and middle income countries around the world are mitigating potential learning losses for children.

This is a lowerbound estimate, as it examines only households' access to techonology and countries' provision of remote learning policies using those technologies, not whether those students with potential access actually engaged with the remote learning method(s). The analysis highlights that children in the poorest countries and those from deprived backgrounds are the most at-risk of being excluded. Students who are not reached by any online, television or radio remote learning modality are mainly from rural areas (76 per cent) and belong to low-income families (72 per cent).

At the primary level, 83 per cent of countries report the provision of online platforms, and 70 per cent the supply of a combination of online and other modalities (paper-based take-home materials, TV or radio). Slightly more countries are offering combinations of online and other channels to lower secondary (73 per cent) and upper secondary (75 per cent) learners. However, for preprimary, only 37 per cent of the countries report that they provide combinations of online or other modalities, and 30 per cent report that they have not offered any of these remote learning options. 9 Pupils in low-income countries and from marginalized populations are more likely to be excluded from these programs. Even before the pandemic, eight out of 10 children in low-income countries were missing out on early childhood education, and those from the lowest quintile were about eight times less likely to attend than their peers in the wealthiest group (Muroga et al., 2020) . The relatively small proportion of countries delivering remote pre-primary programs is of concern given the importance of the early acquisition of socioemotional and cognitive skills for the development of foundational learning (Gromada et al., 2020; World Bank, 2018) and its high economic benefits. It is estimated that every dollar spent on pre-primary education results in nine dollars of benefits to society, which equates to 1134 dollars of net societal benefits per individual over a lifetime for a given cohort of children (Muroga et al., 2020) . The Inter-American Development Bank warns that the disruption of pre-primary education during the pandemic could lead to reductions in GDP of 2.7 per cent for lower-middle-income countries and 0.9 per cent for low-income countries (McCoy et al., 2021) .",

Among the countries offering online learning, 79 per cent reported monitoring user access. For the remote learning modalities that may have wider coverage in the population, however, the percentage of countries monitoring access is lower, including 76 per cent for paper-based take home materials, 67 per cent for implementation of television programmes, and only 58 per cent for implementation of radio programmes.

The incidence of initiatives to systematically monitor learning varies significantly with the country income level, as depicted by the orange bar in Fig. 4 . While only three per cent of high-income countries report that teachers are not monitoring student learning, in low-and lower-middle-income countries, the proportions are 25 and 27 per cent (UNESCO, UNICEF and The World Bank, 2020). This variation by income level is of concern. In low and lower middle income countries, children's foundational learning levels were low prior to the crisis, and the compounding effects of closures on childrens learning may be even more severe. Thus in countries where children have the most need of learning support, less will be known and understood about the impact of school closures and the effectiveness of remote learning, limiting the ability of policymakers and education actors to effectively respond and appropriately adjust instruction when schools reopen. This may contribute to an increased number of children falling further behind and ultimately dropping out.",

While most countries have provided remote learning programs during the COVID-19 school closures, often using multiple modalities, the most marginalized populations and pre-primary students have often been excluded. Given the barriers that marginalized children already face to staying in school and learning, and the importance of pre-primary education for children's further educational success and the, the exclusion of these groups from remote learning suggests that they will be significantly less likely to demonstrate foundational learning skills than those who continued engaging with learning during the pandemic. Furthermore, for those children who are engaging in remote learning, gaps in country mechanisms to track learning progress suggest there is limited information with which to ensure those children are actually learning. Given the significant heterogeneity and specificity of country responses to mitigate learning loss during COVID-19 school closures, improving monitoring and learning assessment strategies will be critical for educators and policymakers to understand what system adjustments and additional support children will need to overcome the identified gaps in learning, especially for the foundational skills.",
