The average time to diagnosis for the patients was 5.5 days (range from 1-21 days A comparative analysis was conducted in four cities. The incidence curves in these cities were very similar before January 31. Wenzhou's first incidence peak appeared on January 29, and then it declined steadily. No second peak was found thereafter. However, Huanggang, Xiaogan and Jingzhou all had their second and even third incidence peaks after January 31 ( Figure 1B) . These three cities implemented rigorous measures that were similar to the \"Wenzhou Anti-COVID19 measures\" on February 10, 14 and 15, respectively. As a result, the outbreak of COVID-19 in these three cities was gradually placed under control. an R0 value of 3.11 (95% CI, 2.39-4.13), suggesting that COVID-19 is very contagious. In general, an epidemic will increase as long as R0 > 1, and control measures aim to reduce the R0 <1. The R0 of SARS has been estimated to be ~3 9 and SARS outbreaks has been successfully controlled by isolation of patients and careful infection control 10 . Therefore, Wenzhou anti-COVID-19 measures were the extremely rapidly response in COVID-19 crisis.",

The cities examined in this study-Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province and Jingzhou, Xiaogan and Huanggang (neighboring cities of Wuhan) in Hubei Province-are similar in size and population as well as in their number of confirmed and new cases of COVID-19.",

All critically severe COVID-19 patients were transferred the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University for intensive care, whereas the mild cases and suspected patients were treated at designated medical centers in the city. The intensive care of COVID-19 patients was conducted under the guidance of a team of medical experts, which included an epidemiologist. All of the close contacts of each confirmed patient were isolated and undergo medical observation. Meanwhile, a rapid nucleic acid detection kit for COVID-19 was used as soon as possible for the diagnosis and to make quarantine and treatment decisions. The epidemic growth rate was estimated by analyzing number of the confirmed cases from January 21 to March 3, 2020. The COVID-19 transmission model in Wenzhou was established using the data-driven network modeling analysis methods 4 . Statistical analyses were performed using Matlab version R2018a software (The MathWorks, Inc). As of February 17 (when the last case was confirmed), 2020, 504 COVID-19 cases had been reported in Wenzhou. Of these patients, 208 (41.3%) were originally infected outside of the city (imported cases from other cities) and 296 (58.7%) had been infected locally (local cases). Moderate measures (first phase measures) were executed from January 17 to January 30 in Wenzhou. However, as of January 31, 2020, 246 cases had been reported, of which 180 (73.2%) were imported and 66 (26.8%) were local. The epidemic pattern in Wenzhou showed that COVID-19 mainly spread in the city (social outbreaks). Therefore, the secondphase measures were implemented on January 31, 2020. A total of 258 cases have been reported from February 1 to March 3, of which 37 (14.3%) were imported and 221 (85.7%) were local. The new cases were predominantly reported in five counties (Yueqing, Ruian, Yongjia, Wencheng, and Taishun) in Wenzhou area. Importantly, two-thirds of these cases were family-type onset. Therefore, the Wenzhou Anti-COVID19 Measures made the epidemic changed from social outbreaks to family-type onset. After the implementation of the first-phase measures of Wenzhou, the imported cases from other cities were substantially reduced. However, the outbreak in the city remained, suggesting that the transmission routes were not completely blocked. To prevent further spread, the Wenzhou New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Committee launched \"Twenty-Five Emergency Measures\" (Wenzhou anti-COVID-19 measures) on January 31. As a result, the number of new cases quickly dropped, and no new and confirmed cases were reported after February 17. The epidemic was under control in 31 days (from January 17 to February 17).",

For example, Wu et al 7 reported an R0 value of 2.68 (95% CI, 2.47-2.86), Li et al 2 reported an R0 value of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4-3.9) and Read et al 8 reported",
