Consequently, the fundamental mechanisms leading to death in high-risk patients with COVID-19 need to be discovered and addressed with urgency. Despite a marked drop in frequency, the post-mortem autopsy remains an essential part of both discovering the cause of death in a particular individual, but also in advancing the science and treatment of disease, especially in the case of novel pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 [2] . The goal of an autopsy is to discover the cause of death (COD) using a macro/microscopic investigation. Traditionally, the intact organs are carefully removed, inspected, and weighed. Because lung weight is often affected by the cause of death and the last breath occurs very near if not at the moments of death, the evaluation of the lungs is one of the starting points of any COD investigation [3] .",

It is important to note that performing the Tukey HSD test requires a studentized range distribution. Due to limited number of lung weights in confirmed IHS SARS-CoV-2 victims, we cannot determine a p-value at this \u00b1 point. However, it is clearly observed that the lung weights seen between IHS+ and IHSautopsies is 2:1, which we believe is indicative of a significant difference.

There are many ways that an insult, and the response to that insult, can be characterized and quantified-morphologically, physiologically, molecularly, biochemically, and genetically, for example. Unfortunately, the focus currently and historically, has centered on the down stream consequences, and not the critical and key physical dimension and spacial aspects of a large volume of accumulated and misplaced water in the lung.

We propose that the induced hyaluronan storm syndrome or IHS, is the model that best addresses the heretofore perplexing respiratory failure that is the proximal cause of death in a minority, but ever rising number, of patients. We encourage researchers and clinicians to put our model to the test, and expand upon our early understanding of this disease. In addition to treating and preventing IHS in currently infected individuals now; an aggressive research effort should be undertaken to discover why the majority of individuals who are exposed to the virus are either minimally or asymptomatic, while a minority of high-risk individuals rapidly progress to respiratory failure and death. The answer to this question will have profound implications for our fundamental understanding and approach to disease, and for the individuals and institutions charged with the management of this and future threats to global health and well-being.",

The primary outcome of interest was SARS-CoV-2 autopsy results with reference to lung weights and presence of hyaline membranes. Mechanisms related to hyaluronan's role in ARDS pathology were selected for detailed analysis.Data Collection and Quality AssessmentRelevant data elements were identified from each publication and recorded in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and Zotero (George Mason Univeristy, Fairfax, VA, USA). All citations extracted from the PubMed orScopus electronic databases were deemed to be of sufficient scientific quality.Data Synthesis and AnalysisWe summarized the autopsy findings and compared the association between each outcome from the relevant studies. Further collating these results with citations related to hyaluronan and ARDS. These findings were compiled in an outcome status report in the form of a table listing the significant findings.
