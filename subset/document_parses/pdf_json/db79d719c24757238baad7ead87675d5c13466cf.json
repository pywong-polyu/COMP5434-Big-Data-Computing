            "text": "Previous reports have documented an association between ABO blood group and risk for infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. 1-3 Associations between race/ethnicity and SARS-CoV-2 positivity have also been reported. 4,5 Here we describe the first large-scale observational study investigating the associations between ABO group/Rh types with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, by major race/ethnicity. In this retrospective, observational study, test results from a national reference clinical laboratory were assessed to determine the influence of race/ethnicity on the associations of ABO/Rh with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. Results from SARS-CoV-2 RNA nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) performed March through July 2020 were matched with ABO/Rh test results obtained for the same individual since January 2010. Only one SARS-CoV-2 result per patient was considered; a patient was considered to have a positive result if any SARS-CoV-2 test result was positive. The ABO/Rh testing is generally performed as part of maternal screening; males were excluded. The influence of race/ethnicity on the associations of ABO type/Rh group with SARS CoV-2 positivity was assessed in a subset of females with available race/ethnicity data. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAAT was performed using one of four US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorized tests (Quest Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 RNA [Covid-19], Qualitative NAAT; Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay; Roche Diagnostics cobas SARS-CoV-2 test; or Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay). The ABO/Rh typing was performed using solid-phase technology (Immucor NEO). Differences in proportions were analyzed using the chi-square test (with results presented as nominal P values). For multivariable logistic regression models, race/ethnicity was grouped into the following categories: Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, white non-Hispanic, and \"other\" race/ethnicity (\"other\" included females of multiple race/ethnicities). Analyses were performed using SAS Studio 3.6 on SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute). This Quest Diagnostics Health Trends study was deemed exempt by the Western Institutional Review Board (Puyallup, Washington). The study cohort comprised 276 536 females with matched SARS-CoV-2 and ABO-Rh results from all 50 American states and the District of Columbia. There were 34 178 females who were SARS-CoV-2 positive (12.4%, 95% CI 12.2%-12.5%).The median patient age at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing was 34.4 (IQR 29.2-40.0) years. type O and SARS-CoV-2 positivity changed from being significantly predictive in the unadjusted model (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11), to significantly protective in the adjusted model (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.99).",

            "text": "This is the largest reported study to date assessing SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates by ABO/Rh and race/ethnicity. In line with prior studies, 2,3 our findings demonstrated that Rh positivity, independent of ABO blood group and race/ethnicity, was a statistically significant risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. In contrast to findings from smaller studies, 1 our unadjusted analysis showed a significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate among individuals with type O blood than in those with other blood types. However, after adjusting for race/ ethnicity, the relationship between type O and SARS-CoV-2 reversed from predictive to protective. Type O and Rh + blood is more prevalent in Hispanics and black non-Hispanics, two groups in our study with the highest proportions of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. Thus we conclude, in concordance with findings from other studies, 1 that type O blood is slightly protective against SARS-CoV-2 positivity once race/ethnicity has been considered. The multivariable model also demonstrated that the influence of Rh+ blood type was attenuated when adjusted for race/ethnicity, suggesting that the association between ABO/Rh and SARS-CoV-2 positivity is strongly influenced by race/ethnicity. Much attention has been paid to the disproportionate rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hispanic and black non-Hispanic populations in the United States. 4,5 The reasons for this relationship are not fully understood. Theories include increased exposure to the virus among Hispanic and black non-Hispanic populations owing to employment, economic hardship, dense living conditions, and other general disparities. 4,5 Here, we demonstrated additional racial/ethnic influences on relationship between ABO group/Rh type and SARS-CoV-2 positivity.",

People with symptoms, or high exposure risk, for example, healthcare workers, are theoretically more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2.
