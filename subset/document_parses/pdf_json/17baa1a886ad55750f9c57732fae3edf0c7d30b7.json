Face shields with two types of edge shapes were used. The \"Type I\" shield had small plates mounted on the top and bottom edges of the shield to physically inhibit the sneeze inflow. The \"Type II\" shield had small brims sticking forward from the shield surface and small plates sticking upward and downward at the top and bottom edges to inhibit the entrainment flow produced by the vortex ring using sneeze flow. We confirmed that the flow characteristics around a face shield can be controlled using the shield's edge shape. In Type I, the entraining flow inside the shield was inhibited by the mounted small plate at the bottom edge, ensuring the inhibiting effect, but not at the top edge. In Type II, the entrained flow inside the shield was inhibited by the mounted brim and small plate at the top edge, ensuring the inhibiting effect, but not at the bottom edge. The effects of the Type II design parameters on the flow characteristics around the face shield were examined. The results indicate that at the top edge, increasing the length of the brim and not mounting the small plate at an incline from the shield surface improves the inhibition effect. At the bottom edge, shortening the length of the brim and mounting the small plate at an incline from the shield surface improves the inhibition effect.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2, which was first confirmed in December 2019, in China has caused a global pandemic, with the number of infected people increasing explosively, and the threat remains. Moreover, in this pandemic, the number of infected people exceeded the number of medical staff and medical equipment in several countries; therefore, many infected people and patients with medical cases unrelated to the coronavirus disease could not receive adequate medical treatment. 1, 2 To maintain the quality of medical treatment in such situations, it is extremely important to ensure that infection prevention measures are followed not only by medical staff but also by all persons. 3, 4 Face shields, which are used to cover the face using a clear plastic shield, and medical surgical masks are being actively used by medical staff to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth-the entry points for viruses-from virus-laden droplets that spread via an infected person breathing, coughing, or sneezing. [5] [6] [7] [8] Recently, the number of people who are using face shields as a substitute for face masks has been increasing in schools, universities, restaurants, and service businesses. This increased adoption is due to benefits such as preventing droplets from attaching directly to the face, being able to see facile expressions, ease of hearing, reusability when washed and disinfected properly, and increased comfort compared to regular masks. However, there is one concern regarding this. As face shields and masks were originally developed to prevent the spread of the wearer's own droplets, they may not be effective in preventing infection when used for any other purpose. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a face shield will have the same preventive effect as a mask.",

This is also applicable when a face shield or mask is worn to prevent infection from infected persons. For example, if a medical professional wearing a face shield is exposed to droplets when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes in front of the wearer's face, the large droplets may attach to the face shield's surface, thereby providing protection; however, small droplets may move with the airflow and be drawn in through the space between the wearer's face and the face shield. 15, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Akagi et al. have conducted numerical simulations to clarify the details of the airflow around a face shield and its effectiveness in preventing infection when a shield wearer is exposed to a sneeze from a nearby patient. 29 Such conditions are frequently encountered by medical staff while treating or examining patients.

Based on our previous results obtained by simulating the airflow around a regular face shield, depicted in Fig. 1 , the inflow into the inside of the shield was observed almost exclusively at the top and bottom edges of the shield, with less inflow from the sides of the shield. 29 Therefore, the edge shape was designed only at the top and bottom edges of the shield to control the sneeze airflow. Figure 2 depicts the side and diagonal top view of the Type I shield. Small simple plates that had a length of 40 mm were mounted at the top and bottom edges of the shield to prevent inflow. The small plates were inclined backward at an angle of 60 to the shield surface with the aim to direct the sneeze flow toward the upper side of the wearer's head and the lower side of the chest while preventing entraining flow owing to vortex rings (refer to the light blue arrows in Fig. 2 ). In the case of a regular face shield, it has been confirmed that droplets transported by the sneeze flow and vortex rings remain between the neck and chest of the shield user, and these droplets move inside the shield through inhalation. Therefore, if flow under the shield can be directed to the area below the chest by the small plate mounted to the lower edge of Type I, the risk of inhalation of droplets by the shield user may be considerably reduced. Figure 3 depicts the side and diagonal top view of the Type II shield. The upper edge of the shield had a small brim sticking forward from the shield surface and a small plate sticking upward. The length of the brim and the small plate was 20 mm. The lower edge of the shield had a brim sticking backward from the shield surface and a small plate sticking downward from the tip of the brim. The shape of the shield was aimed at controlling the propagation direction of the vortex rings by using the sneeze flow that arrives at the shield surface prior to the vortex rings (refer to the light blue arrows in Fig. 3 ). In other words, the sneeze flow that arrives near the top of the shield turns into a forward flow owing to the brim at the top of the shield, and this flow interferes with the vortex ring to change the propagation direction of the vortex ring upward. The brim is expected to enhance the breakdown of the vortex ring when it comes into contact with the shield surface. The small plate sticking out upward is expected to physically prevent the inflow of the vortex ring and enhance the effect of driving the vortex ring upward. The sneeze flow that arrives near the lower edge of the shield is turned into a downward flow by the small plate sticking out from the brim, and this flow changes the propagation direction of the ",

Life-sized human models wearing a face shield, as shown in Figs. 1-3, were placed at the center of the computational domain. We ensured a space between the shield surface and the face of the human model to imitate the most commonly used face shields. Most face shields used in the medical field are designed with no space between the upper edge of the shield surface and the user's face. This type of shield can be evaluated by referring to the flows at the sides and the lower end of the shield used in this simulation. The distance between the face shield and face was set to an average of 25 mm. This fitting condition is similar to that in reality. The average distance between medical staff and infected patients during treatment and diagnosis was estimated to be approximately 1 m. 19, 26 Therefore, the distance between the mouth of the infected person (40 mm in diameter) and the surface of the face shield facing the infected person was set to 1 m in the simulation.",

Boundary conditions Figure 6 plots the velocity and flow waveforms of the airflow by respiration and sneezing. 12, 27 In Fig. 6 (a), negative velocity period indicates the inhalation period, whereas a positive velocity period indicates the exhalation period. This velocity condition was applied to two elliptical inlet boundary surfaces (major diameter of 20 mm and minor diameter of 10 mm) located at the nose of the human model. This simulation assumes nasal-only respiration. The sneezing velocity condition [ Fig. 6(b) ] was applied to the inlet boundary surface, which simulates the mouth of an infected person. Because the temperature of the air in the mouth is approximately 32 C (305 K), 14,24 the temperature of the outward airflow owing to exhaling and sneezing is generally different from that of outside air. Furthermore because this temperature difference produces a buoyancy effect in the sneeze flow and vortex rings, it has been clarified that the droplets tend to be transported unevenly toward the lower end of the face shield under this condition. 29 Therefore, it is desirable to consider the effect of the temperature difference in the simulation. Meanwhile, it is known that the transport process of droplets varies depending on the angle of the sneeze flow, which depends on the motion of the head during the sneezing, and that droplets are transported upward when the angle of the injection is higher than the horizontal direction. 12 To evaluate the effectiveness of preventing droplets entering into the shield, which is the aim of this study, it is desirable to set the conditions such that the sneeze flow and vortex rings reach the upper and lower ends of the shield equally. For this reason, we set the air temperature at the inlet boundary to be the same as the outside temperature, which was 27 C (300 K).",

Medical staff wearing regular, Type I, and Type II face shields are exposed to a sneeze, whose source is at a distance of 1 m, from the front. To simulate the risk of infection for medical staff, the time of the staff's inhalation should be synchronized with the time when droplets emitted by sneezing reach the surroundings of the face shield. Therefore, in this simulation, the start time of inhalation was set to 0.25 s after the start of sneezing, considering the time spent by the droplets to arrive. Figure 7 (Multimedia view) depicts the streamwise velocity distribution and evolution of the three-dimensional vortex structure in the regular face shield. The vortex structure is represented by the isosurfaces of the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor (Q-criterion). Figure 7 (a) (Multimedia view) represents t \u00bc 0.05 s after the start of sneezing. The sneeze generates a jet-like high-velocity flow downstream of the mouth of the infected person, and a vortex ring is generated. Furthermore, this vortex ring moves forward owing to its self-induced velocity and changes direction downward, as shown in 29 Under the condition that the temperature difference between the air in the mouth and the outside air is 5 C, it has been observed that the leading vortex ring tends to move upward because of the effect of buoyancy owing to the temperature difference. In the present condition without a temperature difference, the leading vortex ring moved downward owing to the effect of longitudinal vortices generated by the turbulence of the vortex rings, but the other vortex rings moved almost directly. 32, 33 Although such differences owing to the effects of buoyancy on the flow characteristics and the behavior of the vortex rings are observed, the face shield is covered with a vortex structure, and the high-velocity area caused by the sneeze flow is also observed from the neck to the chest of the shield user; therefore, stagnation of the inflow inside the shield and the droplets under the shield are considered to have occurred. Figure 8 (Multimedia view) depicts the streamwise velocity distribution and evolution of the three-dimensional vortex structure in the Type I face shield. The leading vortex ring generated by the sneeze flow at t < 0.25 s moves downward and reaches the vicinity of the bottom of the face shield at t \u00bc 0.25 s, as shown in Fig. 8 (a) (Multimedia view). The position of the vortex ring and the behavior of its breakdown are slightly different from those of the regular shield. This difference is observed when the vortex ring makes contact with the shield surface; therefore, we consider that it is due to the difference in the shape of the shield edge. Behind this vortex ring, several other vortex rings were generated With the focus now on the area below the neck of a shield user, it can be confirmed that the high-velocity area caused by the sneeze flow, which was observed for a regular shield, is not observed, and the sneeze flow spreads slightly downward of the shield. This difference seems to be caused by the shape of the lower edge of the shield. ",

The effect of this flow control is expected to sufficiently prevent the entrance of droplets. Figure 14 (Multimedia view) depicts the results of particles spreading at t \u00bc 0.54 s when the inhalation flow rate is close to the maximum. Generally, the simulation of the trajectory of these particles considers the effects of the gravitational forces, drag, droplet evaporation, droplet collapse, merger, and turbulent dispersion forces on particles. [34] [35] [36] [37] However, it was confirmed that droplets with a diameter of more than 60 lm tend to fall down by gravity rather than tracking the flow. 12, 38 In addition, droplets with a diameter of less than 20 lm evaporate rapidly immediately after ejection and become aerosols that are easily airborne. 39 Under the conditions of this simulation, in which the distance between the infected person and the face shield wearer was set at 1 m, droplets with a large diameter would either fall on the floor or attach to the surface of the shield, and thus would be difficult to enter inside the shield. The effect of particle size and mass is also considered to be very small because small droplets, which are easily transported by sneeze flows and vortex rings, can be regarded as aerosols. Because the purpose of this simulation was to confirm the trajectory of the droplets when they travel with the flow, it was assumed, as in the previous study, 29 that the target droplets were small enough to trace the flow (i.e., the mass of the particles was equal to zero). Furthermore, the Runge-Kutta method was used to estimate the trajectory of the droplets. This , and the range of splashing is wider than that of the regular shield. Thus, it is clear that the splashing behavior of the droplets in the sneeze flow can be controlled by controlling the flow characteristics around the shield using the design of the face shield. Figure 15 depicts the relationship between the edge shape of the face shields and the ratio of droplets entering the inside of the shields at t \u00bc 0.54 s when the inhalation flow rate is close to the maximum. The values show the ratio of the total number of particles that were released to the number of particles that entered the inside of the shield. Regular face shields allow 11.2% of the released droplets to enter the inside of the shield, whereas Type I and Type II are able to reduce that to 1.47% and 1.94%, respectively. This reduction of entry ratio is caused by the inhibition control of entraining flow via the design of the shield edge.",

It should be noted that case 2 in the table was the same condition as that shown in Figs. 12 (Multimedia view), 13, 14 (Multimedia view), and 15 in Sec. IV A. Figure 16 (Multimedia view) depicts the distribution of the vertical projection velocity vectors along the vertical cross section at t \u00bc 0.35 and 0.5 s under different brim lengths. A comparison of the results indicates that at the top edge of the shield, the high-velocity region, which indicates the flow induced by the vortex ring, moves slightly downward in front of the shield surface as the brim length increases. Figure 17 depicts the enlarged view of the upper end of each shield. It is observed that the rotating flow generated on the upper and lower sides of the brim mounted on the top edge of the shield (the rotating flow exhibits clockwise rotation on the upper side of the brim and counterclockwise rotation on the lower side) increases as the length of the brim increases. This suggests that increasing the brim length enhances the ability to turn the sneeze flow toward the front of the shield, which contributes to the propagation of the vortex ringinduced flow toward the lower front of the shield. It is interesting to note that even in case 1, in which the brim length is the shortest (L 2 \u00bc 10 mm), the effect of inhibiting the entrainment flow is higher than that for a regular face shield. A comparison of the flow at the bottom edge of the shield as a function of the brim length reveals that the region of high-velocity entraining flow, which represents the upward flow from the chest to the neck of the wearer, decreases as the brim length ratio (L 2 /L 1 ) increases. This decrease in the high-velocity region implies that the stagnation of droplets under the neck is easily inhibited. Thus, it was confirmed that the effect of the brim length on the inhibition of the entraining flow at the top and bottom edges of the shield is significant, and to increase the inhibition effect, we should increase the length of the brim. Physics of Fluids Table I at t \u00bc 0.54 s when the inhalation flow rate is close to the maximum. From the figure, it can be observed that the splashing distributions of the droplets vary according to the variation in the velocity distribution caused by the design conditions of the shield edge. In case 6, wherein the inhibition of entraining flow was the most effective at the top edge of the shield, the droplets spread upward in front of the shield (the area indicated by A in the figure), and the height of the spread was the highest among all the conditions. It can be confirmed that the inhibiting effect of the inflow of droplets is the highest. In case 4, wherein the inhibition effect of the entraining flow was the highest at the bottom edge of the shield, droplets spread from the lower part of the shield to the lower part of the wearer's chest (the area indicated by B in the figure), and it can be confirmed that the inhibiting effect of the inflow of droplets at the bottom edge is the most effective. Figure 21 depicts the ratio of droplets entering inside the shield at t \u00bc 0.54 s, when the inlet flow rate is close to the maximum, for all the evaluation conditions shown in Table I . The number of droplets entering the inside of the shield decreased as the brim length was increased, reducing the entry ratio in half only by increasing the brim length by 20 mm. Furthermore, the rate of droplet entry can be confirmed to decrease as the mounting angle of the small plate is increased for all brim length conditions. In the above conditions, the brim length and mounting angle of the plate are set to be the same at the top and bottom edges of the shield. If the design conditions for the top edge are set under the conditions of case 6, where the effect of inflow inhibition is high at the top edge, and the design conditions for the bottom edge are set under the conditions of case 4, where the effect of inflow inhibition is high at the bottom edge, the entry rate of droplets can be the minimum.",

For this purpose, assumptions such as neglecting the temperature difference between the sneeze and the ambient air, and neglecting the particle size distribution and mass of the droplets are made in this simulation. Ideally, these conditions should be taken into account in the simulation, and further simulations, as well as experiments, considering these conditions will be conducted as future work.

At the bottom of the shield, the upward flow generated by the flow passing through the lower edge of the shield and impinging on the chest of the shield user reaches the neck. It has been observed that this upward flow tends to cause stagnation of droplets. 29 The entraining flow at the upper edge of the shield and the upward flow at the bottom edge continue at t \u00bc 0.5 s [Fig. 10(c) (Multimedia view)]. Figure 11 (Multimedia view) depicts the distribution of the vertical projection velocity vectors along the vertical cross section in the Type I face shield. At t \u00bc 0.25 s [Fig. 11(a) (Multimedia view)], the low-velocity flow begins to form along the surface of the small plate mounted on the bottom edge of the shield, induced by the rotating flow of the vortex ring moving in the vicinity of the bottom edge. Because the rotating flow of the vortex ring induces not only fluid on the surface of the small plate but also flow inside the shield, the fluid inside the shield moves slowly downward, resulting in the generation of an entraining flow from the outside to the inside at the top end of the shield. At t \u00bc 0.35 s [Fig. 11(b) (Multimedia view)], the sneeze flow impinging on the front surface of the shield is divided into upper and lower parts and flows along the shield surface; an upward and backward flow along the small plate is generated at the upper part of the shield. In addition, the velocity of the entrained flow generated at the top edge of the shield has increased. In contrast, the downward flow along the shield surface is separated at the connection between the shield body and the small plate, and flow along the small plate is not observed. The flow direction of the separated flow is almost vertically downward such that the attachment point of the flow becomes lower than that of the wearer's chest. This point is different from that of the regular face shield. At t \u00bc 0.5 s [Fig. 11(c) (Multimedia view)], the entering flow at the top edge of the shield extends downward and reaches the area near the eye. At the bottom edge of the shield, the direction of the flow changes from vertically downward to along the small plate, but no upward flow from the chest to the neck of the wearer is generated. Figure 12 (Multimedia view) depicts the distribution of the vertical projection velocity vectors along the vertical cross section of the Type II face shield. At t \u00bc 0.25 s [Fig. 12(a) (Multimedia view)], the rotating flow of the vortex ring at the bottom edge of the shield generates a flow along the lower part of the shield. At this time, no flow enters the inside of the shield, and there is no flow toward the chest of the wearer. At t \u00bc 0.35 s [Fig. 12(b) (Multimedia view)], the upward flow generated by the impact on the chest of the shield user after passing through the bottom edge of the shield reaches the neck. The brim and the small plate were designed to turn the direction of the flow passing near the bottom edge to the vertical downward direction and to inhibit the upward flow generated near the chest, i.e., they were factors in the generation of stagnant droplets, but it seems that the effect was not sufficient. In contrast, at the upper end of the shield, the flow generated by the vortex rings and sneeze flow is not observed, and the only flow into the inside of the shield is the flow owing to respiration. This point is different from that of the regular face shield. These flow characteristics are maintained at t \u00bc 0.5 s [Fig. 12(c) (Multimedia view)]. Further, a weak rotating flow is generated at the upper and lower sides of the brim mounted at the top edge of the shield. On the upper side of the brim, the rotating flow indicates a clockwise rotation, whereas the lower side indicates a counterclockwise rotation. This",

Figure 13 depicts the time evolution of the vertical (Y-direction) component of the velocity near the top and bottom edges of the face shield. Velocity measurements were conducted at two positions on a vertical section through the center of the shield: 5 mm inside the inner surface of the shield, and 5 mm below and 5 mm above the top and bottom edges of the shield. From the velocity evolution near the top edge, it can be observed that, in the regular face shield, the entering velocity from the outside to the inside of the shield (at this time, the flow from the top to the bottom is generated inside the shield) gradually increases with the approach of the sneeze flow, and the velocity reaches its maximum just after t \u00bc 0.25 s when the sneeze flow reaches the bottom edge of the shield. Afterward, when the high-velocity flow induced by the vortex rings reaches the top edge of the shield, the entering velocity decelerates rapidly and changes into the outflow (the upward flow). This variation in velocity indicates the entraining flow due to the vortical structure generated by the roll-up of the separated flow from the top of the shield [Figs. 10(b) and 10(c) (Multimedia views)]",

Because this edge shape is similar to that of the Type I face shield, both flow characteristics are relatively similar. However, in the other conditions for L 2 /L 1 , the entrainment flow is not generated by the inclination of the small plate, indicating that the flow characteristics are almost the same as those for h \u00bc 0 . This indicates that the effect of the inclination angle of the small plate on the flow characteristics at the top edge of the shield decreases when the length of the brim increases. Meanwhile, comparing the differences in the results based on the angle of inclination at the bottom edge of the shield, when L 2 /L 1 \u00bc 0.33, the region of highvelocity entraining flow is no longer observed owing to the inclination of the small plate. This result is the most effective among all the conditions examined in the present study. This flow characteristic is also similar to that of Type I, as well as the case for the top edge. However, as the value of L 2 /L 1 increases, the region of the entraining flow is expanded by the inclination, and the inhibition effect of the entraining flow decreases. This may occur because as the brim length increases and the tip of the small plate gets close to the wearer's chest, the contact position between the sneeze flow and the body is near the chest even if the sneeze flow is along the inclination of the small plate. Thus, it was confirmed that the effect of the inclination angle of the small plate on the entraining flow characteristics around the shield was significantly enhanced at the bottom edge of the shield.Figure 19 depicts the time evolution of the vertical (Y-direction) component of the velocity near the top and bottom edges of the face shield under all the conditions listed inTable I. At the top edge of the shield [Fig. 19(a)], as the length of the brim (L 2 ) increases (solid line in thefigure), the variation in the velocity caused by the entraining flow owing to sneezing and vortex rings decreases, and as the mounting angle of h increases (dashed line in thefigure), the variation in the velocity also decreases. Under the present conditions, the most effective inhibition of the entraining flow at the top edge of the shield was observed in Case 6, wherein the brim was the longest and the small plate was inclined. The relationship between the length of the brim and the inhibition of the entraining velocity observed at the top edge of the shield is similarly confirmed at the bottom edge of the shield [Fig. 19(b)].
