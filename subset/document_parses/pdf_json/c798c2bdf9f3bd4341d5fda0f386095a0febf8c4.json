Specifically, the authors were interested in differences, if any, in the factors that explained microlearning acceptance across gender, age and proficiency in technology. 628 working adults gave their responses to a 46-item, self-rated, 5-point Likert scale developed to measure 12 constructs of the DTPB model. Results of this study revealed that a 12-factor model was valid in explaining microlearning usage intentions of all working adults, regardless of demographic differences. Tests for measurement invariance showed support for invariance in model structure (configural invariance), factor loadings (metric invariance), item intercepts (scalar invariance), and item residuals (strict invariance) between males and females, between working adults below 40 years and above 40 years, and between working adults with lower technology proficiency and higher technology proficiency levels. While measurement invariance existed in the data, structural invariance was only found across gender, not age and technology proficiency. We then assessed latent mean differences and structural path differences across groups. Our findings suggest that a tailored approach to encourage the use of microlearning is needed to suit different demographics of working adults. The current study discusses the implications of the findings on the use and adoption of microlearning and proposes future research possibilities.",

            "text": "In today's fast-paced and technology-driven working environment, expectations of lifelong learning for many working professionals are shifting toward just-in-time instruction and on-need training (Brandenburg and Ellinger, 2003) . Microlearning fulfils these expectations as it emphasises delivering self-paced bite-size content and just-in-time training (Hug and Friesen, 2007) . As learners are also opting to exercise greater control over their intentions and actual usage of technology for professional development, the microlearning design helps cultivate a lifelong learning culture where people effectively manage their own learning independently in various contexts (Sharples, 2000) . With greater volition over technology use, it is important to address the factors driving greater intentions to use microlearning, and understand if these factors differ across working adults of different demographics. The current study investigates differences in working adults' intentions to participate in microlearning using the decomposed theory of planned behaviour (DTPB) across gender, age, and proficiency in technology. Hug (2015) defines microlearning as \"an abbreviated manner of expression for all sorts of short-time learning activities with microcontent\" (p. 492). Similarly, Shail (2019) defines it as \"relatively small, focused learning units consisting of condensed learning activities (usually one to 10 min), available on multiple devices\" (p. 2). For busy working professionals, traditional e-Learning are no longer attractive or effective. Instead, microlearning formats, where training content delivered in bite-size chunks that may be accessed from anywhere and at any time, are increasingly being considered for use in professional development.",

Decomposing the belief structure of the TPB was thought to increase explanatory power of the model and may help in greater understanding of the determinants of behavioural intentions. The authors compared several competing technology adoption models for predicting behavioural intentions to use information technology, and reported the DTPB as being superior in terms of overall model fit, explanatory power, and insights drawn about behavioural intentions. Therefore, using the DTPB, the current study investigates the factors influencing microlearning usage intentions in working adults, and more importantly, explores if the strength of the relationships between the factors vary according to age, gender, and technology proficiency. The better explanatory power of the DTPB may afford a more detailed and satisfactory account of behavioural intentions for a fairly new learning technology like microlearning, and thus facilitate and support its adoption in our workforce. Figure 1 presents the adapted DTPB model explored in this study.",

SE reflect one's judgment of their own ability to perform specific behaviours, while RFC and TFC reflect the availability of resources required to perform the behaviour (e.g. time, money, technological equipment).

For example, Sheeran (2002) meta-analysis of previous meta-analyses (involving 422 studies in total) found a large correlation (r = 0.53) between intentions at one time-point and actual behaviour measured at a later time-point. More recently, Wood et al.

For instance, Venkatesh et al. (2000) applied the TPB model to examine gender as a moderator of the determinants of workers' intentions and use of a new software application over a 5-month period. The authors found gender differences only at the first month mark, with males more influenced by Attitude toward using the software, and females more heavily influenced by social factors (i.e., SN) and environmental constraints (i.e., PBC). By the second month, these gender differences in determining software use were non-significant.",

The influence of SN on older working adults' intentions to use technology became non-significant when making long-term decisions; over time, decisions made regarding technology usage shifted from compliance to others' opinion to independent assessments for whether they should use that technology. PBC remains an important factor influencing software use intentions in older workers as high importance is placed on receiving support and assistance as they continue to use the technology. Therefore, with a highly diverse group of working adults, demographic characteristics should be studied alongside determinants of behavioural intentions to provide a more comprehensive view of whether one decides to use microlearning or not.",

Structural factor invariance was supported by only two out of nine regression paths; a positive influence of PU on Attitude and a negative influence of computer SE on Attitude were found to be equally applicable to students and teachers.

Participants had to be at least 17-years-old, and have prior working experience and e-Learning experience. They were either recruited from adult learning institutes or got to know of the study through word-of-mouth, and took part on a voluntary basis. As a result of the COVID-19 restrictions, the authors were unable to proceed with physical data collection; this might have biassed the participant sample toward working adults who are better versed with digital technology and thus is not an accurate representation of the working population of Singapore. Our sample size was determined using a general rule of thumb which found a sample size of 200 or more adequate for a SEM analysis (Kline, 2015) . We aimed to collect at least 500 responses between the period of October 2020 to December 2020, and eventually collected more data than expected. Since previous research studying behavioural intentions of e-Learning usage using the DTPB model reported sample sizes ranging between 200 and 500 (Ahmed and Ward, 2016; Renda dos Santos and Okazaki, 2016), our sample size of 628 is sufficiently larger than previous samples. Table 1 includes demographic data of the participants, and the comparison groups they were grouped into for the measurement invariance analyses. These data-informed splits were made to maintain high robustness in our results; Meade (2005) ran a simulation study and found that a sample size of 100 per group was insufficient, and produced less robust results than sample sizes of 200 and 400. As such, we made a logical split such that each comparison group had at least 200 data points. To this end, working adults aged between 17 to 39 were grouped together (n = 395) and those 40 and above grouped into the second group (n = 233); also, working adults who rated themselves as \"Not proficient at all, \" \"Slightly proficient, \" and \"Moderately Proficient\" were grouped together (n = 204), while those who rated themselves as \"Highly Proficient\" and \"Extremely Proficient\" were grouped together (n = 424). We acknowledge that in recategorising age and technology proficiency groups into wider groups, due to the lack of sufficient data points to categorise participants into more distinct groups, we lost some valuable information.",

The difference between the less constrained model nested within the more constrained model can be assessed with a chi-square test of difference ( \u03c7 2 ). However, researchers (Cheung and Rensvold, 2002; Chen, 2007) highlighted that \u03c7 2 is still very much affected by large sample sizes and deviations from normality, leading to unrealistic and improbable standards for showing evidence of invariance. Therefore, alternative criteria should be used to assess for evidence of measurement invariance, namely (a) adequate overall model fit of the multigroup model based on cut-off recommendations of fit indexes (Byrne and Stewart, 2006) ; and (b) a non-significant change in goodness-of-fit indexes between nested models as an indication that observed differences may be explained by chance [i.e., CFI \u2264 0.01 (Cheung and Rensvold, 2002) , RMSEA \u2264 0.015, SRMR \u2264 0.01 (Chen, 2007) ].

Improvements were made by removing items contributing to poorer measurement quality (i.e., 6 items that had weak factor loadings of less than 0.7, and 4 items that were more strongly correlated with items measuring another factor than its intended factor). The resulting final measurement model with 36 items loaded onto 12 factors produced a satisfactory model-data fit (CFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.04). For more information, supplementary materials include a detailed breakdown of the various analyses carried out at the measurement level to ensure high measurement quality of the measurement model (see online supplementary file https://doi. org/10.21979/N9/NZ8N7M). Table 3 includes the results for multigroup invariance of the DTPB model across gender, age group, and technology proficiency. In general, the tests of measurement invariance showed support for invariance in model structure, factor loadings, item intercepts, and item residuals between males and females, between working adults below 40 years and above 40 years, and between working adults with lower technology proficiency and higher technology proficiency levels. According to various fit indexes, the 12-factor solution for each group across gender, age, and technology proficiency showed an acceptable model fit (0.92 \u2264 CFIs \u2264 0.93, RMSEAs = 0.06, SRMR = 0.08). Although both RMSEA and SRMR fell exactly on the bounds of cut-off recommendations, and CFI fell close to the cut-off bounds, the existence of a reliability paradox, which illustrates how models are punished for having better measurement quality (i.e., large sample size, standardised factor loadings > 0.7) while models with poorer measurement quality achieve good modeldata fit more easily, makes an acceptable model-data fit more difficult to obtain in such cases where there is better measurement quality (Heene et al., 2011; McNeish et al., 2017) . Therefore, since ensuring a high measurement quality in our measurement model, a slight difference in values of fit indexes from the cut-off recommendations is not necessarily an indication of poor fit.",

We were specifically interested in assessing if constructs of the DTPB model were invariant across groups. As working professionals constitute a heterogeneous population, this study examined measurement (configural, metric, scalar, strict) and structural (factor variance and covariance) invariance to assess if latent constructs and relationships in the DTPB model were equivalent across different demographic groups (i.e., gender, age, and technology proficiency level). Establishing measurement invariance across groups would allow for meaningful comparisons to be made about the relationships among constructs, or about the latent constructs themselves, which potentially translates into practical significance for facilitating and accelerating microlearning adoption with the workforce. Firstly, results of this study revealed that a 12-factor model was valid in explaining microlearning usage intentions of all working adults, regardless of demographic differences. Next, our findings showed that measurement invariance (configural, metric, scalar, and strict) was supported for each group across gender, age, and technology proficiency, and thus allowed for subsequent comparisons of latent mean differences across groups. Following the satisfaction of the various tests of Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org measurement invariance, we attempted to establish structural invariance (factor variance and covariance) for each group across gender, age, and technology proficiency. We found that while measurement invariance existed in our data, structural invariance was only found across gender, not age and technology proficiency; the structural model imposed on various latent constructs was invariant across gender, but varied depending on one's age and level of technology proficiency.

However, a literature search revealed that several authors have similarly failed to find gender differences in technology adoption contexts. For example, Baker et al. (2007) used the TPB with over a thousand Saudi Arabian workers to investigate moderating effects of gender on adoption of new technology, but failed to find a significant interaction between gender and behaviour intentions. One reason provided by the authors, that may also apply in our research, was that previous research showing moderating effects of gender on intentions to use technology often used a Western sample; as such, their findings may not generalise to a non-Western survey sample. Further research using TPB and DTPB in non-Western cultures are necessary to ascertain the validity of this claim.",

In other words, those above 40 years perceive themselves as having more control over decisions of participating in microlearning. Although only a limited number of technology usage studies have tested age as a moderator, our findings are in line with previous research that has found the effect of PBC increasing with age. Morris and Venkatesh (2000) tested technology adoption decisions using the TPB and reported that PBC was more salient for older workers. Hill et al. (2015) reported that older adults above 55 years of age sometimes see mastering new digital technology as a way to empower themselves in this age of digitalisation. Thus, this might be one reason why PBC increases with age. Furthermore, testing for measurement invariance at least helps us reject measurementrelated differences as a reason for finding differences between older and younger working adults. However, since other factors (e.g., job seniority) were not controlled for, it is difficult to determine if the reason for this difference is simply a result of age.",

Similarly, Morris and Venkatesh (2000) found an increased importance being placed on technical assistance to support the use of new technology with increasing age. Therefore, we recommend that when introducing new technology and encouraging the use of technology with working adults, more resources and support should be made available to older working adults.",

With all other factors, individuals with lower technology proficiency were significantly lower on the scale. Despite being similar with regards to intentions to participate in microlearning, individuals who rated themselves as being less technologically proficient perceived microlearning as more difficult to use, not as useful, less compatible with their learning style, were less influenced by opinions of others, less confident in participating in microlearning, and believed the resources and technological support available to them were lacking. This highlights an important consideration when introducing microlearning, or any new technology, to working adults; despite its advantages and benefits, a substantial number of individuals will be less technologically proficient than others and require more support. Knight (2015) recommends customising efforts to integrate and introduce new technology based on workers' level of familiarity with and interest in technology. For example, an online training session may be sufficient for some workers, while others may require more guidance and handholding in the form of a coach or trainer. Understanding the technological proficiency and comfort level of one's employees, then appropriately managing feelings of uncertainty toward new changes, buffers against resistance against new technology and prevents underutilisation.",

Again, this implies that, the relationships among latent variables were equally applicable for both individuals of lower and higher technological proficiency levels. This may be somewhat surprising, considering some previous findings of moderating effects of technology proficiency on general technology usage behaviour. For instance, Choi et al.

To this end, it is still too early to state whether both measurement and structural invariance holds for actual low technologically proficient populations. One possible reason for this is due to COVID-19 restrictions which forbade us from conducting physical data collection; our sample may be skewed toward working adults who are better versed with digital technology (e.g., accessing the survey online through a web link).",

They were also no more likely to believe they had control over participating in microlearning even with the required resources needed to participate available to them, while the availability of resources was a significant predictor of older working adults' perceptions of control for engaging in microlearning.
