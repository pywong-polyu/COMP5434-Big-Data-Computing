All recommendations rated medians of 6.5-9 on a 1-9 scale (1 = \"extremely inappropriate\", 5 = \"uncertain\", 9 = \"extremely appropriate\"). The sections \"General recommendations\" and \"Gender perspective during the consent process for clinical studies\" showed the highest \"uncertainty\" rating. The four keys to improving the understanding of the ICP in clinical studies are to: (1) consider consent a two-way continuous interaction that begins at the first contact with the potential participant and continues until the end of the study; (2) improve investigators' communication skills; (3) co-create the information; and (4) use a layered approach, including information to compensate for the potential participant's possible lack of health literacy and a glossary of terms.",

Panellists stated that the potential participant's understanding has to be achieved through natural conversation. The experts were very critical of the use of questionnaires (especially with MacCAT) or the teach-back method. These, in their opinion, feel artificial and make the potential participant feel as if they are in an exam. However, given that the scientific literature has repeatedly pointed out the usefulness of techniques such as the teach-back method or questionnaires (including self-completion) to assess the level of understanding of potential participants [5, 19, 26, 27] , we believe that while the best option is to have investigators with good communication skills that do not need to use these components, they can be a useful tool during verbal discussion at certain times. Defining how to assess understanding is another important question that emerged during the discussion. The initial proposal for recommendation 18 was to verify that potential participants have understood \"all\" the information about the study, but this was considered unrealistic and unnecessary in most studies, and a more appropriate recommendation would be to verify that potential participants have understood \"all relevant\" information about the study. The information considered as relevant must be defined during the co-creation of the information, taking into account both perspectives (investigator/sponsor and potential participants).",
