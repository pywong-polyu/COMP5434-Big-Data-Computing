There are various reasons why Cloud is an essential irresistible technology and serves as an ultimate solution to access IT software and systems. It has become a new essential catalyst for Enterprise Organisations which are looking for Digital Transformation. Remote working is a common phenomenon now across all the IT companies making the services available all the time. Covid-19 has made cloud adoption an immediate priority for Organisation rather than a slowly approached future transformation. The benefits of Cloud lies in the fact that employees rather engineers of an enterprise are no more dependent on the closed hardware-based IT infrastructure and hence eliminates the necessity of working from the networked office premises. This has raised a huge demand for skilled Cloud specialist who can manage and support the systems running on cloud across different regions of the world. In this research, the reasons for growing Cloud adoption after pandemic Covid-19 has been described and the challenges which Organization will face is also explained. This study also details the most used cloud services during the pandemic considering Amazon Web Services as the cloud provider.",

Cloud computing is the availability of various computing services which includes primarily compute, storage and network over the internet to enable flexibility to access, faster innovation, lower infrastructure costs and making your end user systems highly available and scalable with increased security. It reduces the burden of maintaining the on-premise infrastructure and since it's an on-demand delivery model you pay-as-you-go.",

Public and private organizations have invested millions in security products and incident response personnel but have not tested the efficiency of these safeguards and people using actual attack techniques. They generally lack a comprehensive approach to understanding and operationalizing cyber threat intelligence. The result is a weak security defence posture that undermines investments in threat detection and protection. But Cloud providers have ascertained that they monitor the Client's data and files all the times with latest security policies and services. With a shared responsibility model followed on cloud, it is essential for an enterprise to monitor, identify and remediate on any potential threats and misconfigurations on their provisioned cloud resources. Data breaches and improper Identity and Access management are the important factors to be considered before going for cloud adoption [6] . There are certain obvious common security concerns as well with both on-premise and Cloud based infrastructure. With Cloud adoption, RapidScale claims that 94% of businesses saw an improvement in security and 91% said the cloud makes it easier to meet government compliance requirements [7].",

Originally Amazon Web Services emerged as a sustainable Cloud provider but now there are various other Cloud providers too like Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle etc. Each of these providers have an edge over the other Cloud provider in terms of different areas like Enterprises using Cloud for hosting their applications to be accessible over internet securely used a variety of Cloud services. The table below in Figure 1. shows Cloud services which were used most by 4 different Organisation using AWS (Amazon Web Services) as the Cloud Provider for their 3 applications.Types of CloudsPublic Cloud: It's a type of hosting in which cloud services are delivered over a network for public use, in a shared Infrastructure model. Customers do not have any control over the location of the infrastructure in Public Cloud and the cost is shared and are either free or in the form of a license policy like pay per user. Public Clouds are great for organizations that require managing the host applications Private Cloud: It's a Cloud infrastructure that is solely used dedicatedly by one organization. It gives Organizations greater control over security and data which is managed internally. It can be hosted internally or externally. Private clouds are great for organizations that have high security demands, high management demands and uptime requirements.",
