Type III IFN (IFN-\u03bb) is a group of IFNs related to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, showing similar antiviral effects [3, 4] . Four subtypes of IFN-\u03bb have been found in humans: IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29); IFN-\u03bb2 (IL-28A); IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B); and IFN-\u03bb4 [5] . The action of IFN-\u03bb is realized through the heterodimeric IFNLR receptor, which consists of the IFN\u03bbR1 and IL10R2 subunits. The IL10R2 subunit is also part of receptor complexes for IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26; it is expressed in the cells of various tissues [6] . In contrast, the IFN\u03bbR1 subunit exhibits limited cellular distribution. A high level of IFN\u03bbR1 has been noted in the lungs, intestines, liver, and upper epidermis [7] .",

The transcriptional response to IFN-\u03bb is generally weaker than to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, but is characterized by a longer duration [14, 15] . The use of IFN-\u03bb as a potential antiviral drug has several advantages over IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Using in vivo models, it has been shown that the use of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 for influenza (viral infection) treatment has led to conflicting results [16] . Side effects were explained by the immunomodulatory effects of IFN-\u03b1: recruitment of cells of the innate immune system to the site of infection (pDC, monocytes); increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1); and increased respiratory epithelial cell apoptosis frequency [17] .",

Interestingly, increased serum IFN-\u03bb levels were found only in non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) COVID-19 patients, while more severe ICU patients did not show increased serum IFN-\u03bb [22] . Consequently, a severe course of infection is associated with impaired functioning of the innate immune system and activation of ISGs. The administration of exogenous IFN-\u03bb appears to be a promising approach to alleviate the disease course. Clinical studies on the effect of PEG-IFN-\u03bb1, on the recovery dynamics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, have been carried out. There was a slight decrease in viral load on the seventh day after the start of the experiment, but there were no differences in clinical symptoms between the PEG-IFN-\u03bb1 and placebo groups [23] . For a more accurate assessment of the therapeutic potential of IFN-\u03bb1, we carried out additional in vitro studies.",

As shown in Figure 2 , addition of recombinant IFN-\u03bb1 led to an increase in the expression of the canonical antiviral ISGs MxA, PKR, and OAS-1. Meanwhile, the expression level of MxA mRNA, which has a direct antiviral effect against influenza [27] , increased more than 500-fold (relative to nonstimulated cells) and more than 10-fold (relative to cells infected with IVA). It is noteworthy that the expression of PKR and OAS-1 in the case of IVA infection was suppressed. Similarly, the expression of SOCS-1 was determined, as it carries out negative regulation of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by cells in response to IFN-\u03bb1 stimulation. We have shown an increase in SOCS-1 expression in response to both IVA infection and IFN-\u03bb1 stimulation of cells. In addition, the expression of Rig-1, a cellular sensor involved in the innate immune response to influenza, was also found to be altered in response to IFN-\u03bb1 stimulation. Interestingly, the expression profiles of the considered genes upon 'preventive' administration of IFN-\u03bb1 followed by infection with IVA' generally differed little from cells that were not infected with IVA. The administration of IFN-\u03bb1 generally led to more powerful expression of the considered genes, including MxA, Rig-1, and SOCS-1, which, in general, increased upon IVA infection. Since the Vero cell lineage, which has Chlorocebus sabaeus origin (not Homo sapiens), was also used to assess the antiviral activity, we evaluated the ability of the human recombinant IFN-\u03bb1 protein to induce ISGs in these cells. In Vero cells, IFN-\u03bb1 also induced the expression of MxA, PKR, OAS-1, as well as SOCS-1 and Rig-1. The most significant changes were in MxA expression. Upon treatment with IFN-\u03bb1, the average mRNA level of this gene in Vero cells increased more than 4000-fold (Supplementary, Figure S4 ).",

In our work, we showed the ability of IFN-\u03bb to activate the expression of ISGs such as MxA, PKR, OAS-1, and Rig-1 in A549 cells. It is interesting to note that PKR and OAS-1 expression was suppressed when cells were IVA-infected and did not differ significantly from control cells.

Patients with moderate COVID-19 severity had increased levels of ISGs. In severe patients, on the contrary, an extremely weak activation of antiviral ISGs (MxA, IFITM, IFIT-2) was noted, and the production of IFN-\u03b12 at the protein level was reduced (compared with moderate cases). Moreover, all groups infected with SARS-CoV-2 were characterized by undetectably low IFN-\u03b2, both at the protein and mRNA levels [52] . Thus, the antiviral response we observed against SARS-CoV-2 may be largely mediated by ISGs induced by type III IFN. Interestingly, the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load did not strongly depend on IFN-\u03bb1 concentration (100 or 500 ng/mL). However, a decrease in viral titer was observed only at IFN-\u03bb1 concentrations exceeding the previously calculated EC 50 (approximately 10 ng/mL).",

Meanwhile, such administration in the 'preventive' or 'preventive/therapeutic' schemes limited viral growth. It should be noted that in the proposed scheme, we used single-cycle viral replication to analyze the early cellular response to infection in vivo.

At the same time, early viral factors that antagonize the IFN system, such as IVA NS1 protein, successfully inhibit the IFN-\u03bb-induced immune response of the cell.

It is also worth noting that, when simulating multiple-cycle IVA replication, cell media after infection contained trypsin at a final concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL. With this content of trypsin, loss of IFN-\u03bb functionality and its degradation can be observed. It should be noted that, even with single-cycle IVA replication in Vero cells, the decrease in viral load was insignificant (no more than 1 Log (TCID 50 ) relative to the control). Interestingly, IFN-\u03bb stimulation of Vero cells resulted in a generally less critical decrease in cell viral load.

In our experiments, stimulation of cells with IFN-\u03bb1 did not lead to any significant decreases in the production of viral antigen (hexon) or viral RNA replication, nor decline in infectious activity. Thus, we found no evidence of restriction of AdV (serotype 5) production in cells treated with IFN-\u03bb1. The lack of an antiviral effect against AdV with exogenous IFN-\u03bb1 may be due to various viral repressors (such as E1A and E1B proteins) of cellular protective mechanisms and ISGs [57, 58] .",

According to our results, human IFN-\u03bb1 has the potential to limit the replication of RNA viruses in vitro. However, the data presented here show that treatment of cells by IFN-\u03bb1 immediately after viral invasion can sometimes provoke stimulated viral production, as with CHIKV and less often with IVA. It is noteworthy that such an effect was observed in vitro in a single cell population and is apparently due to the interaction between immunosuppressing viral proteins and effector mechanisms of innate immunity. The molecular basis of this pathogenic potential in the formation of IFN-\u03bb-mediated antiviral responses should be more carefully evaluated using animal models.",
