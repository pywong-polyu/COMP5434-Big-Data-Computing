Increased platelet activation has been described previously in patients with diabetes (regardless of diabetes control), which may be due to hyperglycemia, low-degree inflammation, and increased oxidation [8] . In addition, thrombin generation in platelets appears to be enhanced in patients with diabetes [9] . Thus, the development of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes may enhance the pre-existing platelet dysfunction, since COVID-19 itself, and many of its complications, have been associated with platelet activation, mainly due to uncontrolled overproduction of inflammatory cytokines [10] .",
