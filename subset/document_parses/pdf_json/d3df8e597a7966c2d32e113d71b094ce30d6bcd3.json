Methods To compare Relative Search Volume (RSV) among different twelve preselected urologic keywords we chose \"United States\" as country and \"01/01/2009-31/12/2018\" as time range on Google Trends (GT). We defined \"ureteroscopy\" as a reference and compared RSV against it for each term. RSV was adjusted and normalized in a scale 0-100. Trend presence was evaluated by Mann-Kendall Test and magnitude by Sen's Slope Estimator (SS). Weather influence on RSV was also investigated by comparison of the ten hottest versus ten coldest states. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between number of Pubmed publications and RSV for each term over time.",

Higher temporal trends were seen for \"kidney stone\" (SS = 0.36), \"kidney pain\" (SS = 0.39) and \"tamsulosin\" (SS = 0.21). Technical treatment terms had little search volumes and no increasing trend. States with hotter weather showed higher mean RSV for \"kidney stone\" than colder ones. There was little correlation between GT and Pubmed for most terms, with the exception of \"kidney stone\" (R = 0.89; p < 0.01), \"URS\" (R = 0.81; p < 0.01), and \"laser lithotripsy\" (R = 0.74; p = 0.01). Conclusion There was a significant increase in online search for medical information related to stone disease. Citizens tend to look for generic terms related to symptoms or the disease itself. States with hotter weather show higher RSV than colder states. There is a discrepancy between public and medical community medical terms.",

In 2019, just ten percent of US adults reported that they did not use the internet [7] . Just recently, online strategies and internet trend search gathering tools have been developed to provide useful information for monitoring global and regional health seeking behaviour patterns, epidemiology, aetiology and treatment of various medical conditions, including urolithiasis [8] . Google Trends (GT) is one of the most important of these tools, in which internet queries are catalogued and this indexed information is available to the public.

In our study, we could notice a remarkable increase in interest of the patients in regard to medical information related to kidney stones in the United States. The Google Trend platform cannot compare searching patterns of patients naive for stone treatment with those who have already been instructed in a urologic visit. Although we cannot assume the order in which an individual look for the terms online, the relative volume of search and temporal trend allow for some suppositions. Citizens probably start their research using terms that describe their symptoms or the disease itself, e.g. \"kidney pain\" and \"kidney stone\". Interestingly, \"renal stone\" and \"renal colic\" had low public interest, which demonstrate a cultural language preference of the name \"kidney\" over \"renal\". After looking for those terms, they possibly seek for information concerning existing clinical and surgical treatments, e.g. \"tamsulosin\", \"lithotripsy\", \"kidney stent\" or \"kidney stone surgery\". Online search volume for technical terms as \"PCNL\", \"URS\", SWL\" and \"laser lithotripsy\" was very low. This is the first study to compare population online search behaviour with medical publication patterns. Noteworthy, our results clarify that there is a mismatch between urologic community publications on Pubmed and general information-seeking comportment. This highlights the need for a shift on media planning to better educate our patients who seek for information to make informed decision about their own health.",

The terms \"Kidney stent\" was the fifth in total search volume and may reflect a post-operative information-seeking pattern. \"Tamsulosin\" showed expressive RSV in 2018. In total RSV, it was the third term and a significant increase was seen between 2009 and 2018 which may reflect the interest in medical management an individual might start or was already put on.

They found \"kidney stone surgery\" as the most common term in comparison to \"PCNL\", \"SWL\", \"URS\" and \"laser lithotripsy\". The authors stated that research trends for the expression \"kidney stone surgery\" remained fairly constant over the six-year period and was more looked for in the states of Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and North Carolina. Likewise, they found that specific treatment modalities yielded similar search trends over time but were queried at a lower frequency than the term \"kidney stone surgery\". A common aspect to our study is the fact we have also found that specific surgical technical terms are indeed not relevant in regard to search volume. Nonetheless, we found that the search interest for \"kidney stone surgery\" increased over time and the negative results they had might be explained by the shorter period of time included in their study. If we look at our Fig. 1A , the variation of RSV for \"kidney stone surgery\" was not so pronounced between 2011 and 2017. Second, and more importantly, the lack of a formal statistical analysis is the main drawback of their investigation. One cannot assume just by looking at the graphic that there was no tendency in one direction or another. Finally, the authors did not investigate terms related to the disease itself and symptomatology, which we found to be the most important terminologies addressed by the population.",

However, it was not completely accurate, and the authors believe that this new instrument could have a role in improving the traditional epidemiological surveillance models instead of replacing it. Verma et al. [12] studied the temporal correlation between GT and Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme data to determine if it was feasible to use online data for prediction of outbreaks or epidemics. A significant temporal association was observed, and the authors found a high correlation for Chikungunya and Dengue fever in the studied regions, while Malaria and Enteric fever had a moderate correlation, all preceding factual epidemic outbreak in 2 to 3 weeks. In that same sense, Unsal et al. [13] showed the potential utility of the GT database as a resource for epidemiologic monitoring on epistaxis and for the identification of at-risk populations. More recently, in face of the coronavirus 19 pandemic, Husnayain et al. [14] retrieved GT data for the specific locations of Taiwan. The authors found high-to-moderate correlations between GT RSV and infected cases in several regions and concluded that GT could potentially define the proper timing and site for performing risk communication strategies to the population.",

Similar prevention campaigns could be created and released prior the historical periods of increased stone-related events for any particular region of the country.
