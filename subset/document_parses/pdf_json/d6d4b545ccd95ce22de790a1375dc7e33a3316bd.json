            "text": "Spain is a global leader in the wine sector in terms of production capacity, which is in stark contrast to its low domestic wine consumption. This situation forces Spanish producers to develop a clear focus on exports. Traditionally, the business model in Spain has been based on low prices, high volumes, and a strong dependence on traditional markets, which places Spain at a clear competitive disadvantage in terms of value. Given these commercial challenges in this sector, where cooperatives play a central role, information and communication technologies, particularly websites, offer a source of competitive advantage. The main aim of this research is to analyze the organizational factors and commercial features that are associated with the online popularity of wine producers. This study seeks to verify the influence of organizational aspects (company size and integration), commercial features (sales of bottled wine, internationalization, and organic certification), and website quality on the popularity of corporate websites. The analysis was conducted using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results reveal that the number of website visits is positively related to business integration, organic certification, export activity, website quality, and the marketing of bottled wine. * Corresponding author.

The Internet has undoubtedly become crucial in business and trade around the world because of its rapid widespread penetration in society. Websites represent one of the fundamental tools in online business strategies. Websites are the channel through which communication between companies and their customers takes place and where information about companies' offerings is displayed .

            "text": "A company website has become a basic tool for interacting with customers, supporting the Direct-To-Consumer (D2C) strategy (Crehan, 2019) . Therefore, website popularity in terms of number of visits is a prime objective for organizations (Harto, 2019) . Numerous studies have evaluated the impact of the Internet and e-commerce on the marketing of agri-food products (e.g., Cristobal, Montegut, Ferrer, & Daries, 2020; Zeng, Jia, Wan, & Guo, 2017) . Many of these studies have demonstrated the capacity of ICT to reduce transaction costs by improving the efficiency of business actions along the value chain (Evans & Wurster, 1997) . However, many studies suggest that investing in ICT is not enough. Instead, a series of additional investments and specific organizational practices are needed to make effective use of these tools (Fern\u00e1ndez, L\u00f3pez, Rodr\u00edguez, & Sandulli, 2007) . In order to be efficient, investment in ICT must be accompanied by other actions that are just as (if not more) important. Examples of these actions include investment in training, investment in reengineering and redesigning business processes, and investment in other organizational or strategic factors (Barua, Lee, & Whinston, 1996; Becchetti, Andres, & Paganetto, 2003; Devaraj & Kohli, 2000; Mozas, Bernal, Fern\u00e1ndez, & Medina, 2016; Rogers, 2010) . There is a gap in the literature due to a lack of studies that aim at identifying which characteristics define the organizations with the most popular websites (greatest number of website visits). Accordingly, this article addresses the following two questions: What organizational factors are associated with greater popularity? What strategies can lead to greater user traffic on a website? Given this context, the main aim of this research is to analyze the organizational factors and commercial features that are linked to the popularity of wine producers' websites. Specifically, the aim is to verify the influence of different aspects of the business on these companies' website traffic. The results show that these aspects consist of organizational and structural features (company size and integration), commercial features (the marketing of bottled wine to end consumers, internationalization, and organic certification), and website quality. To achieve this aim, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used.",

Web traffic is therefore a key variable for an organization to be aware of and measure so that the organization can determine effective strategies to maintain and enhance its online presence while improving its organizational performance (Ghandour, 2015) . Accordingly, this study proposes to identify the variables that are positively associated with the number of visits to an organization's website.",

The popularity of a website lies in the optimization of its content, its adaptation to customers' needs, and its ability to facilitate interaction (Butkiewicz, Madhyastha, & Sekar, 2011) .

These virtual platforms also give exporting companies numerous functionalities, so they will tend to improve their quality and thereby attract a greater number of users (Kim, 2019) . In addition, websites allow small organizations to grow through exports (Qurratu'Aini and Hapsari, 2019), which entails major marketing efforts through their websites to increase their online popularity (Kim & Stoel, 2004) . Thus, websites have become a channel for SMEs to internationalize so as to achieve a high volume of website traffic (Manyika & Lund, 2016; Moral, Mozas, Bernal, & Medina, 2015) .

However, on the demand side, consumer misinformation and poor access to the supply of organic products have led consumers to use online channels as an alternative means of purchase (Mozas et al., 2016) . This situation is especially relevant given that consumers of organic products need more information (Lee & Yun, 2015) and that traditional sales channels have been unable to respond to this growing need (Roitner, Darnhofer, Somsook, & Vogl, 2008) . In addition, the intrinsic characteristics of certain \"experiential\" agricultural products make them particularly suited to Internet marketing (Stricker, Mueller, & Sumner, 2007) . The purchase and consumption of wine, for example, is based on an intensive exchange of information concerning largely intangible aspects of the product, which can significantly improve the perception of the product's value (Canavari, Regazzi, & Spadoni, 2002) .",

Cooperatives are built on collaborative arrangements that bring together many individual business owners. This group shares the means of production in order to exploit the benefits of collaboration and a larger scale. In this way, the participating co-owners achieve greater benefits (Mozas, 1999) . The size of these organizations encourages their online presence because it gives them more resources to devote to online activity (Louw & Nieuwenhuizen, 2019) . Several studies have highlighted organizational size as an explanatory factor for innovation and technological adoption (Wamba & Carter, 2014) . In addition, according to Borges, Hoppen, and Luce (2009) information systems are used more frequently within organizations than toward the market. Therefore, a cooperative with a larger number of members will have more website visits. Also, due to the network effect, greater social capital (i.e., the interconnected network of individuals who interact with the organization) will increase the usefulness of the website (Karoui, Dudezert, & Leidner, 2015) and therefore the traffic it receives.

            "text": "One of the main problems facing agri-food entities, particularly the organizations studied here, is a lack of market orientation. As noted above, farmers continue to sell in bulk to international markets at low prices. This approach results in low competitiveness and profitability because of a failure to move up the value chain of the products offered (Cristobal et al., 2020; Heyder, Makus, & Theuvsen, 2011) . ICTs provide a marketing channel for the sale of bottled wine, which captures the value added that escapes producers that sell in bulk (Triana, 2019) . Thus, a market orientation is necessary for the success of an organization's online commercial activity (Borges et al., 2009 ). In marketing their products, organizations oriented toward the consumer market must design a website that offers guarantees, generates a certain amount of traffic, and encourages transactions (Warlina, Siddiq, & Valentina, 2019) . The sales efforts of targeting the consumer market result in a higher quality and more popular website, which enables organizations to listen to, talk to, and interact with the customer network (Durking, Mcgowan, & Mckeown, 2013) . The commitment to a packaged product, aimed directly at end consumers, increases an organization's reputation in the market, especially if this commitment is combined with complementary strategies . Based on these arguments, the following proposition may be formulated:",

This region has by far the largest area of vineyards and wine production in Spain and is responsible for 5% of the world's wine production (Cooperativas Agro-alimentarias, 2019). Despite greater regional competition in the marketing of its wines, Castilla-La Mancha has made slow progress, and brands from this region still have a low profile in the domestic and international consumer markets. This status is due to the region's traditional focus on table wine, whose commercial outlet is primarily bulk sales. These considerations make this region an attractive context for this study.",

This method does not require large samples (Ragin & Rihoux, 2004; Ragin, Shulman, Weinberg, & Gran, 2003) , so it was wellsuited to this study. There are essentially two variants of this research technique. The first is crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis (csQCA), or conventional qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), which was the method initially developed by Ragin (1987) . The second is fsQCA (Ragin, 2008) . By using fuzzy-set theory and Boolean logic, this second variant of QCA overcomes the main limitation of csQCA, which only permits dichotomous variables. Thus, in addition to permitting dichotomous variables, fsQCA enables the use of continuous and interval variables. However, to include continuous or interval variables in the study, prior calibration is necessary to convert these variables into fuzzy categories or fuzzy variables. Calibration of the variables consists of assigning values between 0 and 1, depending on the degree of membership (see Woodside & Zhang, 2012) .",

One response to this situation is the online marketing of products to end consumers. Given this background, the aim of this study is to analyze the organizational factors and commercial features that are linked to the popularity of wine organizations' websites.",

As the literature indicates for other sectors, simply using a website without a solid commitment by allocating resources will not yield the desired results (Mozas et al., 2016) . Similarly, different aspects are associated with greater popularity on the Internet. The results of this study indicate that the quality of information and interaction on the website, the presence of the organization in international markets, the organic certification of the wine, the size of the cooperative, and the organization's orientation toward the consumer market positively affect the popularity of the websites of the cooperatives in this sector. These results are consistent with those of previous studies and lead to acceptance of the five propositions tested in the study.",

As reported here, the wine sector in some regions faces a major problem regarding the marketing of its products to end consumers. Therefore, ICTs, particularly websites, offer this sector a crucial channel to solve this structural problem (Gorges et al., 2009) . Commercial efforts aimed at the end market will lead to greater innovation through, for example, the design of higher quality websites (Durking et al., 2013) . The results should be interpreted while keeping in mind the major commercial problems highlighted earlier. In addition, it is important to consider the opportunity provided by the presence of the current digital context, which is characterized by continuous growth of e-commerce operations on the domestic and international levels (Cristobal et al., 2020) . In this area, food products play an increasingly prominent role. The results provide strategic guidelines for private and public decision makers to follow if they wish to exploit the full potential of ICT. Accordingly, commitment to greater business concentration, internationalization, the flourishing organic product market, and greater market orientation can support the development of this sector not only in conventional markets but also in digital markets.",
