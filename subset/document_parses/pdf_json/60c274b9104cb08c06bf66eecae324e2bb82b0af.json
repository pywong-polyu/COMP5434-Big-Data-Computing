As of December 23, 2021, Nigeria has 231,413 cases across all states, of which 211,853 were discharged and 2991 confirmed dead [7] . Since the pandemic, males are mostly affected than females, with a 60: 40 case ratio and 74:26 death ratio [7] . Individuals 50 years and above account for 70% of the mortality burden [7] . All states in the country are affected, but most cases are reported in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) [7] . While recent data trends have suggested a continuous decrease in the number of cases, the spread of the pandemic, the second wave in December 2020 [8] , and non-adherence to nonpharmaceutical preventive measures underscored the need for an effective vaccine. Vaccination with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is critical for Nigeria's strategy to interrupt the COVID-19 pandemic and curb transmission.",

For example, in 2003, a rumor that the oral polio vaccine contained porcine material and sterilizing agents led to a boycott of polio vaccination in Northern Nigeria. Following this vaccine boycott, an upsurge in polio cases resulted in wild-polio re-infection in 20 countries across Africa and Asia [9] [10] [11] and retrogression of polio eradication efforts in Nigeria and the African region. In 2017, another rumor broke out in the country's Southeastern part, purporting that the Nigerian military was ''vaccinating\" school children with the monkeypox virus [12] . This false story led panicked parents to withdraw their children from school and, uncharacteristically, refuse to take them for vaccination. Soon after that, vaccination rates dropped in that part of the country -a region that previously had some of the highest vaccine uptake rates in the country.",

            "text": "Early vaccine procurement, domestic production of vaccines, the severity of the pandemic, a country's health infrastructure, and vaccine acceptance are significant determinants of COVID-19 vaccine coverage [13] . However, evidence has shown that widespread vaccine acceptance is crucial for achieving sufficient immunization coverage [14] . Until recently, hesitancy surrounding COVID-19 vaccines was not the top programmatic bottleneck to widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines in Nigeria and other lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) because the vaccines were in short supply globally. Thus, like other LMICs, Nigeria introduced COVID-19 vaccines with barely enough doses to cover 1% of the population, with vaccine demand far outstripping vaccine supply. As the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines improves in the second half of 2021 and more doses become available and deployed in LMICs, demand and acceptance, along with absorption capacity, will become the top coverage drivers. Therefore, the need to address vaccine hesitancy will become even more critical and urgent. For example, Nigeria received 40 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in August 2021 and commenced the second vaccination phase [15] . With the planned deployment of millions of vaccine doses, demand generation activities must take center stage, and part of this effort must include practical strategies to address and debunk misinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. We use the term misinformation to denote false or inaccurate information or communication [16] . We consider conspiracy theories as a particular kind of false information in which the creators of conspiracy theories attribute the root causes of events or trends to shadowy networks or cabals carrying out secret plots to control, undermine or exploit the public, governments, or institutions [17] . Conspiracy theories reject the standard explanations for significant phenomena and instead credit covert actors and manipulators.",

This study was designed to systematically elicit the circulating COVID-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories that the Nigerian public had heard or read.

The range of statements reported in our study is similar to a list of globally circulating misinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 compiled by Nyika et al. [20] .

This view confirms similar skepticism reported in other studies and countries about the virus being perceived as a hoax and the COVID-19 prevention efforts as an avenue for politicians to embezzle public funds [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Hoaxrelated conspiracy theories have been shown to predict refusal to engage in preventive behaviors, including vaccination [25] . A striking finding from this study is that the Igbos from Southeast Nigeria were perceived to have the highest level of skepticism about COVID-19. This is because of a distrust of the current government. The recent separatist movement in the Southeast has put the zone in the federal government's crosshairs, creating a trust deficit and geopolitical tension that may now be spilling over into public health. National surveys have reported that the lowest rates of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine were among Southeast participants compared to those from other zones in the country [27, 28] . These low rates raise fundamental concerns that high COVID-19 skepticism may translate into vaccine hesitancy among Southeasterners who have historically had one of the highest rates of childhood vaccine uptake, who also show strong faith in routine childhood vaccines in our study. Nevertheless, we posit that as more cases and deaths become evident, the claim of COVID-19 as a hoax may have less salience to those who need the evidence to convince them. However, programs must also brace for those with lingering doubts, who will continue to perceive that the pandemic is exaggerated because SARS-CoV-2 has affected Africa much less than the United States, Europe, or India.",

Conversely, exposure to digital media was associated with greater belief in conspiracy theories and misinformation [41, 44, 45] . A global survey reported that 88% of Nigerians cited social media as a source of their distrust. The survey also indicated that only 41% had seen fake news while using traditional media sources, and 47% sometimes believed the fake news they saw [46] . So, despite the allure and ease of using social media for information dissemination, traditional media such as radio and television must continue to play a central role in communicating credible information about COVID-19.",
