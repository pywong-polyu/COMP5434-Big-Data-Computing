A notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the dramatic heterogeneity in clinical phenotypes. While most infected individuals remain asymptomatic or develop a very mild disease, some develop severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These severe infections account for most of the public health and societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and disproportionately affect the elderly while mostly sparing children (1) (2) (3) . This is different from other common viral respiratory infections, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (IV), which tend to be most severe in young children and elderly adults. Of the approximately 225,000 deaths from COVID-19 reported in the first eight months of the pandemic in the United States, only 189 occurred in children less than 18 years of age (4) , despite at least 277,285 documented infections in children over the same period (5) .",

Multiple studies demonstrated that ACE2 expression in the airways increases with age (11, 12), leading to lower infectivity and lower viral load in children. However, subsequent studies have demonstrated that viral load and not the severity of illness. Our findings suggest that the local interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract does not differ between children and adults, arguing that factors other than the local antiviral response drive differences in the clinical phenotypes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The time from onset of symptoms to the nasal mucosa samples' collection did not differ between epithelial and immune dominant subsets ( Figure 3C ). In children and adults infected with SARS-CoV-2, viral reads levels were increased in immune-enriched samples compared to epithelial-enriched samples, suggesting increased viral load is associated with immune cell recruitment to the nasal mucosa ( Figure 3D ). To confirm that differences in cell-type composition were not obscuring differences in ACE2 expression in children and adults, we analyzed ACE2 expression in samples from the epithelial cell clusters and the immune cell clusters separately. There remained no difference in ACE2 expression between children and adults ( Figure 3E ). Interestingly, deconvolution analysis of the two samples that were excluded from the healthy children group because of the incidental detection of enterovirus and parainfluenza virus found that these samples had an increased percentage of neutrophils, thus supporting transcriptomic profiling of nasal mucosa as a sensitive tool for assessment of viral .

The mechanisms underlying this relative protection from a severe infection in children compared to adults are unclear. Differences in expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors or response to the virus at the primary site of infection between children and adults have been proposed as potential mechanisms (47, 48); however, these hypotheses have not been directly tested to date. Here we present the first study that directly compares host response to SARS-CoV-2 at the primary site of the infection between children and adults. In our cohort of children infected with SARS-CoV-2, the local response in the nasal mucosa was largely the same as nonhospitalized adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 and children with severe RSV and IV infections. This similarity in response to the virus, particularly the interferon response, suggests that age-related differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes are independent of the primary response to the virus in the nasal mucosa.",

In our cohort, we did not observe a difference in the expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 between children and adults. While some reports suggested that ACE2 expression may increase in response to interferon stimulation (7, 36), we saw no increase in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression during active SARS-CoV-2 or other viral infections, supporting previous reports that interferon signaling does not lead to increased ACE2 expression (37-39).",

Such cross-reactive memory T cells have been reported for SARS-CoV (51) and recently for SARS-CoV-2 (52-56). This observation initially led to speculation that these cross-reactive antibodies and T cells could play a protective role in children and young adults and that vanishing adaptive immunity would make elderly individuals more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. However, in another study, a larger number of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive memory T cells was observed independently in the elderly and patients with severe compared with mild COVID-19 (56) . Importantly, these crossreactive T cells exhibited lower avidity and reduced antiviral responses when stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptides compared with T cells from patients who recovered from COVID-19. Thus, instead of being protective, these cross-reactive low avidity T cells, which are less efficient at virus elimination, could contribute to prolonged production of inflammatory signaling. This hypothesis is attractive as it explains the differences in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, which disproportionately affects elderly individuals.",

To characterize our participant sample data and confirm clinical diagnoses, we queried bulk RNA-seq data obtained from curettage of nasal mucosa for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, or IV reads. Viral reads for SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 28 of 36 samples collected from children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR performed in the hospital diagnostic laboratory (Figure 2A). Of the 24 children diagnosed with RSV, all had detectable RSV reads in RNA-seq data. Six out of 9 children with IV had detectable Influenza A viral reads in their nasal mucosa. Of the 29 adults accompanying children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 14 had detectable SARS-CoV-2 reads, and 2 young adults admitted to the pediatric hospital with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test did not have detectable viral reads. Nine samples were obtained from healthy children. RNA-seq did not detect any SARS-CoV-2, RSV, or IV reads in these samples; however, a more indepth analysis of these samples using the TWIST viral panel as implemented in the OneCodex platform demonstrated the presence of enterovirus and parainfluenza virus in two of the samples.

Interestingly, although we detected an interferon response signature in the majority of virus-infected participants, we did not detect the expression of secreted type I, type II, or type III interferons at the transcriptional level in a majority of patients with RSV or SARS-CoV-2 infection(Figure 5E). Secreted interferons were primarily detected in participants with IV infection, consistent with this cohort having the highest average expression of interferon response genes overall(Figure 5B, E).

Second, while our study includes children infected with other respiratory viruses -RSV and IV, which serve as proper controls to SARS-CoV-2-infected children, it primarily includes hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2, representing a minority of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, 14% of our pediatric cohort were asymptomatic with incidental SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses. The local host response in these asymptomatic children's nasal mucosa could not be distinguished from more severely affected pediatric participants. Similarly, our study only included two hospitalized young adults with moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection and did not include any severely ill hospitalized adults requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Therefore, hospitalized adults with severe SARS-CoV-2 may have a different local response at the primary site of infection. However, the high degree of similarity in the local response between different respiratory viruses in our cohort suggests that other factors, such as the systemic immune response, determine disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Supporting this interpretation, recent studies using single-cell RNA-seq profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated activation of an interferon-response signature in",

This comparison demonstrated that among subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 viral load, children exhibit increased activation of the innate immune system on a percell level. Ultimately, the use of techniques that enable analysis at the single-cell level, such as single-cell RNA-seq, will allow a more precise assessment of cell-type-specific changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 or other viral infections. Recently, single-cell RNAseq has been applied to understand virus-host interactions in children infected with IV(59), and similar efforts are underway in SARS-CoV-2 (60).In summary, we present evidence that the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection at the primary site of infection is similar between children and adults and comparable in its magnitude to other common respiratory viruses. Our findings suggest that factors outside of the primary infection site are likely drivers of the differences in severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection between children and adults.",

Providers received training just before sample collection by trained study personnel. Nasal epithelial cells were obtained by mucosal scrape biopsy of the inferior turbinate using a sterile plastic curette (Rhino-Pro curette, Arlington Scientific) as previously described(26)to obtain a predominantly epithelial cell population. A total of 3 single-pass scrapings per nares were performed per subject. The curette tips were cut and placed into RNase-free collection tubes containing 350 \u03bcL of RLT plus buffer (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, U.S.A.) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol, vortexed vigorously, and stored at -80\u00b0C. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy extraction kits (Qiagen). RNA sequencing and analysis RNA quality and quantity were assessed using TapeStation 4200 High Sensitivity RNA tapes (Agilent), and RNA-seq libraries were prepared from 1 ng of total RNA using SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-seq Kit v2 (Takara Bio). After QC using TapeStation 4200 High Sensitivity DNA tapes (Agilent), dual indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina), 75 cycles, single-end, to an average sequencing depth of 5.88M reads.FASTQ files were generated using bcl2fastq (Illumina). Viral RNA was detected using a custom hybrid genome prepared by joining FASTA, GFF, and GTF files for GRCh37.87, SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2), Influenza A/California/07/2009 (GCF_001343785.1), and is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review) RSV/S2 ts1C (GCF_000856445.1) genomes. An additional negative-strand transcript spanning the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was then added to the GTF and GFF files to enable detection of SARS-CoV-2 replication. To facilitate reproducible analysis, samples were processed using the publicly available nf-core/RNA-seq pipeline version 1.4.2 implemented in Nextflow 19.10.0 using Singularity 3.2.1-1 with the minimal command nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 1.4.2 -singleEnd -profile singularity -reverseStranded --three_prime_clip_r2 3 (27-29).

Briefly, we used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset from Ordovas-Montanes et al. (35), which contains nasal epithelial and immune cells, to train the AutoGeneS model. AutoGeneS selects cell type-specific genes by both minimizing the correlation between and maximizing the distance between the cell typespecific average gene expression profiles. The model was then applied to bulk RNA-seq data to estimate specific cell types' proportions using regression. Statistical Analysis Categorical data were summarized by percentages and compared using Fisher's exact test. Continuous, non-parametric data were summarized using medians with interquartile ranges and compared using Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis testing. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used for false discovery rate correction when performing multiple comparisons. Data were considered statistically significant at P-adjusted<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism version 9.0.0 and R version 4.0.3. Data were visualized using ggplot2 version 3.3.1 and Graphpad Prism.
