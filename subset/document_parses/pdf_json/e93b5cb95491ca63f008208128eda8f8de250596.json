Our retrospective cohort study assessed SARS-CoV-2 cases after vaccine rollout starting from mid-March 2021 at a tertiary hospital in Tokyo. Of 8,749 staff members, no fully vaccinated staff demonstrated confirmed infection, versus 19 cases in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated staff, by the end of June. Three breakthrough cases were identified in July, correlating with spread of delta variant in Tokyo. While our findings confirm the effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine in Asian populations, the presence of breakthrough cases despite strict infection control regulations suggest that ongoing public hygiene measures are required even after vaccination.",

Outside work hours, dining with more than three non-family members is actively discouraged per hospital policy. Temperature checks occur daily at the workplace, with symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 undergoing further examination. Close contacts of confirmed cases are PCR-tested and quarantined.",

Due to a shortage of BNT162b2 vaccines at the time of rollout, as well as according to the wishes of medical staff to receive vaccination, 2,809 frontline medical staff ultimately received vaccination. Administration of BNT126b2 vaccine doses 1 and 2 started on Mar 17, 2021 and April 12, 2021, respectively. Since the start of vaccination, a total of 19 cases were identified by the end of June, of which 16 occurred in unvaccinated medical staff, 3 in partially vaccinated staff, and 0 in fully vaccinated staff.
