The records of 2707 elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies were reviewed in a tertiary medical center of western China from January 2019 to October 2021. The number of operations was compared on a monthly basis in Fig. 1 . The impact of the COVID-19 resulted in a significant reduction of cases from February to April 2020. Particularly, it dropped to zero as a result of the completely lockdown in February 2020. In February to April 2020, the monthly average dropped to 35 cases, compared with a 53.1% decrease in the corresponding period in 2019 and a 59.2% decrease in 2021. In the following months, the number of cases showed a rapid and continuous growth to the normalization level. All patients were discharged within 24 h, and no in-hospital mortality or any life-threatening postoperative complications were observed. The conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy was absent in 2020 (compared with 3 patients in 2019, 2 patients in 2021).",

In contrast to Germany, the elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in our study center quickly resumed after a brief 2-month lockdown, and the total number of cholecystectomies per year in Day Surgery Center increased steadily. The average waiting period for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy before admission was shown within 2 weeks. Particularly, none of these patients were found to be positive for the COVID-19 test on the basis of the strict precautions.
