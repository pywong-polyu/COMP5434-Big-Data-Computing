To test the different isocenter-target distances, 2.5-and 5-cm configurations were prepared. Volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were created for different dose gradients from the target, in which the dose gradients were modified using the maximum dose inside the target. To simulate the rotational error, CT images and targets were rotated in two ways by 0.5\u00b0, 1\u00b0, and 2\u00b0, in which one rotation was in the axial plane and the other was in three dimensions. The initial optimized plan parameters were copied to the rotated CT sets, and the doses were recalculated. The coverage degradation after rotation was analyzed according to the target dislocation and 12-Gy volume.",

At the same time, the widely accepted necrosis indicator, the 12-Gy volume, increased from 1.2 to 3.5 cm 3 , which remained in the tolerable range.

The prescription was 18 Gy to 97% of the target volume, and the dose calculation grid was 1 mm. With the aim of varying the degree of dose gradient around the target, the dose maximum inside the target was allowed during optimization to be approximately 110%, 130%, and 150% of the prescription dose (19.8, 23.4 , and 27 Gy, respectively). Appropriate dose control around the target was also applied with respect to gradient variation.

The optimized plan parameters for each gradient were copied to every rotated image, and doses were recalculated. Therefore, including the original six unrotated plans, study plans were prepared for each combination of two rotation methods (axial and 3D), three different values of gradient steepness, three different rotation degrees, and two inter-target distances, resulting in a total of 42 plans.

However, for the case of r2.5D110 shown in Fig. 2 , the 9-Gy volumes were not separated for each target because of the low dose bridges between targets. Therefore, a volume of 11-Gy was used in this case, resulting in lower GI values than expected. Gradient control is prominent in small targets. The brain tissue volume irradiated with 12 Gy after subtracting the target (V12) was considered the normal brain necrosis indicator. For smaller GI values, V12 was smaller, and the reduction was larger for larger targets, as shown in Fig. 3 , in which a linear relationship can be observed.

The coverage was normalized to that of the unrotated case to show the variation by rotation only. The coverage varies in a complex manner with iso-radius, target size, dose gradients, and rotation method (axial or 3D). The variations in the iso-radius and rotation methods arise from the different displacements of the target from the original position. In the case of axial rotation, the displacement is uniform because all targets are located equidistantly from the rotation center (also beam isocenter) for each iso-radius of 2.5 and 5 cm. However, in the case of 3D rotation, the distance from the rotation axis, x, y, and z, differ for each target and cause different dislocations, even for the same 3D rotation. For example, under the same 3D rotation of 2\u00b0 with iso-radius of 5 cm (r5rot2), the dislocations were 2.2 mm, 2.0 mm, and 1.5 mm for T1cm, T1.5 cm, and T2cm, respectively.

Target coverage was normalized to those of rotation-free cases. a 1-cm targets for different values of gradient steepness and iso-radius, b 1.5-cm targets, and c 2-cm targets. Smaller targets receive less coverage following rotation. Numbers next to data points are displacement values in mm a normal brain volume of 12 Gy (V12) corresponding to gradient steepness. The coverage clearly decreased more for larger displacement errors, and similar displacement resulted in similar coverage outcomes. A larger volume of 12 Gy is caused by a shallower gradient which was controlled by a lower maximum dose inside the target. For all three targets, a linear relationship can be observed between coverage and V12. For T1cm with a dislocation of 0.9 mm and 1.0 mm, the mean coverage increases from 93.1 to 95.1% with an increase of V12 from 1.2 cm 3 (D150, GI of 5.0) to 3.5 cm 3 (D110, GI of 7.9). Larger shifts with coverage of less than 90% did not guarantee a similar increase with an increase of V12. In the case of T1.5 cm, the increase in coverage was similar that an increase of approximately 2% can be seen for a change in V12 of 2.9 cm 3 . In the same way, the mean coverage of T2cm under dislocations of 1.5 mm and 1.6 mm changed from 91.8 to 92.7% for a V12 from 4.5 to 7.3 cm 3 . Figure 6 shows an example of differential and cumulative dose volume histograms (dDVH and cDVH, respectively) for a T1cm with an iso-radius of 2.5 cm undergoing a 3D rotation of 2\u00b0 (3Dr2.5rot2). The cDVH shows longer tails and a higher maximum dose for the target under a steeper gradient. In addition, even with similar target coverage of the prescription dose, the dosevolume patterns below the prescription dose (18 Gy) are different from each other, which can be clearly identified using dDVH. For dDVH, only the volume of the target receiving less than 18 Gy was normalized using a bin width of 20 cGy. In the case of D110, 56.7% of the dose-deficient volume received 17. 8 below the prescribed dose such that shallower dose steepness guarantees less deviation of the target volume from the prescription dose.",

A rotational error greater than 2\u00b0 was also detected in 2.7% [14] . According to Gevaert et al., when using the BrainLAB mask (BrainLAB AG, Feldkirchen, Germany), the mean intrafractional shift was 0.58 mm (SD, 0.42 mm) and the rotational error was less than 0.03\u00b0 (SD, 0.33\u00b0) for each direction.

In a simulation of rotational error that rotated the reference dose distribution around each of the three axes, Prentou et al. showed that the lesion size and distance from the target to the isocenter were important; the target coverage of 2.5 cm 3 dropped to 84% for 1\u00b0 error, and 62% for 2\u00b0 error [12] .

For targets of 1, 1.5, and 2 cm in size, a dislocation of 0.8 mm had little effect on coverage, maintaining more than 95% of the original plan for all dose gradients studied. From the analysis of the cases with > 0.9 mm dislocation, coverage increased by 2% by changing the gradient via the maximum dose from D150 to D110 for T1cm and T1.5 cm.

The change in coverage could be partly affected by the calculation uncertainty of the target volume after rotation, especially for small targets such as T1cm. However, because the volume change of the copied target was less than 3%, the large variation in coverage from rotation (i.e., dislocation) is reliable. In addition, this change is not related to the coverage variation for dose steepness because when we compared the coverage for dose steepness at fixed rotation, the same copied target was used with varying dose gradients. In addition, the rotation of the CT image could alter the pixel entity inside the dose grid. However, we adopted a 1-mm resolution for the dose grid, which was the smallest in Monaco. Moreover, brain tissue could be regarded as homogeneous. Therefore, we conclude that the simulation uncertainty is acceptable.",

In a rotational error simulation, Peng et al. advised a 3-mm CTV-to-PTV margin to cover the no less than 95% of the CTV for most target cases with \u2264 3\u00b0 rotational error [9] . Usually, a 1-2-mm margin to the CTV was suggested for frameless SRS and FSRT [5] [6] [7] [8] 19] . Recently, a method to create an optimal margin robust to positional errors has also been reported [20] . However, a higher margin indicates more normal brain tissue irradiation. For a 1-cm target, the addition of 1-mm margin increases the target volume of 0.52 to 0.90 cm 3 . In the case of a 1.5-cm target, the volume changes from 1.77 to 2.57 cm 3 . Most studies on target motion have assumed that the movement occurred around the beam isocenter which was exactly aligned during the patient setup. However, it is not possible to guarantee that the motion occurs just around the isocenter. In addition, contrary to the frame-based, frameless setup has an increased possibility of involuntary movement. The PTV margin cannot ensure sufficient coverage for all possible movements.",

However, at the same time, a shallower dose gradient increases the net volume of tissue exposed to 12-Gy irradiation, which is recommended to be < 10 cm 3 or < 7.9 cm 3 to limit probable normal tissue necrosis [21, 22] . In Fig. 5 , 1-and 1.5-cm targets with any gradient and 2-cm targets with a GI < 3.2 (D130) satisfied the volume criteria. Of course, the increase in 12-Gy volume should be assessed with caution for the number of targets and prescription dose. Lowering the gradient by allowing the maximum dose to be 130% rather than 150% [5] is a good balance for small targets \u2264 1 cm in size to protect against probable dislocation error.
