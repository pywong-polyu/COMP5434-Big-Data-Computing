To address this challenge, over a hundred fact-checking initiatives worldwide have been monitoring the information space in their countries and publishing regular debunks of viral false COVID-19 narratives. This study examines the database of the CoronaVirusFacts Alliance, which contains 10,381 debunks related to COVID-19 published in multiple languages by different fact-checking organisations. Our spatiotemporal analysis reveals that similar or nearly duplicate false COVID-19 narratives have been spreading in multiple modalities and on various social media platforms in different countries, sometimes as much as several months after the first debunk of that narrative has been published by an IFCN fact-checker. We also find that misinformation involving general medical advice has spread across multiple countries and hence has the highest proportion of false COVID-19 narratives that keep being debunked. Furthermore, as manual fact-checking is an onerous task in itself, therefore the need to repeatedly debunk the same narrative in different countries is leading, over time, to a significant waste of fact-checker resources. To this end, we propose the idea of including a multilingual debunk search tool in the fact-checking pipeline, in addition to recommending strongly that social media platforms need to adopt the same technology at scale, so as to make the best use of scarce fact-checker resources.",

In 2020, almost everyone witnessed or was exposed to various kinds of false claims related to coronavirus origin, transmission, medical treatments and many others 1 . Moreover, myriad studies (Limaye et al., 2020; Tasnim et al., 2020) have shown that most of these claims originate on various social media platforms which makes them questionable to their authenticity as there is no method in place to quickly check the credibility of the content as well as the source. The unverified claims often fall into the category of misinformation in which the person spreading the claim is unaware of its falsity. Furthermore, it also involves disinformation where false information is spread intentionally to deceive . Either of them has the potential to instigate the general public into unethical actions and cause considerable harm. An article by BBC 2 states that around 800 people lost their lives because of misinformation related to coronavirus in just the first three months of 2020. In India, an exodus of a large number of migrants 3 due to fake news caused a national disturbance during the lockdown period.",

            "text": "The research (Vosoughi et al., 2018) has shown that news containing false information disseminates nearly 10 times faster than that of legitimate news. In this case, misleading narratives, for instance once concerning public health are not only detrimental but can also have serious consequences 4 . While the numbers of fact-checking initiatives have grown substantially over the years, still due to limited resources, these are unable to mitigate the impact of dis/mis-information in its inceptive hours (Nakov, 2020) . This line of reasoning is also consistent with research (McGlynn et al., 2020) demonstrating the delay between misinformation and debunking tweets paved the way for misinformation to spread on social media platforms. Efficiently alleviating COVID-19 mis/disinformation begins with being aware of previously fact-checked claims (Shaar et al., 2020) . A report by FullFact 5 shows that there have been cases where similar claims disseminated in different countries at different times and have been debunked by multiple fact-checking organisations, given the debunk for that claim already existed before. While some may argue that these duplicate debunks were generally published on days that lie in proximity of the publication date of the first debunk, our analysis finds that such duplicates differ by weeks and perhaps even by months from its first appearance. These duplicate debunks usually arise when the same claims are shared recurrently on various social media platforms in different countries at different times. Although, the reason behind why people keep on repeating debunked claims is still an open question and not very much explored but few instances show that well-known people such as politicians 6 are known to aggravate this problem by repeating false statements again and again. Another possible reason, which we also extensively explore in this paper is that the debunk made in one language might not be available in another language which could prevent the spreader from being aware about the existence of its debunk.",

These are referred to as duplicate claims which propagate either from the original factually inaccurate information, or in the form of new content containing much of the original claim. Besides this, duplicate claims also give rise to duplicate debunks from multiple fact-checking organisations in different languages. We find all such duplicate debunks in the IFCN database and our approach did not require human labeling (Ref. Methods). We further investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the fact-checked articles of the same false narratives.

The analysis presented below also demonstrates various common themes in COVID-19 misinformation that have emerged across many countries. For this, we classify the claims into various COVID-19 misinformation categories (Song et al., 2020) to see what type of misinformation spreads the most and has been debunked multiple times. General medical advice is perhaps the most consistent topic related to COVID-19. We will examine some of the common themes in this category at greater length later.",

In order to diminish the spread of dis/mis-information, the first corrective strategy should be to look for fact-checked articles that have already debunked similar narratives in the past. Previous study (Reis et al., 2020) on the WhatsApp public groups in India and Brazil found a significant portion of misinformation in the form of images shared on the groups even after it gets fact-checked. Another study (Barr\u00f3n-Cedeno et al., 2020; Shaar et al., 2020) where researchers have worked on detecting previously fact checked claims. However, they only worked on English debunks but in this paper, we shed light on fact-checking articles written in multiple languages debunking the same narratives and thereby demonstrating the need for multilingual debunk search in the fact-checking pipeline. The main implication of this work is to draw attention towards the presence of duplicate fact-checking articles debunking alike claims in multiple languages. Despite the importance of the task of searching previously debunked claims in a multilingual setting, it has largely been ignored by the research community. Also, from the fact checkers perspective, before spending hours doing the research and debunking the claim, it's worth 6 https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/2/trump-releases-video-repeating-debunked-election-fraud-claims 5 https://www.societyofeditors.org/soe_news/full-fact-report-tracks-fake-covid-19-news-across-five-countries/ checking if it has already been debunked before to prevent waste of resources, during which other burgeoning numbers of unsubstantiated claims can be fact-checked.",

The graph shows that India and the United States had the largest number of recurring false narratives and these got debunked multiple times which led to waste in fact-checkers efforts. It depicts that these countries, particularly India with a total proportion of 19% are most vulnerable to even the misinformation which has already been debunked in the past, which also suggests a lack of awareness among the people about the prior fact-checked information. The difference in days between the publication date of query claim debunks and the duplicate claim debunks is illustrated in Figure 2 . The histogram plot shows the weekly count with the value of bin set at an interval of 7 days. For example, the first bar shows that there are 884 cases where the difference between the debunk date of query claim and debunk date of duplicate claim is one week or less. Similarly, the second bar shows that there are nearly 300 cases where there is a fortnight difference and so on and so forth. This is worrisome and the subsequent findings help us answer the reason for the existence of such duplicate claim debunks. In other words, it gives insights into the movement of duplicate claims from one website to another. The graph suggests that for similar claims, the spread between Facebook itself is the highest with around 800 cases, followed by WhatsApp to Facebook which has little more than 200 occurrences. This is particularly concerning as Facebook, which is increasingly being used as a primary source of news (Bridgman et al., 2020) , allows the wild spread of content whose falsity has already been fact-checked before. Although, these social media platforms have made efforts 7 to mitigate the spread of false narratives but it's still prevalent as shown in this study and which also corroborates previous research (Burel et al., 2020) . Furthermore, people use different modalities of content such as text, image, video etc. to spread factually inaccurate claims. Figure 4 b) shows the modality of content used by query claim and the duplicate claim. It seems the modality for text, video and image remains consistent but there are also considerable cases where there is transition between the modalities of content which claim same things.",

For monolingual pairs, it's strange to see so many duplicate claim debunks for which debunks already exist in the same language.

Figure 6 a) depicts the pie plot of the categories of claims for which multiple debunks exists. Misleading medical advice (GenMedAdv) is perhaps the most consistent topic of misinformation with the highest proportion of 33%, followed by the conspiracy (Consp), public authority action (PubAuthAction) and community spread (CommSpread) based false claims at 13% each of all of the cases. Figure 6 b) is a scatter plot demonstrating the difference in days between query claim and duplicate claim debunk for different categories of claims. We observe that claims on general medical advice are most densely spread, which means that there exist a lot of cases where the date of publication of duplicate claim debunks differs by many days. Followed by this, claims about vaccine and conspiracy theories are also densely spread as compared to others which are denser on the lower end depicting that the difference in days between the publication date of query claim and duplicate claim debunk is not much. We further inspect claims that are most widely spread and whose debunks are published at different times of the year. Figure 7 shows a sample of 10 such false narratives about fallacious medical advice which include cures, remedies and prevention methods specific to COVID-19. We find that the debunks are spread across the complete year and these are published in different languages. Subsequently, Figure 8 illustrates the timeline of the appearance of debunks for claims about the consumption of an alkaline-rich diet to eliminate the coronavirus. From our dataset, it appears that the claim was first debunked in Spain in March 2020 and after a month a similar claim was debunked in Indonesia and the United States but it was still here to stay. It is surprising and yet worrisome that the same claim was again debunked in Turkey and Brazil in September and December respectively. One thing that might have led to this unknowing spread of previously debunked claims is the language of the fact-checked article as they all differ as shown in Figure 8 (ISO-39 language code enclosed in brackets after the name of fact-check organisation). We then investigated the language and modality of the claims and find that the claims written in one language are intentionally transformed to other languages and varied modalities (eg. text to image) before it gets propagated to other countries. The social media platforms used to spread the claim in different countries also change over time. Figure 8 shows that the same claim got shared on Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter. Figure 9 demonstrates the conspiracy theories which were debunked many times. The belief that Covid-19 is linked to 5G technology was common across many countries despite having already been debunked before. Besides this, there were also many falsely attributed claims and conspiracies involving Bill Gates.",

            "text": "Before we actually indulge in checking the factuality of the claim, it's really important to look if that claim or its substitute has already been debunked by some fact-checking organisation in their regional language. There has been some previous work (Shaar et al., 2020) , where researchers have proposed the addition of a verified claim retrieval step in the automated fact-checking pipeline. Our analysis shows that this needs to be a multilingual retrieval step where we should consider a complete pool of debunked claims from all over the world irrespective of the language used in the fact-checked article. As manual fact-checking is time-consuming, it's paramount to avoid this double effort on debunking narratives that have already been fact-checked. Therefore, the ability to search previously debunked claims in multiple languages is beneficial to fact-checkers. On the other hand, it is indeed impossible to fact-check every claim but at least the social media platforms can take an initiative to warn users (Kaiser et al., 2020) before they share content that contains previously debunked claims. Over the years, several fact-checking organisations have emerged which have accumulated a large corpus of fact-checked articles (Augenstein et al., 2019; Shahi & Nandini, 2020) debunking various claims in different languages. This data can effectively be utilised to quickly debunk the repeated false narratives that keep on appearing on various social media platforms and thereby limiting its spread and potential harm that it may cause.",

The CoronaVirusFacts Alliance led by International Fact-checking Network (IFCN) consists of more than 100 fact-checking organisations based in 70 countries and covering around 40 languages. All IFCN signatories follow certain principles about good practices while debunking. We use their IFCN Poynter website 8 to collect all claims that have been fact-checked in 2020 (Song et al., 2020) . We crawl a total of 10,381 claims related to COVID-19 with their associated debunks. For the purpose of this study, following fields were extracted from the html tags of each debunked claim on their website. Except for the fields provided by Poynter website 9 , we also add some additional fields as stated below, \"Claim\": Original debunked claim statement from the IFCN Poynter website. \"Country\": List of countries where the claim has spread. \"Factcheck Organisation\": Name of the fact-checking organisation that has debunked the claim. \"Debunk Link\": Link to the fact-checked article debunking the claim (may or may not be in English) \"Debunk Language\": Language used in the fact-checked article using langdetect 10 \"Debunk Date\": Date of publication of the fact-checked article using htmldate 11 \"Social media website\" : List of the websites where claims appeared. \"Modality of content\" : Modality of claim using JAPE rule (Cunningham et al., 1999) 11 https://pypi.org/project/htmldate/ 10 https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/ 9 https://www.poynter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CORONAVIRUS-FACTS-RFP- Data-Description.pdf In order to find all the duplicate claim debunks, we used the claim field of the debunks collected above to find all the semantically similar claims that were debunked by multiple fact-checkers. We formulate this as a retrieval problem where for each claim we did semantic search on all other debunked claims present in the dataset. We refer to them as query claim debunks and all the retrieved duplicate counterparts as duplicate claim debunks. For retrieval, we first replace all the words by which the COVID-19 is referred to in the claims (eg. sars-cov2, covid19, 2019-ncov, covid, covid-19) with a single representation i.e. \"coronavirus\". After this, we use a multistage approach where initial lexical retrieval is done using BM25 Okapi algorithm followed by neural retrieval stage using state-of-the-art text similarity model (Liu et al., 2019; Nogueira & Cho, 2019) to find all the semantically similar claims with their associated debunk article. We set a strict threshold of 0.8 on the relevance score so that we get strong reliable data for the purpose of this study. In addition to this, there were two retrieval constraints: 1) The fact checking organisation of the query claim debunk is different from the fact checking organisation of the retrieved duplicate claim debunk.",
