Design: This observational study was carried out with Brazilian adults through an online questionnaire 5 months after the social distance measures implementation. The McNemar, McNemar-Bowker and Wilcoxon tests were used to investigate differences before and during the COVID pandemic period, adopting the statistical significance of P < 0\u00b705. Setting: Brazil. Participants: Totally, 1368 volunteers aged 18\u00fe years. Results: The volunteers reported a lower frequency of breakfast, morning and lunch snacks (P < 0\u00b705) and a higher frequency of evening snacks and other meal categories during the pandemic period (P < 0\u00b705). The results showed an increase in the consumption of bakery products, instant meals and fast food, while the consumption of vegetables and fruits decreased (P < 0\u00b7005). There was a significant increase in the frequency of consumption of alcoholic beverages (P < 0\u00b7001), but a reduction in the dose (P < 0\u00b7001), increased frequency of smoking (P = 0\u00b7007), an increase in sleep and screen time in hours and decrease in physical activity (P < 0\u00b7001). Conclusions: It was possible to observe an increase in screen time, hours of sleep, smoking and drinking frequency. On the other hand, there was a reduction in the dose of alcoholic beverages but also in the practice of physical activity. Eating habits also changed, reducing the performance of daytime meals and increasing the performance of nighttime meals. The frequency of consumption of instant meals and fast food has increased, while consumption of fruits and vegetables has decreased.",

Smoking habits were analysed among those that did not smoke and the ones that did. Based on this categorization, univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were obtained by the enter method. All the covariates with P < 0\u00b720 on univariable analysis (see online supplemental data) were entered in the initial model. The fit of the models was tested by the Hosmer and Lemeshow test (P > 0\u00b705). The statistical significance was determined as P < 0\u00b705.",

            "text": "The frequency of alcoholic beverage intake has increased significantly during the pandemic in our sample. The increase in drinking frequency can be associated with an attempt to combat stress, boredom and possible negative emotions resulting from physical and social isolation (19) . Despite the increased frequency of alcoholic beverages, the dose of consumption has significantly decreased. The decrease in the alcohol consumption/occasion differs from that of most studies that assess lifestyle and COVID-19 have consistently demonstrated (5, 20, 21) . Along with the ban on the operation of bars and the holding of parties in Brazil, one of the possible explanations for the occurrence of these divergences is the fact that our sample is composed mainly of women. Although alcohol consumption has been growing significantly among women in the last decade, men still have a higher prevalence of excessive alcohol consumption (22) . The consumption of 2\u00b75 doses or more of alcoholic beverages per occasion was also associated with the male gender in the present study (OR = 1\u00b7392). Also, the motivations for drinking alcohol may differ according to gender: men are more likely to drink when exposed to stress, while women prefer to drink in relaxation and entertainment situations (22) . In addition to our sample being composed mainly of women, more than a quarter of the interviewees reported living at home with children. Recent research has shown that women avoid consuming excessive doses of alcoholic beverages in this family composition, while men do not change this specific habit (23) . Interestingly, our data showed that living with children was a predictive factor for the consumption of alcoholic beverages once a week or more in our sample (OR = 1\u00b7521). However, living with parents was inversely associated with consuming, per occasion, 2\u00b75 doses of alcohol or more (OR = 0\u00b7765). Although the number of nonsmokers in our sample exceeds 90 %, our results showed that during the pandemic, the number of nonsmokers decreased. While the number of cigarettes/d increased in the categories of eleven units or more, despite the recommendations of the health authorities, who issued a warning that smoking is associated with an increase in the severity of the disease and death in hospitalised COVID-19 patients and advised that all support should be given to encourage the *The frequency and dose of alcoholic beverages are highly correlated habits in the evaluated population (r = 0.806; P < 0.001), and, therefore, they were causing multicollinearity and interfering in the adjustments of their respective models. Therefore, the dose of alcoholic beverages was not included as a predictor of frequency of alcoholic beverage and vice versa. interruption of this habit (24) . Researchers have already shown that one of the reported reasons for smoking in unpleasant situations is that cigarettes seem to cause a momentary feeling of relief (25, 26) . Other studies also observed an increase in the number of cigarettes during the pandemic period (27, 28) . However, an Italian survey observed a decrease in smoking habits (8) . We hypothesised that due to the atypical content of the present moment, individuals who may have previously dropped the addiction may have faced the need to resume the use of cigarettes during the lockdown, and this habit was associated with the consumption of 2\u00b75 doses or more of alcoholic beverages per occasion (OR = 1\u00b7328) and inversely associated having intermediate meals like morning snack (OR = 0\u00b7256) and afternoon snack (0\u00b7520), in addition to consuming fresh fruits more often (OR = 0\u00b7933) and sweetened drinks less often (OR = 1\u00b7112). Previous data reported that people who quit addictions are more prone to relapses and fluctuations in atypical and high-pressure periods (29, 30) . Another change observed was the increase in screen time, including television, computers, tablets and cell phones. More than half of our respondents reported an increase in working time during the pandemicincluding housework. Most of the studied population reported being working/studying remotely full or part-time, and this reflects directly on screen time since people were led to adapt to a way of working called 'intelligent', in which the obligations are fulfilled remotely and, for the most part, online (29) . Besides working or study remotely (OR = 1\u00b7953), other factors were inversely associated with 10\u00b75 h or more of screen time during the pandemic, like being older (OR = 0\u00b7965), working or studying without changes (OR = 0\u00b7553), increased time spent on work (including household chores) (OR = 0\u00b7552) and practicing physical exercise (OR = 0\u00b7998).",

Although there is no evidence regarding the adequate number of meals, there is a discussion that the distribution of energy and nutrients between 4 and 5 meals can have a positive effect on health, since the fractionation of meals brings relief from digestive and metabolic overload caused by higher energy density meals, in addition to contributing to the fulfillment of the recommendations of the food and nutrient groups (45) .

The main limitation of this study is the use of a selfreported online questionnaire, which can lead to incorrect data filling and allow the participation of only people with internet access. Also, people were asked about a time before the pandemic, and very specific life/dietary issues, and some of them could not remember, or their answers may only reflect their impressions and notions on how the pandemic is affecting them. A strength of our study is the application of the questionnaire 5 months after the start of the pandemic, period of high adhesion of restrictive measures of social isolation in Brazil, being possible to notice the changes that occurred during this period.",

On the other hand, there was a reduction in the dose of alcoholic beverages but also in the practice of physical activity. Eating habits also changed, reducing the performance of daytime meals and increasing the performance of nighttime meals. The frequency of consumption of instant meals and fast food has increased, while consumption of fruits and vegetables has decreased. Studying the repercussions of the pandemic on all these aspects is extremely important. Future studies should deepen this theme to support creating and implementing appropriate health promotion strategies in the current public health emergency.
