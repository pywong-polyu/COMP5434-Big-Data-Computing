            "text": "Iridoviruses are large icosahedral cytoplasmic DNA viruses with circularly permuted, terminally redundant, double-stranded DNA genomes (Qin et al., 2003) . The family Iridoviridae includes six genera: Ranavirus, Iridovirus, Chloriridovirus, Lymphocystivirus, Megalocytivirus, and Decapodiridovirus (Chinchar and Duffus, 2019) . Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) was first isolated from the grouper Epinephelus tauvina. It belongs to the genus Ranavirus and currently causes high economic losses in the mariculture industry (Qin et al., 2003; Xiao et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020) . Understanding the pathogenesis of SGIV is necessary to develop effective therapies against it (Yu et al., 2019a) . Viral infection begins with its attachment to the host cell membrane, and it then enters the cell via specific endocytosis. In the host cell, the SGIV is transported to the replication site, where the viral genes are expressed (Seisenberger et al., 2001) . Many SGIV structural genes and non-structural genes have already been studied and are related to viral replication, pathogenesis, and host cell immunity (Chinchar et al., 2009; Chinchar and Duffus, 2019) . During infection, modifications appear in the host cell membranes (Verdaguer et al., 2014; Ab\u00f3s et al., 2015; Seeger and Mason, 2015; Yu et al., 2019a) , which can potentially be used as important biomarkers of infection. Such biomarkers can be used to develop diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches to virus infection (Yildirim et al., 2007; Ashcroft, 2019) . Membrane proteins account for about 30% of the total cellular proteins and have important roles in various physiological functions (Shangguan et al., 2008) . Knowledge of these biomarkers will extend our understanding of viral pathogenesis. However, little is yet known about the mechanisms underlying the entry of these biomarkers into host cells. To address this limitation, we used aptamers to investigate the crucial events of biomarker endocytosis into SGIV-infected host cells during viral infection.",

            "text": "Aptamers are selected by the systematic evolution of ligands with the exponential enrichment technology (SELEX) (Ellington and Szostak, 1990) . Aptamers selected against different targets are synthetic oligonucleotides with different sequences and fold into distinct three-dimensional structures, binding their targets with high specificity and affinity (Yu et al., 2019b) . Although they resemble antibodies in this regard, aptamers have properties that make them more useful than antibodies, such as their ease in synthesis and modification, high reproducibility, and stability. Based on these excellent qualities, aptamers are excellent molecular probes for pathogen diagnostics and therapeutics (Li et al., 2014 Wolter and Mayer, 2017; Kaur et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2020) . For example, aptamer A10 was selected against the coat protein of red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) and was successfully used to develop an aptamer-based enzyme-linked apta-sorbent assay (ELASA) for the rapid and sensitive detection of RGNNV infection (Zhou et al., , 2017 . Aptamers are also used as highly specific molecular probes in pathogen pathogenesis studies (Jin et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2019a) . They have been widely used to identify membrane protein biomarkers, such as alkaline phosphatase placental-like 2 (Dua et al., 2013) , stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 ( Van et al., 2014) , and protein tyrosine kinase 7 (Shangguan et al., 2008) . According to several reports, after specifically binding to biomarkers in the cell membrane, some aptamers are actively internalized into the target cell. Consequently, they can be used as delivery vehicles for the targeted delivery of drugs (Sun and Zu, 2015) . For example, McNamara et al. (2006) reported the cell-type-specific delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNA)-aptamer chimeras, which significantly increased the therapeutic efficacy of the siRNA against cancer cells. Because aptamers are easy to synthesize, they have great potential utility in targeted therapies. However, little is yet known about the mechanisms of entry of these cell biomarkers into host cells.",

            "text": "In a previous study, the aptamer Q5, which targets whole grouper-iridovirus-infected cells, was successfully generated with Cell-SELEX (Li et al., 2015) . Aptamer Q5 has high binding affinity (24.35 nM) and recognizes SGIV-infected cells with high specificity. The target protein of aptamer Q5 on the membrane of SGIV-infected host cells was identified as the major capsid protein (MCP) of the virus (Yu et al., 2019a) . MCP is the predominant structural protein of iridovirus particles and comprises about 40%-45% of the iridovirus particle polypeptides. It is used as a marker to identify and classify iridoviruses (Lin et al., 2014) . MCP plays an important role in iridovirus pathogenesis, including in the formation of the iridovirus particle, the induction of the immune responses, virus-host cell interactions, antigen recognition, and the transcription of viral genes (Fu et al., 2012) . After specifically binding to MCP in the cell membrane, aptamer Q5 is actively internalized into the target cells, indicating that MCP is transported by the vesicular transport system in the host cell during viral infection. Therefore, aptamer Q5 can be used as a specific probe with which to investigate the trafficking mechanism and endocytotic pathway of MCP in host cells during SGIV infection (Wickner and Schekman, 2005; Yu et al., 2019a) . Briefly, aptamer Q5 first binds to the target protein (MCP) on the cell surface, and the Q5-MCP interaction activates the cellular signaling pathways, which internalize Q5-MCP through one of several endocytotic mechanisms. These include clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and non-clathrin-caveolae/raftdependent endocytosis (Wang et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2017) . In this study, an aptamer (Q5)-based specific probe was used to investigate the trafficking mechanism and endocytotic pathway of MCP in host cells during SGIV infection.",

Efficiency of MCP endocytosis was significantly reduced in the presence of CQ (to 65.4% with 15 \u00b5M CQ, to 60.3% with 20 \u00b5M CQ) (B) or NH 4 Cl (to 30.8% with 200 mM NH 4 Cl, to 23.5% with 400 mM NH 4 Cl) (C) (**p < 0.01).",

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the classical endocytotic mechanism and also the bestcharacterized pathway. Some viruses are reported to invade their host cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, such as Betanodavirus (Huang et al., 2017) , SGIV (Wang et al., 2014) , and African swine fever virus (Hernaez and Alonso, 2010) . During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, clathrin is assembled on the plasma membrane to form clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which invaginate to form clathrin-coated vesicles containing the internalized material. CPZ is a cationic amphiphilic agent that causes the misassembly of CCPs, so it was used to determine the role of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway in the entry of the Q5-MCP complex into SGIV-infected cells. In this study, the entry efficiency of the Q5-MCP complex decreased significantly and dose-dependently after CPZ treatment. Therefore, we conclude that MCP endocytosis during SGIV infection is dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",

Some viruses, such as the tiger frog virus (Guo et al., 2011) , infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) (Guo et al., 2012) , and coronaviruses (Nomura et al., 2004) , invade cells via caveola-dependent endocytosis but not clathrin-mediated endocytosis. As reported previously, cholesterol plays a critical role in caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis (Huang et al., 2017) . In this study, M\u03b2CD was used to deplete cholesterol from the plasma membrane of the host cell. As expected, M\u03b2CD significantly reduced the cholesterol during the entry of the Q5-MCP complex into SGIV-infected cells. However, the effect was insufficient to conclude that the internalization of the Q5-MCP complex is dependent upon caveolae-mediated endocytosis. According to the latest reports, cholesterol is also an essential factor in clathrin-mediated endocytosis because it regulates the fluidity of the plasma membrane, which may affect the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (Huang et al., 2017) . Some viruses, including rhesus rhadinovirus (Zhang et al., 2010) , Betanodavirus (Huang et al., 2017) , Japanese encephalitis virus (Das et al., 2010) , and Chikungunya virus (Hoornweg et al., 2016) , are reported to invade their host cells through cholesterol-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, whether the entry of SGIV MCP into its host cells involves caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis warranted clarification.",

Therefore, we used genistein to determine whether the entry of SGIV MCP into its host cells is dependent on caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis. As shown in Figure 7 , genistein treatment, even at a high concentration (100 \u00b5M), did not block the entry of the Q5-MCP complex into SGIV-infected cells.

It plays a critical role in the cellular uptake of agents Guggenheim et al., 2020) , the exchange of extracellular vesicles (such as exosomes and microvesicles) between cells (Costa-Verdera et al., 2017), cellular immune defenses (Hohn et al., 2009) , and viral entry (Huang et al., 2017) . Both Na + /H + exchanger activity and the functional actomyosin network are important in macropinocytosis, and many studies have reported that macropinocytosis requires signaling events and activated protein kinases such as PAK1, PKC, and GTPase Rac1. For example, the entry of SGIV into GS cells (Wang et al., 2014) and of Echovirus 1 into polarized Caco-2 cells (Krieger et al., 2013) depends on PAK1 and PKC and is associated with macropinocytosis. Therefore, several inhibitors were used to analyze the role of macropinocytosis in MCP endocytosis during SGIV infection in this study. ML-7 was used to antagonize the phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase, to regulate myosin II activity, which blocks the functional actomyosin network involved in macropinocytosis. NSC23766 was used to inhibit Rac1 activity, rottlerin to inhibit PKC activity, and IPA-3 to inhibit PAK1 activity in the host cells (Huang et al., 2017) . However, even at high concentrations, these macropinocytosis inhibitors caused no statistically significant changes in the entry efficiency of MCP. These results suggest that macropinocytosis is not involved in MCP endocytosis.",
