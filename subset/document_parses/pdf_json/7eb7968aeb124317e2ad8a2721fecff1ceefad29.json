            "text": "Analysts of social media differ in their emphasis on the effects of message content versus social network structure. The balance of these factors may change substantially across time. When a major event occurs, initial independent reactions may give way to more social diffusion of interpretations of the event among different communities, including those committed to disinformation. Here, we explore these dynamics through a case study analysis of the Russian-language Twitter content emerging from Belarus before and after its presidential election of August 9, 2020. From these Russian-language tweets, we extracted a set of topics that characterize the social media data and construct networks to represent the sharing of these topics before and after the election. The case study in Belarus reveals how misinformation can be re-invigorated in discourse through the novelty of a major event. More generally, it suggests how audience networks can shift from influentials dispensing information before an event to a de-centralized sharing of information after it.",

These approaches differ in how much they emphasize the content of messages versus their social networks or media (Acerbi 2020; Bentley et al. 2014; Bond et al. 2012; Carrignon et al. 2019; Lazer et al. 2014 ). Among those approaches that emphasize social influence, there are contrasting views over the importance of individual, exceptional agents. In one view, influence is heterogeneous and diffuse (Watts and Dodds 2007) , such that ideas can emerge from virtually anyone in a network and be shared widely. In this view, there is little value in trying to identify key individuals who lead public information formation.",

Influence, freely-conferred by followers, reflects the influencer's own characteristics, such as prestige or status as highly informed, respected, or well-connected (Henrich and Broesch 2011; Watts and Dodds 2007) . Since these qualities are judged by the followers, influencers rely on other agents. Represented as a 'hub-and-spoke' network structure, the influentials view has been presented, for example, for online terrorist networks, in which influential social media agents have a large number of followers who need not be well-connected to each other (Agarwal et al. 2017; Johnson et al. 2016; Weimann 2015) .",

First, the lead-up to an event and the immediate response to it, and second, the social-sharing and discussion of the event in terms of long-running themes Bentley and O'Brien 2017) . Before an event, agents may be focused mainly on centralized information sources. Consequently, the pre-event attention network likely has a \"hub-and-spoke\" structure ( Fig. 1, top left) . Immediately after a consequential event is reported by such centralized sources, individuals respond independently to the news. Subsequently, as agents discuss the facts of the 36 36 Page 4 of 20 event with their peers, the network becomes more clustered and diffuse ( Fig. 1 , top right). Simultaneously, different clusters of correlated keywords/phrases/hashtags may emerge that contrast with the more centralized \"broadcast\" network of how the news itself was first disseminated. Besides the diffusion of network interactions, Fig. 1 shows other patterns in the social media data we might expect to change after a significant event. Before the event, one null expectation is that if we rank words by their frequencies from most common to least common, then those frequencies will decline in a regular relationship known as \"Zipf's Law\" (Fig. 1, middle left) . After the event, we expect certain words (related to the event) to be emphasized beyond what is expected under Zipf's Law, so we predict that the top few word frequencies will be unusually high, and then moving down the ranks will fall off abruptly (Fig. 1, middle right) . This reflects increased copying of certain words and phrases across the diffused network, so we expect a decrease in a measure of information content known as Shannon entropy (Shannon 1949) .",

Fake social media accounts, coordinated through common algorithms, often form star-like networks where certain accounts are linked by large numbers of follower accounts who are otherwise disconnected from each other (Johnson et al. 2016; Ruck e al. 2019 ).

Moreover, since each dimension is quickly and inexpensively quantifiable, we thought these measures may contribute to a toolkit for detecting when social networks are vulnerable to disinformation campaigns. To be robust, a predictive toolkit will require multiple dimensions with strong signals.

We focus on the Belarusian presidential election of August 9, 2020, by monitoring Russian-language Twitter activity before and after this date. The team benefits from members who are native speakers of Russian, whose knowledge was crucial to the qualitative analysis-not just the literal meaning of Russian words in Twitter posts, but perspective in connection to a wider project at University of Tennessee on monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of Russian disinformation in Former Soviet Republics. The ability of the team to consider the results in terms of both content and pattern should reduce researcher bias in the analysis. We provide brief context to the 2020 Belarusian presidential election (timeline in Supplementary Table S1). As president of independent Belarus, a former Soviet republic, since 1994, Alexander Lukashenko had solidified control over the government and public life, with restrictions on free speech and the press (IREX 2019). Although Belarusian elections between 1996 and 2020 have not been internationally recognized as legitimate (Freedom House 2020), over half of surveyed Belarusians have typically accepted and supported their president (Manaev 2016) . In the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, Belarusian authorities arrested and jailed two challenger candidates, popular blogger Sergei Tikhanovsky and banker Victor Babariko, while a third candidate, Valery Tsepkalo, fled the country. Subsequently, Tikhanovsky's wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, ran for president in his stead, gaining popularity with support from the campaigns of Babaroko and Tsepkalo. On July 30, over sixty thousand pro-Tikhanovskaya supporters gathered in a Minsk park. On August 9, Lukashenko was officially reelected with 80.1% of the votes, over 10.1% for Tikhanovskaya. Amid reports of electoral violations (OSCE 2020; Nechepurenko and Higgins 2020), Tikhanovskaya refused to accept the results, fled the country on August 11 and hundreds of thousands of Belarusians protested. Violent clashes with riot police-\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d in Russian-led to at least one protester being killed and hundreds forcibly detained (Chadwick 2020) .",

Table 1 shows the keywords used in identifying Russian-language Twitter accounts (see also supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Despite not explicitly stated as part of our model, we also examined the conveyed sentiment of the Twitter data as a component of content by using vector lists of emotion words, or \"word bags,\" to determine normalized word frequencies, weighted inversely to document frequency. We computed the broad sentiment-positive, neutral, and negative-in Russian by using a neutral network classifier trained on a humanlabeled dataset of 18,000 Russian-language news articles and a validation set of 6000 articles (Sakenovich and Zharmagambetov 2016) . Next, we applied unsupervised topic analysis using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model (Blei et al. 2003; Gr\u00fcn and Hornik 2018) . The LDA topics are based on the co-occurrence of diagnostic two-word phrases across all tweets. Each tweet is considered a mixture of the topics based on frequency (or presence/absence) of the different word pairs. The number of topics is an adjustable parameter of LDA implemented in a Bayesian framework (Cao et al. 2009; Griffiths and Steyvers 2004; Murzintcev 2016) . The ideal number of topics, k, is that which provides the model with the best topic prediction probability on a held-out sample of words. We ran topic models on all of our data combined, as well as the data collected using the keywords, for Tweets before versus after the August election. We used pyLDAvis (github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis) to qualitatively explore the identified topics in each data split.",

First, we built a Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) matrix for each 5-day window in the dataset (Horne et al. 2019 ). Next, we visualized a network, where nodes represent tweets from different accounts and edges connect the tweets whose vector cosine similarity is greater than 0.85 (i.e., nearly the exact same text). The n tweets generate n completely connected networks of accounts retweeting each message. For each edge in each component, we ordered them by the timestamp by matching each copying tweet to an older tweet with highest cosine similarity. By creating directed edges from the original tweet to the copied tweet, this \"pruning\" process generated n trees (from what had been networks), one for each original source tweet. These trees were then aggregated into a network again, such that the nodes represent Twitter accounts and weighted, directed edges represent the normalized number of tweets copied from one account to another.",

            "text": "We examined the observed Twitter patterns while considering the idealized patterns illustrated in Fig. 1 . Figure 2 shows the results of the LDA topic analysis for election-related tweets July-August 2020, with each topic characterized by 30 word frequencies. A principal component analysis of these topics represents, in the first two PCs, how related they are to each other. The change in topics is complex, as each topic represents a unique list of the top 30 most salient words characterizing that topic. Nevertheless, a few broad changes are consistent with the predictions in Fig. 1 . First, the majority of topics noticeably cluster together after the election (Fig. 2, right) , illustrating the topics across Tweets are less distinctive and less diverse. While we used the same number of topics (parameter k) in both topic models for comparison, this heavy clustering post-election suggests fewer topics were discussed after the election than before it (a smaller k would provide a better model post-election). One of the words prominent in the tight cluster of topics after the election is \"\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\" (riot police) which was among the top three words of several topics with the post-election cluster (Fig. 2 , right). In contrast, the topics before the election tended to be centered on different candidates, particularly \"\u043b\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\" (Lukashenko), who is the top word in topics 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 2, left) . Overall, again the most notable change after the election is the clustering of topics around the left end of PC 2 (Fig. 2) . Figure 3 shows the top 20 words in the Tweets before versus after the election. We observe the expected increase in the frequency of the number one and two words after the election (Fig. 1) , as well as change in the words occupying these top spots. Before the election, the most common word was the candidate, \"\u0431\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\" (Babariko), whereas after the election it was \"\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\" (riot police) and other words, including \"\u0436\u044b\u0432\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c\" (Belarus Live) and \"\u043d\u0430\u0445\u0443\u0439\" (f-word), which spiked on 11 August, just after the election. Notably, on several dates in summer 2020 (July 16, July 29 and August 11), the frequency of \"\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\" (\"riot police\") spiked and then declined exponentially-as indicative of a response to a relevant event (Fig. 1) .",

When we look at proportional mentions of the three candidates relative to one another (Fig. 4, right) , we clearly see the effect of Lukashenko's election victory. Before the election, mentions of Lukashenko decrease compared to his main opponent, Tikhanovskaya. After winning the election, Lukashenko predominates in terms of proportion of candidate mentions (Fig. 4 right) , even as all mentions decline exponentially in raw counts (Fig. 4 left) .

Our prediction (Fig. 1) is more copying after the event. As Fig. 5 shows, the correlations between each candidate and top words are much stronger after the election, consistent with our prediction. This likely reflects the effect of copying in the discussion of each candidate after the election, with a \"signature\" of distinct words associated with the candidate, in contrast to before the election when there was more reporting of news associated with each candidate. Notably, there is little overlap of word top lists between candidates either before or after the election (Fig. 5) . Similar to the pattern in candidate mentions (Fig. 4, left) , we see a spike of candidate-related tweets after the election, followed by the expected exponential decline. Figure 6 shows the most productive Twitter accounts, in terms of number of tweets. As anticipated, the most productive accounts before the election were news sites, led by Tut.by, which is among Belarus's five most popular Russian-language websites, with an estimated 3.5M users in 2020 including over 50% of Internet users in Belarus (IREX 2019). After the election, the most productive accounts included what appear to be bots (Pavelts, Artur Protska, and Patikoshka), given their high tweet rate and relatively few followers, pushing Tut.by down to rank number 10 during the post-election period (Fig. 6 right) .",

Finally, there was little change in average sentiment among the tweets, which averaged neutral in sentiment before and after the election (Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5) . This may reflect limitations in our sentiment analysis. First, we may be losing signal by averaging across such a large number of tweets, ultimately compressing any extremely negative or positive sentiment in the data. Second, automatic sentiment detection in the Russian language is understudied. In this work, we used a Russian sentiment classifier that was trained on language from news articles. While this classifier may work on many tweets in our dataset, other tweets may contain language that is much more informal than the language used in news articles. Hence, we may also be misclassifying some extremely positive or negative tweets that use informal or slang language. Further investigation into these limitations is left to future work.",

The sentiment analysis showed negligible change after the election, which may reflect averaging a large sample. Twitter bot activity appears to have increased after the election. As a general explanation for these changes, we propose that a major event, such as the election, catalyzes a shift from a more \"broadcast\" pattern, where attention is focused on major news providers, to a more de-centralized process of discussing the news with peers. The initial pattern we have identified is in line with the findings from a study by Lin et al. (2014) that during major planned events capturing shared media and public attention Twitter activity tends to concentrate on elite users such as news providers with large numbers of followers.

This strategy can be effective whichever way the event (e.g., an election, a protest) turns out. For example, English-language twitter bots released before the U.S. 2016 presidential election by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), infamous for its bots and disinformation campaigns worldwide (Connell and Vogler 2017; Chivvis 2017) , spiked in response to divisive events exacerbating racial and/or political tensions (Ruck e al. 2019) .

The outcome of the August 9th presidential election in Belarus was never in doubt, as national surveys show president Lukashenko's previous elections since 1994 were all largely accepted by the Belarusian public (Manaev 2016) . Given this expectation, state authorities benefit by deploying social media bots to nudge post-discourse toward vilifying and marginalizing opposing voices, including political rivals (in this case Tikhanovsky, Babariko, and Tsepkalo). This \"nudge\" strategy leverages existing social media users and does not require overt \"control of the information environment,\" (cf. Reuter and Szakonyi 2015; Tucker et al. 2017) . The state can hold more drastic measures in reserve when needed, such as blocking or shutting down independent online news organizations, social media platforms, and search engines for Belarus-based internet users (Stratcom 202) .",

This may underlie a strategy, observed previously, of Russian bots exploiting politically or socially divisive events (Ruck e al. 2019) . Often large in number, bots might be designed as widespread, low-profile catalysts of social sharing. Although the Russian government had taken a cautious public stand on the Belarusian election, it may have directed bots to confuse the message of mass protests against Lukashenko. The Kremlin's Internet Research Agency (IRA), for example, has programmed social media bots for targeted disinformation campaigns abroad (Chivvis 2017; Connell and Vogler 2017; Ruck e al. 2019) . SN Soc Sci (2022) While our theoretical framework (Fig. 1 ) invoked a single, planned event, such as an election, it could apply to micro-events within a broader change, such as social movement that advances in punctuated bursts (Horne et al. 2016) . These granular events themselves may become incorporated into a larger disinformation campaign . For this reason, there is need for more fine-grained observation. As we observed negligible sentiment change, future studies should explore sentiments at closer scale. A genuine lack of sentiment change would be notable, as anger and fear are commonly known levers of propaganda (Berger and Milkman 2012; Wollebaek et al. 2019 ). It may not be easy to change baseline sentiment in a long-term campaign. Another need for granularity involves the constantly evolving use of social media platforms. While this study monitored Twitter as readily available data, future studies will need to monitor multiple social media, as most users have multiple platforms. Twitter represents a small fraction of followers and users of TUT.BY, which has (as of early 2021) over a million users or followers on YouTube, and hundreds of thousands more on Instagram, Telegram, Vkontakte, Facebook, and Odnoklassniki (IREX 2019; Stratcom 202).",

Social media disinformation in post-communist countries involves producers, facilitators, and counter-acting online communities (Koinova 2009; Lyons 2006) . The case study in Belarus indicates how the effects of influential opinion leaders, versus peer-topeer sharing, are in dynamic balance in spreading disinformation. The novelty of a major event can lead audience networks to shift from influentials dispensing information before an event to a de-centralized sharing of information after it. By considering the network dynamics of how information spreads (Badawy et al. 2018; Freelon et al. 2020; Vosoughi et al. 2018; Watts and Dodds 2007) , we can expand upon current studies of the effects of disinformation campaigns, which tend to focus the content of propagandist messages, narratives, and themes (Paul and Matthews 2016; Lucas and Pomeranzev 2016) . Overall, this case study contributes to our knowledge of the value of using null models for judging the magnitude effects for events. During prolonged events that may be ongoing, comparative models can be captured throughout the event to find moments of clear transition in dynamics, much like a phase transition in classic network traffic models (Ohira and Sawatari 1998).",

We envisage a toolbox that allows social media activity to be used as an \"Early Warning System\" to help reveal what is not easily seen. This could furthermore be the start of a toolkit for assessing the reaction to an event as being artificial or human, and ultimately how we might use this to uncover invisible events by seeing the \"vapor trail\" they leave behind.",
