Epidemic modelling is useful in displaying scenarios under alternative and combined interventions. A recent model suggested that lockdowns may be necessary in the UK to prevent the health care system from breaking down. 1 However, better empirical evidence is needed to corroborate predictions. Adherence to interventions is a central parameter in the models. Using responses from participants in two large, ongoing cohorts, our aim was to estimate the adherence to two governmental recommendations given to Norwegian citizens from August onwards: to test for SARS-CoV-2 when having respiratory symptoms, and to go into quarantine when a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 was made. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

The proportions increased slightly (2 to 5%) if we only included subjects with at least one of the following symptoms: cough, dyspnoea, sore throat, or loss of sense of taste or smell ( Figure 1 ). We found no statistically significant differences in the proportions tested among men who fell ill when comparing age groups or educational levels. However, the odds ratio of being tested decreased in round 12 compared to round 11 and varied slightly by place of living in unadjusted and adjusted regression models (Supplementary Table 1 ). Among women, the odds ratios for being tested decreased in the later rounds, was higher for women aged 40-44 years compared to 45-49 years, and was lower among those with the highest educational level and varied by county of residence in both unadjusted and adjusted regression models (Supplementary Table 1 ). Inclusion of participants who had been ill with symptoms from the airways during the previous round lowered the proportion being tested (results not shown), suggesting that people are likely to get tested soon after the onset of symptoms.",

Also, immigrants to Norway are under-represented in the cohorts, and results from the current study cannot be generalized to this population. The relative proportion of COVID-19 in Norwegian residents with country background other than Norway has been higher than in residents with Norway as country of birth. 16 As lifting of non-pharmacological interventions, such as banning of public events, have been associated with increased transmission rates, 17 it seems vital that the public continues to follow the remaining recommendations from governments to be able to keep restrictions at a minimum. Self-isolation of symptomatic individuals has been stipulated to reduce transmission rates by 20-30%. 1 Testing strategies and self-isolation or quarantine are recommendations that affect the public to a lesser degree than banning of public events, school closures, general requirements to stay at home or curfew. The implications on transmission rates of reduced public adherence to existing governmental recommendations need to be elucidated further both in other countries, and in settings with varying infection pressure. In this study, performed in a country with high trust in government, and a relatively low infection pressure during the study period, public adherence to governmental recommendations on regarding testing and quarantine were lower than expected. Accordingly, there is considerable room for improvement in adherence, possibly reducing the need for more restrictive interventions. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",
