The model identified a small cluster of four key mutations of SARS CoV-2 that promotes much stronger viral attachment and viral spreading.

The existence of such universal amino acid-water interaction parameters is by itself convincing evidence for the thermodynamic phase transition model 7, 9 . The average accuracy of each of the 20 exponents is better than 1% 2,12 . In the absence of a phase transition critical point, the likelihood that 20 such accurate power-law exponents would coexist independently is astronomically small (less than 10 -40 ).

The smaller the magnitude of the exponent, the more hydrophilic the amino acid will be on average. This differs from the many attempts to assign hydropathy based on chemical properties of an amino acid in isolation 12 . The more hydrophilic a residue the more likely it will reside near the outside of the protein and vice versa for the more hydrophobic. However, given that the residues are situated sequentially on a chain, the effect of neighboring residues must be taken into account. This requires deducing an effective domain size that dominates the protein's conformation, whose details at the molecular level are unknown.",

In this case, there could be one dominant domain length and this conjecture has been applied successfully to many proteins 10,14 . The model also posits a mechanism for the increase in infectiousness of CoV-2 based on synchronized attachment 2 . Of the over 300 mutations between CoV-1 and CoV-2, the model predicts that only four key mutations affected its infectiousness. The new B.1.1.7 variant, which contains only 9 amino acid mutations (3 deletions and 6 substitutions) 3 , seems to be transmitting at a higher rate than CoV-2 15 .

In particular, the conclusion reached before 2 that the spike attachment dynamics are synchronized by hydrophilic extrema is preserved. 16 . Although these edges do not necessarily require to be associated with any observable structural features, they seem to be located in salient regions for dynamics. Edges 1, 2, 4, and 6 are the most hydrophilic. They have similar magnitudes and are much more similar than the corresponding edges of CoV-1 (see Table 1 ). This symmetry is a signature of a critical point and lends the hydrophilic domains more conformational mobility, particularly for acting in synchrony. The symmetry is also fragile and can be easily broken by mutations as confirmed by mutation simulations (data not shown). The differences between \u03a8(R,35) for CoV-2 and B.1.1.7 are small, but close inspection of the hydrophilic edges shows that edges 1, 2, 4 and 6, which were nearly equal already in CoV-2, have become even more equal in B.1.17 (see Table 1 ).

This increased hydrophobicity could stabilize the virus in aerosols 20 . The near leveling of the hydrophobic peak near 227 with the receptor binding peak near 380 suggests that the two peaks could bind together to aerosol surfaces. Overall, there seems to be a qualitative difference in the mechanisms used by the B.1.17 and B.1.351 to supplant CoV-2.

This has low probability as it would require coordinated hydrophilic mutations within the narrow range of 35 residues surrounding an edge. Additionally, the great success of vaccines based on S was predicted because even a small disturbance in S will tend to drive it away from the critical point 2 . For the virus to attach to a cell, S must act in a coordinated fashion and this is impaired away from the critical point. Thus, the S-based vaccines that are already available are expected to be equally successful not only for B.1.1.7, but for any future mutation as well that increases transmissibility by moving the virus still closer to its critical point.

Where the spheres overlap, they are cutoff by planes equidistant from their chain contacts (dotted lines). The surface area of the central amino acid that is accessible to water molecules is then calculated. These surface areas are then plotted for each amino acid as functions of chain length M. Increasing M decreases surface areas as the chains fold back upon themselves.

Taking the four most hydrophilic edges (1,2,4,6), the coefficient of variation for the hydropathy scores are 0.04, 0.01, 0.007, and 0.01 for CoV-1, CoV-2, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351, respectively. There was a large decrease between CoV-1 and CoV-2 and a smaller one between CoV-2 and B.1.17, indicating a progression towards a symmetric critical point.
