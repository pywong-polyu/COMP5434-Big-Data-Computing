This paper proposes a model to detect cough events from cough audio signals. The models are trained by the dataset combined ESC-50 dataset with self-recorded cough recordings. The test dataset contains inpatient cough recordings collected from inpatients of the respiratory disease department in Ruijin Hospital. We totally build 15 cough detection models based on different feature numbers selected by Random Frog, Uninformative Variable Elimination (UVE), and Variable influence on projection (VIP) algorithms respectively. The optimal model is based on 20 features selected from Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features by UVE algorithm and classified with Support Vector Machine (SVM) linear two-class classifier. The best cough detection model realizes the accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score with 94.9%, 97.1%, 93.1% and 0.95 respectively. Its excellent performance with fewer dimensionality of the feature vector shows the potential of being applied to mobile devices, such as smartphones, thus making cough detection remote and non-contact.",

For example, by July 30 2021, COVID-19, a global pandemic, has confirmed 196,553,009 cases and caused 4,200,412 deaths, according to World Health Organization (WHO) [7] . Due to the spread of the mutant COVID-19 coronavirus and the unbalanced vaccine supply, the global COVID-19 pandemic is facing a severe situation again. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary symptom of a patient with COVID-19 coronavirus may be cough [8] . Therefore, largescale and contactless cough detecting applications are of great importance. The occurrence of cough events is usually accompanied by the production of some specific sounds. Therefore, many scholars used audio signals to build models, so as to achieve remote detection of cough events. Alsabek reported the importance of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) extraction of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 samples in cough signal process [9] . Monge-\u00c1lvarez reported that using local Hu moments as a robust feature for cough detection with audio signals [10] . Al-Khassaweneh used Wigner distribution and wavelet transform to analyze cough signals for detecting asthma [11] . Pramono developed an algorithm based on features of the audio signals with a logistic regression model to identify cough events [12] . Laguarta developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) speech processing architecture based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to screening the coughing symptom of COVID-19 [13] . Imran proposed a COVID-19 diagnosis system using the combination of machine learning and deep learning from cough samples via an App [14] .",

Meanwhile, it may increase the risk of overfitting. Cough detection, a relatively simple problem, does not require complicated technical solutions to solve. What's more, most studies do not include cough samples recorded in scenarios where cough detection is required such as the ward in their dataset. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a cough detection model using small number of features and machine learning algorithm such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) while achieving optimal performance with inpatient cough samples. SVM, a well-known classifier, is widely used in various detection and identification techniques. Kumar presented a person authentication framework using SVM classifier to implement person identification and verification [15] . Song proposed a sound-of-tapping technology based on SVM, including 7 tapping position classification and 6 medium identification [16] . Many studies used SVM as a classifier to implement cough detection. Bhateja reported a method for features extraction and classification of cough sound in noisy environment using SVM [17] . Vhaduri developed a cough and snore detection framework based on several machine learning classifiers including SVM, which can be implemented on a smartphone [18] .",

UVE algorithm's main principle is to add artificial random variables to the original variable matrix, calculate a selection criterion for original and random variables, and keep original variables whose selection criterion result is larger than that of random variables. The selection criterion calculation is the ratio of regression coefficient b j and its standard deviation s (b j ), measuring the reliability of the PLS regression coefficient c j [22] .",

SVM constructs a hyperplane in a high dimensional space which can be used for classification, and training data samples are referred as points in the high dimensional space.
