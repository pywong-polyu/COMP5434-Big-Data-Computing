We report a rapid, low-cost (~ 2 USD), simple-to-use nucleic acid test kit for self-administered at-home testing without lab instrumentation. The entire sample-to-answer workflow takes < 60 min, including noninvasive sample collection, one-step RNA preparation, reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) in a thermos, and direct visual inspection of a colorimetric test result. To facilitate long-term storage without cold-chain, a fast one-pot lyophilization protocol was developed to preserve all required biochemical reagents of the colorimetric RT-LAMP test in a single microtube. Notably, the lyophilized RT-LAMP assay demonstrated reduced false positives as well as enhanced tolerance to a wider range of incubation temperatures compared to solution-based RT-LAMP reactions. We validated our RT-LAMP assay using simulated infected samples, and detected a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants with successful detection of all variants that were available to us at the time. With a simple change of the primer set, our lyophilized RT-LAMP home test can be easily adapted as a low-cost surveillance platform for other pathogens and infectious diseases of global public health importance.",

Whilst vaccination rollouts and improved access to testing have helped to control the pandemic 1 , transmissions and infections (including post-vaccine breakthrough cases) due to the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 2,3 continue to pose a burden on global public health and economics. Effective SARS-CoV-2 surveillance requires frequent testing with rapid results to quickly identify infected individuals to break transmission chains 4 . However, centralized testing models such as drive-through tests may increase the risk of exposure to health care workers and also rely on costly facilities, trained personnel, and sophisticated lab equipment (typically RT-qPCR) that in many cases still fail to deliver a timely test result. These delays can be detrimental to effective surveillance and disease control efforts due to the risk of presymptomatic/asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 5 . While testing labs are widely available in many high-income countries, most low-and middle-income countries lack sufficient facilities and trained personnel for wide-spread application of sophisticated SARS-CoV-2 detection technologies. Rapid antigen tests are easy to use and less expensive, however, while they are effective at screening symptomatic patients with high viral loads 6 , the overall higher rates of false positives and false negatives (compared to nucleic acid tests) make rapid antigen tests less suitable as a front-line diagnostic 7,8 .

Among several candidate nucleic acids amplification protocols 10 , RT-LAMP is a simple method that achieves rapid exponential amplification of RNA using a set of six primers to recognize eight distinct regions on the target RNA sequence, enabling highly specific and sensitive detection of target RNA without stringent requirement on sample purity 11 . This eliminates the need for the sophisticated RNA isolation and purification processes that have been a major bottleneck of current SARS-CoV-2 testing workflows. Further, the compatibility with simple pH-based colorimetric readout 12 allows easy interpretation of the test result by visual inspection, making RT-LAMP suitable for inexpensive point-of-care applications. To date, many RT-LAMP assays have been proposed for SARS-CoV-2 detection [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] including several that have obtained FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) [23] [24] [25] .

Conventional molecular assays do not support convenient use at home by untrained individuals because of the complexity of the testing workflow, dependence on specialized instrumentation, stringent requirement of cold storage for reagents, and the high cost of the test platform manufacturing and distribution. To enable truly inexpensive, rapid, reliable at-home testing of COVID-19, we developed a simple all-in-one molecular home test kit based on lyophilized colorimetric RT-LAMP, requiring only a regular thermos and a thermometer to conduct the self-administered test. A rapid, one-pot lyophilization protocol was developed to quickly preserve all reagents needed for the colorimetric RT-LAMP test in a single microtube, facilitating longterm stability, inexpensive distribution, and convenient use of the home test kit. Notably, the lyophilized RT-LAMP assay demonstrated reduced false positives and higher tolerance to a wider range of incubation temperatures compared to conventional solution-based RT-LAMP reactions. To enable detection of viruses from clinical sample matrices, we adapted a one-step RNA preparation protocol 19 based on low-cost shelf-stable reagents. The entire sample-to-answer workflow ( Fig. 1 ) takes < 60 min, including noninvasive sample collection (anterior nasal swab or alternatively gingival swab), quick extraction-free RNA preparation, optimized RT-LAMP reaction in a thermos, and finally a colorimetric interpretation of the test result.",

To preserve the RT-LAMP reagents for home test use, we employed lyophilization, also known as freeze-drying, to extend the shelf-life of the test kit and facilitate simple test kit distribution, handling, and storage under convenient temperatures (e.g., at typical homerefrigeration temperature or at room temperature). A lyophilized test kit also reduces the number of pipetting steps to improve usability and minimize contamination 26 . However, lyophilization is typically an expensive and time-consuming process involving three stages including freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying which can be difficult to design and optimize 27 . In this work, we developed a fast, one-pot lyophilization process that minimizes the drying time by completing both the primary and secondary drying under a single condition 28 . Unlike prior lyophilization protocols developed for molecular biology assays, our protocol eliminates the need to separately lyophilize the reaction buffer and the enzymes 17, 26, 29 . Instead, our simplified protocol enables one-pot lyophilization of all reagents needed for the colorimetric RT-LAMP in a single microtube (Table 1) , and the entire lyophilization process can be completed in under 2 h (see Methods).

In addition, guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) 35 was included in the optimized formulation to improve the reaction speed and the sensitivity of colorimetric RT-LAMP. We carefully screened multiple sets of recently published RT-LAMP primers 14, 15, [36] [37] [38] and optimized our RT-LAMP assay with a well-performing primer set 38 (Table 2) , which targets the ORF1a gene of the viral genome and is minimally impacted by the mutations from recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Compared to typical solution-based RT-LAMP reactions, we observed that the addition of trehalose at the optimized concentration significantly reduced the occurrence of RT-LAMP false positives. The slight decrease in reaction speed was mitigated by the addition of GuHCl. Notably, our lyophilized RT-LAMP reactions also enabled a wider compatible range of incubation temperatures compared to the solution-based RT-LAMP reactions, thus improving the assay's robustness to tolerate the use of regular thermoses for reaction incubation without precise temperature control. Specifically, as shown in Fig. S7 , our lyophilized assay (\"3 M trehalose + 1 M GuHCl) lyo\") performed robustly across the entire temperature gradient tested (60.7-70.0 \u00b0C) with clear readout of true positives as early as 20 min and no false positives by 50 min of incubation at most temperatures within the temperature gradient. In contrast, the solution-based RT-LAMP assay (\"Fresh sol\") based on the same primers and master mix formulation showed a narrower range of compatible temperatures, slower turnaround, and earlier occurrence of false positives. The beneficial effect of the one-pot lyophilization was also observed in Fig. S15 , where we conducted a similar temperature gradient experiment for the assay based on a different published RT-LAMP primer set 23 . We hypothesize that the enhanced performance of the one-pot lyophilized assay is partly due to the inclusion of trehalose in the RT-LAMP formulation. In addition to its role as a lyo-and thermal-protectant, trehalose was found to have a DNA duplex destabilizing effect in prior literature 39 . Such an effect helps to improve the specificity and yield of isothermal amplification reactions, which agrees with the observations from our experiments.",

Sensitivity for authentic SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 was significantly reduced in comparison to the sensitivity under laboratory conditions with commercially purified RNA, 15,514 viral copies per reaction, but at higher viral loads the assay demonstrated reliable sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 2b) .

Aliquots of simulated SARS-CoV-2 infected samples were also subjected to qRT-PCR in the OHSU clinical lab using the Fisher Multiplex TaqPath platform with 15,514 viral copies returning a calculated CT value of 26.4. We next examined the distribution of CT values for 5897 samples tested across symptomatic and asymptomatic patients tested in the OHSU clinical lab (data provided generously by Dr. Xuan Qin, OHSU Department of Pathology), finding that the RT-LAMP assay would be expected to have detected SARS-CoV-2 in approximately 4254 patients, the number of patients with a CT of < 26, yielding a real-world sensitivity of 72%.",

            "text": "In this work, we have demonstrated an inexpensive, one-pot lyophilized colorimetric RT-LAMP molecular test kit for self-administered COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition to its low cost and simplicity, the test kit features a user-friendly home testing workflow that can be easily completed in under 1 h with no specialized instrumentation or trained personnel (Table 3) . Specifically, we developed a simple one-pot protocol for lyophilizing colorimetric RT-LAMP. All reagents needed for the isothermal amplification reaction can be quickly preserved in a single microtube, facilitating long-term storage, inexpensive distribution, and simple testing workflow without multiple liquid transfers. Unlike prior work of lyophilized LAMP/RT-LAMP that requires sophisticated lab procedures to separately lyophilize the enzymes from the reaction buffers, the simplicity and robustness of our one-pot lyophilization protocol makes it easy to inexpensively manufacture the molecular test kits at scale. We tested our RT-LAMP assay in regular thermoses and verified its tolerance to temperature deviations in different thermoses (Fig. 5) . Notably, our test conveniently tolerates larger sample input volumes (i.e., as opposed to 1 \u03bcL to 5 \u03bcL sample volume commonly used in standard RT-LAMP assays, our test directly accepts 20 \u03bcL swab media sample to rehydrate the lyophilized reagents for a 20 \u03bcL RT-LAMP reaction). Furthermore, in contrast to conventional molecular diagnostics that usually involve multiple precise volume liquid transfers, our test requires only a single pipetting step (using a low-cost disposable transfer pipette) during the entire testing workflow. Nevertheless, the present work has several limitations. First, the RT-LAMP assay is qualitative and relies on visual interpretation of the colorimetric test result. Besides potential user errors, extended storage of the current test kit under elevated temperatures may reduce the color contrast between the positive and negative readouts, Second, while we have demonstrated excellent analytical performance of the underlying lyophilized RT-LAMP assay, further optimizations of the RNA isolation protocol are needed to achieve better sensitivity on clinical samples. However, for perspective, we compared the results of our dose-response evaluation of the RT-LAMP platform in its current configuration with the real-world CT values from the OHSU clinical diagnostic laboratory, we predict a real-world sensitivity of approximately 72% for all SARS-CoV-2 infections. While this value is below the performance of some other RT-LAMP platforms, it is well above the predicted sensitivity for symptomatic individuals of the widely used BinaxNOW for symptomatic individuals of 64.2% 40 . Third, the off-the-shelf RT-LAMP master mix used in the present assay contains glycerol, which may cause insufficient removal of water during lyophilization 41 . While our real-time stability experiments suggested that the simple one-pot lyophilization could readily preserve the colorimetric RT-LAMP reactivity for > 4 months (data not shown), the long-term stability of our assay could be substantially improved by using glycerol-free enzymes. Fourth, the present study evaluated an extraction-free RNA preparation protocol (i.e., heating for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C in 0.0025X TBE) but did not assess its efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. While recent studies 19, 42 have suggested the use of similar heating protocols for effective inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, thorough validations must be conducted before pursuing other applications beyond home testing. Compared to other COVID-19 testing platforms available at the time of this writing, our rapid molecular test kit shows good potential to enable affordable and frequent at-home testing. Due to its low cost and simplicity, our test can allow mass manufacturing in a short timeframe to potentially address the pressing need for global population-scale surveillance, especially in resource-limited regions where COVID-19 is still raging and vaccinations are lagging. For users who cannot conveniently perform the test at home, our test kits can also be readily used at point-of-care settings such as local pharmacies or mobile laboratories, where batch testing of samples can be easily conducted on site using a dedicated dry or water bath or a similar heat source. The patient would still self-collect a sample using the provided swab with the collection tube and then return the sample to the pharmacy. Due to the fast turnaround of our RT-LAMP assay, the test result can be returned to the patient in under one hour. Advantages of using our tests for point-of-care/near-patient testing include the further simplified testing workflow and the improved quality control of the tests. However, this alternative configuration would require a technician to handle the patient samples, thus enhanced precautions must be carefully followed (e.g., use of PPE, hand hygiene, frequent instrument decontamination) and assure that all samples are fully inactivated upon receipt. Ideally, the sample handling protocol would be automated at the pharmacy to reduce the risk and improve the testing throughput. Furthermore, it is important to note that our all-in-one lyophilized colorimetric RT-LAMP test kit can be quickly adapted to detect different RNA or DNA targets by simply changing the primer set. This remarkable flexibility coupled with the simplicity and reliability of our test kit and testing workflow hold great promise to enable a robust model platform for low-cost decentralized surveillance of other Heat-inactivated virus was diluted in nuclease-free water. Viral copy numbers were calculated following quantification of stocks. Methods otherwise as described previously. NTC: non-template control (nuclease-free water). ",

The primers were resuspended in nuclease-free water (Sigma-Aldrich) and mixed to form a 10X primer mix consisting of 2 \u00b5M F3 primer, 2 \u00b5M B3 primer, 16 \u00b5M FIP primer, 16 \u00b5M BIP primer, 4 \u00b5M LoopF primer, and 4 \u00b5M LoopB primer. RT-LAMP reactions were run at 20 \u00b5L total reaction volume. Specifically, the lyophilized RT-LAMP reagents were reconstituted with 5 \u00b5L sample + 15 \u00b5L nuclease-free water in all analytical experiments conducted with synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA control (Twist Bioscience, cat. 102024). Unless otherwise specified, 20 \u00b5L of sample (as opposed to 5 \u00b5L sample + 15 \u00b5L nuclease-free water) was directly added to the lyophilized RT-LAMP mix in validation experiments conducted with simulated SARS-CoV-2 infected samples. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Fast one-pot lyophilization of colorimetric RT-LAMP. The 3 M trehalose solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g D-(+)-trehalose dihydrate powder (Sigma-Aldrich, M.W. 378.33 g/mol) in 440.5 \u03bcL nucleasefree water, followed by vigorous vortexing and heating at 60 \u00b0C for 10 min to fully dissolve the trehalose to yield a supersaturated solution. This resulted in a solution with a total volume of approximately 760 \u03bcL, corresponding to an effective trehalose concentration of around 1.75 M. Because our assay prototyping needed only small amounts of the solutions, to keep the measuring simple and consistent, we refer to this resulting solution as the 3 M trehalose throughout the text unless otherwise specified. The trehalose solution was then sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 \u00b5m syringe filter (VWR), followed by brief vortex and centrifuge to remove air bubbles. For consistency, the 1 M GuHCl solution was prepared similarly by directly dissolving 0.1 g guanidine hydrochloride powder (VWR, M.W. 95.53 g/mol) in 1046.8 \u03bcL nuclease-free water without further adjustment of the final volume. The tube containing the GuHCl solution was covered with aluminum foil to protect it from light. Components of the colorimetric RT-LAMP lyophilization formulation were mixed at the specified ratio ( Simulated SARS-CoV-2 infected samples. Anterior nasal swab (and alternatively gingival swab) samples were collected as described below from 10 uninfected individuals, into sample collection media (TBE (1X: 90 mM Tris-borate-2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) at the specified concentration, in nuclease-free water) and pooled.",

Virus-spiked samples were heated at 95 \u00b0C for the specified duration and chilled on ice. Then, 20 \u00b5L of the resulting sample was added directly into the RT-LAMP microtube to reconstitute the lyophilized reagents. RT-LAMP microtubes were vortexed (spun down, if necessary) and briefly chilled on ice, before pre-incubation photos were taken. Finally, RT-LAMP microtubes were incubated for 60 min at 65 \u00b0C, with photos taken at 30-60 min to assess color change. The best detection sensitivity was achieved by RNA isolation with 0.01X TBE (based on 5 \u00b5L sample input into a 20 \u00b5L reaction) and heating for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C (Figs. S17-18).

The microtubes were recapped and flicked gently (being careful not to introduce bubbles) to resuspend the lyophilized RT-LAMP reagents and then chilled on ice before pre-incubation photos were taken. Meanwhile, a mug was filled with boiling water, and allowed to chill to ~ 70 \u00b0C before pouring into the thermos. The water was allowed to further chill to ~ 67 \u00b0C before samples were added. Next, the RT-LAMP microtubes were incubated in the thermos with the lid tightly closed for 60 min, with photos taken at 30-60 min.

Classification depends on the presence of substitutions that may confer increased transmissibility, disease severity, immune and therapeutic escape, and interference with diagnostic test targets. It is thus important to assess the accuracy of our assay in detecting newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants. After carefully screening multiple sets of recently published RT-LAMP primers 14,15,36-38 , we optimized our RT-LAMP test with a well-performing primer set (Table 2) 38 targeting the ORF1a gene of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, our test successfully detected multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and their isolates from different geographical locations, including WA1/2020 (USA), B.1.1.7 (\"Alpha\", UK), B.1.1.7 (\"Alpha\", US-CA), B.1.351 (\"Beta\", South Africa), P.2 (\"Zeta\", Brazil), B.1.2 (US-LA/NM), B.1.427 (\"Epsilon\", US-CA), B.1.429 (\"Epsilon\", US-CA), B.1.526 (\"Iota\", US-NY), B.1.617.1 (\"Kappa\", India), and B.1.617.2 (\"Delta\", India).
