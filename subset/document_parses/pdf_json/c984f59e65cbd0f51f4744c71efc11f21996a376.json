            "text": "The outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also known as in Wuhan has attracted worldwide attention. SARS-CoV-2 causes severe inf lammation, which can be fatal. Consequently, there has been a massive and rapid growth in research aimed at throwing light on the mechanisms of infection and the progression of the disease. With regard to this data science is playing a pivotal role in in silico analysis to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 and the outbreak of COVID-19 in order to forecast, diagnose and come up with a drug to tackle the virus. The availability of large multiomics, radiological, bio-molecular and medical datasets requires the development of novel exploratory and predictive models, or the customisation of existing ones in order to fit the current problem. The high number of approaches generates the need for surveys to guide data scientists and medical practitioners in selecting the right tools to manage their clinical data. Results: Focusing on data science methodologies, we conduct a detailed study on the state-of-the-art of works tackling the current pandemic scenario. We consider various current COVID-19 data analytic domains such as phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 genome identification, protein structure prediction, host-viral protein interactomics, clinical imaging, epidemiological research and drug discovery. We highlight data types and instances, their generation pipelines and the data science models currently in use. The current study should give a detailed sketch of the road map towards handling COVID-19 like situations by leveraging data science experts in choosing the right tools. We also summarise our review focusing on prime challenges and possible future research directions. Contact: hguzzi@unicz.it, sroy01@cus.ac.in",

Figure 2 also illustrates data analysis processes. Some processes return data and/or models that can be used as input (feedback) for the data analysis workflow. The integration and analysis step uses data science models to infer knowledge from the results of the previous steps (see Decision row in Figure 2 ). For instance, the drug-disease association needs a network biology approach to determine the relationship between drug molecules and their impact on patients. Many laboratories are producing a massive amount of heterogeneous data, considering both format and content. Viral sequences are represented as strings. Usually, raw clinical data (i.e. clinical records, biological analyses) are highly unstructured and heterogeneous, while medical images are more standardised data. Such data are accumulated into public databases or websites, which can be integrated with other existing databases (e.g. virus-host interaction databases, clinical and epidemiological databases) to enrich knowledge or correlate information. Such an approach can be useful in the drug-disease association, screening possible candidate vaccines or supporting healthcare decisions (e.g. management of resources such as intensive care units [ICUs] ).",

Thus, it is crucial to have the right tools and data for understanding the biology behind SARS-CoV-2.

They exist in the form of small independent particles named virions. Each virion consists of two main components: (i) the genetic information, encoded as DNA or RNA, and (ii) a protein coat, named capsid, which wraps the genetic material. Sometimes the capsid is surrounded by an envelope of lipids. Virions have different shapes that are used in their classification [9] . As viruses are not able to replicate by themselves, they need to use the cell metabolism of a host organism. The virus replication cycle may be summarised in the following six steps [10] : Figure 2 . A data science landscape for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 studies. Many different technologies produce a large quantity of data related to patients at different scales (e.g. molecular data, medical images and clinical data and epidemiological data). The accumulation of this data is the pre-requisite for a substantial rise of data science approaches (e.g. deep-learning and classical data mining) that often integrate existing data stored in databases or a priori knowledge (e.g. domain experts or ontologies). Such approaches produce new information about molecular interactions, phylogenetic analysis, in silico design of drugs or healthcare management decisions. The output may guide the execution of novel experiments closing the loop of the whole process. 5. Assembly. Virus particles may self-assembly with host proteins, causing the modification of some proteins. 6. Release. Viruses can be released from the host cell by lysis, a process that kills the cell.",

These are giant enveloped positivestranded RNA viruses that are usually able to infect a wide variety of mammals and avian species. All the members of the family cause respiratory or digestive and enteric diseases [11] . The infection mechanism is based on the action of surface spikes constituted by glycoproteins (named S or spike proteins), responsible for binding to host cell receptors. The literature reports seven \u03b2-coronaviruses that are responsible for causing diseases in humans. Four strains cause mild respiratory apparatus infection, which can be usually treated without lethal consequences (HCoV-229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43). More recently, three strains of betacoronaviruses have severe and potentially fatal consequences: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [12] . SARS-CoV caused an outbreak in China in 2002 characterised by a severe respiratory syndrome. MERS-CoV caused an outbreak in the Middle East in 2012. Both viruses caused similar disease symptoms, which led to pneumonia. MERS-CoV infected patients also presented gastrointestinal complications and kidney failure. The third member of the family, SARS-CoV-2, appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [13] . From the initial steps, it presented a surprisingly rapid diffusion rate. Until now, COVID-19 has killed more people than SARS and MERS combined, despite a lower fatality rate [14] . By the end of April 2020, the COVID-19 virus had already caused over 1500 000 confirmed cases around the world, of which around 350 000 hospitalised, and over 94 000 deaths. In China there has been more than 80 000 confirmed cases, with more than 3000 deaths.",

Some of the clinical conditions are severe pneumonia, kidney failure, anaemia, neurological problems, cardiovascular complications and also a severe inflammation known as cytokine storm, occurring in the most serious cases [15] [16] [17] .",

We consider data to be primary when it is directly generated from the virus or the patient. From the primary data, more refined, summarised and inferred outputs are elaborated and then stored as secondary data.

Omics data fall (but are not limited to) into the following classes: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Both omics technologies and data are used for insights into new unknown viruses. Thus, a preliminary activity to study COVID-19 disease has been the sequencing of the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 to elucidate how the virus grows, mutates and replicates [18] . Blood or throat swab specimens are collected both from population and patients showing compatible symptoms or suspected to have been infected. The extracted RNA material is then further sequenced, for instance, by using next generation sequencing (i.e. NGS). The output of NGS is the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is usually stored in public repositories (see available SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide and protein sequence repositories in Table 1 ). NGS enables the retrieval of complete RNA information, including transcription and expression levels, functions, locations, trafficking and degradation. In a recent study, the architecture of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome [19, 20] is reported. Transcriptomic data are highly effective in furthering understanding of the processes of cellular differentiation, carcinogenesis, transcription regulation and SARS-CoV-2, followed by the discovery of important biomarkers. The two main sources of SARS-CoV-2 RNA expression can be found in NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and OmicsDI (https://www.omicsdi.org/). Finally, metabolomic data analysis may be used to help in identifying potential chemical biomarkers for COVID-19. Metabolomics is used for the analysis of phenotypes and to gain insights into the metabolic state of biological systems. However, there are very few works in the literature providing metabolic data from COVID-19 samples. For instance, Shen et al. [21] reported proteomic metabolomic profiling of sera from 46 COVID-19 and 53 control patients data extracted from ProteomeXchange Consortium dataset (https:// www.iprox.org/).",

There are many experimental platforms for deriving physical interactions among proteins [23] , such as affinity purification mass-spectrometry (AP-MS) and yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H). Gordon et al. [24] have expressed 26 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and used an AP-MS to identify 332 human proteins to which the viral proteins bind. There are several bioinformatics tools enabling the prediction of interactions using biological information coupled with network science (see for instance [25] for a more detailed comparison). Different proteomic technologies can be used to study the complete set of interactions for several viruses [26] [27] [28] . For instance, research projects have elucidated quite a large map of interactions for SARS-CoV-2. Such interactions are usually modelled by using graphs and stored in a growing number of databases, such as Virus Mint [29] , String Viruses [30] , HpiDB [31] , Virus Mentha [32] and VirHostNet [33] .",

The term data . Major phases of data science pipeline towards decision making and analysis. Data initially collected and integrated from many sources. Then they need to be pre-processed to filter uninformative or possibly misleading values (e.g. outliers or noise). Then existing models are used to explain data or extract relevant patterns describing data or predicting associations. Finally, results need to be interpreted and explained by domain experts. Each step of analysis may generate corrections or refinements that are applied to precedent steps. science was introduced for the first time in 2008 by DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher [43] . Data science pipelines are made of four major phases: (i) raw data collection, (ii) preprocessing, (iii) descriptive or predictive modelling and (iv) interpretation. An illustrative representation of a typical data science workflow for COVID-19 management is reported in Figure 4 .",

            "text": "The integration of heterogeneous data is a crucial step in data science. The success of any data science model depends on the quality of data. Due to flaws, noise or errors in data generation, the outcome of a data science workflow can lead to incorrect results and/or interpretations. It is crucial therefore to apply different scrubbing and cleaning processeses on the data. Data standardisation and transformation are required if data have been generated by multiple and varying sources. Collectively, all of the above steps are called preprocessing [44] . Data exploration, which consists in feeding data to the computing model, can then be performed. Any data science process should include the statistical description (e.g. type, distribution, significant features, relationship among the data variables) of the input dataset, which leads to a better understanding of the data itself and of the preprocessing and analysis phases. Feature selection helps in identifying relevant attributes in the dataset. Visualisation aims to explore the possible relationship between features in the dataset or among different datasets. Dimensionality and data reduction help to make the data science workflow more efficient and resistant to noise.",

            "text": "Data can be analysed through the use of both descriptive (unsupervised) and predictive (supervised) models that often may be merged together by ensembling [45] . It is worth mentioning a few deep learning frameworks that could be helpful for COVID-19 predictive data analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [46] are extensively used to analyse radiological chest images of COVID-19 patients. A different kind of CNN model, specifically designed for graph or network data, is a graph convolution network (GCN) [47] . Due to the lack of adequate training samples during COVID-19 to train deep models, the synthetic data play a significant role [48, 49] . A recent breakthrough in deep model architecture is given by the generative adversarial networks (GANs) [50] for generating synthetic data akin to real data. A GAN is made of two simultaneously trained neural networks: generator and discriminator. A discriminator recognises training samples, whereas a generator creates fake instances to challenge the discriminator, which enhances both modules in learning crucial discriminating features in the original dataset. Regression analysis is a supervised model that can also be used to predict pandemic trends [51] . Clustering [52] is a well-known unsupervised learning model that describes and summarises the hidden pattern inside data based on certain proximity metrics. Results of the previous methods have to be validated by domain experts. Expert feedbacks can also be iteratively suggested to refine the phases of the data science pipeline (see Figure 2 ).",

            "text": "Discovering the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2 is currently the most urgent research topic. It aims to generate an evolutionary tree by using its nearest species [53] . Clustering is one of the most popular techniques to create a phylogeny among the coronavirus family-like SARS-COV and MERS-COV [54] [55] [56] . The evolution of viruses is mapped onto in silico algorithms using phylogenetic analysis. In general, the creation of a phylogenetic tree primarily relies on the analysis of sequence through alignment. Several algorithms have been developed to produce high-quality sequence alignments for both global alignments (focusing on the whole sequence) and local alignments (focusing on local regions of the sequence). Few common established methods and software have been used for SARS-CoV-2 genome alignment, such as DNAMAN (https://www.lynnon.com/dnama n.html), ClustalW [57] , MUSCLE [58] , Jalview [59] and MAFFT [60] . From alignment data, the evolutionary history is inferred by using the neighbour-joining (or maximum likelihood) method [57, 61] . Alignment approaches are also frequently used for the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of rapidly evolving viruses like SARS-CoV-2 [12, 12, 62] . On the other hand, alignment-free methods use feature-based approaches and compare the sequences by using the derived features. Due to the low mutation rate and a high degree of similarity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes, very few studies have been performed using alignment-free methods [63, 64] . Studies reveal that SARS-CoV-2 genome is similar to SARS-related coronaviruses (https:// www.ecohealthalliance.org/2020/01/) found in the Pangolin [65] or Bat [66, 67] . Scientists are studying the new strains variants of coronavirus to understand its mutant variants. Despite the close similarity of the different SARS-CoV-2 genomes [68, 69] , significant variations are also reported in the literature [70] . These studies, important for an understanding of the spread of the disease, can be useful for antiviral drug design [71] .",

The elucidation of protein structures by wet lab experiments requires a considerable amount of time. Structure prediction therefore is performed by using computational methods. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been predicted (https://deepmind.com/) by the AlphaFold and the structures are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/).

In addition to this, other existing protein structure and homology, modelling tools like COMPOSER [78] , SWISS-MODEL [79] , PyMOL c [80] and I-Tasser [81] are used for rapid prediction and comparison of Spike (S) protein [82, 83] , Envelope (E) protein [2] and ab initio homology modelling [81] .",

Data related to the interactions (or functional associations) among biologically relevant macromolecules (e.g. proteins, genes, etc.) are usually modelled by means of graph theory and its related formalism [101, 102] . Consequently, biological entities are represented as nodes, while edges model their associations [103] . Such networks may contain a single kind of molecule, such as protein-protein Interactions (PPI), or genegene interactions [23, 104] . More recently, it has been shown that biological processes are formed by the synergistic interplay of different molecules (i.e. genes, non-coding RNA, proteins, mi-RNA, etc.) [105] . Consequently, novel models that integrate such diverse aspects and describe the interplay of the heterogeneous actor have been introduced. The use of more complex network models comprising different nodes and the various interactions is growing [106, 107] . The SARS-CoV-2 scenario, as we describe in the following, also contains such models (e.g. [10] ). In Figure 6 we report a summarised view of in silico interactome graph inference workflow, involving different interactome and omics data sources.",

One of the main challenges in this area is represented by the different speeds between the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the time needed for wet-lab experiments.

The authors have derived the first map of both intra-viral and host-viral proteins using a bioinformatics approach based on the homology between SARS-CoV-2 and the previous 2002 SARS-CoV virus. The hypothesis underlying Multiple interactome analysis is another method used to integrate data obtained from heterogeneous protein or gene networks. In a similar attempt the authors in [108] proposed the integration of PPIs and gene expression data that are both obtained from available databases. Authors started with data related to three existing viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E) to infer the interactome of SARS-CoV-2. They also integrated an additional PPI database in order to reconstruct the action of SARS-CoV-2 at the proteome level, obtaining a network consisting in 13 020 nodes and 71 496 interactions. In parallel, the authors inferred a gene co-expression network using random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm and S-glycoproteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E as seeds. Similarly, the HCoV-host interactome network was built by assembling known networks (e.g. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, mouse MHV, avian IBV) obtaining a SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetically close interactome. As a novel attempt [109] , the codon pattern is used to infer possible interactions between 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and selective host proteins involved in 17 major cell signalling pathways.",

Therefore, research in this field benefits from any increase in the discovery of novel protein interactions. Nonetheless the development of targeted therapies suffer from certain limitations.

Data manipulation techniques can be used for the automatic (or semi-automatic) analysis of large amounts of images requiring substantial quantitative assessment and computation. Chest images can be used in many COVID-19-related scenarios, e.g. predicting the need for ICU resources, predicting survival rates, studying the patient's trajectories during treatment [1] . Imaging is a fast, non-invasive, relatively cheap and already a widely adopted clinical practice that can be used to monitor the evolution of the disease.

The integration of both X-ray and CT scans may improve the quality of detection. Due to the similar lung damage and symptoms between COVID-19 and common pneumonia or influenza, the chances of false positives are quite high. One option for more accurate COVID-19 diagnosis, which is yet to be fully explored, is to integrate information extracted from chest images with transcriptomic and metabolomic data [110] . Despite the increasing demand of rapid COVID-19 diagnostic systems, most of the data science approaches described above suffer from low data availability. The larger the sample data volume, the more reliable the diagnostic system should be.

At first, COVID-19 interactome modules have been identified, considering 56 different human tissues. Existing drug molecules have then been ranked by means of a proximity measure based on their ability to interact with their protein targets. In [125] network proximity analyses have been performed on drug targets and HCoV-host interactions and 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs have been selected. They have used host proteins from four known HCoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) based on phylogeny analysis and performed functional enrichment followed by drug association analysis. Another network-based approach for deriving possible drug targets has been attempted in [10] , where both protein interaction and gene co-expression networks have been used to identify master regulators [127] involved during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Physical interactions of proteins were extracted from [34] . The co-expression network has been generated by using SARS-CoV-2-human interactome proteins, derived from [128] and the largest human lung RNA-Seq dataset available from the GTEX consortium (www.gtexportal.org). The authors identified a number of key proteins involved during an infection such as ACE2, TMPRSS and MOCK.

Data science and computational intelligence are the two most useful building blocks of all the other drug repurposing approaches. Unfortunately, drug repurposing process needs, to the best of our knowledge, the introduction of up-to-date medical guidelines to become widely adopted. Despite the fact that data science will clearly help in accelerating drug repurposing, some challenges remain. For instance, in silico drug repurposing, being based on simplified models for both humans and viruses, may not reproduce all of the possible side effects. Moreover, the vast majority of drug repurposing approaches do not consider the impact of dosage or the responses on different tissues (the original drugs could be optimised for other scenarios). Therefore, clinical tests, which are mandatory for candidate molecules, may well lead to a slowdown in the process, since short term trials may not have sufficient statistical power (e.g. due to the small number of patients). Moreover, existing drug repurposing approaches do not often consider, among other factors: (i) heterogeneous populations with different genetic backgrounds, (ii) the existence of different phenotypes (e.g. patients with a different level of illness), (iii) as well as genetic differences on the SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants.

Table 2 provides an overall summary of data science models, types of tasks and data and various software tools. We also discussed some relevant challenges for data science applications in healthcare, including the need to introduce more standards and the need for more straightforward data integration.

For instance, synthetic sample data (X-ray) is generated by using generative adversarial networks during the training phase of the model. In a recent attempt, a one-shot LSTM framework [139] has been proposed [140] for repurposed drug discovery in cases of low data availability [141] .

The determination of such interactions is often performed by integrating experimental data with knowledge extracted from literature. Furthermore, protein structures are also predicted. All of this information (structures, virus-host interactions and viral interactions) is integrated by using heterogeneous networks. The final product of the process is an interactome. the work is that the similarity between two viruses is also preserved at the interactome level. Thus many interactions of 2002 SARS-CoV may be preserved in SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, they derived a whole SARS-CoV-2 interactome containing both intra-viral and virus-host interactions. The authors derived a 2002 SARS-CoV interactome by analysing the available literature. Such data are integrated with a genome-wide analysis through Y2H on SARS-CoV ORFeome, obtaining a resulting intra-viral interaction network consisting of 31 proteins and 86 unique interactions. Then, the authors used both Y2H interaction data and literature mining to derive the viral-host interactions.
