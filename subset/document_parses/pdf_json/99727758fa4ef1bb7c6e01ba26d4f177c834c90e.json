Delay in the diagnosis of malaria and other imported infections has occurred during other health crises, such as the recent Ebola outbreaks. Despite the current public health emergency and travel restrictions, imported infections with prolonged incubation periods and possibility of relapse should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients especially if alternative, more frequent diagnoses such as COVID-19 are not confirmed. 5 ",
