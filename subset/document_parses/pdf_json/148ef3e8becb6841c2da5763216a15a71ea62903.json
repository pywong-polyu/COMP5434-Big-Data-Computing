Given how OCD may interact with pandemic-related fears, as well as substantial symptom heterogeneity (Thorsen et al., 2018) , it is important to determine whether particular OCD clinical characteristics may be associated with worse mental health outcomes ). Concerns about harm to self or others and a heightened propensity towards disgust may result in excessive washing and cleaning in many with OCD (Akhtar et al., 1975; Cervin et al., 2020; Khanna et al., 1990; Wheaton et al., 2010) . Indeed, fears of contamination and excessive washing or cleaning are among the most prevalent symptoms among individuals with OCD . OCD is also associated with intolerance of uncertainty and an inflated sense of responsibility to prevent harm (Britton and Davey, 2017; Obsessive Compulsive Cognitions Working Group, 2005) . As the COVID-19 pandemic has seen widespread calls for increased responsibility for each individual to keep oneself and others safe and increased cleaning behaviors, as well as ambiguity regarding the scope and impact of the disease, it is reasonable to expect that individuals with OCD may be at particularly high risk for adverse mental health consequences during the pandemic. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with worsening of OCD symptoms (Benatti et al., 2020; Davide et al., 2020; French and Lyne, 2020; Matsunaga et al., 2020; Tanir et al., 2020) as well as relapse from previously well-controlled OCD (Jassi et al., 2020; Kumar and Somani, 2020) .",

Exposure and response prevention is the first line treatment of adults and children with OCD, demonstrating high acceptability (Lewin et al., 2014) , low dropout rates (Johnco et al., 2020) , large effect sizes relative to psychotherapy and placebo control conditions (McGuire et al., 2015; Skapinakis et al., 2016) , and superiority to antidepressant medication monotherapy (Foa et al., 2005) . There is value to examining both OCD-specific and COVID-specific predictors of ERP outcomes to better understand prognosis and treatment tailoring variables. Outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, several variables have been demonstrated to predict ERP outcome, including higher severity of OCD and depression (Denys et al., 2003; Mataix-Cols et al., 2002; Tibi et al., 2019; Kyrios et al., 2015; Hamatani et al., 2020; Ong et al., 2016) , family accommodation (Garcia et al., 2010; Merlo et al., 2009) , and poor insight (Nissen and Parner, 2018; Selles et al., 2020) .",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate clinicians' perspectives regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with OCD receiving ERP under their care prior to and during the pandemic. On the basis of reports of worsening OCD during the pandemic as well as clinical experience, we predicted that OCD symptomatology would decrease from the start of ERP to pre-COVID-19; thereafter, we predicted that the trajectory of symptom improvement would flatten throughout the pandemic. Based on past findings regarding predictors of ERP outcome, we also predicted that the trajectory of outcomes would be different for those with poor insight (versus with good/excellent insight; Nissen and Parner, 2018; Selles et al., 2020) and greater pathological doubt (versus mild doubt; Kyrios et al., 2015; Martinelli et al., 2014) . While primary contamination symptoms is not typically associated with attenuated outcome to ERP (Keeley et al., 2008; Storch et al., 2008) , we explored if this factor may be predictive of outcome given that COVID-19 has exacerbated these symptoms among many individuals with OCD (Knowles et al., 2021) . Finally, although few data have been reported regarding the impact of stressors on ERP outcome in those with OCD, some studies have documented that psychosocial stressors predict sustained or worsened OCD severity (Lin et al., 2007; Marquett et al., 2013) . Accordingly, we predicted that elevated COVID-19-related life stressors, including financial stress, close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, high-risk occupations, and the presence of high-risk medical comorbidities, would predict less positive ERP outcome.",

Overall, clinicians estimated that over one-third of their patients' symptoms worsened during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic despite continuing in active treatment. Only 10% were reported to be doing better since the onset of the pandemic, while 47% remained stable. These findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant stressor for most patients with OCD, exerting a deleterious effect on many. The overall stressful nature of the pandemic, which is well documented across individuals (Asmundson et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) , may impact overall treatment progress, as one would expect higher rates of improvement during active treatment over this time interval in the absence of the pandemic. Results suggest that financial stress and being medically at-risk for significant complications from COVID-19 are two stressors that have been particularly detrimental for individuals with OCD in treatment. Findings also highlighted that progress in OCD treatment has been attenuated moreso in adults relative to youth. Although clinicians have articulated clear guidelines for conducting effective ERP via telehealth and with public health precautions in place (Fontenelle and Miguel, 2020; McKay et al., 2020; Storch et al., 2020) , it is unclear to what extent telehealth delivery may also affect outcomes.",

Although the pandemic has been a major stressor for youth as well as adults (Signh et al., 2020) , it may be that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought more adjustment difficulties, such as trouble coping with social and academic changes, rather than OCD-specific stress. It is possible that stay-at-home orders allowed them youth to continue to focus on completing ERP exercises since they had fewer competing \"extracurricular\" activities during this time, especially during the first few months of the pandemic when activities were more stringently limited. Alternatively, youth may have had less exposure to real-world triggers (e.g., school stressors) during confinement. In contrast, adults may have had more competing occupational, family, child-educational duties, and financial tasks with which to cope.",

This suggests that there may have been slightly more \"bounce-back\" in OCD severity among individuals with greater family accommodation during the pandemic, potentially due to more family interaction during stay-at-home orders. It is also worth noting the steeper decline prior to the pandemic for individuals with greater family accommodation, potentially due to greater statistical opportunity for change in this group, as individuals with greater family accommodation also began with higher OCD severity. This steeper pre-pandemic decline appeared to contribute more to the quadratic effect than post-pandemic symptom changes.",

The data reported reflects trajectories for individuals with OCD who continued to receive treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic; outcomes for those who terminated treatment may look very different. Second, our sample sizes for subgroup analyses were small. For example, we had n=21 for the \"at-risk for severe COVID-19 illness\" subgroup and n=36 for the \"adverse financial impact\" subgroup. Thus, the comparisons were based on unequal sample sizes and may have been biased due to the relatively smaller number of people endorsing these risk factors. Third, clinicians were sampled during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic; it is unclear how findings will play out as the pandemic continues. Finally, clinicians possessed expertise in OCD treatment and were asked to select up to 5 patients (although most reported on 1); findings may not be representative of all OCD patients and/or those seen by this group of expert clinicians.",

Overall, progress in ERP seems to be attenuated from expected rates for most adult patients (but less so for youth) during the initial months of the pandemic. Results also suggest that the pandemic is associated with worsening of symptoms in patients who endured financial distress, who are medically at-risk, or had greater baseline family accommodation. Surprisingly, individuals with greater pretreatment doubt/uncertainty progressed more favorably in treatment Storch et al. during the pandemic, on average, compared with individuals with less pretreatment doubt/uncertainty issues. While this study represents an initial effort to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated stressors on ERP outcomes, further research is needed to better understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD symptomatology and treatment trajectory post-pandemic.",
