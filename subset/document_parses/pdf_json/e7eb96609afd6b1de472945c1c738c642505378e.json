In our centre, only the 8-Fr size of these types of catheters is available. Consequently, they often become occluded in a short time after the placement, and repeated surgical procedures can be required. Therefore, we did not use this type of catheter with any patients during the study period; however, it should be kept in mind as an alternative method for the drainage of pleural effusions.",
