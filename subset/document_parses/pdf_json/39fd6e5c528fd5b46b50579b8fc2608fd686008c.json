With the increased prevalence of chronic pulmonary diseases due to pollution, vascular and neurological diseases from obesity and the aging population pyramid and, last but not least, the occurrence of pandemics such as COVID-19 or Ebola accelerate pharmaceutical manufacturing and research processes that must be adhered to strict quality conditions. A newly manufactured and market-placed medicine has to face obstacles for the industry players. Changes in consumer attitudes, cybersecurity threats, rapid advances in technology, non-adequate return on innovation and competition from companies in emerging economies are several of them [1, 2] . In the 21st century, a novel quality assurance approach, Quality by Design (QbD)), appeared, oriented towards quality of the product and the improved patient applicability during therapeutic use. Quality, safety and efficacy are the three cornerstones of the QbD approach, which is built around starting from preformulation studies all the way to the patient's own use [3, 4] .",

Lipid-, polymer-based or other nanoDDSs all require a specific regulatory environment [6, 7] . On the one hand, the reason for this is to be found in the production process, as conventional production line equipment is not necessarily suitable for the production of these products besides the need of special conditions and constant control. The opportunity is there in the hands of all developers to apply this method and in the course of our research group, the existence was proven on many occasions for nanoDDSs, such as liposomes [8] , polymeric micelles [9] and human serum albumin nanoparticles [10] . On the other hand, safety must also be proven, as an increase in efficacy is expected due to the advanced properties of the systems, but in the case of improperly optimized preparations, it can lead to nanotoxicity and severe side effects [11, 12] .",

They have a number of advantages, perhaps the most important of which is the increase in water solubility, along with a reduction in particle size. Together, these two factors contribute to a more favourable pharmacokinetic profile and to the incorporation of certain poorly soluble or penetrating active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into a liquid dosage form [14] . The physical stability of the polymeric micelles proves to be adequate and they are able to maintain their particle size even during the circulation time in the bloodstream. In addition to administration by alternative administration routes, they show increased resistance to the body's metabolic effects, which is also important for maintaining the active, effective form of the API [15] . For safety and quality assured development, every developer must consider all possible outcomes before, in between and after the preparation of nanotherapeutics, which needs a holistic and systematic knowledge space-based development [16] . As mentioned, the leaders of pharma industry must create innovative dosage forms in order to stand a chance in the global market. To achieve this, polymeric micelles are an excellent solution. Compared to liquid formulations, these nanosized systems have the higher ground when talking about decrease of dosage strength; therefore, the occurrence of side effects, the ability to offer higher permeability and flux values across biological membranes and, last but not least, the pleasing carrier integrity through the circulation in the body.",

Based on our previous experience from formulation studies in the field of nanotechnology and polymeric micelles supplemented by literature data, quantified risk severities based on this systematic summary was calculated in order to help and encourage professionals in the pharmaceutical field to apply QbD in the development processes. Later, described possible Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) were collected and an extensive risk assessment (RA) was performed on them. The Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and Critical Material Attributes (CMAs) went through a RA also and because many formulation methods exist in the development of polymeric micelles, these methods were evaluated individually.",

A three-level scale was used to describe the relation between these parameters: each relation was assigned with a \"high\" (H), \"medium\" (M) or \"low\" (L) attributive.

LeanQbD Software (QbD Works LLC, Fremont, CA, USA) was used for the RA procedure. At first, an interdependence rating amongst the QTPPs and the CQAs and the CQAs and the CPPs was performed. A three-level scale was used to describe the relation between these parameters: each relation was assigned with a \"high\" (H), \"medium\" (M) or \"low\" (L) attributive. The decision of assignment was performed based on numerous aspects including: occurrence of the risk factor during formulation and/or final product development phase; controllability of the factor; whether the factor can be eliminated or can it be fixed at a certain value without affecting quality; detectability. The description of relations had the fundamental basis of how closely the factors are related and data from the collected literature, in addition to the regulatory aspects of a joint MHLW/EMA reflection paper on the development of block copolymer micelle medicinal products [21] . Using the software, these qualitative relations were the basis of calculating the severity scores. As the output of the RA, Pareto diagrams were generated, presenting numeric data and ranking of the CQAs and the CPPs representing the potential impact on the final product [22] .",

In addition to the mandatory elements of the ICH guidelines, optional QTPPs can be defined, which mainly depends on the nature of the target product. Defining the indication is of paramount importance. This QTPP is most often due to the properties and previous application of the API. By forming a polymeric micelle formulation, the indications in the previous SPCs can be also supplemented [23] . Achieving this plays an important role mainly in immune and cancer therapy [24] . On the other hand, by innovating the mode of application, the API can be delivered to biological spaces which previous conventional formulations are not capable of. A particularly good example of this is the delivery of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to the central nervous system (CNS) for the treatment of neuroinflammation, in which case, conventional peroral formulations do not or only a small extent can enter [25] .",

This is especially important in pediatric and geriatric medication, where patient experience is of paramount importance to improve therapy fidelity, the so-called adherence [26] . Polymeric micelle formulations designed for a conventional route of administration are aimed primarily to increase the bioavailability of products previously authorized for that route. However, new development trends prefer alternative routes of administration, of which the ophthalmic, topical and nasal delivery play the largest role [27] [28] [29] . A significant number of active substances are able to exert their effect only at certain point of action in the body, in the given indication. However, this does not mean that their potential is not greater and nanoformulations are able to deliver APIs to new sites. Of these, the intake of the drug into the CNS and cancer cells should be highlighted [30, 31] . The dosage strength of the formulation depends on many things: indication, API features and the administration route. Manufacturers should clearly indicate the proposed dosage form of the formulation because they have different stability and product quality in colloidal solution, colloidal gelling system or freeze-dried form [14] .",

The main criterion for polymers is that they are biocompatible with the human body and that, after their metabolism, the degradation products do not cause harmful side effects [32] . Where necessary, sterility is also required, as well as the product characteristics that allow the safe use of the dosage form and the administration route. The stability of polymeric micelles can be approached in several ways. Stability in aqueous solutions means a constant particle size after redispersion and a reduction in the tendency to aggregate. In addition to the liquid form, it is also worth checking these parameters during storage after freeze-drying [14] . Some copolymers are temperature and pH sensitive, so it is important to know whether a particular product can provide the expected effect under these factors. Changes in structure are expected after drug loading and which are also critical parameters of product characteristics. The classification of solubility among QTPPs is also a common case, as reducing redispersion time, improving solubility rate and increasing wetting properties are also the goal in the production of polymeric micelles. This is closely related to drug release, such as QTPP, where different aims can be achieved. Most commonly, the aim is the rapid onset of action, but in other cases, sustained release with prolonged circulation time can be accomplished after modifying the polymeric micelle structure [33, 34] . Drug release is also influenced based on indication, the route of administration and the API itself. Drug permeability is included as QTPP, aiming either to enhance passive diffusion or the carrier-mediated active transport mechanisms [35] . The described QTPPs are summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 .

It is supplemented by the general ICH specifications, e.g., the guidelines of safety pharmacology studies for human pharmaceuticals (ICH S7A) [37] and the general development and manufacture of drug substances (ICH Q11) [38] . There are multiple factors that should be taken into account: first, the description and composition which are related to the later described CQA and CMA elements. Such factors are the content of the block copolymer and the active substance in the product, the composition and the polymer's material attributes, followed by the quality characterization of the product. Typical examples are the impurity profile, the micelle size, morphology, surface properties, drug loading and in vitro release/permeability profile, which can be generally measured to all polymeric micelle product. The joint paper also states that the stability of the block copolymer micelle products should be based on the ICH Q1A(R2) [39] guideline and for the ones containing biological or biotechnological entities, the ICH Q5C can be applied [40] . For example, if the stability is included in the QTPP profile of the product, it should be more specific depending on the manufacturer's goal-whether it should be physically and/or chemically stable-which is more important or, in other words, based on the material properties of the building agents which have the higher risk value. Non-clinical pharmacokinetics should include relevant measurements of the release and permeability profile of the product complemented by thorough active substance and micelle-forming polymer metabolite screening using biorelevant mediums (maybe organs and/or tissues). When applicable, safety pharmacology studies should be conducted in accordance with ICH M3(R2), ICH S7A and ICH S7B [37, 41, 42] with toxicological studies based on ICH S4, ICH S6(R1) and ICH S9 [43] [44] [45] .",

During screening processes, two main things need to be determined or examined first: the nature of the polymeric micelle forming copolymer and the type of polymeric micelle. Copolymers can differ in the constitution of monomers and the sensitivity towards environmental changes. A distinction can be made between copolymers consisting of two block and those consisting of three blocks, the latter of which can be composed of two or three different monomers. Graft copolymers are considered to contain chain branches allowing a more diverse structure [46] . Innovative copolymers are already able to respond to stimuli by altering the tertiary or quaternary structure of the polymer. Such a stimulus can be, for example, pH, temperature, ionic strength or even binding to an immunological element [47] . The arrangement of conventional polymeric micelles is as follows: in a polar liquid medium, the hydrophilic side chain is solubilized to the outside world, while the hydrophobic moiety keeps the drug molecularly dispersed. The inverse of this can be also distinguished when talking about a reverse micelle. Mixed micelles are polymeric micelles in the construction of which several copolymers play a role. The polymer side chains can take various forms, depending on the material properties, such as a flower-like micelle, unimolecular star micelle or unimolecular dendritic micelle. In the hydrophobic core of a polymeric micelle, several compartments can be formed, mainly with oily substances, in which case, it is a multicompartment micelle [46] . Morphology of the polymeric micelles are influenced by the dosage form (e.g., they are incorporated into a hydrogel or just a colloidal solution) and whether surface modifications have been formulated on the surface of the outer shell. These modifications all have the same aim: to improve or control the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug release from the carrier [48, 49] .",

Such factors are: particle size, polydispersity index, encapsulation efficiency (EE%), drug loading (DL%) and zeta potential. These, combined with polarity and the definition of wetting parameters, are import elements of optimization. The average particle size of polymeric micelles is between 20 and 200 nm, which is influenced by the properties of the building copolymers and the API itself. A particle size distribution is claimed to be optimal if it is below 0.300. Both the EE% and the DL% are strongly related to the material properties, the extent of which is determined by the quantitative and qualitative features of the polymer. As the hydrophilic side chains are oriented towards the outer surface after encapsulation of the API, the values of the contact angles to water will decrease, while those to hydrophobic materials will increase. This leads to increased polarity, which is closely related to water solubility and thus also to dissolution parameters [50] . These factors are the ones that most often form part of the design of experiment (DoE) as to be optimized. Optimization can be performed by factorial experimental designs, e.g., Box-Behnken design, central composite design, Plackett Burman design or the traditional 2 x DoE experiments. Nowadays, the creation of neural experimental design networks is also of key importance, as it is able to study the interactions between factors more broadly [51, 52] .",

In the case of polymeric micelles, the preparation can always start or end in a liquid medium, where four main factors are distinguished: the copolymer, the API, the solvent(s) and any excipients added. The general CMA factors are presented in Table 3 . Several methods have been developed for the production of polymeric micelles. Direct dissolution method is commonly used when the micelle-forming copolymers have relatively high water solubility. The API and the copolymer are directly dissolved in an aqueous media associated with stirring, heating and/or sonication in order to form the drug-loaded polymeric micelles [53] . Thus, micelle formation happens by the dehydration of the core forming blocks. The dialysis method is for copolymers with low water solubility; therefore, organic solvents are used in this method. During the preparation, the API and the copolymer(s) are dissolved in a common organic solvent and they are subsequently dialyzed against water. This triggers the micelle formation besides washing away residual organic solvents from the formed polymeric micelle solution [54] . Oily substances can be used in the preparation, when the API is miscible or soluble in the oil phase. With constant mixing, polymeric micelles can form in the aqueous phase of the emulsion, but this method needs many after cleaning processes [55] . The freeze-drying method is associated with dimethylacetamide or tert-butanol as organic (co-)solvents because of their high vapor pressure offering rapid sublimation. After dissolving the API in the organic solvent-water mixture, a freeze-dried cake of polymeric micelles can be achieved which demonstrates adequate shelf-life with high water dispersibility [56] . The thin film method is a production method based on complete solvent evaporation, where the drug and polymer system dissolved in any solvent (mixture) is recovered in the form of a thin film. It is then followed by hydration in water (or water-based buffer) and depending on the properties of the polymer, the process can also be followed by ultrasonication, mixing or even filtration, just like in the production process for liposomes [8, 9] . Possible CPP elements and specific CMAs associated with each production method are collected in Table 4 . ",

It can be claimed that there is an antipsychotic compound which has low water solubility and inefficient permeability can be experienced from the intestinal tract from previously formulated solid tablet formulations. Based on this sentence alone, many QTPP elements can be already determined: What is the marketed/clinically efficient dosage strength of the API? What other administration route can I exploit? What is the target population of this API? What is the major indication field of this substance? What physicochemical and pharmacokinetic attributes do I want to improve on? The next step is to make adjustments to this based on your goal: instead of the adult population, the target population should be children; therefore, my target dosage strength must be lowered accordingly to pharmacokinetic parameters. A novel article was found during the knowledge space development phase of my research where the suspension form of this API delivered by the nasal route showed higher brain concentrations, resulting in more advanced therapeutic effect in the major indication. Then, all process and material parameters should be taken into account, for example, in the research laboratory, we have a deep knowledge on freeze-drying production method for polymeric nanocarriers, so that should be the chosen formulation method and there are suitable micelle-forming copolymers which are able to decrease the particle size of APIs below 100 nm.",

            "text": "One of the cornerstones of the QbD approach is that, at the end of the risk assessment, an extensive formulation optimization follows. This is most often done by setting up a factorial or neural experimental design, after which the design space is set up with proper statistical evaluation and then the formulation is characterized to validate it. If a quality defect is discovered during the life course of the formulation, then adjustments but be made. One good example of applying QbD as a part of the DoE set-up is the work of Khurana et al., where a 13-run central composite design was used to optimize resveratrol-loaded polymeric micelles [57] . Based on their risk assessment, the selected CQA elements with the highest risk severity were micellar incorporation efficiency (MIE), the particle size and the skin deposition potential. The effect of polymer ratio and the API content were investigated on these CQAs and a response analysis were carried out through polynomial equation. By plotting the surface plots, the optimized polymer to API ratio was found and satisfactory results were obtained: the observed MIE was 93.45% with a particle size of 142.67 nm and skin deposition of 51.63% which all meet the requirements of a polymer-based nanoDDS for topical drug delivery supplemented by advanced in vivo pharmacokinetics. Another great example of QbD-based DoE is the work of Lohan et al., where after the construction of an Ishikawa fish-bone diagram containing the factors influencing the galantamine-loaded mixed micelle formulation, a 7-factor 8-run Taguchi orthogonal array design was employed aiming to reveal the potential impact of various material attributes on product quality [58] . After the screening, they investigated the effect of DSPE-PEG 2000 and soy lecithin on the particle characteristics and drug release in a 13-run central composite design, as well as with 5 parallel measurements. A great tool to decrease the severity of the risk factors was applied by them: keeping the high-risk valued ethanol concentration at a fixed ratio, meaning that the optimized formulation should be matched with this factor. By the end of the optimization, the desirability functions were compared to the investigated parameters and a nanosized mixed micellar system was developed with a particle size of 175 nm, a zeta potential of \u221218 mV and a dissolution efficiency of 86%. In our previous work, the optimization of Meloxicam-loaded polymeric micelles via RA-based Box-Behnken factorial design was performed and a one-way ANOVA statistical analysis of the results was applied. The effect of the ethanol and sodium-hydroxide volume and the polymer concentration was investigated on particle size and particle size distribution with end results of 111.6 nm and a PdI of 0.114, allowing proper basis for nasal drug delivery [9] . In addition to these examples, many factorial/neural design studies are there in the literature for polymeric micelles; however, the lack of pre-optimization risk screening can be observed. That is why it is encouraging to use the demonstrated knowledge space development and risk assessment, along with statistical analysis of your choosing, so the micellar formulations can be matched to quality management as well.",

The QTPP elements, as proven, depend on the purpose; however, it is important to incorporate the mandatory elements of the ICH guidelines when setting up the pilot design. For polymeric micelles, as promising nanotherapeutics, this is not an easy task, as new indications and therapeutic possibilities may occur due to particle size reduction and modification of the administration route, leading to a different pharmacokinetic profile. The CQA, CPP and CMA elements were collected in their entirety to characterize a general formulation based on literature.

Amongst QTPPs, it can be seen that it can range from general application principles to the extent of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic factors. It is important to see that QTPP elements are those without which risk assessment would not be possible. A separate risk assessment process is required for each polymeric micelle formulation, regardless of whether it contains an active substance or it concerns a development of a new polymeric carrier system able to form micelles. In the risk assessment with the CQA, CPP and CMA elements, we shed light on which posed the greatest risk for a general nanoformulation. Of course, a researcher has to decide for themself which factors are relevant to the production process and product quality chosen, so we performed the analysis for several production methods common amongst developers. The risk assessment of R&D processes is of particular importance for nanocarriers. Greater emphasis should also be placed on the basic properties of polymers and the active substance, as well as on the steps in the manufacturing process. The optimization of the particle characteristics also depends, crucially, on the nature of the building polymer and the manufacturing process.",

As an encouragement, it is recommended that all researchers use the previous literature and evaluate the significant factors under a risk assessment process, resulting in a more focused design of experiment.
