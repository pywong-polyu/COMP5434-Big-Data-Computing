ICD10 codes (Appendix) were used to define diverticulitis-related encounters (outpatient, inpatient, including operations and percutaneous drainage, or emergency department (ED)) and complications (perforation, abscess). Episodes were defined by the highest intensity visit (inpatient highest, outpatient lowest) in a 14-day time period. Care occurring greater than 42 days later was considered a separate episode.",

While patients who delay presentation for diverticulitis may plausibly develop more severe or complicated disease, this time-course is not well understood. Population-based studies have suggested a disconnect between uncomplicated and complicated disease-where the number of acute episodes does not correlate with the frequency of complicated disease and increasing elective surgery for uncomplicated disease does not reduce emergency complications. 5, 6 The \"natural experiment\" of the pandemic on diverticulitis resulted in limited care through social restrictions or health care access, highlighting the gap in our understanding of the diverticulitis disease spectrum. Within a month of the restrictions, there was a more than 3-fold decrease in the monthly episode count (primarily uncomplicated disease), without a coinciding change in complicated cases. The shift from outpatient care (presumably because of decreased clinic access) suggests that the drivers of healthcare utilization in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis (such as thresholds to seek care) remain poorly understood.",
