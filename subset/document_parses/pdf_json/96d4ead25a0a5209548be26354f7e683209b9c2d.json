We therefore compared the functional properties of the S proteins with aspartic acid (S D614 ) and glycine (S G614 ) at residue 614. We observed that retroviruses pseudotyped with S G614 infected ACE2expressing cells markedly more efficiently than those with S D614 . This greater infectivity was correlated with less S1 shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion. Similar results were obtained using the virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins. However, S G614 did not bind ACE2 more efficiently than S D614 , and the pseudoviruses containing these S proteins were neutralized with comparable efficiencies by convalescent plasma.",

One of these variations encodes a S-protein mutation, D614G, in the carboxy(C)-terminal region of the S1 domain [21] [22] [23] 26, 30 . This region of the S1 domain directly associates with S2 (Fig. 1a ). This mutation with glycine at the residue 614 (G614) was previously detected to increase with an alarming speed 21, 22 . Our own analysis of the S-protein sequences available from the GenBank showed a similar result: The G614 genotype was not detected in February (among 33 sequences) and observed at low frequency in March (26%), but increased rapidly by April (65%) and May (70%) (Fig. 1b) , indicating a transmission advantage over viruses with D614. Korber et al. noted that this change also correlated with increased viral loads in COVID-19 patients 22 , but because this change is also associated with the mutations in viral nsp3 and RdRp proteins, the role of the S-protein in these observations remained undefined.",

An S D614 variant, in which the furin-cleavage motif between the S1 and S2 domains is ablated (S FKO ), was also included for comparison. HEK293T cells transduced to express human ACE2 (hACE2-293T) or those transduced with vector alone (Mock-293T) were infected with the same particle numbers of the PVs pseudotyped with the S D614 , S G614 , or S FKO (PV D614 , PV G614 , or PV FKO , respectively), and infection level was assessed one day later. We observed PV G614 infected hACE2-293T cells with approximately 9-fold higher efficiency than did PV D614 ( Fig. 1c,d) . This enhanced infectivity of PV G614 is not an artifact of PV titer normalization, as their titers are very similar (Extended Data Fig. 1 ).",

To do so, we used Sprotein constructs bearing Flag tags at both their amino (N)-and C-termini. PVs pseudotyped with these double-Flag tagged forms of S D614 , S G614 , and S FKO were partially purified and concentrated by pelleting through a 20% sucrose layer 32 and evaluated for their infectivity. The titers of PVs were similar among PV G614 , PV D614 , and PV FKO before and after purification (Fig. 2a) . In addition, modification by Flag-tags or pelleting of PVs through a sucrose layer did not alter the relative infectivity between PV G614 and PV D614 (Fig. 2b) . We then determined their S1:S2 ratio by western blotting using the anti-Flag M2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2c , the S1:S2 ratio is markedly greater in PV G614 compared to PV D614 , indicating that glycine at residue 614 of S G614 stabilizes the interaction between the S1 and S2 domains, limiting S1 shedding. In addition, the total amount of the S protein in PV G614 is also much higher than that in PV D614 , as indicated by a denser S2 band, even though the same number of pseudovirions was analyzed, as determined by quantitative PCR. To independently confirm that similar number of virions was analyzed, the lower part of the same membrane was blotted with an anti-p30 MLV gag antibody (Fig. 2c) . Similar densities of p30 bands were observed from all PVs, indicating that differences in S-protein incorporation observed with PV G614 and PV D614 were due to the mutation of residue 614, not by different amount of PVs analyzed. A similar experiment performed with independently produced PVs yielded a nearly identical result (Extended Data Fig. 2a ). Densitometric analysis shows there is 4.7 times more S1+S2 band in PV G614 compared to PV D614 (Fig. 2d) . To more accurately estimate the S1:S2 ratio, we next compared different amount of the same samples so that S2-band intensity in PV G614 and PV D614 was comparable (Fig. 2e) . Averages of several quantification show that the S1:S2 ratio of PV G614 is 3.5 times higher than that of PV D614 (Fig. 2f) . The M2 antibody used in this experiment binds the Flag tag located at both the N-and C-termini of a protein, but it binds N-terminal Flag tag more efficiently 33 .",

To explore this possibility, we investigated whether ACE2 binding by S G614 was more efficient than that by S D614 . HEK293T cells transfected to express each S protein were assessed for their binding of hACE2 immunoadhesin, using hACE2-NN-Ig, whose enzymatic activity was abolished by mutation 31 . hACE2-NN-Ig bound SARS-CoV-1 RBD with an equivalent affinity as hACE2-Ig. These S proteins are fused to a C-terminal, but not an N-terminal Flag tag, thus allowing for the measurement of total S protein expression in permeabilized cells by flow cytometry. Although total S protein expression was comparable, hACE2-NN-Ig binding to the cells expressing S G614 was substantially higher than its binding to cells expressing S D614 (Fig. 4a) . This observation has several explanations. First, G614 could increase hACE2 association by promoting greater exposure of the RBD, or second, this mutation could increase the number of binding sites by limiting S1-domain shedding. To differentiate these possibilities, we appended the Myc-tag to the N-terminus of the S-protein that is Flag tagged at its C-terminus and repeated the study, this time detecting the S1 domain with an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 4b , the ratio of Myc-tag to Flag-tag is higher in cells expressing S G614 than in cells expressing S D614 . However, the Myc-tag/Flag-tag ratio is similar to the hACE2-NN-Ig/Flag-tag ratio, indicating that increased hACE2 binding to the S G614 -expressing cells did not result from increased affinity of S G614 spikes to hACE2 or greater access to the RBD. Instead, these data show there is more S1 domain in the S G614 -expressing cells, a result again consistent with the observation that the D614G mutation reduces S1",

An alternative explanation, more consistent with the data presented here, is that Q613 forms a hydrogen bond with T859, and the greater backbone flexibility provided by introduction of glycine at an adjacent position 614 enables a more favorable orientation of Q613. It is also possible that D614 can form an intra-domain salt bridge with R646, promoting a local S1 conformation unfavorable to its association with S2. In this model, replacing aspartic acid with glycine at the position 614 would prevent sampling of this unfavorable configuration.

In case of VLPs, this disruption would presumably further interfere with appropriate M-and N-protein associations by altering the conformation and orientation of the S-protein membrane-proximal regions. Alternatively, these S-protein trimers with the exposed S2 domains may serve as poor substrates for downstream post-translational modifications including palmitoylation, and those lacking proper modifications might be unsuitable for virion incorporation.",

It is possible that higher levels of functional S protein observed with S G614 increase the chance of host-to-host transmission, but that other factors limit the rate and efficiency of intra-host replication. Alternatively, the loss of virion-associated S proteins observed with S D614 may be compensated by greater fusion efficiency with the destabilized S protein when the next target cell is adjacent in a host tissue. It is also possible that our ability to detect sequence changes at this early stage of the pandemic is simply greater than our ability to detect modest differences in pathogenesis. The strong phenotypic difference we observe here between D614 and G614 suggests that more study on the impact of the D614G mutation on the course of disease is warranted.",

At some point in this process, the virus acquired a furin-cleavage site, allowing its S1/S2 boundary to be cleaved in virusproducing cells. In contrast, the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-1, and indeed all SARSlike viruses isolated from bats, lack this polybasic site and are cleaved by TMPRSS2 or endosomal cathepsins in the target cells [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Thus the greater stability we observe with S G614 would not be relevant to viruses lacking this site, but it appears to be strongly favored when a furin-cleavage site is present. Therefore, the D614G mutation may have emerged to compensate for this newly acquired furin site.",

The ratio of 5:5:1 by mass was used for the retroviral vector pQCXIX encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP) or firefly luciferase (FLuc), a plasmid expressing MLV gag and pol proteins, and a plasmid expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 or VSV G protein. The plasmid expressing VSV G protein was previously reported 31 . SARS-CoV-2 S protein gene used in the production of MLV PVs was codon-optimized and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies based on the protein sequence (GenBank YP_009724390). The S protein gene is fused to the Flag tag sequence (DYKDDDDK) either at its C-terminus or at both the N-and C-termini, as indicated in each experiment. PV-containing culture supernatants were collected at 43 h post transfection, cleared through 0.45 \u00b5m filters, and either purified or aliquoted and frozen at -80\u00b0C immediately. PV titers were quantified by RT-qPCR, using primers and a probe that target the CMV promoter. Sense primer: 5'-TCACGGGGATTTCCAAGTCTC-3', anti-sense primer: 5'-GlycoBlue coprecipitant (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). qPCR was performed using Luna Universal Probe qPCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs) with the known quantity of pQCXIX vector to generate standard curves. Infection assays were performed by spinoculating (at 2,100 x g for 30 min at 10\u00b0C) PVs onto the Mock-and hACE2-293T cells seeded on multiwell plates. Spinoculated plates were incubated for 2 h in a CO 2 incubator and medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Infection levels were assessed 24 h post infection by measuring GFP expression by Accuri flow cytometer or luciferase activity using the Luc-Pair Firefly Luciferase HS Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia). Analyses of the S protein incorporated into MLV PV. For the analyses of the S protein in the virion, PVs were partially purified. 9 ml of cleared culture supernatants containing PVs (20 ml/T175) were loaded onto 2 ml of 20% sucrose in PBS and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm in the SW41 rotor for 2 h at 10\u00b0C 32 . PV pellets were resuspended in 30-50 \u00b5l NT buffer (120 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH8.0). Purified PVs were immediately used or aliquoted and frozen at -80\u00b0C. For western blot analyses, 5-10 \u00b5l of purified PV, which is equivalent to 0.5-1.0 x 10 10 vector genomes, was loaded per lane of the 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies), transferred to the PVDF membrane, and blotted with 1 \u00b5g/ml anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804) to detect the S-protein bands. 1 \u00b5g/ml anti-p30 MLV gag antibody (Abcam, ab130757) and 1:10,000 dilution of goat-anti-mouse IgG-HRP polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 115-036-062) were used to detect MLV gag protein as an internal control. Band intensities were measured, using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). To increase the accuracy of this measurement, the same blots were analyzed several times at different exposures. For silver staining, 30 \u00b5l of purified PVs were separated by the 4-12% Bis-Tris gel and stained with Silver Stain Plus (Bio-Rad). VLP production and S-protein analysis. SARS-CoV-2 VLPs were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells at ~60% confluency in T75 flasks with 25 \u00b5g total DNA using the calcium phosphate method as previously described with a modification 34 . The plasmids expressing SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins were transfected at a ratio of 1:5:5:1. The codon-optimized M, N, and E protein genes were synthesized based on the GenBank protein sequences, YP_009724393, YP_009724397, and YP_009724392, respectively. VLPs were harvested 43 h post transfection from the culture supernatants, cleared by 0.45 \u00b5m filtration, and partially purified by pelleting through a 20% sucrose layer as were MLV PVs. VLP pellets were resuspended in 30 \u00b5l of NT buffer, and the entire amount was loaded on the 4-12% Bis-Tris gel for WB analyses. As with MLV PV, the S-protein bands were visualized using the anti-Flag M2 antibody, and the N-protein band was detected using pooled convalescent plasma at a 1:500 dilution and 10 ng/ml goat-anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with polymerized HRP (Fitzgerald, 61R-I166AHRP40).Cell-surface expression and analysis of the S protein. HEK293T cells, approximately80% confluent in 6-well plates were transfected with 8 \u00b5l PEI 40,000 (Polysciences) and 2 \u00b5g plasmid expressing the indicated S protein variant. For ACE2-NN-Ig binding experiments, the S protein constructs with the Flag tag only at the C-terminus, and for the measurement of total S1, those with N-terminal Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) and C-terminalFlag tag (DYKDDDDK) are used. All tags are fused with a two-glycine (GG) linker. To measure ACE2-binding ability or the level of the S1 domain present on the cell surface, cells were detached two days post transfection with Accutase (Stemcell Technologies Inc.) and incubated with either 1 \u00b5g/ml purified hACE2-NN-Ig or anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10, National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN), respectively, on ice. hACE2-NN-Ig was previous described and was purified using Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) 31 . To measure the total level of S protein, cells were permeabilized with PBS including 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 10 min and incubated with 1 \u00b5g/ml anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Neutralization assay with human immune plasma. Deidentified blood samples were obtained by the Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Specialists of South Florida, LLC for COVID--19 serotyping, and exempt from human subject research under 45 CFR 45.101(b)(4). MLV PVs encoding firefly luciferase and pseudotyped with the indicated SARS-CoV-2 S protein were preincubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with or without convalescent or healthy plasma serially diluted in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Mock-and hACE2-HEK293T cells on 96-well plates were infected with the preincubation mixes and infection levels were assessed 24 h later by measuring luciferase activity using the Luc-Pair Firefly Luciferase HS Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia).
