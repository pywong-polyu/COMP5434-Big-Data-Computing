The inverse opal hydrogel structure features well-defined, interconnected pores with high similarity to human alveolar sacs. By populating the sacs with primary human alveolar epithelial cells, functional epithelial monolayers are readily formed. Cyclic strain is integrated into the device to allow biomimetic breathing events of the alveolar lung, which, in addition, makes it possible to investigate pathological effects such as those incurred by cigarette smoking and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pseudoviral infection. Our study demonstrates a unique method for reconstitution of the functional human pulmonary alveoli in vitro, which is anticipated to pave the way for investigating relevant physiological and pathological events in the human distal lung. alveoli | distal lung | lung-on-a-chip | inverse opal | three-dimensional",

Our study demonstrates a unique method for reconstitution of the functional human pulmonary alveoli in vitro, which is anticipated to pave the way for investigating relevant physiological and pathological events in the human distal lung. alveoli | distal lung | lung-on-a-chip | inverse opal | three-dimensional T he lung, as the major organ of the human respiratory system, is responsible primarily for gas exchanges and thus, directly exposed to the external environment. Lungs are affected by a plethora of pathologies such as asthma (1); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (2) ; and infections like influenza (3), pneumonia (4) , and tuberculosis (5) as well as lung cancer (6) . These pathological manifestations make lung failure one of the leading causes of death globally. More recently, this is further exemplified by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic, which has so far killed more than 3 million people worldwide with total confirmed cases of >140 million (7) .",

A recent work attempted to develop such a model with bioprinting (19) ; however, this model merely reflected alveoli's gross anatomy, albeit in much larger scales than the actual features of the human alveoli (millimeters vs. micrometers), and the material used was still incompatible to native tissue in terms of bioactivity.",

GelMA was used as the model ECM to fabricate the scaffold due to its biocompatibility, photocross-linkability, availability, and cost-effectiveness (30) . Importantly, GelMA possesses some of the essential properties of ECM such as presence of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequences, which promote cell attachment, and matrix metalloproteinaseresponsive peptide motifs, thus allowing cells to proliferate and spread in/on GelMA-based scaffolds. A range of Young's modulus values has been reported for the human lung tissue depending on the anatomical compartments of the lung and the mechanical testing techniques used, from \u223c1.4 to 7.2 kPa (31, 32) . The compressive modulus of our GelMA hydrogels (double cross-linked; first with Irgacure 2959 and then with microbial transglutaminase [mTG]) was found to be 6.23 \u00b1 0.64 kPa (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ), which is within the range of the mechanical strengths reported for the native lung tissue. In addition, the swelling ratios of the GelMA hydrogels (double cross-linked) were significantly smaller (\u223c8 and \u223c10% for 2D and 3D GelMA hydrogels, respectively) than those photocross-linked with Irgacure 2959 alone (\u223c12 and \u223c15% for 2D and 3D GelMA hydrogels, respectively), as shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S2A . Thus, we first photocross-linked our GelMA constructs using Irgacure 2959 and then further chemically cross-linked them using mTG to increase their stability as we have shown also in the degradation profiles in SI Appendix, Fig. S2B . We have further used collagen methacryloyl to fabricate an inverse opal structure, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach to engineer the alveolar lung model using different hydrogel biomaterials (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 ).",

            "text": "The structure (all based on GelMA below) was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy, as illustrated in Fig. 2 A, ii, Inset and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 , in which an interconnecting window between two adjacent sacs could be observed. The fluorescence confocal images of the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated GelMA before and after alginate microbead removal further verified their structure ( Fig. 2 A, iii). The alginate microbeads were prepared by electrospraying the alginate solution into a CaCl 2 solution for immediate physical cross-linking (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 ). The influence of each parameter, including alginate concentration, voltage, needle diameter, flow rate, and ring diameter, on the formation of the microbeads was carefully studied (SI Appendix, Figs. S6-S10). While a wide range of diameters could be conveniently achieved, uniform alginate microbeads measuring \u223c200 \u03bcm (201 \u00b1 12 \u03bcm) were selected for constructing the alveolar lung model since the average size of each alveolus is \u223c200 \u03bcm in diameter in the native lung (33) . Approximately 7,050 microbeads were packed into three layers, resulting in a roughly 546.4-\u03bcm-thick inverse opal structure. Such an inverse opal structure represented the miniature alveolar lung model that featured the sac-like pores and the interconnecting windows between the sacs, which resembles the native human counterpart in both architecture and dimensions, meaning that the two would also share the same unit surface area. The dimension of the overall 3D GelMA scaffold was 8 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 3 mm that comprised a layer of bulk GelMA base below the 546.4\u03bcm-thick inverse opal GelMA layer for improved stability. were first assembled into a cubic close-packed lattice (Left); a 7% (wt/wt) GelMA solution was then infiltrated into the void spaces of the lattice and crosslinked (Center). Finally, the alginate microbeads were selectively removed using EDTA, leaving behind an alveoli-like hydrogel structure (Right). (Scale bar: 100 \u03bcm.) A, ii, Right, Inset shows an scanning electron microscopy image of the interconnecting window between two adjacent sacs. (Scale bar: 20 \u03bcm; note the shrinkage of the sac size comparing to optical images was caused by the sample-drying process for scanning electron microscopy imaging.) (A, iii) It should be noted that, although the human alveoli are not necessarily homogeneous in size, in our model we pursued the use of only uniform alginate microbeads as the sacrificial templates to avoid unwanted interferences caused by the heterogeneity in the alveolar sizes. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that the use of porous scaffolds with uniform pores is experimentally superior to those with random pores even if the average pore size falls in the same range (20, 21) . In fact, we were also able to fabricate the 3D inverse opal GelMA structures with different yet uniform pore sizes using monodispersed alginate microbeads of different diameters. The microbeads with sizes of 325.9 \u00b1 10.5, 199.6 \u00b1 1.1, and 156.3 \u00b1 2.7 \u03bcm were used separately to fabricate 3D GelMA structures with corresponding pore sizes (SI Appendix, Fig. S11 ). Likewise, we could also fabricate a 3D GelMA structure with heterogeneous pore sizes by using randomly mixed microbeads with three diameters (\u223c200, \u223c250, and \u223c300 \u03bcm) as the template (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 ). The alginate microbeads could be rapidly removed by treating with the 0.01 M EDTA solution. The complete removal of the alginate microbeads from the scaffold was confirmed by both scanning electron microscopy imaging and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S13 . In particular, EDS mapping profiles suggested that while 1.3% of Ca 2+ was detected in the sample before removal of the microbeads, no Ca 2+ (0%) was measured at all after the removal. Thus, removal of both Ca 2+ and the alginate microbeads was complete.",

Fluorescence confocal images revealed that the hAECs were almost rounded and crowded at day 1 postseeding, where they were able to gradually spread and proliferate during the following days, eventually covering the full surface areas of the alveoli-like sacs ( Fig. 2 B , i and C and SI Appendix, Figs. S14 and S15). The viability of the hAECs on the surfaces of the pores in the porous GelMA structures was observed to exceed 95% (Fig. 2B) . The proliferation of the cells was steady during the first 10 d of culture and slightly slowed down afterward (Fig. 2 B, ii) , possibly due to the contact inhibition upon confluency of the cells on the surfaces of the pores. The cell viability, proliferation, and spreading at the different depths within a single layer of the sacs of the inverse opal structure are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S14 . Indeed, fluorescence confocal images suggested that these culture conditions resulted in the formation of a confluent alveolar epithelium (Fig. 2 , Movie S1, and SI Appendix, Figs. S14 and S15). Significantly, the hAECs were linked by a continuous presence of tight junctions as indicated by Zonula occludens (ZO)-1 staining (Fig. 2D ). Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining provided an overview of the structure of the GelMA hydrogel and the cell distributions, clearly validating the emulation of the alveoli-like, interconnected sacs and the continuous monolayer of hAECs on the pore surfaces (Fig. 2E ).",

To investigate the advantages of our 3D GelMA inverse opal structures in the recapitulation of the pulmonary alveoli, the behaviors of hAECs were carefully compared with those cultured on 2D GelMA surfaces. The morphologies of the hAECs were further studied by capturing scanning electron microscopy images (Fig. 3A ) of the cells cultured on both the 3D GelMA structures (Fig. 3 A, Upper) and the 2D GelMA surfaces (Fig. 3 A, Lower) at days 3, 7, and 14. Comparing with the slightly crowded and oftentimes locally aggregated hAECs on the 2D GelMA surfaces during the culture, the hAECs in the 3D GelMA structures appeared to be flatter, where the formation of a smooth, confluent epithelium by well-spread cells was apparent at day 14. The microscopic images of hAECs cultured on the 2D GelMA surfaces are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S16 . Moreover, the apparent proliferation rate of the hAECs in the 3D GelMA structures was significantly higher than that of the cells on the 2D surfaces (SI Appendix, Fig. S17 ). Nevertheless, when normalized (Fig. 3B) , there were no significant differences between the two configurations anymore during the culture period of 10 d. The hAECs in the 3D GelMA structures became higher in numbers than those on the 2D surfaces at day 14, most likely due to the presence of the larger total surface area within the 3D GelMA structure as compared with the 2D surface, at \u223c2 cm 2 in the former vs. 0.8 cm 2 for the latter despite that they share the same planar size of 8 \u00d7 10 mm. Most importantly, the 3D GelMA scaffolds provided an optimal geometry and microarchitecture for cell spreading and proliferation compared with the planar surfaces, which possibly promoted the cellular process such as adhesion, proliferation, and migration. These observations indicated that the 3D culture provided an optimal geometry for cell spreading and proliferation compared with the planar culture when both substrate materials were the same GelMA with similar local mechanical properties, both close to that of the normal human lung tissue (29) .",

Scatterplots and the Venn diagram (SI Appendix, Fig. S20 A  and B) were generated for the three comparisons (i.e., 3D GelMA vs. 2D PDMS, 3D GelMA vs. 2D GelMA, and 2D GelMA vs. 2D PDMS). We calculated the normalized expression values (fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads) of every gene analyzed in the three groups, and those values with greater than twofold increase or decrease with a false discovery rate of less than 0.05 (q value < 0.05) were considered as the differentially expressed genes.",

The genes associated with ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, and small-cell lung cancer in the clusters had a monotonically decreasing trend from 2D PDMS and 2D GelMA to 3D GelMA cultures, while oxidative phosphorylation in the cluster showed an increasing trend (SI Appendix, Fig. S20) . Similarly, biological processes regarding mitochondrial biogenesis also possessed an increasing trend in the order of 2D PDMS, 2D GelMA, and 3D GelMA cultures. Mitochondria provide the cells with adenosine triphosphate through the oxidative phosphorylation activity, and up-regulation of these pathways could provide more energy to help maintain the functionality of the cells (37, 38) . Specifically, heat maps were produced to compare differentially expressed genes involved in ECM-receptor interactions and the TNF signaling pathway. Integrin-\u03b24 (ITGB4), which is one of the transmembrane receptors for ECM proteins, can form a stable attachment to the basal membrane in polarized epithelial cells through the formation of hemidesmosomes (39) and also has a significant impact on signaling events that stimulate migration and invasion (40) . It was observed that the hAECs expressed more ITGB4 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in 2D conditions (both GelMA and PDMS) than in 3D GelMA (Fig. 3F) , possibly indicating a response to the more unnatural 2D microenvironments. Focal adhesions are key transducers of outside-in signaling that enable cells to sense cues from the ECM and generate forces (41) . In 2D cultures, especially for PDMS, up-regulation of focal adhesion genes and ECM-receptor interaction genes might be caused by the stiff and pathologically activated surfaces (41, 42) . Prior studies further reported that TNF-induced death signaling induced alveolar epithelial dysfunction in acute lung injury (43) and also, the increase of IL-6 expression in lungs with diffuse alveolar damage (44, 45) . Collectively, these analyses hinted that our 3D GelMA inverse opal structure provided better capabilities to maintain and promote the functions of hAECs in a more in vivolike manner compared with 2D models, particularly those based on the planar PDMS surfaces.",

Herein, we demonstrated the airflow in and out of the alveoli-like structure in our inverse opal alveolar lung model during a breathing cycle, as shown in the simulation results in SI Appendix, Fig. S22 A, C , and E as well as in Movie S2. During the \"breathing\" of the chip, the air gradually flowed into and then out of the inverse opal sacs spontaneously due to the volume change-induced pressure variation with velocity values and Reynolds numbers (0.71 to 1.70), which are very similar to those found in the real human alveoli. In addition, direction of the airflow changed according to the structural framework within the inverse opal alveolar lung model, especially in correspondence at the \"alveolus-alveolus\" interfaces. On the contrary, in the control 2D model, the airflow followed nonphysiological straighter paths without showing rapid changes of directions (SI Appendix, Fig. S22 B, D, and F) .",

To confirm the sufficient supply of nutrients within the top layer of the 3D GelMA inverse opal structure, we assessed the diffusion of both small molecules (FITC) as well as larger molecules (FITC-dextran, M w = 10 kDa). It was found that the diffusion of both types of molecules across the entire GelMA structure occurred within relatively short periods (SI Appendix, S23 ). Since the diffusion is a continuous process, this observation potentially suggested good transport of various components within the culture medium through the GelMA structure.",

Cigarette smoking is one of the major factors leading to the development of COPD, currently the third leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality worldwide (2, 49, 50) , as well as resulting in lung cancer as the most common lethal neoplasm (51) . Since the alveolar epithelium is the barrier between the inhaled air and the underlying components (52) , the establishment of a smoking alveolar lung-on-a-chip model to examine the distal lung injury and study the effects of smoking on the alveolar epithelium becomes important. While a smoking lung-on-a-chip platform was previously demonstrated using airway epithelial cells on a synthetic polyethylene terephthalate membrane (53) , no model currently exists for the distal lung (i.e., the alveoli). Our smoking alveolar lung-on-a-chip model consisted of a smoking device (53, 54) and an additional compartment on top of the breathing alveolar lung-on-a-chip platform to mimic the airwayalveoli transport route (Fig. 5A ). After smoking \u223c10 cigarettes and further culturing for 24 h, dead cells within our alveoli model showed an increase (Fig. 5B) , and the viability of hAECs was significantly decreased compared with normal breathing and control groups (Fig. 5C ). The apoptotic activities of the cells before and after the application of the cigarette smoke were analyzed via caspase-3/7 staining of hAECs on/in both 2D and 3D scaffolds (SI Appendix, Fig. S24 ). Consistent with the cultures without the chips ( Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig. S18 ), hAECs on 2D GelMA in the chip also showed a higher apoptotic tendency (SI Appendix, Fig.  S24A ) as compared with those in 3D GelMA structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S23B ). The smoking further resulted in the increase of apoptosis of hAECs in both configurations (SI Appendix, Fig.  S24 A-C). This observation was, in addition, reflected in cellular activity assay (SI Appendix, Fig. S24D ).",

Our results indicated an elevation in the intensity of nuclear 4-HNE staining postsmoking (Fig. 5E ), and such a high expression of 4-HNE may further induce downstream cellular damage. As a result, the soluble cytokine levels of IL-8, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1, and GM-CSF after smoking slightly declined compared with the normal breathing group, suggesting that the functions of hAECs to inhibit proinflammatory responses were compromised when they were exposed to cigarette smoke, consistent with literature (53) .",

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global public health crisis and is associated with high mortality, mostly caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (59, 60) . As the lungs are the first body organ affected by COVID-19, we further assessed the applicability of our alveolar lung-on-a-chip to investigate SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infection. In addition, the antiviral efficacies of two clinically approved antiviral drugs, remdesivir (61) and hydroxychloroquine (62) , as well as an antimalarial drug, amodiaquine (63), were evaluated. The latter has also been given to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (64). Since it has been well recognized that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cellular entry, prior to SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral particle (pCoV-VP) infection on the alveolar lung-on-a-chip, we first detected the expression of ACE2 receptors by hAECs grown on the surfaces of the alveolar sacs. The hAECs showed a higher level of expression of ACE2 receptors as shown in Fig. 5G and SI Appendix, Fig. S25A . The chips were then inoculated with pCoV-VPs at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 for 48 h to identify the virus susceptibility in vitro in the presence and absence of antiviral drugs. At 48 h postinfection, the infection of hAECs with mcherry-labeled pCoV-VPs was observed under a fluorescence microscope (SI Appendix, Fig. S25B) , and cytopathic effect of pCoV-VPs was assessed by live/dead assay (Fig. 5H and SI Appendix, Fig.  S25C ) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay (Fig. 5I) . The results showed that the cytopathic effects of pCoV-VPs were decreased by approximately 21.4, 30.0, and 11.3% at 5 \u03bcM amodiaquine, 10 \u03bcM remdesivir, and 40 \u03bcM hydroxychloroquine, respectively (Fig. 5I) . Thus, these drugs significantly inhibited the infectioninduced hAEC death by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viral particles expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in our alveolar lung-on-a-chip.",

We have successfully reconstructed some of the key aspects of the human pulmonary alveoli, including the microarchitecture, the ECM microenvironment, the ALI, and the mechanical breathing events. The alveolus in the lung is one of the most important structural determinants of the architecture of the respiratory parenchyma and lung functions. Our breathing alveolar lung-on-a-chip model could broadly reproduce the 3D anatomical structures and functions of the alveoli through the use of a precisely defined 3D porous GelMA hydrogel based on an inverse opal structure, while the breathing function was realized by situating the hAEC-populated GelMA structure in PDMS chip device. Based upon the breathing alveolar lung-on-chip model, we subsequently built a cigarette-smoking alveolar lung-on-a-chip platform, where the negative effects of smoking on the hAECs could be readily explored. We further demonstrated the applicability of our alveolar lung model for investigating SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infection and treatment efficacies of antiviral drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and amodiaquine. While remdesivir and amodiaquine have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 (64) , in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the discrepancies in antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 (62).",
