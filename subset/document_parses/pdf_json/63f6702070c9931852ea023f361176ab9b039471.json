In two experiments, we investigated whether students differentially regulate their use of self-testing for easy and difficult items and assessed the effectiveness of students' self-regulated choices. Undergraduate participants learned normatively easy and normatively difficult Lithuanian-English word pair translations. After an initial study trial, participants in the self-regulated learning groups chose whether they wanted to restudy an item, take a practice test, or remove an item from further practice. Participants chose to test items repeatedly while learning but dropped both easy and difficult items after reaching a criterion of about one correct recall per item. Consequently, final test performance 2 days later was lower for difficult items versus easy items, and performance was lower in the self-regulated learning group than in an experimenter-controlled comparison group (in Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we tested hypotheses for why participants reached a similar number of correct recalls for both easy and difficult items. Three new groups included different scaffolds aimed at minimizing potential barriers to effective regulation. These scaffolds did not change participants' learning choices, and as a result, performance on difficult items was still lower than on easy items. Importantly, participants planned to continue practicing items beyond one correct recall and believed that an optimal student should practice difficult items more than easy items, but they did not execute this plan during the learning task.",

In almost any class, the learning materials will vary in difficulty, meaning that students will need to learn some material that is easier than others and some material that is more difficult than others. How students regulate their learning for items of varying difficulty will have important implications for their subsequent retention of that information; in particular, difficult material will require more practice during learning to reach a similar level of retention, even if the same effective strategy is used. For example, retrieval practice is a powerful memory strategy in which the act of retrieving information from long-term memory enhances retention of that information. Retrieval practice is beneficial for both easy and difficult items (de Jonge & Tabbers, 2013; Karpicke, 2009 ), but difficult items require more retrieval practice during learning to obtain the same retention as easier-to-learn items (Vaughn et al., 2013) . When students are making their own selfregulated choices about what material to study and how much to study it, they may not differentially regulate their use of self-testing for easy and difficult items, which could have a detrimental impact on retention of difficult items.",

And how effective is students' use of self-testing for achieving long-term retention of both easy and difficult items? Below, we first briefly discuss research indicating what normatively effective use of self-testing would involve when learning easy and difficult items. This provides an example of what students could do to effectively regulate their learning of easy and difficult items. Next, we consider what students may do when regulating their learning of easy and difficult items through the lens of the agenda-based regulation framework (Dunlosky & Ariel, 2011) . This illustrates different ways that students may dysregulate and achieve suboptimal performance for difficult items, compared to easy items. We then review relevant research on self-regulated learning. We start this review by discussing the two previous investigations of students' use of self-testing for items of varying difficulty. However, these two studies alone are not enough to inform predictions for the current set of experiments, so we also broaden this review by discussing the most relevant aspects of the self-testing literature and the literature on students' restudy choices for easy and difficult items. Together, these studies are then used to inform our predictions about how students may choose to use self-testing in the current set of experiments.",

            "text": "One of the most effective ways to use retrieval practice is to continue practicing items until they are correctly recalled multiple times during learning (Pyc & Rawson, 2009 ). This method of practicing items to a certain number of correct recalls is known as criterion learning, in which items are presented for practice tests until they have reached their predetermined criterion level (i.e., the number of times an item needs to be correctly recalled during practice before it is removed from the list of learning materials). However, if easy and difficult items are practiced to the same criterion level, performance on a memory test will be lower for the difficult items than for the easy items. For example, Vaughn et al. (2013) had students learn Lithuanian-English word pair translations that were normatively easy and normatively difficult. These easy and difficult items were assigned to one of six criterion levels (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 correct recalls during practice). Equating the criterion (number of correct recalls) for easy and difficult items was not enough to equate performance on a delayed cued recall test (e.g., performance in the Criterion 1 condition was 33% for easy items versus 18% for difficult items). Instead, the difficult items needed to be practiced to a higher criterion before final memory performance was similar to easy items (e.g., 58% for difficult items at Criterion 5, 61% for easy items at Criterion 3). This experiment provides an example of what students could do to effectively regulate their learning for items of varying difficulty: if students reach a higher criterion for difficult items compared to easy items, then they could perform equally well on both difficult and easy items on a final test.",

            "text": "When students are regulating their own learning, they have many choices to make, and they may not choose to implement a learning plan like the one outlined above. A theoretical framework of self-regulated learning is useful to consider the regulatory choices that learners may make. According to the agenda-based regulation framework (Dunlosky & Ariel, 2011) , self-regulated learning is goal oriented and involves reducing a discrepancy between a perceived state and a goal state (this assumption is key to other frameworks as well, e.g., Winne & Hadwin, 1998) . Learners set goals and then develop agendas (or plans) to work toward this goal state. These agendas guide various decisions that the learner makes, including which items to select for learning, which learning strategies to use, and how much time to allocate. Agendas play an important role in students' learning and can explain when regulation is optimal (e.g., when a learner develops an effective agenda and sticks to this agenda throughout learning) and when regulation is suboptimal (e.g., when the agenda constructed was suboptimal, the execution of an agenda was suboptimal, or the learner had a low learning goal). When executing agendas, learners can monitor and evaluate whether their goals have been met. If their goal has not been met, they can decide to continue engaging with an item, change the learning strategy they are using, or change their learning goal.",

This task gives students several options, and there are many ways students could dysregulate and achieve suboptimal memory performance. For example, students may enter this task with a learning goal (e.g., goal state) that involves learning only the easy items and tolerating lower performance for the difficult items. Alternatively, students may have the goal to perform well on all items but may not realize that difficult items will need more practice than easy items to achieve this goal. Thus, they may plan to make similar learning choices for all items, which would result in lower retention of difficult items compared to easy items. Alternatively, students could plan to practice the difficult items more but may execute this agenda ineffectively and treat items similarly during learning, which would also result in lower retention of difficult items compared to easy items. As illustrated by the agenda-based regulation framework, several possible patterns of self-regulated behavior may emerge when engaging in self-testing for easy and difficult items.

For example, the few other behavioral studies that examined self-regulated use of retrieval practice did not include item difficulty, but the outcomes still shed light on what students choose to do when they can make more than one learning choice per item. When allowed to make multiple learning choices, participants typically choose to test themselves on most items and engage in several test trials per item, but they stop after about one correct retrieval (Ariel & Karpicke, 2018; Dunlosky & Rawson, 2015; Karpicke, 2009; Kornell & Bjork, 2008) . These results come from college students' choices for items of similar difficulty, but this pattern may hold for both easy and difficult items.

Students typically choose to restudy difficult items more often and spend more time restudying difficult items than easy items (Son & Metcalfe, 2000) . These results come from students' restudy choices for easy items and difficult items, but this pattern may hold for test choices. Accordingly, when students can choose to restudy items and/or to test items, they may engage in more restudying and more testing for difficult items. This possibility may seem contradictory to the expectation that students will reach a criterion of one for both easy and difficult items, but these two expectations are complementary. Difficult items may require more restudy trials and more test trials before being correctly recalled for the first time. Thus, a student could engage in a higher number of restudy trials and test trials for difficult items and still reach the same criterion as easy items.",

However, they reached a similar criterion level for both easy and difficult items, t(43) = .62, p = .54, d = .09. Thus, participants differentially regulated in terms of choosing more test trials for difficult items, but they did not continue testing difficult items until they achieved multiple correct recalls per item. Instead, participants dropped items after about one correct recall regardless of item difficulty. Concerning the effectiveness of students' use of self-testing, these learning choices led to lower performance on the delayed cued recall test for difficult items compared to easy items (27% versus 52%, as shown in Figure 3 ), t(43) = 9.62, p < .001, d = 1.53.

Practice time includes time spent on initial study trials, restudy trials, and test trials. It does not include time spent on judgment and decision tasks (EOLs, JOLs, or decisions in the SRL group). Table 2 reports the mean practice time for easy and difficult items in the SRL and criterion groups (reported as seconds per item). Consistent with the broader literature on learning choices for easy and difficult items (e.g., Son & Metcalfe, 2000) , participants in the SRL group spent more time practicing the difficult items compared to the easy items (p < .001, d = 1.14). Additionally, participants in the SRL group spent less time per item than participants in the criterion group spent on criterion 3 and 5 items (ps < .001, ds > .76). Consider these outcomes in relation to the corresponding boost in performance associated with reaching a higher criterion for difficult items. For example, the additional test trials associated with reaching criterion 5 for difficult items took about 28 s more per item and were associated with a 40 percentage point increase in delayed cued recall performance, compared to participants in the SRL group.

            "text": "In Experiment 1, participants in the SRL group did not adjust the criterion they reached for easy versus difficult items. The agenda-based regulation framework described earlier motivated four explanations for why students may not effectively regulate their learning. Experiment 2 aimed to test each of these hypotheses with the addition of three new self-regulated groups. The first new group builds upon the SRL group from Experiment 1 by adding item difficulty labels to each item. This labels group evaluates the hypothesis that participants did not know which items were normatively easy and which items were difficult. Exploratory outcomes from Experiment 1 weigh against this possibility, but the labels group afforded more direct evaluation of the hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, participants in the labels group will achieve a higher criterion for difficult items than for easy items. The second new group builds upon the labels group by also providing participants with a specific goal to learn items well enough to achieve at least 70% correct for the easy items and 70% correct for the difficult items on the delayed memory test. This goal group evaluates the hypothesis that participants did not have the same learning goal for easy and difficult items and were fine with lower performance on the difficult items. This hypothesis predicts that the goal instructions combined with the item difficulty labels will help participants in the goal group achieve a higher criterion for difficult items than for easy items. The third new group adds to the goal group by also asking participants questions regarding how they will achieve this goal for easy and difficult items, including how many times they think they should correctly recall the items before removing them from practice. This plan group evaluates the hypothesis that participants think the difficult items do not need to be practiced beyond one correct recall during learning. The prediction here is that students will plan to correctly recall the difficult items about one time. If we disconfirm this hypothesis and find that participants report that difficult items should be practiced beyond one correct recall, then the plan group will allow us to evaluate whether participants implement their plan during the learning task. Thus, this plan group can also evaluate the hypothesis that participants do not fully implement their plan during learning. In particular, a prediction here is that students will achieve a lower criterion than they planned to reach for the difficult items. The hypotheses, procedures, and data analysis plan for this experiment were preregistered on the Open Science Framework (https:// osf. io/ b3j2n/).",

First, did participants reach a similar criterion because they could not discriminate between easy and difficult items? Outcomes from the labels group indicate the answer is no. Despite explicitly labeling each item as easy or difficult, participants in the labels group still reached a similar criterion level for easy and difficult items (left panel of Figure 4 ) and still had lower final cued recall performance for the difficult items compared to easy items ( Figure 5 ). Compared to the basic group, these item difficulty labels did not lead to changes in the criterion reached or in final cued recall performance. (The full ANOVAs for these comparisons and other analyses below are presented in Table 4 .) Because these two groups did not differ on either of the primary variables of interest, they are functionally equivalent and will be collapsed for the following analyses. Second, did participants reach a similar criterion because they did not start with the same learning goal for easy and difficult items? Outcomes from the goal group indicate the answer is no. Participants in the goal group were given the same item difficulty labels as the labels group; additionally, they were given a specific learning goal to achieve the same level of retention (70%) on the final test for both easy and difficult items. However, they still reached a similar criterion for easy and difficult items (left panel of Figure 4 ). This criterion level was also similar to the criterion achieved by participants in the combined basic/labels group (Table 4 ). Because participants in the goal group did not adjust criterion based on item difficulty, their final cued recall performance was lower for difficult versus easy items ( Figure 5) and was similar to performance in the combined basic/labels group (Table 4 ). Given that Group * item difficulty 1, 137 < 1 these groups did not differ on either of the two variables of primary interest, we collapsed them for the final ANOVAs reported below. Next, did participants reach a similar criterion for easy and difficult items because they started the task with an ineffective learning plan? Outcomes from the plan group suggest the answer is no. Participants in the plan group received item difficulty labels and the same learning goal as the goals group; additionally, they answered questions about what an optimal student should do to reach the learning goal and what they plan to do in the current learning task. In the right panel of Figure 4 , the first set of bars shows that participants had a good idea of what would be an optimal criterion for easy and difficult items. Participants indicated that an optimal student should reach a higher criterion for difficult items than for easy items, t(34) = 2.57, p = .02, d = .43. Additionally, participants thought an optimal student should reach a criterion of about 5 for the difficult items. Results from the criterion group in Experiment 1 suggest this is what participants should do to correctly answer 70% of the difficult items on the final cued recall test. Thus, participants started out with a good idea of what would be an optimal plan.",

Consistent with Experiment 1, and the broader literature on learning choices for easy and difficult items, participants in all groups spent more time practicing the difficult items compared to the easy items (ps < .01, ds > .40). Additionally, participants in all four groups spent a similar amount of time practicing difficult items (ps > .25).

The current project is the first to examine students' self-testing choices for normatively easy-to-learn and difficult-to-learn items when students could test or restudy items as many times as they would like. Across two experiments, we investigated two main research questions: Will students differentially regulate their use of self-testing for easy and difficult items? And how effective is students' use of selftesting for achieving long-term retention of both easy and difficult items?

These extension groups included different scaffolds that were aimed at minimizing potential barriers to effective regulation. For instance, if students had problems judging item difficulty or did not develop an explicit goal to perform well on the difficult items, then providing item difficulty labels or giving students an appropriate learning goal was expected to increase the criterion achieved for difficult items. In contrast to expectations, these scaffolds were not successful in encouraging students to reach a higher criterion for the difficult items. However, results from the plan group indicated that when participants were given item difficulty labels, a specific learning goal, and asked to create a plan for achieving this goal, participants started with an effective plan to practice items until they were correctly recalled multiple times, but they did not execute this plan during the learning task.",

            "text": "This finding may be surprising, particularly because Ariel and Karpicke (2018) found that informing participants of the benefits of testing items until they are correctly recalled three times was effective at getting participants to reach this suggested criterion. Why might these participants have effectively implemented the plan that was suggested to them, whereas participants in the current plan group did not effectively implement a plan they created on their own? Methodological differences may have contributed to this difference in findings. First, in the current experiments, participants made their next learning choice immediately after completing a trial for an item. Imagine a participant who just retrieved a correct answer on a practice test trial-when participants are making their next learning choice immediately after this correct retrieval, they may be overconfident in their current level of knowledge and decide to drop the item after this first correct recall. In contrast, Ariel and Karpicke (2018) had participants make learning choices in choice blocks in which participants saw all the remaining items and selected which items to test again, restudy, or drop. If a participant tested an item and recalled the correct answer, there would be a delay before making another learning choice for that item, caused by cycling through the remaining items before reaching the next choice block. After this delay, participants may be less confident in their memory of an item and realize they could benefit from more test trials. Although this is speculative, it could be evaluated in future research. This difference in the timing of choices also represents another difference in how students made their learning choices. In the current experiments, participants made their learning choices for each item individually in a sequential format, but Ariel and Karpicke (2018) had participants make their learning choices for all items at the same time in a simultaneous format. Executing a study plan can be more difficult using a sequential format compared to simultaneous format (Ariel et al., 2009; Dunlosky & Thiede, 2004; Middlebrooks & Castel, 2018) , which could be another contributing factor to why participants in the current experiment's plan group failed to properly execute the plan they created. Additionally, in the current Experiment 2, participants were learning all 40 items in one block. Learning 40 items at one time could make it difficult to track the criterion that has been reached for each item. Thus, even though participants planned to continue testing items until they reached three correct recalls, it may have been difficult for them to track their progress. In contrast, Ariel and Karpicke (2018) used blocks of 20 items. With these smaller blocks of items, it may be easier to mentally track the number of correct recalls, which likely contributed to their participants' success in executing the suggested plan.",

Participants may have been aware that testing would have a direct effect on their learning, but after starting the learning task, they may have used testing for a different purpose. In particular, students report using tests to monitor whether they have learned items and not because testing itself has a direct effect on learning; that is, they use testing as a monitoring tool instead of a learning tool (for a review of the accumulating evidence consistent with this hypothesis, see Rivers, 2020) . If students' prepotent bias is to use testing as a monitoring tool, they presumably would use a practice test to evaluate whether they knew an item well enough to pass the final test. If the student answers the practice test trial correctly, it would be evidence that they had learned the item well enough and hence they would then remove that item from further practice. In the present case for participants in the plan group, they may have planned to reach a high criterion, but when they were engaged with the learning task, their prepotent bias to use testing as a monitoring tool may have overridden their initial plan (for a demonstration of prepotent biases overriding effective learning plans, see Dunlosky & Thiede, 2004) .",

(2018) stated, \"Across five experiments, learners selectively utilized testing for easier items and reserved restudying for the more difficult items\" (p. 550). The different conclusions may arise from a methodological difference between the current project and the prior studies. In the current project, participants in the SRL groups could choose as many additional learning trials as they wanted, whereas students in both prior studies could choose only one additional learning trial per item. On the initial trial, participants may choose to restudy difficult items, but when given the opportunity to continue engaging with an item across multiple trials, they may eventually test themselves more often on the difficult items. However, if participants are only allowed to engage with an item one time, this shift to testing difficult items would not be captured.",
