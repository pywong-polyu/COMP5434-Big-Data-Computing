The regional endeavors summarized population-based evidence, yet they conducted study-level meta-analyses in which the original studies could have followed different laboratory methods, and they did not study all countries in the region. Therefore, comparability across studies could be limited and evidence lacks for many countries. Finding a method to estimate sodium/salt consumption in national samples leveraging on available data is needed to update and complement the existing evidence. 7-10 However, quantifying sodium/salt intake based on 24-hour urine samples is costly and burdensome, limiting its use in population-based studies or national health surveys. As an alternative, equations have been developed to estimate sodium/salt intake based on spot urine (SU) samples. 11-14 However, these equations have been used in few WHO STEPS and other national health surveys, 15 leaving several countries without data to quantify the local sodium/salt consumption because they do not have access to SU samples. 16 If we could (accurately) estimate sodium/salt intake based on variables that are routinely available in national health surveys (e.g., weight or blood pressure), mean sodium/salt intake in countries 6 kg/m 2 ) or with implausible weight (outside the range 12-300 kg) or height records (outside the range 1.00-2.50 m). Participants with SBP outside the range 70-270 mmHg were discarded, and so were participants with DBP outside the range 30-150 mmHg. We excluded records with SU creatinine <1.8 or >32.7 mmol/L for males and <1.8 or >28.3 for females. 17, 18 In addition, we excluded participants with estimated salt intake (using the 4 equations) above or below three standard deviations from the equation-specific mean (Supplementary Figure 1) . 19 After completing data preparation, observations were randomly assigned from the pooled dataset (100%) into three datasets for the ML analysis: training data (50%), test data (30%) and validation data (20%).",

First, urine data was based on a spot sample, which is not the gold standard (24-hour urine sample) to measure daily salt consumption. Future work should verify and advance our results using on 24hour urine samples available in nationally representative samples; in the meantime, our work has led the foundations and hopefully sparked interest to use available data and novel analytical techniques to deliver estimates of salt consumption in the general population.

A larger and global work in which all relevant data sources are pooled is needed; while this endeavour takes place, our work has provided recent estimates of salt consumption at the population level in 49 LMICs. In this line, there are still countries which were not herein included. Researchers in these countries, along with local (e.g., ministries of health) and international health authorities (e.g., WHO), should conduct studies/surveys to collect data on salt consumption. This would inform global targets but also local needs and interventions. Conclusions A ML model based on readily available variables was accurate to predict daily salt consumption. This ML model applied to 49 national surveys with no urine samples to compute daily salt consumption, revealed high levels of salt intake particularly in the Western Pacific region. Pending further validation, this ML model could be used to keep track of the overall sodium consumption where resources are not available to conduct national surveys with urine samples.",
