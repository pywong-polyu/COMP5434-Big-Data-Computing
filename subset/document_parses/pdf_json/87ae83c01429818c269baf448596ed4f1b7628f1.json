Although current data is lacking, some research suggests that principals have a stressful work situation that eventually may lead to burnout and exhaustion disorder, thus negatively affecting the ability of principals to function as leaders. To gauge the situation in Sweden, and as a basis for future preventive actions, we examined to what extent principals displayed signs of exhaustion and whether the prevalence rates of exhaustion differed across school levels, length of work experience as a principal, and gender. Methods: Principals (N = 2219; mean age 49 years [SD 7 years]; 78% women) working at least 50% in pre-schools, compulsory schools, upper secondary schools or adult education completed a cross-sectional web survey entailing two validated inventories: The Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale (KEDS) and the Lund University Checklist for Incipient Exhaustion (LUCIE). Data was analysed using traditional non-parametric methods. Gender stratification achieved covariate balance when analysing school level and length of work experience.",

Compared with male principals, female principals reported more signs of possible exhaustion disorder in both LUCIE and KEDS. School level was not associated with reports of exhaustion symptoms in neither LUCIE nor KEDS. Among male principals, length of work experience was associated with exhaustion symptoms in KEDS.",

In addition, overstressed principals may contribute to secondary effects by discontinuing their job or negatively influencing the health and wellbeing of staff and students via sub-optimal leadership (e.g., hasty decision-making, lack of strategic planning, limited access to support, etc.). For example, teachers who report experiencing poor leadership tend to report higher burnout scores [2] .

            "text": "The importance of monitoring a broad range of psychosocial hazards at work (e.g., violence, harassment, work-life balance, and work-related stress) has been recognized [31] . And the potential consequences of poorly managed psychosocial hazards such as poor mental health and psychiatric disorders attributed to stressful work conditions is not only a concern for principals. It is also a lasting public health concern in many countries [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . And in response to this concern, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW) adopted the diagnosis of exhaustion disorder (ED) in 2005 [27, 37] . Incorporated within the diagnostic entity F43 \"Reactions to severe stress and adjustments disorders\" and ICD-10 code F43.8 \"Other reactions to severe stress\" [37] , ED was designated F43.8A. In contrast to burnout, which focuses on various psychological manifestations of exhaustion (e.g., exhaustion, cynicism and decreased professional efficacy) [26] , ED emphasises the physiological aspects that are associated with the excessive and often paralyzing feelings of tiredness, which is a core symptom in both burnout and ED [38, 39] . In contrast to the ED diagnosis, the burnout diagnosis (Z73.0) carries a lower weight in that it is placed in the ICD-10 category \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" [37] . Observably, this lower diagnostic weight appears to be retained in the forthcoming ICD-11 [40] . However, in ICD-11, the conceptualisation of burnout (QD85) has been improved and clarified. And it is now explained that burnout is a result from chronic workplace stress and a phenomena that is constrained to the occupational context and distinct from adjustment disorder (6B43) [40] .",

Presumably, ED is the result of insufficient rest and recovery from very frequent, or excessively long-lasting, stress responses [27, [41] [42] [43] . From this perspective, it should be noted that about 70% of the principals in Sweden are women [44] . And it is known that men and women who perform similar work display similar physiological stress responses [45] and tend to develop similar types of health issues [46] . Accordingly, male and female principals who perform similar work should develop similar health problems. However, on average, women are also known to report more numerous, intense, and frequent bodily symptoms than men [47] , and to be more long-term sick-listed than men. This includes sick-listing for psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., depression, anxiety and/or ED), which, since 2014, have been the most common cause of sicklisting in Sweden [48, 49] .",

Consequently, knowledge about principals' health status is important when it comes to the planning and prioritising of any action that aim to protect principals' health and/ or to avoid unwanted secondary effects. In the absence of current Swedish and internationally comparable data on principals' mental health status, the present study aimed to gauge the occurrence of early and manifest signs of exhaustion among Swedish principals. Accordingly, the first aim was to examine to what extent principals reported early signs of exhaustion as well as manifest signs of exhaustion in two validated exhaustion inventories (i.e., LUCIE and KEDS). Secondly, the aim was to examine whether the prevalence rates of exhaustion symptoms differed across various school levels (i.e., pre-school, compulsory school, upper secondary school and adult education), length of work experience as a principal, and gender. Since signs of exhaustion can be assumed to be sensitive indicators of emerging health problems, knowledge of their occurrence and distribution provides a needed basis for decisions on future preventive actions aimed to improve principals' mental health.",

Each item is responded to on a 7point scale (0-6). Short descriptive verbal phrases serve as anchors for the scale steps 0, 2, 4 and 6, but not for 1, 3 and 5. Higher values reflect more severe symptoms, and the sum score (0 to 54) is used as an outcome, with a score \u2265 19 indicating possible ED [51, 57] . The Lund University Checklist for Incipient Exhaustion (LUCIE) comprises 28 items (statements) that refer to the past 4 weeks and which cover the following six domains: (a) sleep and recovery (3 items), (b) separation between work and spare time (4 items), (c) sense of community and support in the workplace (2 items), (d) managing work duties and personal capabilities (5 items), (e) private life and spare time activities (3 items) , and (f) health complaints (11 items) [52, 53, 58] . The items are responded to on a 4-point scale: 1 = not at all, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 = very much. For a detailed description of the scoring, see Persson et al. [53] . In brief, the scoring builds on two supplementary algorithms comprising two separate but supplementary scales: the Stress Warning Scale (SWS) and the Exhaustion Warning Scale (EWS). Specifically, the SWS is sensitive to milder signs of incipient exhaustion, whereas the EWS reflects more severe signs of exhaustion. The main difference between the two scales concerns the intensity of the replies. The EWS score is primarily based on replies at the highest level of the 4-point response scale (i.e., 'very much'). In contrast, the SWS score also includes replies on the adjacent lower level (i.e., 'quite a bit'). In practice, these two scales are combined into a The question read -\"How often, during the last 12-months, have you consumed alcohol to the extent that you have been intoxicated (drunk)? No test of equality for column proportions for the first category \"Daily almost daily\" due to too few participants e Inactive = almost completely inactive (e.g., primarily reading, watching television, watching movies, using computers or doing other sedentary activities). Light = light physical activity for at least 4 h/week (e.g., riding a bicycle or walking to work, walking with the family, gardening, fishing, table tennis, bowling etc.). Medium = performing regular physical activity and training for at least 2-3 h/week (e.g., spending time doing heavy gardening, running, swimming, playing tennis, badminton, calisthenics and similar activities). Heavy = engaging in regular hard physical training for competitive sports several times per week (e.g. spending time running, orienteering, skiing, swimming, playing football, handball etc.) f The question read -\"Do you wish to reduce your alcohol consumption\" four-step ranking of incremental stress symptomatology, with the highest level possibly being indicative of ED:",

The target level of 2000 participants was based on the knowledge that circa 10 and 5% in a highly educated part of the general population can be expected to display signs of exhaustion in KEDS and LUCIE, respectively [53] . Hence, this level was judged to give sufficient statistical power and to allow relevant subgroup comparisons. Because LUCIE scores are on a classificatory scale (or on an ordinal scale of increasing frequency of signs of exhaustion), and because comparisons had to be made across groups of different sizes, the data were analysed with traditional methods for non-parametric statistics. Confidence intervals (95%) for prevalence rates were constructed with a bootstrap procedure. For nominal or categorical data, between-group comparisons were made using Pearson's independent chi-square test and pairwise follow-up tests with a Bonferroni-adjusted z-test for column proportions. Preliminary analyses indicated that the level of exhaustion signs in both KEDS and LUCIE did not differ across job title (i.e., principal, assistant principal, and \"other\" titles signifying equivalent responsibilities as being a principal or assistant principal). The participants were therefore treated as one group (i.e., principals) in the statistical analyses. Preliminary analyses also identified an uneven distribution of men and women across the categories of length of work experience and school level. To avoid bias due to gender, gender-stratified analyses were applied when appropriate. Age scores were typically unrelated to the other variables, except for a positive correlation with length of work experience. Because this dependency was expected, and presumably part of the causal chain, we did not conduct age-stratified analyses. However, due to the small number of responses in the most extreme categories on the work experience item, the outermost response categories were merged with adjacent categories. This created a four-step ordinal scale of increasing years of work experience as a principal: 0 to 3 years, > 3 to 5 years, > 5 to 10 years, and > 10 years.",

Furthermore, a comparison between the group of principals who met the exhaustion criteria in KEDS (i.e., a score \u2265 19) and 698 care-seeking patients with diverse occupational backgrounds [57] also reveal that the principals expressed a noticeable level of exhaustion complaints. While the principals had a lower mean KEDS sum score than the care-seeking patients who received \"stress-related diagnoses (i.e., F43)\", they scored almost on par with the care-seeking patients who received \"psychiatric diagnoses other than stress (i.e., F [except F43] + Z56)\" and clearly higher than care-seeking patients who received \"somatic diagnoses (other codes than Fcodes and Z56)\" [57] . Moreover, when comparing the principals who met the exhaustion criteria in KEDS and a group of 390 Swedish patients undergoing a 24-week multimodal treatment for their diagnosed and pronounced manifestations of stress-related exhaustion [63] , the principals scored substantially lower on KEDS than the patient group did immediately before their treatment. However, compared with the patients post assessment and follow-up scores 12 month later, the principals who met the exhaustion criteria in KEDS scored at a similar level as the patient group on both occasions at which the patients' average scores remained above the level for exhaustion indication in KEDS [63] .",

This observation aligns with the few previous studies that have contained validated and specific scales for mental health [8, 20, 23] . Comparison across studies should, however, be made with caution due to differences in study sample compositions, the instruments used, the year data was collected, and variations across countries that are contingent on variations in the educational system. In addition, due to the differences in questionnaire design, layout, scoring procedures and the period the questions refer to; caution should be exercised when comparing LUCIE and KEDS scores. For example, the 28-item LUCIE covers the spectra from the earliest signs of exhaustion to heavy signs possibly indicative of ED by asking for the occurrence and severity of various symptoms in six domains the last 4 weeks [53] . In contrast, the 9-item KEDS focus on assessing symptoms of exhaustion disorder and comprises nine domains during the last 2 weeks [51] . And in a previous study, we observed a low agreement between LUCIE and KEDS classifications of exhaustion [53] . On the other hand, LUCIE and KEDS scores are positively correlated to each other and to the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire [64] , which suggest that these instruments share common ground [53, 54] .",

            "text": "Nevertheless, female principals reported more signs of exhaustion than their male colleagues in both LUCIE (11% vs. 6%, respectively) and KEDS (31% vs. 24%, respectively). This aligns with the fact that women compared with men tend to report more intense, numerous and frequent bodily symptoms [47] , and have higher prevalence rates of symptoms of depression and depression diagnoses, in which exhaustion is a core symptom [65] . Observably, many explanations have been proposed as contributing factors. Examples are biological differences, The rare LUCIE combination of SWS yellow + UWS red (n = 10) are included in this category variations in symptom appraisal and symptom perception, socialisation and social roles, abuse and trauma, and gender bias in research etc. [47, 66] . Nonetheless, that female principals report more exhaustion symptoms than male principals align with previous studies in which gender differences in both LUCIE [52] and KEDS [53] have been reported. However, gender differences have not always consistently been observed in LUCIE [53] or KEDS [57] . It is unclear why female principals in the present study report more exhaustion symptoms than their male colleagues. In light of the background questions, a differential exposure to non-work related stress, a lack of access to social support in the private life, or lifestyle differences (i.e., frequency of alcohol intoxication, smoking, and leisure-time physical activity) appear as unlikely explanations for this gender difference. Indeed, female and male principals reported similar levels of exposure to non-workrelated stress. And while female principals reported cohabiting to a slightly lesser extent, they did report a greater access to social support in their private life. While female principals reported being less physically active during their leisure time than male principals, they reported similar levels of smoking and being intoxicated by alcohol more seldomly than their male counterparts. The significance of any gender difference in lifestyle behaviours is, however, obscured by the fact that the principals' lifestyle habits in general suggest that they are ostensibly as healthy as, or healthier, than the general population in Sweden [67] . For example, that only 5% of the principals reported being daily or occasional smokers, and that 12% reported having sedentary leisure time, are more favourable than the national estimates of 14% (2018) and 16% (2015) for the population in the ages 45 to 64, respectively [67] . That fewer principals smoke than in the general population agrees with their relatively high socioeconomic status [68] and with a previous observation in an Australian study [14] . Interestingly, no differences were found in relation to school level. This contrast with previous observations from United Kingdom in a male-dominated study sample [23] . In this large-scale study, the level of mental ill health (as assessed by the Crown Crisp Experiential Index) was inversely related to school level. Accordingly, the highest level of mental ill health was found in primary schools followed by secondary schools and further/ higher education institutions [23] . More recent studies have either kept school level constant [7] or have not included school level as a factor in the statistical analyses [8] . However, for the reasons previously outlined above, comparison across studies should be made with caution.",

However, given that length of work experience as a principal was correlated with the participants' chronological age, it is plausible that \"third-variable\" factors confound the analysis. For example, in an Australian study, it was observed that older principals reported lower levels of stress and burnout than younger principals, whereas work experience did little to protect against the reporting of adverse psychosocial factors [8] . Anyhow, the absence of clear associations with school level and length of work experience may indicate that these two higher-order constructs either have a low explanatory power for principals' mental health or that they are just too crude as analytical units.",

Similarly, the use of two validated exhaustion inventories increases the accessibility of the results. And the large sample size contributes high power to the statistical analyses and thus provides good possibilities for detecting relevant associations. However, since it was not possible to use a randomized selection procedure that considered regional variations, we had to recruit the participants via a non-random procedure. Accordingly, the representativeness of subunits (e.g. counties or municipalities) could not be ensured. Therefore, we did not consider it meaningful to weigh the estimates, or in other ways control, for geographical origin.

And a larger proportion of women than men met the exhaustion criteria in KEDS and reported possible exhaustion disorder in LUCIE. Thus, a large group of Swedish principals working in pre-schools, compulsory schools, upper secondary schools or adult education displayed a symptomatology of signs of exhaustion that, if sustained, might lead to poor health. The scope and seriousness of complaints suggest that education authorities, or other relevant stakeholders, ought to take some form of preventive actions. However, effective combinations of individual, group, organisational and/or societal preventive activities remain to be identified and tested. ",
