Sensors allow data quantification for use in decision making or even to predict the clinical evolution of a given treatment, such as in rehabilitation therapies to restore patients' motor and cognitive functions. This paper presents the Biomechanics Sensor Node (BSN), composed of an inertial measurement unit (IMU), developed to infer input information and control virtual environments. We also present a software solution, which integrates the BSN data with Unity Editor, one of the most used game engine nowadays. This asset allows Unity-developed virtual reality applications to use BSN a secure interaction device. Thus, during rehabilitation sessions, the patient receives visual stimuli from the virtual environment, controlled by the BSN device, while the therapist has access to the information about the movements performed in the therapy.",

Such devices are still quite limited in terms of user freedom, precision, and complexity of movement control. These restrictions give rise to a scenario favorable to the creation of new solutions that aim to optimize the immersion of the user. Other examples of devices are the wearable sensors fixed in different parts of the user's body, which can capture patterns of movement. A problem with this sort of device is that they present excessive battery consumption, requiring continuous recharging, which can become a negative point in the user experience. Low energy technologies have been developed to mitigate this problem, resulting in so-called low energy devices.",

Among vascular diseases, stroke represents the leading cause of long-term disability. The increasing proportion of survivors from this disease is associated with an increase in patients who persist with neurological deficit. Indeed, more than half of the survivors remain with a severe disability affecting functional independence in daily life activities [17, 24] .",

            "text": "Every VR interface must be composed of immersion and interaction devices. Regarding interaction devices, we can highlight the use of inertial devices as a means of body tracking, which is not new, but still lacks specific solutions for healthcare. Foxlin [11] , a few years ago, came up with a walking tracking solution called NavShoe. The solution consisted of an inertial sensor attached to the shoelace of one of the user's feet, connected to a PDA (wireless). Tregillus and Folmer [29] presented a walking solution in VE using the smartphone's sensors. Wittman et al. [35] studied the feasibility of an unsupervised arm therapy for self-directed rehabilitation therapy in patients' homes using an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based VR system (ArmeoSenso) in their homes for six weeks. These solutions have been using inertial sensors for tracking virtual environments. However, in most of them, the prototypes are focused on one group of members (upper or lower).",

Thus, to consult the information present in the armband, the Characteristic UUID must be equal to the information UUID that one wishes to obtain. Algorithm 4 presents the ReceiveSteps function. The step data are obtained using the Characteristic UUID equivalent to the step information. The result of the ReceiveSteps function is a set of bytes, converted to the uint16 t format an unsigned integer of 16 bits size. With the bytes duly converted, we have the number of steps counted by the BSN. The registration function results in a set of bytes that contains the components W, X, Y, and Z of the quaternion vector. Thus, the byte set is converted to an int32 t data pattern to obtain the actual data of the four components. Finally, the function groups all the components and returns Q, the quaternion vector obtained from the BSN. We create the ReceiveRawData function, to obtain the raw data of the BSN device. Algorithm 6 presents the use of the Characteristic UUID equivalent to the data information sensor. Thus, we convert the resulting bytes (that contains the X, Y, and Z components of the accelerometer, gyroscope and compass sensors) to the int16 t standard data, the default used by the BSN for this data set. Finally, the function groups the elements of each sensor into an R vector, returning a composite list of the vectors of each sensor.
