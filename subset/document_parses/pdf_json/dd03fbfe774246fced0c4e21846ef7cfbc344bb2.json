In Australia COVID-19 vaccine rollout began in February 2021 and is underway at the time of writing. During the rollout, testing for COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat) continues to be another important management strategy. Testing and subsequent contact tracing of positive cases provides essential data about where, when, and how the virus is spreading, and informs decisions about how to contain outbreaks (e.g. through short-term localised restriction of movement).",

Australia has taken a state-based and phased approach to rollout, with eligibility focusing initially on frontline healthcare workers, older people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and people with specified preexisting underlying medical conditions (Australian Government Department of Health, 2020) . Two vaccines were available at the time of the study: Pfizer (Comirnaty) and AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria), although the supply of Pfizer was much more limited. Though both are widely used and accepted internationally in countries such as the UK, the AstraZeneca vaccine has drawn media attention due to a very small increased risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (a side effect that can have serious consequences), and reports of poorer vaccine effectiveness compared to Pfizer (Picheta, 2021) . This, coupled with the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI)'s changing advice about Pfizer as the 'preferred vaccine' for certain age groups likely reduced community willingness to get the AstraZeneca vaccine in the first half of 2021, which slowed the rollout because it was the only option available to many community members at that time (Leask et al., 2021) .",

Three quarters of participants (77%) reported that they would get tested for COVID-19 if they experienced symptoms, 'no matter what,' though this proportion varied significantly across language groups. The main barriers to testing were concerns about getting infected at the testing centre and about the test being painful. Just over half the sample (53%) were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine if recommended to them, one fifth responded they were unwilling, and the remainder unsure, though again, these proportions varied significantly by language spoken at home. Participants were more likely to say 'no' or 'not sure' to a COVID-19 vaccine if they were female or did not use Australian commercial information sources as a main way of finding out about COVID-19. Key barriers to vaccination were concerns about side effects and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, and a need for more information before making a decision.",

Key barriers to vaccination were similar in this study and our November Australia-wide survey (i.e. concerns about safety and needing more information) , though distrust of the government did not feature highly in the current study; only 3% of participants who reported barriers to vaccination said this was because they did not trust the government.

Given existing inequities for people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities, and the lower vaccination intentions observed in this study, public health should prioritise these groups to support testing and vaccination (Dodds and Fakoya, 2020, Al-Oraibi et al., 2021) . This approach must work collaboratively with people in these communities to develop tailored, targeted approaches to COVID-19 vaccine communication and rollout (Wild et al., 2021 , Leask et al., 2021 , Chauhan et al., 2021 , Raz et al., 2021 . In fact, the Australian federal government itself laid out policy in November 2020 (Australian Government, 2021a) , emphasising the need for translated and simple English communication about the vaccines and their rollout, providing ample opportunity for people in these communities to ask questions, working with community leaders and representatives, and embedding interpreter workforce into clinical services. However, at the time of study recruitment this policy had not been adequately implemented in Australia. There is evidence that this inclusive approach can also support COVID-19 testing behaviours, as evidenced by community-based .

This included providing translated versions of the survey, using interpreters, and multiple recruitment methods (including through social media, community events, and through community networks). We also included several variables related to culture and language (e.g. English language proficiency, literacy in own language, and years living in Australia), and focused on 10 specific language groups, in an attempt to provide a more nuanced description of the sample that captures some of the complexity and diversity within these communities. Whilst this inevitably means that not all cultural and language groups are represented in the survey, we hope that that by focusing on 10 groups with different access to translated materials, English language skills and proficiency in language spoken at home, that the findings have practical value and can inform decision-making to develop tailored supports and resources that serve these communities. This study also did not ask participants if they had already received the vaccine. State-wide estimates suggest fewer than 25 per 100 NSW population had received a single dose of the vaccine at the time recruitment closed(covid19data.com.au, 2021). Lastly, we were unable to incorporate specific items about the Astrazeneca vaccine as recruitment began before the news about its side effects hit mainstream media outlets.",
