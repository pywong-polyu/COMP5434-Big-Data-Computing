Male sex is a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. The meccanisms underlying the reduced morbidity and lethality in women are currently unclear, even though hypotheses have been posed (Brandi and Giustina in Trends Endocrinol Metab. 31:918-27, 2020). This article aims to describe the role of sex hormones in sex-and gender-related fatality of COVID-19. We discuss the possibility that potential sex-specific mechanisms modulating the course of the disease include both the androgen-and the estrogen-response cascade. Sex hormones regulate the respiratory function, the innate and adaptive immune responses, the immunoaging, the cardiovascular system, and the entrance of the virus in the cells. Recommendations for the future government policies and for the management of COVID-19 patients should include a dimorphic approach for males and females. As the estrogen receptor signaling appears critical for protection in women, more studies are needed to translate the basic knowledge into clinical actions. Understanding the etiological bases of sexual dimorphism in COVID-19 could help develop more effective strategies in individual patients in both sexes, including designing a good vaccine.",

As an example, 80% of patients with autoimmune diseases are females and similarly 80% of patients with osteoporosis are women [13] [14] [15] . Conversely, cardiovascular diseases are anticipated of at least a decade in men when compared to women [16] . In general, men have a lower life expectancy than women, but women spend their extra years with higher levels of illness, the so called gender health paradox [17] .",

The ACE2 gene encodes a type I carboxypeptidase glycoprotein of about 100 kDa, composed by 805 amino acids and located as an ectoenzyme on the surface of the cells. ACE2 enzyme acts exclusively as a carboxypeptidase removing a C-terminal amino acid from Angiotensin II (Ang II) generating Ang(1-7) or from Ang I forming Ang(1-9). The Ang(1-7) acts through its G-protein coupled receptor Mas [34] . The protein is expressed on the surface of lung epithelial cells and other tissues, that regulate the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system [35] . The ACE2 is linked to a reduced risk of developing hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and it is also protective in the lungs against edema, permeability, and pulmonary damage [35] . These features point to the control of the expression of the ACE2 gene as a therapeutic strategy in hypertension and heart failure. The ACE2 gene is regulated at multiple levels including transcriptional, posttranscriptional and post-translational through its shedding from the cell surface. The lung expression of the ACE2 gene decreases with age, prevalently in men [36] . This, together with a potential double dose of ACE2 gene in women, could explain the higher COVID-19 lung morbidity and mortality in elderly men. Also the mechanism of acute myocardial injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 during severe COVID-19 disease might be related to the inhibition of the ACE2 catalytic activity [37] . Humans are not equal with respect to the expression levels of the cellular ACE2 enzyme and ACE2 gene expression and/or polymorphisms could influence both the susceptibility of people to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcome of the COVID-19 disease [35, 38] . Further exploration of the relationships between the virus and the ACE2 gene expression and genotype should help to better understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19.",

Aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrazole, letrozole and exemestane, inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens and accumulation of androgens could potentially lead to increases in TMPRSS2 gene expression. On the other side tamoxifen with its antiestrogenic, antiandrogenic and antiviral combined functions could be an ally in the fight to COVID-19 for patients with mammary cancer. Unfortunately, tamoxifen treatment is associated with an increased risk thromboembolism. In a recent study, SERMS appear as the most promising drugs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection in women affected by hormone-driven cancers when compared to other antiestrogenic therapies [125, 126] . More efforts will help a future understanding of the molecular basis of this putative protective effect, before the use of SERMs and/or other antiestrogenic therapies in the prevention of COVID-19. What we intend to recommend is that any decision in treating the patients with these drugs should be taken patient by patient, keeping in mind the accumulated knowledge.",
