In this sample we identify 85 flaring objects, ranging in spectral type from M4 to L0. We detect 234 flares in this sample, with energies between 10 29.2 and 10 32.7 erg, using both automated and manual methods. With this work, we present the largest photometric sample of flares on late-M and ultra-cool dwarfs to date. By extending previous M dwarf flare studies into the ultra-cool regime, we find M5-M7 stars are more likely to flare than both earlier, and later, M dwarfs. By performing artificial flare injection-recovery tests we demonstrate that we can detect a significant proportion of flares down to an amplitude of 1 per cent, and we are most sensitive to flares on the coolest stars. Our results reveal an absence of high-energy flares on the reddest dwarfs. To probe the relations between rotation and activity for fully convective stars, we extract rotation periods for fast rotators and lower-bound period estimates of slow rotators. These rotation periods span from 2.2 hours to 65 days, and we find that the proportion of flaring stars increases for the very fastest rotators. Finally, we discuss the impact of our flare sample on planets orbiting ultra-cool stars. As stars become cooler, they flare less frequently; therefore, it is unlikely that planets around the very reddest dwarfs would enter the 'abiogenesis' zone or drive visible-light photosynthesis through flares alone.",

            "text": "Stellar flares may be a major determinant in whether a planet can initiate and sustain life. Flares are explosive events caused by magnetic recombination in the upper atmosphere of a star (Benz & G\u00fcdel 2010) . This sudden eruption of magnetic energy usually occurs around active regions, such as stellar spots, and causes bursts of particles and electromagnetic radiation. The spectra of this radiation resembles a black body with an effective temperature of 9000 K (Shibayama et al. 2013) . Often, though not always, powerful flares will come accompanied with a coronal mass ejection (CME) event, where clouds of charged particles are directionally ejected from the star. While flares can be destructive, through atmospheric erosion (Lammer et al. 2007) , ozone depletion (Segura et al. 2010; Tilley et al. 2019) , and even extinction events, they can also be an essential power source for life. It is possible that flares could provide the missing energy at the bluer end of the spectrum needed for cool, red dwarfs to initiate prebiotic chemistry (Buccino et al. 2007; Ranjan et al. 2017; Rimmer et al. 2018 ) and for photosynthesis (Mullan & Bais 2018; Lingam & Loeb 2019a) . The additional UV energy may also affect the evolution of a planet's atmospheric chemistry (Segura et al. 2010; Vida et al. 2017) . In summary, stellar flares have extreme and far-reaching consequences on the planets hosted by cool stars. Therefore, it is essential to study these stars' flaring activity, and assess how applicable our current understanding of stellar activity is to the ultra-cool regime.",

These stellar winds are dependent on the structure and properties of the magnetic field. As the rotation slows, this decreases the magnetic activity in a process known as spin down (Skumanich 1972; Noyes et al. 1984) . Due to this effect, rapidly rotating stars flare much more frequently than slow rotators (Skumanich 1986; Davenport et al. 2019; Mondrik et al. 2018; Medina et al. 2020) . Spots and faculae on the surface of stars and brown dwarfs cause periodic photometric variations as they come in and out of view, on the same timescale as the object's rotation. This allows the rotation period to be deduced directly from the photometry. Therefore, the rotation of a star can provide valuable insights into the magnetic dynamo, the mechanism which generates a star's magnetic field.",

Despite this predicted difference, recent work has shown that relationships between activity and rotation remain consistent from partially to fully convective stars (Wright & Drake 2016; Newton et al. 2017; Wright et al. 2018) . Spin down is, however, believed to occur on slower timescales for fully convective stars, which accounts for the enhanced activity of mid-to-late M dwarfs (West et al. 2008; Newton et al. 2017; Jackman et al. 2021 ). Therefore, rotation, activity, and the relationship between the two, are extremely useful probes of the underlying magnetic activity of ultra-cool dwarfs.",

Due to the intrinsic faintness of UCDs in the visible, it is difficult to achieve the high photometric precisions necessary to constrain their flaring activity. However, it is possible to perform small, dedicated studies of the much rarer, high-energy flares on UCDs (Gizis et al. 2013; Paudel et al. 2018; Jackman et al. 2019) . Therefore, to obtain a sufficient sample size, previous large flare studies have focused on hotter stars, up to mid-M dwarfs, where photometric precisions are much higher. This has resulted in limited flare statistics for the coolest stars, for which we would require a large, high-cadence photometric survey optimised for UCDs.",

SPECULOOS's motivation is to provide temperate, terrestrial planets for detailed atmospheric characterisation with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST, Gardner et al.

SPECULOOS comprises a network of 1-m class telescopes spread across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The largest facility, the SPECULOOS-Southern Observatory (SSO) in Cerro Paranal, Chile, consists of four identical, robotic telescopes. These telescopes are named Io, Europa, Callisto and Ganymede. Each telescope operates independently and in robotic mode following plans written by SPECULOOS's automatic scheduler, SPeculoos Observatory sChedule maKer ( , Sebastian et al. 2021) . Additionally, the SPECULOOS-Northern Observatory (Niraula et al. 2020) in Tenerife and the SAINT-EX (Search And characterIsatioN of Transiting EXoplanets) facility (Demory et al. 2020) in San Pedro M\u00e1rtir each have one 1-m telescope.

We note that in SPECU-LOOS's \"survey mode\", there are no simultaneous observations with multiple telescopes during the course of a night. During this time period the operational temperature of the CCD was increased from \u221270 to \u221260\u00b0C in October 2018. The choice to raise the temperature of the CCD was due to the effect on the quantum efficiency of the detector, improving our sensitivity at the red limit, while the increase in dark current was found to be negligible. This temperature change introduces an offset in the differential flux between the nights before and after. Whilst this offset has no consequence on our flare program, it affects long-term photometric trends. Therefore, when recovering rotation periods (in Section 4), we split the lightcurves that straddle this temperature change and analyse the before and after sections independently. As this temperature change happens during the first few months of our dataset, the majority of targets were either observed entirely before or after it. Therefore, we only need to split a handful of our lightcurves. If a target has been ob- served by multiple telescopes we do not combine their lightcurves, as each will experience slightly different instrumental systematics. However, we do check that the rotation periods estimated in Section 4 are present in observations from all telescopes. If we choose only the objects which have been observed more than 20 hours with one telescope, this provides us instead with 154 targets (of which 134, or \u223c87 per cent, are in the SPECULOOS target list). We define the observation time as the sum of the span of all observation nights (start of night to end of night), where we exclude any gap longer than 15 minutes. These 154 objects define the SPECULOOS-South data sample. This sample covers a range of M dwarfs in spectral type, extending from M4 into the early L dwarf regime (with masses of 0.07-0.2 M ), as shown in Figure  1 . All objects in this sample will therefore be fully convective, as the convection limit occurs around 0.35 M (Chabrier & Baraffe 1997) . While M4 and M5 objects are not considered ultra-cool dwarfs, we include them in this sample to explore any differences between mid-M, late-M, and L dwarfs.",

Only objects above a brightness threshold (optimised for each field) are chosen as reference stars. Reference stars whose differential lightcurves exhibit photometric variability, or that are far in spatial distance on-sky from the target, are then weighted down in an iterative algorithm, based on Broeg et al. (2005) . It is worth noting that the target star is removed from this process. This means that, except for the distance weighting, this 'artificial lightcurve' is entirely independent of the target star's lightcurve. This pipeline then corrects for the second-order effects of atmospheric water absorption on our differential photometry, using measurements of precipitable water vapour from the ground-based LHATPRO (Low Humidity and Temperature PROfiling radiometer) instrument (Kerber et al. 2012) .",

As we only use one aperture size across all nights, it is important to take time at this step. Choosing the best aperture for a target involves a fine balance between an aperture that's large enough to avoid losing flux for nights with sub-optimal observing conditions (e.g., a larger seeing), and an aperture that's small enough to prevent blending from nearby stars and extra white-noise contamination from the background. We select the aperture by eye which minimises the correlation between the lightcurve flux and the seeing for the whole lightcurve, and has no clear contamination from neighbouring stars. In addition, we implement a bad weather flag and thresholds for the background sky level, airmass, and seeing (above which the data are severely impacted), described in more detail below.",

This distinction means that we can use the artificial lightcurve as an independent reflection of the photometric conditions at that time to identify where the quality of our lightcurves deteriorates. Data points in our lightcurves are flagged based on the RMS of the section of the artificial lightcurve surrounding that data point (local RMS). We define the length of the local section to be \u00b10.01d. We make the assumption here that there is a threshold for photometric scatter in the artificial lightcurve (which therefore must be present in the highly weighted reference stars' lightcurves) above which we cannot obtain good photometric precision.

By only considering small neighbouring sections of the lightcurve in our RMS, and the flux for a few points either side of the flare in our criteria, we are able to detect small flares on rapidly rotating or frequently flaring objects. Equation 1 assesses the quality of the flare's shape. If we assume that the peak of the flare is at then the first half of Equation 1 confirms that we are at a peak by ensuring the flux at is greater than the flux a few exposures before and after. The steeper the peak, or larger the flux difference between the peak and surrounding points, the higher its value. The second half of Equation 1 hinges on the asymmetry of the flare by requiring that the gradient before the peak, the fast rise, is larger than the gradient after the peak, the slow decay. For this second half of the equation, the greater the asymmetry, the higher its value. By dividing by the local RMS, the aim is to remove flare structures caused by photometric scatter, which is especially problematic for ground-based observing with rapidly changing weather conditions.

In doing so we note that the energies we calculate provide a lower bound on the flare energy, as we may miss the flare's peak. It is also possible that if there was a large flare on a rapidlyrotating star, the underlying mean may 'smooth out' photometric structure, leading to the flare energy being over-estimated. However, to be classed a 'large' flare, a flare needs to be more than 7 times the running global standard deviation (as defined in Section 3.3.2). This standard deviation would be highly inflated from the periodic photometric modulations, and therefore this flare would have to be very high energy for this to become an issue. As high energy flares are rare (Gershberg 1972; Lacy et al. 1976 ), this scenario is not a major concern. We chose not to use the flare model because the flares in our lightcurves are well-sampled, and when there is increased photometric noise in the lightcurve, or more complex The grey points are the unbinned data, while the black points are binned every 5 minutes. We do a simple least-squares fit of a sine wave with a period of 0.33d, shown in light blue. It is clear from this fit that the rotation pattern is not perfectly sinusoidal; however, it provides a way to visualise the periodicity. The medium-blue data points are those initial flare regions flagged by the automatic flare detection algorithm described in Section 3.3.1. The vertical, medium-blue lines are the flare candidates that have also been confirmed manually. During visual inspection of this lightcurve, we remove two flares (one in the first plot on the second row and the first flare in the second plot on the second row), due to their small amplitude, which were found too difficult to detach from the photometric scatter. The best-fit Davenport et al. (2014) flare shapes from overlapping flares (see Section 3.4), the fit to the flare model can be unreliable. Integrating the lightcurve directly means that bursts of flares occurring in short succession are counted as one flare of increased energy. While this simplification may affect the calculation of our flare rates and energies, it should not significantly affect our results as we only detect 27 unusually-shaped flares that may be a blend of multiple flares. We note that while flares are typically approximated as blackbodies with temperatures from 9000-10000 K, the flare temperature has been observed to vary outside this range, both between and within flare events (Howard et al. 2020b ).",

While we may be injecting \"unphysical\" flares, this approach allows us to explore a larger parameter space of different flare morphologies. The amplitude-duration relationship for flare has also not been well studied for the case of UCDs, where it may differ from that seen in earlier M dwarfs. We do not see a clear relationship between fitted amplitude and duration in our sample (and so cannot confirm any other observed amplitude-duration relationships, e.g. Hawley et al. 2014) , though our estimates of amplitude and duration rely on a good fit to the Davenport template, which is significantly more challenging with messy ground-based data. Our purpose with these tests is to examine the decay time, amplitude, energy and spectral type limits of our flare detection method, not to reproduce a realistic flare frequency distribution. To model a realistic flare distribution we would need to consider that low energy flares are more common than high energy flares, as discussed in Section 5.3. However, then we would have significantly more low energy flares injected and recovered, making our sensitivity results more robust for small amplitudes/decay times, and less robust for high energy flares.",

This prevents those 5 flares from occurring too close to the start or end of night or during gaps in our observations, which we would always miss.

If two or more flares overlap within 1 FWHM flare , they may be detected as only one flare. We assume if they occur further apart in time then they should be easily separable.

It is more likely during manual vetting that we would conflate low-amplitude flares or flares on high photometric scatter targets with noise, therefore by removing this stage we have potentially inflated our recovery rates for the lowest energy flares, or for the faintest target stars. Figure 4 shows the results of the injection-recovery tests, carried out for approximately 23,000 artificial flares. We are able to detect a significant proportion of flares with amplitudes above 1 per cent. Due to the short exposure times of SPECULOOS, we have the advantage of being very sensitive to flares with a short duration (with FWHM flare < 5 minutes). However, we are more limited in detecting longer duration flares (with FWHM flare \u2265 60 minutes) due to the day-night cycle, with typical uninterrupted observation windows of 4-8 hours. There will also be some stars which have nights of observation less than 4 hours, due to weather, or limited visibility, and these will be the most difficult targets on which to detect slowly decaying flares. However, we note that during the manual vetting (Section 3.3.4) we inspect the lightcurves with flares removed and we do not find any undetected high energy flares remaining in our sample. We also assess our limitations with the photometric RMS of our lightcurves. When the RMS of a global lightcurve exceeds \u223c 0.7 per cent (for 5-minute binning) we begin to see a drop in detection efficiency, resulting in an increase in the minimum detectable amplitude.

For low-energy flares, we have two competing biases. The lightcurves for the later, and fainter, M and L dwarfs have higher photometric scatter, which makes it difficult to detect small-amplitude (and therefore lower energy) flares. However, as flares have a strong white light component (Namekata et al. 2017) , there is an increased contrast between flares and the stellar spectra of red dwarfs, which should make lower energy flares easier to identify in our coolest stars (Allred et al. 2015; Schmidt et al. 2019) .

Therefore, careful treatment of the resulting periodograms is essential to remove aliases.",

Any lightcurves for which we see some periodic structure, but we cannot easily determine a period, we class as 'U'. This can result from broad peaks in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, or multiple possible periods due to lack of observations, or a very low amplitude periodic signal that is comparable to the noise level. Because of these ambiguities in the period measurements, we do not attempt to place errors on our period estimates. If we do not detect any periodic signal or we cannot remove correlations with systematics (such as for very crowded fields), then we class the object as 'N'. Finally, in addition to the classes defined in Newton et al. (2016) , we add an extra 'L' grade.

These flaring stars span the spectral type range from M4 (T eff = 3160K) to L0 (T eff = 2313K). Figure 7 shows the spectral type distribution and proportions of the flaring objects identified in the SSO sample. From this figure we see the proportion of flaring stars stays consistently above 60 per cent for objects of spectral type M5-M7. We see that the rate of flaring stars begins to decline around M8 (\u223c 30 per cent), with no detected flares for any object beyond L0. The coolest flaring star we detect is a 2313 K, M9.6V object (which is rounded to L0 in Figure 7 ). However, for the L dwarfs we are limited by the small sample size, and therefore cannot make any conclusions about whether the fraction of flaring objects continues to decrease beyond late M dwarfs. Likewise, we do not have any objects earlier than M4; however, these earlier M dwarfs have been well studied by TESS, Kepler, and MEarth. Despite our small sample of M4 dwarfs, we see an apparent reduction in activity for stars earlier than M5 that agrees with the previous results (\u223c30 per cent for M4 with TESS, G\u00fcnther et al. (2020) , 25% for M5 with ASAS-SN, Mart\u00ednez et al. (2019) ). Several authors find a steep rise in flaring fractions around spectral type M4 (West et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2017; G\u00fcnther et al. 2020; Mart\u00ednez et al. 2019) . Specifically, West et al. (2004) analysed the H emission of cool stars (which roughly correlates with flaring activity, Yang et al. 2017; Mart\u00ednez et al. 2019 ) and determined that the fraction of active stars rose monotonically from spectral type M0 to M8, peaked at M8 (\u223c80 per cent active) and then declined to L4. Our results show an increase from M4 to a broad peak from M5-M7, followed by a decrease from M8 to L2.",

In conjunction with the difficulties arising from the day-night cycle (typical night observations are 4-8 hours), which complicates our detection of very slowly decaying flares (see Figure 4) , it is unlikely that superflares with energies > 10 33 erg (Shibayama et al. 2013 ) will be detected by our survey.

            "text": "We see a tentative trend that as the stars get cooler, the flares we detect become less energetic and less frequent. However, we see a large diversity of FFD profiles even within the same spectral type. This could be due to variation in stellar age or metallicity. Since we are biased towards detecting lower energy flares for cooler stars, it is possible we more significantly underestimate the rates of lower energy flares for our earlier M stars. This effect may result in steeper power-law slopes, further separating the mid-M dwarfs from the late-M and L dwarfs. However, we only have one M4, M9 and L0 object with at least 3 flares, and within the larger sample of M5-M7 stars, we see little distinction. The decline in flare rates for cooler spectral types could be partially explained by our decreased sensitivity for early-M stars. If only the infrequent, high energy flares are within reach, we only pick up the objects that flare more often. Conversely, since we are more sensitive to detecting lower energy flares on late-M and L dwarfs, we are able to identify stars with lower flaring frequencies. This effect explains the lack of low frequency flaring stars of early spectral types, but not the lack of high frequency flaring stars of later spectral types. As we have a small sample of flaring ultra-cool stars (see Figure 7) , we cannot confirm whether they, as a whole, flare less frequently. Paudel et al. (2018) similarly find that the flare rates for low-energy flares decrease as they move towards later spectral types, with L0 and L1 dwarfs having the lowest flaring rates. Critically, however, they find shallower slopes for cool stars (also in agreement with Gizis et al. (2013) and Mullan & Bais (2018) ), implying that they have higher occurrence rates for the high-energy flares that are inaccessible to us. High frequency of these flares could be sufficient for a star to enter the abiogenesis zone. However, we are unable to confirm this trend, due to our small We find the best power-law fit to the cumulative flare rates against flare energy for every star, shown by straight lines. The spectral type of each star is indicated by its colour. The abiogenesis zones (Rimmer et al. 2018 ) are also shown for each star as the regions shaded in green (similarly to G\u00fcnther et al. 2020) , and the photosynthesis thresholds (Lingam & Loeb 2019a ) are shown in orange.",

By considering stellar flares as a mechanism for providing this UV energy, we can calculate the abiogenesis zones around the stars in our sample from their FFDs. Whether or not this chemistry is possible on a planet does not tell us if life has originated there, but instead, whether this mechanism can allow that planet to generate this first building block for RNA.

(2018) The computed flare occurrence rates (Equation 10), and their 1 uncertainties, against bolometric flare energy for an average star of each spectral type bin. These flare rates have been corrected for our incompleteness at low flare energies and represent the 'intrinsic' flaring rate (equivalent to Equation 16 at very high energies). The solid lines mark up to the highest energy flare for each spectral type bin, after that the \"extrapolated\" region is marked by the dotted line. and Yang & Liu (2019) generated flare catalogues and found on average M dwarfs had a power law indices of = 2.09 \u00b1 0.10 (for fully convective stars) and = 2.07 \u00b1 0.35 respectively. For a sample of cool dwarfs observed by TESS, Medina et al. (2020) found = 1.98\u00b10.02. Seli et al. (2021) specifically isolated TESS's observations of stars similar in spectral type to TRAPPIST-1, for which they found =2.11. This work also modified the FFD for TRAPPIST-1 generated by Vida et al. (2017) to include recovery rate, updating their value of from 1.59 to 2.03 \u00b1 0.02. Lin et al. (2021) used EDEN and K2 lightcurves to analyse the flaring activity of the nearby active M dwarf Wolf 359, for which they found = 2.13 \u00b1 0.14. We could find a lower value of if the incompleteness of the sample is not fully described by Equation 16. We see a slightly earlier tail-off at low energies compared to the Jackman et al. (2021) model for all spectral types, which may be evidence of this. Alternatively, previous works may find higher values for than this work as they have studied higher energy flares on UCD targets using space-based observations. We are limited in this study to only frequent, low energy flares due to our observing strategy. Therefore, it is possible that power laws may steepen at higher flaring energies.",

We also derive a long-period rotation estimate with SPECULOOS for two objects with small amplitudes that may not be evident in the MEarth data, due to limitations on the lowest mass stars.

For the clear slow rotators, which we observe for less than a full phase, we can only assign a long-period estimate (L). The apparent gap in rotation periods from our sample between one and two days is likely a bias from the difficulty in disentangling real rotation from 1-day aliases. Seli et al.

(2021) find rotation periods for four objects that appear in our catalogue. We find rotation periods for 16 of the 35 objects (with rotation classes A, B or L). Therefore, we can also compare both our flaring and rotation results for this handful of targets. For three of these objects we detect an alias of the period extracted from TESS 30-minute FFIs. For each of these three objects we inspected the SSO lightcurves and periodograms. In each case, the rotation period measured by Seli et al. (2021) is the second most promising period, however, the peaks in the periodogram are very close in power, and the chosen period usually gives a better phase coverage. This is the reason for the 'B' grade we assign to rotators Gaia DR2 2349207644734247808 and 4967628688601251200. Gaia DR2 3200303384927512960 is assigned a grade of 'A', however, it is a unique case. For this target we detect a rotation period of 0.334 d, while Seli et al. (2021) measure a period of 0.50062 d. Rotation periods of 0.33, 0.5 or 1 d are special scenarios for ground-based observations where, over short baselines, we only see the same part of the phase on every observation night. Therefore, due to the limit imposed by the day-night cycle, we are unable to distinguish between these periods. The target for which we do not detect any rotation period, Gaia DR2 4971892010576979840, has an amplitude for periodic photometric variation of 2.1 mmag (measured by Seli et al. (2021) ).

This flaring fraction contrasts this work, where we detect flares on 28 of the 57 M7-M9 objects within the SSO sample (49 per cent). There may be several reasons for this discrepancy. Firstly, Seli et al. (2021) detect flares from lightcurves with a low time resolution of 30 minutes. TESS is also not optimised for very red objects such as UCDs, therefore the photometric precision is lower than for SPECULOOS. Both of these factors inhibit a flare survey on TESS data from detecting low energy flares (which have small amplitudes and short durations) on UCDs. Instead, continuous 27-day monitoring of each TESS field allows Seli et al. (2021) to probe the rarer, high energy (even superflare) flare regime. This is demonstrated by their recovery fraction, which is less than 20 per cent for flares with energies below 10 31.5 ergs, compared to SSO recovery fractions of 50-70 per cent (depending on spectral type) for the same energy. Additionally, in this paper we demonstrate that cooler stars flare less frequently at all energies, therefore it is likely that a survey focused on high energy flares on cool stars would detect significantly fewer flares. Finally, space-based data is less impacted than ground-based data by time-varying systematics due to the Earth's rapidly-changing atmosphere, therefore the risk of false positives is presumably lower.",

            "text": "The breadth of the SSO flare sample allows us to compare the flaring and rotating behaviour of mid-M stars with ultra-cool dwarfs. We predominantly detect flares on M5-M7 stars (\u223c60-70 per cent flare), and decreasing proportions of flaring stars for both earlier and later M dwarfs. Since there is a spectral dependency to our flare detection (Figure 6 ), it is likely that we are missing the lower energy flares on mid-M dwarfs, and therefore underestimating the proportion of flaring stars. On the other hand, these higher mass objects do produce rarer, high-energy flares more frequently than late-M dwarfs (Lacy et al. 1976 ). These high-energy flares should be easier to detect. Our results also agree with other surveys, with around \u223c 30 per cent of M4 stars flaring. It is possible that these surveys are limited in different ways for mid-M stars, which exist at the redder end of their samples, rather than at the bluer end of ours. Lacy et al. (1976) showed that the flares on mid-M dwarfs were more frequent and lower energy than on early-M dwarfs. Hilton et al. (2010) found that this trend continued into the late-M dwarf regime (M6-M8). From our findings we see little difference between spectral types up to M7. However, our results extend beyond M8, where we find that flares of all energies appear to become less frequent. From our injection-recovery tests, we conclude that if higher energy flares were present on the reddest stars in our sample, then we would detect them; therefore, the lack of high-energy flares for late-M and L dwarfs on the sampled timescales of 0.8 to 8.7 days is likely real.",

The stars with rapid rotation periods of <5 days, are much more likely to flare than the rest of the SSO sample. At least 74 per cent of the stars with rotation periods faster than 2 days flare, compared to around 59 per cent of all rotating stars and 42 per cent of non-rotating stars. Therefore, we are more likely to detect flares on stars where we can determine a rotation period than stars we cannot. Possible explanations are that fast rotators flare much more frequently, more energetically, or are more likely to flare than stars with no detectable rotation period. Being unable to detect a rotation period may be a symptom that a star has a period too long to be measured by our survey, or the photometric variations on the rotation timescale are too small to be seen, possibly due to small spot covering fractions, a low spot-photosphere contrast, or a particular orientation of spots (e.g. distributed at the poles). This contrast between rotators and nonrotators is further enhanced for the very fastest periods ( \u2264 2 d).",

(2018) on MEarth data, and in the activity-rotation study from Seli et al. (2021) on TESS observations. SPECULOOS and MEarth are two ground-based surveys focused on cool stars, but with very different observing strategies. SPECULOOS is a fast-cadence survey that targets ultra-cool dwarfs for relatively short baselines of 4-8 days. MEarth, however, revisits its M dwarf targets only every 20-30 minutes, over a period of several months. With SPECU-LOOS's lightcurves, therefore, we are able to study the short-term photometric variability of an object, such as its flaring and fast rotation (<10 d), whereas with MEarth's lightcurves we can monitor an object's long-term variability, such as any slow rotation (>50 d) and stellar surface evolution. SPECULOOS and MEarth, however, are both ground-based surveys which have to contest with the challenges of observing through the Earth's atmosphere and the loss of data from the day-night cycle. TESS, a space telescope, is able to perform continuous 27 d monitoring of each field, however ultracool dwarfs are not its ideal targets. Therefore, TESS lightcurves of UCDs are mostly only available from the 30-minute FFIs, and have generally lower precisions. SPECULOOS has the short exposure times and high precisions necessary to identify frequent low energy flares, however for rotation, the irregular data sampling and large gaps (limited by weather conditions and the observing cycle) make it difficult to identify the correct period above its aliases. For this reason we recommend caution when interpreting the rotation results from this survey, and provide 'rotation classes' to help identify targets with rotation period uncertainties. TESS is only able to detect the rarer high energy flares (with large amplitudes and slow decay times), however, its ability to provide continuous phase coverage of fast-rotating objects, and to observe up to hundreds of cycles, make it well suited for rotation studies. Comparisons such as these, between ground and space-based surveys, and between fast and slow-cadence observing strategies highlight that they are highly complementary. Leveraging the differences and the overlaps between different surveys allows us to fully explore the photometric activity parameter space of UCDs, and unearth more information about the subsequent impact on any potential planets they might host.",

This flare released an energy of 10 32 erg and the associated coronal mass ejection hit the Earth's magnetosphere, resulting in the largest geomagnetic storm on record. This storm disrupted telegraph systems and produced auroras reaching almost as far as the Equator. While our flare sample is relatively low-energy compared to the wealth of recorded flares on other stellar types, in our sample we detect 14 flares with energies greater than 10 32 erg on 10 different stars.

            "text": "From calculating FFDs for the stars in our sample, we can place energetic bounds on whether flares can drive photosynthesis (Section 5.3.3) or provide their planets with enough UV flux for the prebiotic chemistry described in Section 5.3 to occur. If we extrapolate the FFD power laws to = 10 34 erg, we have only one M6 star that provides this necessary UV flux. However, there are several caveats to these results. As we see a non-linear \"tail-off\" effect for low energy flares due to our detection limits we likely underestimate low energy flares rates, resulting in shallower FFD power laws in Section 5.3. Therefore, without accounting for the completeness of our flare sample this work only places upper bounds on the stars whose planets can reach the abiogensesis zone, or which can sustain photosynthesis. As we move towards cooler stars, we see that the frequency of flaring decreases (see Figure 8 ). However, there are only one of each of the M4, M9 and L0 stars, with at least 3 flares detected. Due to our low detection efficiency for mid-M dwarfs, we are biased to detect only the most frequently flaring stars; therefore, it is likely that we would see an artificial increase in flare rate for M4 objects. In contrast, we should be more sensitive to flares of all energies on our late-M and L dwarf stars, so this bias does not explain the decrease in flare frequency for these stars. By including our detection sensitivity in Section 5.4 and considering an \"average\" star for each spectral type, we can conclude more general relationships between flare frequency and spectral type. While there is a wide diversity of flare frequencies for individual stars' within a given spectral type, on average cooler stars have lower flaring rates. If this trend holds for a larger sample of UCDs, it may have severe consequences on the search for life around the very lowest mass objects. Similar conclusions have been reached by work on the flaring activity of TRAPPIST-1 (Glazier et al. 2020; Ducrot et al. 2020; Seli et al. 2021) and \"TRAPPIST-1 analogues\" (Seli et al. 2021) .",

This work can be used in conjunction with previous and ongoing flare studies on earlier M dwarfs, such as those carried out on TESS, K2, and MEarth observations, to assess the diversity of M dwarfs and how well we can extrapolate the results of these studies to lower mass objects. We demonstrate the benefit of a large-scale flare study of UCDs, such as this, to extending existing flare catalogues.",

Firstly, the quiescent UV flux of cool stars is too low for the synthesis of ribonucleotides, a major step in prebiotic chemistry. Secondly, the visible light incident on planets around cool stars is also found to be too low for photosynthesis to occur. In both cases, while we find it is possible that flares on active M dwarfs could provide the necessary extra radiation, the frequency of flares of all energies appears to decrease with spectral type. These two considerations alone suggest UCD systems may not be favourable sites for abiogenesis, though other factors-known and unknown-certainly impact the likelihood of finding life in these systems as well. Figure A1 . The FFDs for each of the 31 objects with at least three flares. The cumulative flare rates against bolometric flare energies (binned every 10 0.1 ergs in log space) are shown by the points as well as the best-fit power law for each star. The plots are ordered in increasing spectral type and the colour of the points and lines correspond to that object's spectral type. The thresholds to reach the abiogenesis zone and perform oxygenic photosynthesis are shown for each object by the green and orange lines respectively.",
