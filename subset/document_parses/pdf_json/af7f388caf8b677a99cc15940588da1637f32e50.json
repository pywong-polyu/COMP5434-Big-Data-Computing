It is also used in some cases of resistant depression, and it is the only psychiatric medication (other than clozapine) proven to prevent suicide (Baldessarini et al., 2003) . Clinically, lithium has also been used to treat severe psychotic symptoms in some patients with schizophrenia (Leucht et al., 2015) and it has also been prescribed to control irritability and aggressive behaviors in several conditions, such as personality disorders, children with conduct disorders and aggressive subjects with intellectual disability (Tyrer, 1994) . Some authors consider that, with the exception of ECT, lithium is the single most effective treatment in Psychiatry (Shorter, 2009) .",

Magnesium acts as a cofactor for enzymes that are needed for the replication of viral proteins and nucleosides. When lithium replaces magnesium, it seems to inactivate the polymerase enzymes. The binding (or association) constant of both lithium and magnesium with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are of the same order of magnitude, explaining why lithium may be able to interfere with virus replication by disrupting key enzymes of the ATP/ADP balance such as ATPases (Briggs et al., 2016) .",

In summary, lithium is a drug with antiviral properties against several virus types (including some within the coronavirus family), and it has some capacity to regulate the immune system and increase anti-inflammatory events.

In Galicia (a region in north-western Spain), COVID-19 incidence rates are lower, i.e., 8,304 cases and 463 deaths (incidence of 3.07 per thousand inhabitants). In the Health Area of Vigo, where most of the population in Galicia is concentrated, 1,633 cases and 108 deaths have been recorded for COVID-19, an incidence of 2.89 per thousand inhabitants. In order to explore some preliminary evidence on lithium's effectiveness on COVID-19 infection, we compared our database of patients receiving lithium in our catchment area (437 patients) with the registry of patients positive for COVID-19. We found that none of them were infected. This finding does not prove that lithium is effective against COVID-19, but if a number of patients taking lithium were to be infected, then our hypothesis would have been considerably nullified. The next step in search for evidence for the plausible efficacy of lithium in treating patients with COVID-19 was to prescribe lithium carbonate to some COVID-19-positive patients whom also present psychiatric symptoms, which would justify, at least from a psychiatric viewpoint, the use of the drug. This was assessed independently by two of the authors who are both clinical psychiatrists (MLG and JMO). Finally, we selected six hospitalized patients, all of whom were over 16 years old and had provided written informed consent for the publication of any potentially identifiable images or data included in this article.",

If an adjustment in dose was required to reach those levels, a new measurement of plasma levels would be performed 72 h after the first intake of the increased dose. Special consideration was given to any concomitant diuretic and/or antiretroviral treatment the patient could be taking, as those may modify (i.e., increase) the plasma levels of lithium in the blood and QTc, respectively.

Six of these patients were treated with lithium carbonate after psychiatric evaluation by two different psychiatrists who considered they could benefit from receiving the treatment. Patients 1 and 5 received an initial dose of 200 mg/12 h, and after plasma lithium levels were measured (after 48 h from first dose) the dose was increased to 400 mg/12 h for patient 1 and 600 mg (200 mg-0-400 mg) for patient 5. The rest of the patients received 400 mg/12 during 48 h and after plasma lithium levels were measured (0.6-1.2 mE/L) they remained on the same dose. In the case of patient 4, physicians did not consider hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir treatment because he had been suffering from COVID-19 symptoms for more than 12 days, so he only received lithium carbonate (400 mg/12 h) (Figure 1) .",

In our case we have shown that lithium carbonate treatment could be effective and with fewer side-effects. We do not know if lithium carbonate is able to reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2, which still needs to be tested, but here we have provided evidence that all patients treated with lithium were RT-PCR test negative at discharge. COVID-19 is a disease with no single effective treatment to date. Until the first vaccines are available, there is a need for an effective and preferably inexpensive treatment that can be administered worldwide. Lithium is a drug that has been used by doctors for the last 70 years, and it has been shown to have antiviral properties against different RNA and DNA viruses. We hope that we will be able to elucidate its promising antiviral actions against COVID-19 in future research. It has also been shown elsewhere that lithium may influence inflammation and lymphocyte count. As we now know, lymphocyte numbers are largely decreased by COVID-19 in severely affected patients, and interestingly, we have seen how this is reversed in all six patients treated with lithium.",
