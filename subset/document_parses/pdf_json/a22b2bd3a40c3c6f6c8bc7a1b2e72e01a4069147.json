Several approaches have been developed to overcome these problems. Here we describe the engineering of CoV full-length cDNA clones using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). In this system the viral RNA is expressed in the cell nucleus under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and further amplified in the cytoplasm by the viral replicase. The BAC-based strategy is an efficient system that allows easy manipulation of CoV genomes to study fundamental viral processes and also to develop genetically defined vaccines. The procedure is illustrated by the cloning of the genome of SARS coronavirus, Urbani strain.",

BACs are synthetic low-copy-number plasmids based on the well-characterized E. coli F-factor (12) that presents a strictly controlled replication leading to one or two plasmid copies per cell. These plasmids allow the stable maintenance of large DNA fragments in bacteria, minimize the toxicity problem usually observed with several CoV sequences when amplified in high-copy-number plasmids, and their manipulation is similar to that of conventional plasmids. The cDNA of the CoV genome is assembled in the BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter to allow the expression of the viral RNA in the nucleus by the cellular RNA polymerase II (13). At the 3 -end, this cDNA is flanked by a 25-bp synthetic poly(A) and the sequences of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination and polyadenylation signals to produce synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 3 -ends.

Check a small aliquot of the digestion by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure that the entire DNA has been cleaved. 2. When two enzymes requiring different buffers are used to digest the DNA, carry out the digestion sequentially with both enzymes. Clean the DNA after the first digestion by extraction with phenol:chloroform and standard ethanol precipitation or by using the Qiagen QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit following the manufacturer's instructions for purifying DNA fragments from aqueous solutions (see Note 15). 3. Purify the digested BAC vector and the DNA insert by agarose gel electrophoresis using the Qiagen QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit following the manufacturer's instructions (see Notes 15 and 16) . Determine the concentration of the BAC vector and the insert by UV spectrophotometry or by quantitative analysis on an agarose gel. 4. If the BAC vector was digested with only one restriction enzyme or with restriction enzymes leaving compatible or blunt ends, the digested BAC vector has to be dephosphorylated prior to its purification by agarose gel electrophoresis to suppress self-ligation of the BAC vector.

In general, the cloning of CoV full-length cDNAs in BACs allows the stable propagation of the infectious clone in E. coli DH10B cells. If a residual toxicity, characterized by a small colony phenotype and a delay in the bacterial growth, is observed during the assembly of the infectious clone, we recommend inserting the cDNA fragment responsible for this toxicity in the last cloning step to minimize the toxicity problem. Additionally, the infectious clone can be stabilized by the insertion of a synthetic intron to disrupt the toxic region identified in the viral genome (14). The intron insertion site has to be precisely designed to generate 5 and 3 intron splice sites matching the consensus sequences of mammalian introns (15) and to restore the viral sequence after intron splicing during the translocation of the viral RNA expressed in the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. The probability of splicing for every insertion site is estimated using the HSPL program, designed to predict splice sites in human DNA sequences (16). 8. Cultures of BAC transformed bacteria should be grown from a single colony isolated from a freshly streaked selective plate. Subculturing directly from glycerol stocks or plates that have been stored for a long time may lead to loss of the construct. 9. LB broth is the recommended culture medium, since richer broths such as TB (Terrific Broth) lead to extremely high cell densities, which can overload the purification system, resulting in lower yield and less purity of the BAC DNA. 10. When other kits are used instead of the QIAprep Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), equivalent modifications have to be included to optimize the recovery of BAC DNA. 11. To avoid DNA degradation and unwanted rearrangements owing to culture overaging, it is important to prevent the culture from growing up to the late stationary growth phase. 12. The use of a swinging bucket rotor is recommended for the last isopropanol precipitation step to facilitate the further resuspension of the BAC DNA. After washing with 70% ethanol, air-dry the pellet for only 5 min. Never use vacuum, as overdrying the pellet will make the BAC DNA difficult to dissolve. Carefully remove any additional liquid drops, add 250 l of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (DNA dissolves better under slightly alkaline conditions), and resuspend the DNA overnight at 4 \u2022 C. To prevent plasmid shearing, avoid vortexing or pipetting to promote resuspension of the BAC DNA. Transfer the DNA to a clean 1.5-ml microfuge tube, remove any possible resin traces by centrifugation for 1 min in a table-top microfuge, and keep the supernatant in a clean tube at 4 \u2022 C. If the purified BAC DNA is not going to be used for a long period of time we recommend storage at -20 \u2022 C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles to prevent plasmid shearing. 13. For efficient cell transformation, bacterial culture OD at 550 nm should not exceed 0.8. To ensure that the culture does not grow to a higher density, OD measurement every 20 min after 3 h of growth is highly recommended. 14. Take care when decanting the supernatant as the bacterial pellets lose adherence in 10% glycerol. 15. The Qiagen QIAEX II resin can be used to efficiently purify DNA fragments from 40 bp to 50 kb from aqueous solutions and from standard or low-melt agarose gels in TAE or TBE buffers. Other commercial kits are available, but check whether they have been optimized for purification of DNA fragments larger than 10 kb, as most BAC constructs used during the assembly of the infectious clone are larger than 10 kb. 16. Ethidium bromide-DNA complex excitation by UV light may cause photobleaching of the dye and single-strand breaks. To minimize both effects, use a long-wavelength UV illumination (302 nm instead of 254 nm) to cut the desired DNA bands from the agarose gel. 17. The large size of the BAC vectors reduces the ligation efficiency. To increase this efficiency, it is essential to use larger amounts of vector, insert, and T4 DNA ligase than when using conventional plasmids. 18. Most electroporation machines contain programs with defined parameters for transforming specific cell types. In this case, choose the program containing the conditions closest to those described in this protocol. 19. The presence of salt increases the conductivity of the solution and could cause arcing during the electrical pulse, drastically reducing the transformation efficiency. If arcing occurs, use a smaller amount of the ligation reaction in the electroporation or remove salt from the DNA using any commercial kit or by extraction with phenol:chloroform followed by precipitation with ethanol and 2 M ammonium acetate. 20. Plating volumes higher than 200 l of electroporated cells on a single plate may inhibit the growth of transformants owing to the large number of dead cells resulting from electroporation. If only small numbers of transformant colonies are expected, the recommendation is to spread 200 l-aliquots of the electroporated cells on different plates. 21. A mix of small and large colonies indicates that the cloned DNA fragment presents some toxicity when amplified in E. coli. Choose the small colonies, which may contain the correct insert, and always grow the bacteria containing this recombinant BAC plasmid at 30 \u2022 C to minimize the toxicity problem. In this case, we strongly recommend inserting this toxic DNA fragment into the infectious clone in the last cloning step, in order to reduce the manipulation and minimize the possibility of introducing unwanted mutations. Infectious BAC cDNA clones presenting a residual toxicity should be grown at 30 \u2022 C. 22. It is important to avoid overloading the reaction by adding too many bacteria, which may alter the ionic balance of the reaction and inhibit the amplification by the Taq polymerase. 23. We recommend using this storage method for BAC clones that present a residual toxicity and are not fully stable when amplified in E. coli. 24. All work involving SARS-CoV has to be performed in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) laboratory, following the guidelines of the European Commission and the National Institutes of Health. 25. Do not add antibiotics to media during transfection as this causes cell death.",

In this case, optimization of the transfection of the desired cells with the BAC clone using Lipofectamine 2000 should be required.

Incubate the culture overnight at 37 \u2022 C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm). 2. Inoculate two aliquots of 500 ml of prewarmed SOB medium with 0.5 ml of the overnight culture in separate 2-liter flasks. Incubate the flasks at 37 \u2022 C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) until the OD at 550 nm reaches 0.7 (this can take 4-5 h) (see Note 13).3. Transfer the flasks to an ice-water bath for about 20 min. Swirl the culture occasionally to ensure that cooling occurs evenly. From this point on, it is crucial that the temperature of the bacteria not rise above 4 \u2022 C. 4. Transfer the cultures to two ice-cold 500-ml centrifuge bottles and harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6000 \u00d7 g (6000 rpm in a Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 500 ml of icecold 10% glycerol in sterile water. 5. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6000 \u00d7 g (6000 rpm in a Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 15 min at 4 \u2022 C. Carefully pour off the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 250 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol (see Note 14). 6. Repeat step 5 reducing the resuspension volume to125 ml for each cell pellet. 7. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6000 \u00d7 g (6000 rpm in a Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 15 min at 4 \u2022 C. Carefully pour off the supernatant (see Note 14) and remove any remaining drops of buffer using a Pasteur pipette attached to a vacuum line. 8. Resuspend the cells in a final volume of 3 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol, avoiding the generation of bubbles. This volume has been calculated to reach an optimal cell concentration of 2-4 \u00d7 10 10 cells/ml. 9. Transfer 50 l of the suspension to an ice-cold electroporation cuvette (0.2-cm gap) and test whether arcing occurs when an electrical discharge is applied with the electroporation apparatus using the conditions described in Section 3.2.3.3, step 4. Arcing is usually manifested by the generation of a popping sound in the cuvette during the electrical pulse. If arcing occurs, wash the cell suspension once more with 100 ml of 10% glycerol and repeat steps 7 and 8. 10. Dispense 100-l aliquots of the final cell suspension into sterile, ice-cold 1.5-ml microfuge tubes, freeze quickly in a dry-ice methanol bath, and transfer to a -70 \u2022 C freezer.

In the case of blunt-ended DNAs, to improve the ligation efficiency use 225 ng of vector, the corresponding amount of insert, and 6 Weiss units of T4 DNA ligase, and incubate the reaction mixtures for 20 h at 14 \u2022 C. 3.2.3.3. TRANSFORMATION OF DH10B COMPETENT CELLS BY ELECTROPORATION 1. Thaw the electrocompetent DH10B cells at room temperature and transfer them to an ice bath. 2. For each transformation, pipette 50 l of electrocompetent cells into an ice-cold sterile 1.5-ml microfuge tube and place it on ice together with the electroporation cuvettes. 3. Add 2 l of the ligation reaction (about 20 ng of DNA) and incubate the mixture of DNA and competent cells on ice for 1 min. For routine transformation with supercoiled BACs, add 0.1 ng of DNA in a final volume of 2 l. Include all the appropriate positive and negative controls. 4. Set the electroporation machine to deliver an electrical pulse of 25 F capacitance, 2.5 kV, and 100 \u2340 resistance (see Note 18). 5. Add the DNA/cells mixture into the cold electroporation cuvette avoiding bubble formation and ensuring that the DNA/cells mixture sits at the bottom of the cuvette. Dry the outside of the cuvette with filter paper and place the cuvette in the electroporation device.",

Also plate susceptible cells (Vero E6 in the case of SARS-CoV) at the required confluence for the amplification of the recombinant virus after transfection.2. Before transfection, equilibrate the Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Gib-coBRL. Invitrogen) at room temperature and put the DNA (see Note 26) and the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent on ice. For each transfection sample, prepare transfection mixtures in sterile microfuge tubes as follows: a. Dilute 5 g of the BAC clone in 250 l of Opti-MEM medium. Mix carefully, avoiding prolonged vortexing or pipetting to prevent plasmid shearing. b. Mix Lipofectamine 2000 gently before use. Dilute 12 l of Lipofectamine 2000 in 250 l of Opti-MEM medium, mix by vortexing, and incubate the diluted Lipofectamine 2000 at room temperature for 5 min. c. Combine the diluted DNA with diluted Lipofectamine 2000, mix carefully, and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. 4. Add the 500 l of the DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 mixture onto the washed cells and mix by rocking the plate back and forth. Incubate the cells at 37 \u2022 C for 6 h (see Note 27). 5. Remove the transfection medium, wash the cells with trypsin-EDTA solution, and detach the cells using 300 l of trypsin-EDTA solution. Add 700 l of growth media to collect the cells and reseed them over a confluent monolayer of susceptible cells containing 1 ml of normal growth medium. 6. Incubate at 37 \u2022 C until a clear cytopathic effect is observed. 7. Analyze the presence of virus in the supernatant by titration. 8.

Although the BAC DNA prepared by this method is contaminated with up to 30% of bacterial genomic DNA, it is suitable for analysis by restriction enzyme digestion or PCR. 3.2.1.2. ISOLATION OF ULTRAPURE BAC PLASMIDS FROM LARGE-SCALE CULTURES 1. Large-scale preparation of ultrapure BAC DNA suitable for all critical applications, including subcloning, DNA sequencing or transfection experiments is performed by alkaline lysis with the Qiagen Large-Construct Kit, which has been specifically developed and adapted for BAC purification. This kit integrates an ATP-dependent exonuclease digestion step that enables efficient removal of bacterial genomic DNA contamination to yield ultrapure BAC DNA. 2. Inoculate a single colony from a freshly streaked plate (LB agar plate containing 12.5 g/ml chloramphenicol) (see Note 8) in 5 ml of LB medium containing 12.5 g/ml chloramphenicol and incubate for 8 h at 37 \u2022 C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm).3. Dilute 1 ml of the culture into 500 ml of selective LB medium (see Note 9) prewarmed to 37 \u2022 C and grow the cells with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) in a 2-liter flask at 37 \u2022 C for 12-16 h, to an OD at 550 nm between 1.2 and 1.5. This cell density typically corresponds to the transition from a logarithmic to a stationary growth phase (see Note 11). 4. Harvest the bacterial cells by centrifugation at 6000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u2022 C and purify the BAC DNA with the Qiagen Large-Construct Kit according to the manufacturer's specifications (see Note 12). Depending of the size of the BAC, yields of 20-35 g of ultrapure BAC DNA can be obtained.",
