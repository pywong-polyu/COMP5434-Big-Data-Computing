This study examines the effect of quarantine on young adults by assessing depression, anxiety, stress and the experience of positive and negative affect. The role of potential risk factors such as disruption of normal life, perceived threat of the disease, acquaintance with someone infected and gender; and protective factors, such as adherence to a daily routine and altruism was evaluated. An online questionnaire entailing demographics, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), measures of life disruption, perceived threat and adherence to a daily routine and an altruism scale was completed by 1018 undergraduates. Increased levels of depression, anxiety, stress and negative affect were found. Life disruption and perceived threat of the disease were risk factors in all psychological distress measures, while a stable, satisfying daily routine and altruism mitigated the negative consequences. Gender was a moderator. Acknowledging the psychological effect of quarantine on young adults should be the starting point for interventions. Helping people build a new routine and assign an altruistic meaning to the confinement can protect psychological health.",

On 10 March with no deaths and just 89 confirmed cases, the government suspended the operation of all educational institutions. Within a week an unprecedented lockdown was imposed nationwide. A large \"we stay home\" campaign emphasised the need for social distancing and hygiene measures. Greece was one of the few countries that took strict measures early in the outbreak, despite their impact on the country's vulnerable economy. As a result, the number of infections was low, saving human lives.",

A nationwide research found that more than a third experienced psychological distress (Qiu et al., 2020) and nearly a fifth had depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality (Huang & Zhao, 2020) . College students exhibited high anxiety associated with the financial consequences of the outbreak and the changes in daily life (Cao et al., 2020) . Wang et al. (2020) found that more than half of the participants (53.8%) experienced moderate or severe psychological impact, while 16.5, 28.8 and 8.1% reported moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Subsequent studies in Europe outlined comparable consequences on psychological health. In Italy, a country that experienced one of the highest rates of deaths, anxiety and distress rates reached 32.1 and 41.8%, respectively . PTSD symptoms were reported by 27.72% followed by a high increase of negative mood such as helplessness, preoccupation, insecurity, sadness, fear and boredom . Some studies reported stress levels up to 50.12% (Cellini et al., 2020) and sleep problems in more than half of the participants Cellini et al., 2020) . Similarly, in Spain a sizable percentage of adults exhibited depressive, anxiety and PTSD symptoms (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sanguino et al., 2020) . Students were significantly affected displaying even higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress than university workers (Odriozola-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2020) .",

Thus, the first aim of this study was to evaluate the early psychological effects of COVID-19 on non-infected young adults in Greece by assessing depression, anxiety, stress and the experience of positive and negative affect during the quarantine. Undergraduate students were the focus of the study as they constitute a vulnerable group for mental health problems (Auerbach et al., 2018) that can be exacerbated in times of crisis. The second aim of the study was to explore the role of potential risk and protective factors that have been understudied. The risk factors examined were life disruption, perceived threat of the disease and knowing someone infected. It was hypothesised that depression, anxiety, stress and negative affect will be positively associated with the extent of life disruption, the subjective evaluation of the risk posed by the disease and the acquaintance with someone infected. Adherence to a daily routine and altruism were explored as potential protective factors. Although keeping a routine during quarantine has been proposed as a way to reduce mental health problems (Fiorillo & Gorwood, 2020) , this recommendation has not been verified. Regarding the protective role of altruism Brooks et al. (2020) assumed that quarantine might be more bearable to those who believe that their confinement would benefit others. However, the evidence was limited in medical staff (Liu et al., 2012) and remains to be testified. We hypothesised that a stable daily routine and a prosocial altruistic tendency will be associated with less psychological distress.",

(2) Depression, stress and anxiety were measured with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) validated in Greek (Lyrakos et al., 2011) . The scale consists of three self-reported scales with seven items each, designed to assess depression (e.g. \"I felt that I had nothing to look forward to\") anxiety (e.g. \"I felt scared without any good reason\") and stress (e.g. \"I found it difficult to relax\"). Participants rated each item on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (almost always) indicating how much the item applied to them over the past week. The sum for each subscale was calculated with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress. The scores were doubled to be comparable to DASS-42. Participants were classified to normal, mild, moderate, severe and extremely severe levels using the recommended cut-off points: depression (0-8, 10-12, 14-20, 22-26, 28-42), anxiety (0-6, 8-10, 12-14, 16-18, 20-42) and stress (0-14, 16-18, 20-24, 26-32, 34-42) . Cronbach's alphas were .87 .84 and .87 for the depression, anxiety and stress scales, respectively.",

Participants rated the prevalence of each emotion during the last week on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (very much). Two sums were calculated, one by adding up the positive and one by adding up the negative affect items. Cronbach's alphas were .84 for the positive and .83 for the negative affect scales.

Participants rated each item on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). A mean perceived threat score was calculated for each participant with higher values corresponding to increased threat. The internal consistency of the scale was high (Cronbach's alpha .82).

A mean score was calculated with higher means indicating more disruption. (6) Adherence to daily routine was assessed with seven items assessing whether the respondents had a stable and satisfying routine during the quarantine (e.g. \"I have a stable routine\"). Each statement was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot). Higher mean scores indicated a more structured daily routine.

Five items assessed individuals' voluntary helping behaviour motived by concern for the needs of others (e.g. \"I feel that if I help someone, they should help me in the future\"-reverse scored). Participants indicated whether each statement described them on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (does not describe me at all) to 5 (describes me greatly) with higher scores showing more altruism.

The unprecedented, mandatory countrywide quarantine disrupted students' life. They perceived COVID-19 as a threat for their family members more than for themselves, a finding reflecting their concern about the vulnerability of older people. A similar pattern was observed in previous studies (Germani et al., 2020; Odriozola-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2020) where the participants were more concerned about family members contracting the disease than themselves. The findings revealed elevated levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Lyrakos et al. (2011) found that the mean scores in adult Greek population for depression, anxiety and stress were 8.05 (SD 9.6), 7.19 (SD = 7.7) and 12.46 (SD = 9.82), respectively. Compared to these normative means before the COVID-19 outbreak the depression and stress scores were raised. It is concerning that more than a third of the participants (35.6%) exhibited moderate to extremely severe depression symptoms, while 31.8 and 19.5% reported moderate to extremely severe stress and anxiety respectively. The mean scores and the levels of depression, anxiety and stress were very close to the ones reported in Italy (Mazza et al., 2020) and among University students in Spain (Odriozola-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2020) using the same scales.",

This might reflect the high interest in the rapidly evolving health emergency. On the contrary, negative affect was high (M = 22.05). The most prevalent negative affects were distress, upset and nervousness.

Most of them lost their jobs and were separated from their friends and partners. For the first time there was a shift from the traditional classroom to e-classes.

Although fear in a fundamental adaptive response in the face of a threat that can generate protective behaviours, excessive fears can lead to adverse psychological consequences. In a study among university students in USA, the fear about their own health and the health of their loved ones was the main stressor of their psychological health (Son et al., 2020) . COVID-19 worries and low perceived likelihood of surviving have been associated with psychological maladjustment (Germani et al., 2020) and 8 KORNILAKI stress , respectively. Several factors could have raised perceived threat. At the time of the study, the National Public Health Organisation described COVID-19 as an invisible and insidious enemy and the control of the situation as an ongoing battle, while the media were flooded with images of hospitals in Italy and Spain counting hundreds of deaths every day. Although we did not explore the sources fuelling perceived threat, excessive social media exposure has been blamed for heightening anxiety and depression (Gao et al., 2020) .",

The effect of this variable was substantial. Previous studies have examined one component of daily routine, that of sleep, and found that better sleep quality related to less post-traumatic stress symptoms (Liu et al., 2020) . In the present study, those who had the ability to adapt to the new circumstances and sustain a gratifying routine while staying home exhibited less mental health problems. This is because routine is associated with feelings of safety, confidence and comfort and creates positive feelings (Avni-Babad, 2011). Mundane routines are among the things that make life meaningful and generate a sense of purpose in life (Heintzelman & King, 2019) . They also entrain and regulate the human circadian rhythms that are essential for mental health (Grandin et al., 2006) .",

Our finding adds to previous limited evidence on outbreaks showing the medical staff's altruistic acceptance of the risk to help SARS patients decreased the odds of having depressive symptoms (Liu et al., 2012) . Altruistic behaviour is motivated by other-oriented concerns and is highly correlated with social responsibility, the tendency to act in a manner that benefits the society (Carlo & Randall, 2002) . It is possible that altruistic individuals feel responsible to confine the spread of the disease for the welfare of others and that sense of obligation makes quarantine more bearable. The ascription of altruistic meaning to quarantine might help them cope with the situation alleviating their psychological distress.",

            "text": "The findings have several implications for social policy makers, mental health professionals and academic institutions. The psychological effect of quarantine should not be underestimated. University students are a vulnerable population and their institutions should not only prepare the transition to distant education but take also provision for their increased psychological needs during this challenging time. Students should have access to intervention programmes addressing their concerns, fears and psychological difficulties. Mental health services should support students to adjust to the \"new normal\" by employing adaptive coping strategies. The findings suggest that helping people reorganise their daily routine can be an effective way of coping. Building a new routine, enriching daily life with gratifying activities, having stable sleep-wake and meal times can create a sense of regularity. A stable routine in times of uncertainty can be a source of security. Moreover, stressing the altruistic component of the quarantine can potentially be protective for psychological health. Increasing the concern for others, especially to those vulnerable, can promote social connectedness and join people in the common effort to control the outbreak. It is believed that the altruistic aspect of health messages in UK had a positive effect on wellbeing compared to the messages stressing the obligation to stay home (Holmes et al., 2020) .",

Longitudinal studies are needed to examine the long-term effects of this pandemic and cause-effect relationships. The difficulty of obtaining a random sample in short time led to the snowball sampling method. Thus, selection bias cannot be ruled out. Females were overrepresented in the study, possibly because the questionnaire was first distributed in a department that had predominantly female students. The participants were undergraduate students and that limits the generalizability of the findings. We do not know how many of them belonged to vulnerable mental health groups before the outbreak. Moreover, due to lack of research, DASS-21 scores were compared with the normative data of Greek adult population and not of university students, a population known to have elevated prevalence of mental health problems (Auerbach et al., 2018) . The findings reflect mental health at a specific time point. The quarantine lasted 3 more weeks after data were collected. Therefore, assumptions about the psychological effect of the whole quarantine period cannot be made. Although it might be reasonable to assume that the prolonged duration could have further strained psychological health, it is also likely that the emerging containment of the disease could have created feelings of hope and relief.",
