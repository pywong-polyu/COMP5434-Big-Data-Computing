A consistent boost in diagnostic and clinical decision-making was reported across all studies in the literature. One study found that HVRs decreased the stress level in many families and improved their quality of life. Training in performing good-quality videos is necessary and increases the diagnostic value of HVRs. Conclusions HVRs can be of diagnostic value in epilepsy diagnosis and management. HVRs are low cost, widespread, and may provide great support for neurologists. It is important to train patients and caregivers in performing good quality videos to optimize this useful tool and to guarantee safety standards during the recording.",

            "text": "Epilepsy is a clinical diagnosis, and the accurate characterization of seizures is of utmost importance for prognosis and for the appropriate choice of treatment [1, 2] . Differential diagnosis for seizures is broad. Even experienced neurologists can be misled when the diagnosis needs to be inferred from descriptions provided by family members or caregivers who witnessed the seizures. Indeed, misdiagnosis in epilepsy is not uncommon with rates varying from 4.6 to 30% across several studies [3] . Currently, neurologists are supported in the diagnosis of epilepsy by neuroimaging studies and neurophysiological techniques which allow a prolonged recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. However, differential diagnosis, particularly with psychogenic nonepileptic events (PNEE) and nonepileptic paroxysmal events (NEPE), is a clinical challenge and can contribute to the rate of misdiagnoses in epilepsy [4] . In this scenario, inpatient long-term video-electroencephalographic (VEEG) monitoring has largely demonstrated its clinical value in differential diagnosis of paroxysmal events with a detection rate of epileptic seizures of almost 70% [5] . False negatives at VEEG can be attributed to low frequency of events or to their association with specific settings that are difficult to reproduce in a hospital environment. Moreover, some patients with epilepsy, especially those with psychiatric comorbidities, may present both seizures and PNEE, thus complicating the diagnostic process [6] . Social and economic conditions may further represent an obstacle for access to outpatient examinations in developing countries, with a consequent delay in diagnosis [7] . Although VEEG remains the gold standard for diagnosis, a detailed clinical history and witnessed description of behavior during ictal events remains a mainstay in epilepsy diagnosis. However, witnessed description of seizures usually has low reliability as it depends mainly on the observers' level of medical knowledge [8] .",

The expert panel discussed relevant data from the systematic review of the English-language medical literature in a series of conference calls. Critical evaluations included study design, numbers of patients, definitions used, outcomes reported, and potential biases. The committee members synthesized the data, and inconsistencies were resolved by means of discussion until a consensus was achieved. The final quality and safety recommendations were reviewed and approved by all nine participants. Table 1 displays the 17 identified studies [10] [11] [12] [13] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] and case reports that have included clinical application of home/ smartphone videos in diagnosing PSLE. Studies were carried out in North America, Europe, and Asia. Below, we summarize relevant clinical aspects of reported studies.",

Two studies [12, 27] employed a video-based survey to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of HVRs among medical professionals. Huang et al.

HVRs increased the mean correct diagnosis percentage by 3.9% for epileptic events and 11.5% for non-epileptic events. Similarly, Wasserman and colleagues [27] showed 10 video episodes' recordings of PSLE to 46 medical participants (20 neurologists and 26 non-neurologists).

A consistent boost in diagnostic and clinical decision-making was reported across all studies in the literature. This suggests that HVRs are effective, timesaving, and provide consistency of care in different centers and across continents, with high practical value and universal relevance. The results of our systematic review also highlight the recommendations of the operational classification of seizure type by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) [30] which encourage the use of supporting information including videos recorded by family members as part of the diagnostic process for seizures. At the same time, the reviewed articles indicate the clinical observation of PSLE is usually sufficient in differentiating seizure's semiology and differentiating epileptic seizures from PNEE, even before viewing the EEG. However, it should be mentioned that HVRs had the highest clinical value only for epileptologists, while general neurologists and nonneurologists usually required additional diagnostic tools and showed lower interrater agreement [27] . Therefore, since it has been proven that discriminating seizure's semiology is a learned skill and requires specific neurologic training [8, 31] , specific education for the task may be needed in order to fully exploit the clinical benefit provided by HVRs.",

PNEE still represent a clinical challenge even for the experienced neurologist since their manifestations are greatly variable and often resemble those of epileptic seizures [32] . The ILAE Nonepileptic Seizures Task Force published recommendations indicate that HVRs can provide some advantages, but their use is not recommended because the diagnostic yield of typical events recorded by witnesses has not been systematically evaluated [33] . However, the results of recent studies have started to challenge this notion, and we suggest that HVRs should not only be recommended but that they may also represent a \"red flag\" for seizure mimic if volunteered by patients, as suggested by Tatum et al. [10] , probably because they respond to the need of patients to confirm that their episodes are \"real\". Indeed, the possibility to diagnose PNEE after the first attack at the emergency department would largely benefit this patient population as it may avoid unnecessary examinations, expedite treatment planning, and reduce the risk of undesired side effects from unnecessary antiseizure medications.",
