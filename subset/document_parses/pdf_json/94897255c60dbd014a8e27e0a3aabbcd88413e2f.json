Contrary to expectations, credit rating agencies pursued mostly a business-as-usual approach and reviewed sovereign ratings when they were due for regulatory purposes rather than in response to the rapid developments of the pandemic. Despite their limited reaction to the ongoing pandemic, sovereign rating news from S&P and Moody's still conveyed price-relevant information to the bond markets.",

By March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and by October 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2020a) forecast a global economic contraction of 4.4% for the year 2020. For perspective, the Great Financial Crisis saw a global contraction of 0.1% (IMF, 2020b) . Fiscal responses to the economic crisis have driven public sector leverage to an all-time high, rendering sovereigns more vulnerable to future shocks, especially if and when interest rates rise from their historic depths. 1 The unusually brisk and synchronised deterioration of economic and fiscal fundamentals across the globe provides an unprecedented opportunity to assess the reactions of credit rating agencies (CRAs) to sudden shocks. CRAs are relied upon as leading sources of credit risk information and act as gatekeepers to global debt markets (Kedia, Rajgopal, & Zhou, 2014) . Analysing ratings actions from January 2020 to March 2021, we are the first to empirically investigate the extent to which CRAs delivered on their remit to inform market participants of changing in creditworthiness in a timely, transparent and independent manner.",

            "text": "We analyse rating actions of the three biggest CRAs (S&P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings), which together represent a market share of more than 90%. 2 Between January 2020 and March 2021, three CRAs issued a total of 99 sovereign rating downgrades on 48 countries, affecting 35% of their rated sovereign portfolio. We find that compared to previous crises, CRAs have reacted with considerable caution. For example, S&P with a coverage of 121 countries, issued 20 (31) downgrades on 19 (26) countries in the six (14) months since February 2020, amounting to 15.7 (21.5)% of its sovereign portfolio. For comparison, in the six months following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, S&P downgraded 31 sovereigns, or 25% of its (then smaller) sovereign portfolio (Kraemer, 2020) . 3 Why should the severe contraction during COVID-19 induce fewer downgrades than the comparatively mild contraction during the great financial crisis? One potential consideration is the business-as-usual scheduling of ratings reviews by CRAs. The frequency of sovereign ratings reviews is subject to regulation. For example, for sovereign followed by rating analysts based in the EU, 4 CRAs are required to publicly announce ratings reviews on two to three dates in the forthcoming calendar year. 5 Regulations permit CRAs to conduct reviews ahead of schedule when circumstances require (EC, 2013) . A reasonable assessment would be that the pandemic constitutes a sufficiently large change in circumstances to merit early ratings reviews from CRAs. CRAs were effectively free to review any rating at any time following the outbreak of the pandemic.",

To examine whether the severity of the health crisis (case and mortality rates) affected sovereign ratings actions, we compile a novel panel dataset of rating actions for 137 countries issued by three leading CRAs between 30 January 2020 and 31 March 2021. The effect of COVID-19 is measured by the number of confirmed cases per million published by Johns Hopkins database. We establish the starting date of our sample (30 January 2020) as the day when WHO announced COVID-19 a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\". Our identification strategy corrects for the fact that the pandemic did not hit all countries at the same time. Namely, the country enters the sample only after the first confirmed case has been recorded. We regress rating actions against the number of confirmed cases per million, a measure of CRA's timeliness based on the time elapsed since the preceding public ratings review, and country-level controls.",

            "text": "Our key finding is that rather than proactively issuing early ratings reviews, CRAs in many cases kept coasting in a business-as-usual mode, reviewing ratings close to their scheduled dates set before the pandemic. For each month that the preceding rating review aged, the probability of a downgrade increased by 0.14% and that of a negative outlook or watch by 0.13%. If sovereign credit committees were strictly held on an analytical as-needed basis, the time that has elapsed since the previous review should not have any impact on the likelihood of a rating action. The fact that the coefficient is positive and highly significant (at 1% level) provides evidence that CRAs did in many instances simply wait until a review was due before lowering a rating or outlook. This is an important and surprising finding. In the midst of a disrupting pandemic, which clearly constituted an external unanticipated shock, the case for an accelerated review would have been exceptionally easy to make, both internally as well as externally. Regulators would not have been able to object to the assessment that previous assumptions going into sovereign ratings had been overtaken by events and a fresh look would have been called for. Our finding reveals important and original insights compared with the previous crisis of similar systemic nature. During the sovereign debt crisis in the early 2010s, CRAs were criticised for what some considered to be excessive downgrades on sovereign ratings of Euro area countries. The downgrades have been caused by a common external shock affecting all Euro area sovereigns to varying degrees. 6 Similarly in 2020, almost the entirety of rated sovereigns has been affected by the external shock of the pandemic. Had the CRAs reacted in 2020 in a similar fashion as they did a decade earlier, under what were substantially milder circumstances, we would have obtained insignificant coefficients on the time elapsed since the last review.",

Namely, they were unable to realise the timing of rating actions according to the CRAs' regulatory review calendar and/or to adjust the spreads accordingly. It follows that rating actions in the pandemic are still treated as 'news'. Sovereign spreads increase by an average 71.06 basis points in the [0; +1] window of a negative outlook announcement compared with the benchmark case of no announcement. Spreads are strongly responsive to S&P's rating actions, whilst moderate if the actions are from Moody's. Similar to episodes of market turbulence in the past (Afonso, Gomes, & Taamouti, 2014) , negative sovereign rating news give important information value to the capital markets. Additionally, we confirm that there is no relationship between case rates and the bond spreads, which substantiates our earlier findings concerning the muted effects of depth of the pandemic on sovereign risk. On the other hand, we find evidence of an attenuating effect of government measures aiming at containing the virus and bond spreads. Contrary to CRAs' pessimistic view, the government's actions aiming at controlling the virus are perceived by the markets as positive signals.",

Despite their prevalence in the market, unsolicited ratings remain one of the most controversial aspects of the industry 8 (Fulghieri, Strobl, & Xia, 2014) . For example, bank and corporate ratings literature finds that issuers who do not pay for ratings on average receive lower assessment (Bannier, Behr, & Guttler, 2010; Poon, 2003) . The opposite is found in the sovereign ratings market (Gibert, 2019) . Following changes in sovereign solicitation disclosure rules, Klusak, Alsakka, and Gwilym (2017) find banks domiciled in sovereigns which switched their status to unsolicited rating receive a penalty in a form of lower ratings. Regulators and investors are interested in this feature as both types of ratings are allowed for regulatory purposes.",

Part of the regulatory requirement is that methodologies are publicly accessible and that sovereign ratings are reviewed at least once per year, or six-monthly for sovereign that fall under EU-regulation (EC, 2013) . The rating decisions are taken by committee process, where committee members apply the appropriate methodology and vote on the final decision of the rating, and/or the outlook on the rating. Because CRAs aim to \"rate through the cycle\" they find themselves in a constant dilemma between reaching stability versus accuracy in their ratings (Altman & Rijken, 2004) . Generally, CRAs intend to give ratings which are stable over time and not influenced by temporary fluctuations due to the nature of the business cycle. One of the key challenges for CRAs is therefore the identification of \"fundamental\" changes in variables that are expected to have an impact on creditworthiness. To help with their efforts 9 CRAs apply additional credit warnings such as outlook or watch to show possible direction and timing in their rating (Hamilton & Cantor, 2004) .",

In a similar vein CRAs were blamed for failing to recognise the 1997 East Asian crisis and aggravating it even further by excessive sovereign downgrades (Mora, 2006) . On the other hand, CRAs also stand accused of worsening the 2010 European debt crisis by downgrading ratings of Eurozone sovereigns too far and too fast . Although the inertia during times of sudden shocks might be driven by the underlying business models of CRAs it is also partly related to regulatory negligence on the side of regulators and market players. Users of ratings often over-relied on ratings without making their in-house assessments (House of Commons, 2012) . In addition, regulators kept a blind eye for a very long time (BOE, 2011) . Finally, the ratings became strongly imbedded into regulations and this assured investors about their reliability and encouraged herd behaviour.",

Using the epidemiology model, Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020) study the interaction between the pandemic and economic decisions and reveal a trade-off between restrictive economic interventions (lockdown) and costs of the spread of the disease. Following, a growing survey literature links how the COVID-19 outbreak affected consumer beliefs, macroeconomic expectations, anxieties and preferences (Binder, 2020; Fetzer et al., 2020) . Several studies collate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected global economic and financial affairs in comparison with the previous health (e.g., SARS, MERS, Ebola, Zika) and financial crises (Correia, Luck, & Verner, 2020; Goodell, 2020; Izzeldin, Muradoglu, Pappas, & Sivaprasad, 2021) . Treating COVID-19 as a financial crisis rather than an epidemic 10 Izzeldin et al. (2021) apply sectoral analysis to G7 economies and find that the most affected sectors are Health Care and Consumer services with Telecommunications and Technology the least. Moreover, authors find the response of financial markets to COVID-19 resembles that of previous financial crises rather than other pandemics. 11 Wang, Zhang, and Verousis (2021) estimate the effect of previous pandemics on innovation outputs and find that effects vary between countries and sectors. Sharif, Aloui, and Yarovaya (2020) suggest that compared to the Great Depression and the Global Financial Crisis, the COVID-19 crisis is unique, inter alia, in the way it produces a (figurative and literal) contagion effect. Akhtaruzzaman, Boubaker, and Sensoy (2020) find that the spillover can be mainly attributed to financial institutions.",

Moreover, CRAs often release contradicting ratings. Finally, there is a lead-lag relationship in sovereign credit rating announcements whereby S&P leads Moody's in downgrades and Fitch in both upgrades and downgrades (Alsakka & ap Gwilym, 2010) . 9 While regulators, and bond issuers appreciate rating stability, market participants such as investors of hedge funds or traders prefer ratings which are timely and accurate (Cantor & Mann, 2007) . 10 Others consider COVID-19 as a black swan event (e.g., Yarovaya, Brzeszczynski, Goodell, Lucey, & Lau, 2020 The only studies remotely connected to our research are Balajee (2020), Kargar et al. (2020) and Acharya and Steffen (2020) . Balajee (2020) in their study of 95 sovereigns between January and April 2020, find that sovereign ratings are amongst the most important determinants of fiscal stimulus packages undertaken by governments to tackle the pandemic. Ratings affect not only the amounts raised but also the timing of the stimulus packages being introduced. Authors document that on average, governments with low ratings issued 0.3% lower fiscal packages and delayed their response by 1.7 days. On the other hand, Kargar et al. (2020) and Acharya and Steffen (2020) investigate the liquidity of US corporate bonds in the wake of Federal Reserve interventions. Kargar et al. (2020) with a sample spanning between January and June 2020 (without access to the latest rating data for all the bonds) find that at the climax of the crisis liquidity conditions depreciated because dealers were unwilling to use their own balance sheets to absorb corporate debt. After Fed facilities such as 'purchase of corporate debt' were announced, the situation reversed. Acharya and Steffen (2020) show how differently the stock market evaluated firms depending on their liquidity. The authors find only firms in the category between A to AAA issued bonds following Fed's quantitative easing. In contrast, the lowest end of the investment grade firms (category BBB-) rushed to convert their commitments into cash. This \"dash for cash\" behaviour was observed amongst half of the converted credit line commitments and characterised firms with the potential of becoming 'fallen angels' 12 in the future.",

Forecasts for each variable for 2020 and 2021 are obtained from three IMF World Economic Outlook reports published in October 2019 (which did not take into account the impact of COVID-19), April 2020 and October 2020 (which did). For each of these three economic indicators (and in each report) we obtain the average forecast of 2020 and 2021 for each country. We then calculate the change of the average forecast in a report compared to that from the previous report. The IMF lowered the unweighted country average forecast for 2020/2021 of current account balance, net government lending/borrowing and GDP growth by 0.83%, 2.74% and 2.06%, respectively (Table 2, Panel I).

(1) using pooled sample containing rating revisions by all the three CRAs to establish the rating industry' general behaviour during the current health crisis.

Furthermore, we can identify the systematic effect of the case rates on rating actions by disentangling them from the country effects (Fracassi, Petry, & Tate, 2016) . For instance, it could be possible that the case rates merely reflect a well-designed health system operating in the well-functioning economy. 19 Secondly, we estimate regressions using individual CRA sub-samples to examine rating agencies' individual reaction to the pandemic. Although this approach has limitations, it is a common practice in the rating literature (Williams et al., 2013) . Therefore, we estimate Eq. (2): 16 During our sample period, there were just ten rating upgrades and 56 positive outlook/watch revisions across all three CRAs. Therefore, we merge positive rating actions with confirmations and non-actions into one category. 17 We have also estimated our model using mortality rates, and results remain mainly unchanged (See Appendix B and C). The literature suggests case rates offer advantages over the measure of mortality rates. For example, Ashraf, 2020 find that the stock market reacts stronger to the number of confirmed cases than to a number of deceased. 18 For example, the Fed dropped interest rates and issued support packages.",

We also divide the events by IMF regions (See Section 3.1). 20 The pooled sample of three CRAs contains 5171 observations for 137 sovereigns (Table 1 , Panel I, Columns 2 and 3). We identify 603 sovereign rating events which include 99 downgrades and 121 negative rating outlooks and credit watches with negative implications (Panel I, Columns 8, 6, and 5 respectively). Individually the number of sovereigns receiving negative rating reviews of S&P and Fitch accounts for approximately 47.46% and 64.29% of their sovereign ratings portfolio, respectively (Panel II and IV, Column 10). Surprisingly Fitch leads in all negative revisions with 40 downgrades and 47 negative outlook revisions (Panel IV, Columns 6 and 5). S&P follows with 31 downgrades and 41 negative/watch revisions (Panel II, Columns 6 and 5). Moody's appears the least active amongst the three CRAs. They negatively reviewed ratings of only 48 sovereigns (around 36.64% their sovereign rating portfolio) including 28 downgrades and 33 negative rating outlooks/credit watches (Panel III, Columns 7, 10, 6, and 5).

This result reveals that sovereign ratings are not always reviewed based on the needs and urgency caused by the pandemic observed in the changes of market fundamentals. In contrast, the decision to bring a sovereign rating to a committee seems to be also significantly driven by CRAs regulatory historic review dates and rating schedules. This is especially worrying as there is no obligation to wait until the next possible review date. CRAs can call a committee on any sovereign and change its rating at any time if they can make the argument that a fundamental change to the credit outlook has occurred (EC, 2013).",

One explanation could be that more prosperous and sophisticated economies have more resources to better absorb shocks without lasting damage to their creditworthiness. This includes their superior ability to mobilise fiscal Notes: This table presents the summary statistics, abbreviations and definitions of variables used in the multivariate analysis on 137 sovereigns rated by S&P, Moody's and Fitch for the period 30 Jan 2020-31 Mar 2021. \"Obs.\" is the number of observations. \"S.D.\" is the standard deviation. CAB_Outlook, NetLB_Outlook, GDP_Outlook, and CaseRates are winsorised per sub-sample at the 1st and 99th percentiles. Sources of data are explained in Section 3.1. and monetary support packages to cushion shocks in the short term. This is consistent with an empirical observation that higher ratings have historically been less volatile than lower rated categories (Kraemer & Gunter, 2020) . For instance, 73% of S&P's AAA-rated sovereigns will still be rated AAA ten years later. This number will be half (33% and 38%) for sovereigns rated in the BB or B categories respectively. The alternative explanation is that CRAs might present positive bias toward sovereigns of advanced economies. Some CRAs may still recall the political backlash that followed when they had lowered many AE ratings during the Euro area debt crisis (or, in the case of S&P, the downgrade of the US). In some instances, costly lawsuits in AE courts have been a consequence of downgrades (FT, 2015) . A significant tightening of rating regulations is also believed to have been a consequence of what policymakers may have considered excessive AE downgrades (De Haan & Amtenbrink, 2012) . The impact on business and operations may subconsciously have lingered in analysts' minds when making decisions on AE ratings, developing a subconscious statusquo bias. Also, CRAs have been told by the EU regulator to avoid quickfire downgrades during the pandemic in fear of worsening the situation (Reuters, 2020) . Table 5 presents results from Eq. (2) for each CRA sub-sample. Although our baseline result concerning the effects of macroeconomic variables on sovereign rating actions continue to hold, there is a heterogeneity across the three CRAs concerning the importance of each of the three macroeconomic variables. We find significant coefficients with negative signs on CAB_Outlook and GDP_Outlook in the sample of S&P's ratings (Spec. (2) ). However, they turn insignificant after controlling for region fixed effects (Spec. (3)). In the case of Moody's, GDP_Outlook and NetLB_Outlook are negative and significant whilst CAB_Outlook is insignificant (Spec. (3)). Finally, in the case of Fitch, GDP_Outlook is strongly significant with the predicted negative sign but CAB_Outlook is weakly significant with a positive sign (Spec. (3)). According to Afonso, Gomes, and Rother (2011) , the effect of current account balance on sovereign ratings is uncertain. Our obtained result for Fitch indicates that current account deficit is reflective of an accumulation of capital inflows, which fuels growth and improves sovereign creditworthiness. Therefore, deterioration in the CAB_Outlook will reduce the likelihood of a negative rating action.",

Such an outcome is not anticipated if bond investors are oblivious to the CRAs' rating calendars, and in consequence a business-as-usual approach is taken during the pandemic. To test this prediction, we regress the sovereign bond yield spreads on Count and Downaction using the sovereign credit rating actions announced by S&P, Moody's and Fitch during the period January 2020-March 2021. Our regressions utilise a large cross-country dataset of sovereign bond spreads obtained from Datastream. 25 We argue that an empirical analysis from the perspective of financial markets provides original insights to the literature. Recall that the current situation of the pandemic is different to the past episodes of market downturns which moved CRAs to the forefront of the debate. For example, one could observe accelerated rating committees during the 2010 European sovereign debt crisis when S&P reviewed all and downgraded several Euro area sovereigns in January 2012 (S&P, 2012) . Although CRAs' accelerating approach provided rating users with a full view of comparable ratings, it also subjected them to criticism from regulators. Public criticism against the CRAs also emerged during the 1997 Asian currency crisis and the 2007 global financial crisis. CRAs were blamed for following rather than leading the market (i.e., upgrades in good times and downgrades in bad times) (Kaminsky & Schmukler, 2012) . The pro-cyclicality of sovereign ratings exacerbates the euphoria amongst investors on the bond markets, thereby aggravating the market instability (Afonso et al., 2014; Reisen & Von Maltzan, 1999) . Therefore, if the markets can identify CRAs' change of approach (from accelerating review efforts in the past to adhering to the minimum regulatory requirements during the ongoing pandemic) then sovereign rating actions will not prompt as significant adjustment in sovereign credit spreads as documented in the past crises (Baum, Sch\u00e4fer, & Stephan, 2016; De Santis, 2014) . In this respect, our empirical analysis in this section makes an original contribution to the literature.",

Our results show that the markets do not realise there has been a change of working mode amongst global CRAs, particularly S&P and Moody's. Their rating actions announced during the pandemic still trigger significant reactions from the markets, especially the negative actions by S&P, which resembles what happened during the European sovereign debt crisis Alsakka, ap Gwilym, & Vu, 2017) .",

The estimates of \u03b2 4 on the interaction of Downaction with the government response index Gov-tResponse are negative and strongly significant at 1% level in the pooled sample and the sub-sample of S&P. It indicates that the restrictive measures put in place by governments in containing the spread of the virus have attenuating effects on the yield spreads when S&P announces a negative rating action. This result is interesting as it reveals that there is a disagreement between CRAs and the market participants regarding the counter measures imposed by governments during the pandemic. From the perspective of the market participants, restrictions measures are perceived positively. This might be because investors put more hope in a quick return to normality in countries that take prompt actions to contain the virus.

Second, actual sovereign rating announcements in the pandemic are still met with significant reactions in the sovereign credit spreads. Specifically, spreads can increase by 71 basis points in the window [0; +1] of a negative sovereign rating action in the pandemic. Amongst the CRAs, downgrades by S&P caused the largest market impact. Apart from the market oblivion to the CRAs business-as-usual mode, we find a smaller increase in yield spreads for countries actively engaged in a fight against the virus. Our finding implies that the CRAs and investors are in disagreement. CRAs were more likely to lower the rating when a government pulled the resources to stop the spread of the virus. Investors, on the other hand have rewarded decisive action by governments with lower spreads.",
