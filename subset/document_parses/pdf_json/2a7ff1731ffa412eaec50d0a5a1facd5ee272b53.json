We show that primary human CD8 + T cells strongly upregulate the expression of ACE2, the Spike protein receptor, during differentiation to CTLs. CTL pre-incubation with the Wuhan or Omicron Spike variants inhibits IS assembly and function, as shown by defective synaptic accumulation of TCRs and tyrosine phosphoproteins as well as defective centrosome and lytic granule polarisation to the IS, resulting in impaired target cell killing. These defects were reversed by anti-Spike antibodies that interfere with ACE2 binding and were reproduced by ACE2 engagement with Angiotensin-II or an anti-ACE2 antibody, but not by the ACE2 product Ang (1-7) . These results highlight a new strategy of immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 based on the Spike-dependent, ACE2mediated targeting of the lytic IS to prevent the elimination of infected cells.",

The killing machinery of CTLs includes the lytic granules, which are lysosome-like organelles enriched in granzymes and perforin, the recently described supramolecular attack particles (Balint et al., 2020) , and FasL, which is released both at the plasma membrane and in association with exosomes to trigger the Fas apoptosis pathway in target cells (Cassioli and Baldari, 2022) . While the specificity of killing is dependent on cognate cell recognition by T cell antigen receptor (TCR) interaction with major histocompatibility complex-bound peptide antigen (pMHC), selectivity is ensured by the precise delivery of the cytotoxic effectors to the target cell at the immune synapse (IS), a highly specialized signaling and secretory platform that forms at the CTL interface with its target (Douanne and Griffiths, 2021; Dustin and Choudhuri, 2016) .",

An inward actin flow allows for the centripetal movement of TCRs and co-stimulatory receptors to the IS center, eventually forming an F-actin ring that seals a space between the CTL and its target, the synaptic cleft. Additionally, the centrosome and secretory apparatus polarise towards the synaptic membrane, with microtubules providing tracks for the transport of the cytotoxic machinery to the target cell contact and its delivery into the synaptic cleft (Blumenthal and Burkhardt, 2020; Martin-Cofreces and Sanchez-Madrid, 2018) .",

However, following their differentiation, CTLs migrate to the site of infection, where they can be exposed to high virus concentrations. The finding that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Hoffmann et al., 2020) is expressed in activated T cells and mediates binding and internalisation of SARS-CoV-2 (Welch et al., 2022) suggests that, as a result of ACE2 engagement by the Spike protein, T cells may be directly modulated by the virus.",

Under these conditions CD8 + T cells differentiate to functional CTLs by day 5, as assessed by granzyme B (GzmB) expression and cytotoxicity (Fig.S1B,C) .

To understand whether Spike interferes with TCR signaling at an earlier stage of IS maturation we compared the outcome of CTL pretreatment with Spike-W on IS assembly in 5-min (nascent IS) versus 15-min (mature IS) conjugates. The defects in phosphotyrosine signaling and TCR/CD3 accumulation at the IS were clearly detectable in 5-min conjugates ( Fig.2A,B) , indicating that Spike-W impairs TCR signaling at an early step in IS formation. Consistent with this finding, the early synaptic accumulation of active ZAP-70, the protein tyrosine kinase responsible for coupling the TCR to the downstream tyrosine phosphorylation cascade (Au-Yeung et al., 2018) , was compromised in Spike-W pre-treated CTLs (Fig.2C ).",

The extracellular carboxypeptidase domain of ACE2 catalyses the conversion of Angiotensin (Ang)-I to Ang (1-9), and Ang-II and Ang (1-9) to the bioactive peptide Ang (1-7) which activates the receptor MAS1 on target cells (Samavati and Uhal, 2020) . However, ACE2 also acts as a receptor that modulates intracellular processes in a peptidase-independent manner through distinct contributions of its extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains, including integrin transactivation, regulation of aminoacid transporters and endocytosisdependent infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Danilczyk et al., 2006; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Inoue et al., 2007; Simons et al., 2021) . The fact that mAbs that prevent Spike interaction with ACE2 reverse the effects of Spike supports the notion that the inhibitory effects on IS formation are mediated by ACE2 signaling. To test this hypothesis we assessed the outcome of ACE2 engagement on IS assembly in CTLs, using as ligand an anti-ACE2 polyclonal Ab raised against the extracellular domain that blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry in target cells by competing with Spike for ACE2 binding (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . CTL pre-treatment with the anti-ACE2 Ab recapitulated the suppressive effects of Spike on IS assembly, including the synaptic accumulation of tyrosine phosphoproteins and TCR/CD3 complexes (Fig.5A (1-7) receptor MAS1. In this context, although we found MAS1 to be expressed in CD8 + T cell, its expression decreased during their differentiation to CTLs (Fig.S3G) .

The precise mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of Spike on IS assembly remains to be elucidated. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to ACE2 interferes with the assembly of a functional IS in CTLs by inhibiting the process at an early step. Of note, the Omicron variants suppress IS assembly to a similar extent as Spike-W, despite a higher binding affinity for ACE2 (Wrapp et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2022) , suggesting that Spike-W binding to ACE2 is sufficient to fully unleash the inhibitory potential of ACE2 engagement on this process. Potential targets of the ACE2-Spike axis are integrins such as LFA-1, which is essential for the generation of well-structured immune synapses characterised by the tight accumulation of TCR/CD3 complexes at the center of the contact area with the APC (Cassioli et al., 2021a) . ACE2 has been reported to interact with b1 integrin, a fibronectin receptor, inducing its conversion to the open, high-affinity conformation and activation of downstream signaling mediators such as FAK (Clarke et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2004) . Whether ACE2 modulates integrin signaling in T cells is an interesting hypothesis that warrants testing.",

Unpulsed Raji B cells were used as negative control (-SAgs). To measure cytotoxicity in in vitro-differentiated CTLs the calcein-based assay was used (Kummerow et al., 2014). Calcein-AM (Invitrogen, #C1430)-loaded B cells (0.050x10 6 ) were incubated with CD8 + T cells at different ratios (1:1, 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20) in 250\u00b5l AIMV medium for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Reading was performed at 485 nm excitation wavelength and 528 nm emission wavelength in the bottom reading mode by a Synergy HTX multi-mode plate reader (BioTek). Cytotoxicity (% target cell lysis) was calculated as follows: (Flive \u2212 g \u00d7 Fexp)/(Flive \u2212 Flyse) \u00d7 100, where Flive is the fluorescence of only target cell controls, Fexp are the CTLs with target cells, and Flyse is the maximal target lysis. The g value was measured at time zero: g = Flive (0)/Fexp To analyse the effects of CTL pre-treatments on cytotoxicity, B cells (0.025x10 6 ) were incubated with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE,ThermoFisher, #C34554)-loaded CD8 + T cells (0.225 x10 6 ), pre-treated as described above, at a 1:9 ratio in 50 \u00b5l AIMV medium for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then diluted to 200 \u00b5l with cold PBS and acquired using a GUAVA flow cytometer (Merck Millipore). Propidium Iodide (PI,Sigma, #537059) was added before of each acquisition. Cytotoxicity (% target cell lysis) was calculated as follows: (% CFSE \u2212 PI + dead cells \u2212 % CFSE \u2212 PI + dead cells in control sample)x100/(100 \u2212 % CFSE \u2212 PI + dead cells in control sample).",

Pairwise or multiple comparisons of values with normal distribution were carried out with Student's t-test (paired or unpaired), one-sample t-test (theoretical mean = 1) and One-way ANOVA test or One-sample t-test (theoretical mean =100), whereas values without Gaussian distribution were analysed with Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis test.Statistical significance was defined as: ****p\u22640.0001; *** p\u22640.001; **p\u22640.01; *p\u22640.05;",
