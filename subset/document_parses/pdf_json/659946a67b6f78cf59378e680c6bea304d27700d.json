We observe significant declines in relative differences (RDs) from the pre-to peri-period (as compared with the 10-year climatology) in most study countries including China, South Africa, India, and the UK by 15, 17, 8 and 7% respectively. The US does not demonstrate significant decline with RD difference relatively small at just 2%. Meanwhile, although the 2020 RD of Brazil is 7% lower than 2010-2019, this trend is quite similar to that of 2019 (20% vs 23%). In the post-period of 2020, the NO 2 columns rebound in most target countries: China, US, South Africa, Brazil and UK, with similar RDs relative to the corresponding pre-period as compared with 2019 and 2010-2019. In contrast, NO in India continues to be influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis with pre-to-post RD 8% lower than the average of previous 10 years.",

It is one of the most crucial indicators of air quality over urban and industrial centers due to its importance in the catalytic production of the earth's ozone distribution (Villena et al., 2012) and formation of secondary inorganic aerosols (Behera and Sharma, 2011) , with vital consequences for the global climate (Brinksma et al., 2008) and human health (Atkinson et al., 2018) . The primary sources of NO x are anthropogenic fuelcombustions, especially from motor vehicle and industrial power plants (Richter et al., 2005) . NO 2 is usually adopted as the indicator of larger group of NO x which remains relatively close to emission sources due to its comparably short lifetime in the atmosphere, and therefore can be utilized to monitor both long-and short-term changes in fuel consumption Lee and Koutrakis, 2014; Liu et al., 2020a Liu et al., , 2020b Liu et al., , 2020c Liu et al., , 2020d ). An accurate investigation and evaluation of the changes in NO 2 caused by COVID-19 over different countries is vital for global economic loss assessment, resource rearrangement and reopening strategy-planning. Furthermore, long-term exposure to NO 2 is considered to be one of the most important contributors to high fatality rates caused by COVID-19 (Ogen, 2020) , and even short-term exposure may increase the risk of infection (Zu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . Therefore, analysis on the trends and patterns of NO 2 densities are also crucial for the understanding of COVID-19 spread and fatality.",

Abrupt declines of NO 2 emissions were observed in many parts of the world during the pandemic (Liu et al., 2020c; Liu et al., 2020d; Baldasano, 2020; Otmani et al., 2020) . Using satellite observations, Bauwens et al. (2020) found unprecedented NO 2 decreases over China, South Korea, western Europe, and the United States during the pandemic as compared with the same period in 2019. Liu et al. (2020c) found significant reduction of NO 2 columns over major power plants and roads with seasonal variations considered and excluded in the analysis of NO 2 patterns over California, USA. However, with the influence of climate change (Krotkov et al., 2016) and emission regulations over the past several years (Shou et al., 2020) , inter-annual trends during the study period could introduce uncertainties and errors to the analysis and results. Furthermore, whether declines were due to COVID-19 mitigation policies or seasonal/periodical trends has rarely been addressed through previous studies. Liu et al. (2020d) utilized model simulations with constant NO 2 emissions before and during the lockdown to rule out the potential influences introduced by changes in meteorological conditions in the study over China and found that these influences are relatively small as compared with prolonged reductions. Whether the same conclusion can be found in other parts of the world is still up for debate. Furthermore, with city-reopenings implemented all over the world, whether NO 2 emissions have completely recovered to baseline levels still needs to be confirmed.",

We compare the temporal trend of NO 2 TVCD in 2020 with both the preceding year, 2019, and long-term climatology trends (2010-2019) to conduct a comprehensive analysis examining whether the pandemic has caused extraordinary changes. Furthermore, when investigating the spatial patterns of the NO 2 TVCD changes due to COVID-19, the linear inter-annual trend of each pixel is ruled out by performing detrending analysis on 2020 data before comparing it with 2019 data to mitigate the possible influences of other factors such as climate change and emission regulation policies on NO 2 emission. We also adopt anomalies to cancel out the seasonal cycles and reveal a relative pure pattern caused by COVID-19.",

In the pre-period, the daily time series of 2020 reveals a continuous decrease, reaching the minimum around January 25, the Chinese New Year (CNY), due to the gradual shutdown of industry prior to the country's biggest holiday, which is consistent with the data of 2019 and 2010-2019. A rebound is observed in the previous 10 years as well as 2019 around 1 week after CNY, when the holiday period ended. However, in 2020, the time-series does not display such a rapid uptick; NO 2 TVCDs stay at lower values until about 20 days after CNY and return to normal trends at a much slower rate as compared with 2019 and 2010-2019, 60 days after CNY when most cities and industries are gradually reopened in China. This low-emission period was prolonged for more than 40 days in 2020.

In the pre-period, the 2020 data has higher values over most parts of China than 2019 ( Fig. 2a and  d) , which rules out the possibility that 2020 has an initial lower NO 2 emission. However, during the peri-period of 2020, lower NO 2 TVCDs spreads to more surface area than in 2019. Wuhan city, where the first few confirmed cases were reported, shows an unprecedented low value in 2020 which cannot be observed in 2019. Other major cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou also present considerably lower TVCDs than previous year. These column reductions are likely due to the declines of traffic and vehicle use which is the dominate source of NO 2 emissions in cities.",

Throughout March and early April, most state governments issued stay-at-home orders to stem the spread of the virus (Norwood, 2020) . As shown in Fig. 3 , the 2020 timeseries of daily NO 2 TVCD over the US is quite similar to that of 2019 and 2010-2019 from the pre-to peri-period; and the overall statistic listed in Table 2 also reveals similar reductions over these two periods in 2020, 2019 and 2010-2019 (\u221241%, \u221240% and \u221239% respectively) with differences smaller than the standard errors. After the reopening, an uptick in the timeseries of NO 2 columns can be observed for both 2020 and 2019, and the overall reductions are smaller in the recent years as compared to the 10-year climatology. In conclusion, COVID-19 related actions have not substantially influenced overall NO 2 emissions in the US. According to Fig. 4 , regions where the first COVID-19 breakouts occurred in the US, such as Washington state, California, New York and its neighboring states, Vermont and New Hampshire (Fig. 4b , red circles), show decreasing changes from the pre-to peri-period in 2020 as compared with 2019. In order to slow the spread, these states implemented mitigation policies including curfews, travel bans, transportation restrictions and industrial closures (Moon, 2020; McMichael et al., 2020) . These declines are most likely due to the reduction of traffic emissions caused by these policies. Another NO 2 reduction evidence can be found along the national highway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The anomalies are quite similar between 2020 and 2019 during preperiod, but obviously lower in 2020 during the peri-period. The reduction of traffic emission should account for this change. Eastern Texas also presents a decreasing trend which cannot be seen in 2019. This region is an industrial area concentrated with power plants (Fig. A.3) . This reduction may largely be due to the closure of non-essential industries.",

Transportation between the two countries was reduced due to the travel restriction announced by both countries (South African Government, 2020b; The Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini, 2020). The declines in NO 2 TVCD may have a strong connection with these COVID-19 mitigation measures. Moreover, the decrease around Cape Town can also be explained by the traffic reduction under the country-wide lockdown order (Businesstech, 2020) . Furthermore, Emalahleni city and its surrounding regions is the most important coal-mining center of the country (Pollet et al., 2015; Fig. A.4) , so the decreasing pattern also reflects the significant reduction of industry production in this area.

By the end of March, most state governments had imposed quarantine policies to slow the spread (BBC News, 2020). Fig. 7 shows the timeseries of normalized daily NO 2 TVCDs in 2020, 2019 and 2010-2019. The 2020 data shows a slight decrease as compared with 2019 and 2010-2019 during the lockdown (20% vs 23% and 27%). The trend of 2020 remains lower than the previous 10-years' climatology for a 20-day period after the end of lockdown. However, similar phenomenon is observed in 2019 data. The overall increase is lower in 2020 and 2019 than 2010-2019 with RD of 27% and 23% versus 36%. Therefore, COVID-19 related shutdown and reopening orders do not have obvious influence on the overall NO 2 emissions of Brazil. Fig. 8 shows spatial patterns of NO 2 TVCD anomalies for the pre-, peri-and post-period over Brazil. From the pre-to peri-period, despite the NO 2 columns increase over most target pixels in 2019, the 2020 data shows declines, especially over major cities like Rio de Janeiro, Vitoria and Sao Paulo. Lockdown-induced reduction of traffic emissions is the most likely reason for this phenomenon. Meanwhile, declines of NO 2 over rural areas are not significant considering the systematic errors and slightly lower initial emissions in the pre-period as compared with 2019. Therefore, the influence of COVID-19 on industrial production is not obvious in Brazil.",

As shown in Fig. 9 , the 2020 trend of NO 2 TVCDs are consistent with both 2019 and 2010-2019 in the pre-period and even higher during February (days 43-67), possibly due to the high biomass burning, forest fires, vegetation, and agricultural crop emissions this year (Gautam et al., 2020) . However, the 2020 data is generally below the curves of 2019 data and 10-year climatology in the peri-period. According to Table 2 , the decline between the pre-and peri-period is 11% for 2020 data which is considerably sharper than 2019 and 2020 which are 1% and 3% respectively. Accordingly, the lockdown has significantly reduced the NO 2 emission in India indicating its negative impacts on the economy and people's activities. The unusual decline does not rebound to normal trends even after the reopening in 2020 with a RD between post-and pre-period of \u221211% compared to \u22123% for both 2019 and 2010-2019. In conclusion, economic production and transportation are impeded by the COVID-19 mitigation policies in India and have not recovered even after the lockdown orders are lifted.",

Despite the effort made by this study and all the other related research, more work needs to be done highlighting the various impacts of COVID-19 mitigation efforts, including: 1) Conducting detailed and quantitative analysis to explain spatiotemporal patterns at a regional or local scale, by considering more local features such as mitigation policies of counties/cities/states/ provinces, regional environment and weather, wildfires, residents' habits and customs, locations of roads and power/industrial plants, topography, etc. 2) Performing more comprehensive detrending analysis on the longterm historical data. 3) Including other potential parameters which may influence the patterns and trends of NO 2 emissions, such as human mobilities, inner-city transportation, climate and geographical changes, to isolate the influence of COVID-19 mitigation efforts more accurately; 4) Investigating the impacts of COVID-19 in other parts of the world. 5) Estimating the impacts of COVID-19 related policies on global economy.",

            "text": "1) The COVID-19 lockdown and economic reopening policies have had crucial influences on the NO 2 emissions of most study countries in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These impacts are distinct in different countries in terms of duration, response speed, severeness of influence, and spatial distribution. 2) For the anthropogenic-sources-dominated pixels, mean NO 2 TVCDs of most target countries, including China, South Africa, India and UK, significantly decreased during the lockdown compared to 2019 and 2010-2019. However, the changes in RDs over Brazil and the US are relatively small and according to Bauwens et al. (2020) , uncertainties of the OMNO2d product are larger than \u00b15% over most of their study cities during this period. Therefore, the overall NO 2 emissions have no obvious change in Brazil and the US. However, NO 2 columns were observed to be reduced over their metropolises, national capitals and power plants despite overall patterns, indicating the negative influence of COVID-19 on traffic volume and industrial production. 3) After the reopening, the NO 2 emissions rebounded to similar levels as the pre-period in most target countries except India. The NO 2 columns in India stay at a lower level compared to previous years, indicating that industrial production has not yet recovered from the pandemic. ",
