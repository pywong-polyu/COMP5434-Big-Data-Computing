Meanwhile, evidence is mounting that the pandemic is characterized by superspreading, where a small fraction account for the majority of infections. Capturing this phenomenon theoretically requires modeling at the scale of individuals. Using a mathematical model, we show that superspreading represents an Achilles' heel of COVID-19, and drastically improves the efficacy of mitigations which reduce the personal contact number, even when this is done without changing the average social contact time.",

By now, there is substantial evidence that these are not just singular events, but that they reflect a marked transmission heterogeneity [4] [5] [6] , a signature feature of the disease. In a well-mixed population, such heterogeneity has little bearing on the trajectory of an epidemic, but when public sphere contacts are restricted, heterogeneity takes on a decisive role [7] . In this report we investigate the effects of transmission heterogeneityi.e. superspreading -on mitigation strategies which rely on a reduction in social network size, such as lockdowns and restrictions on sizes of gatherings.",

Superspreading events may occur due to circumstances and behaviour as well as biology. Even medical procedures, such as intubation and bronchoscopy, which facilitate the production of aerosols [11] , can lead to superspreading events in respiratory diseases. However, the most straightforward model of superspreading is that some individuals simply shed the virus to a much greater extent than the average infected person. For COVID-19, this \"biological superspreader\" phenomenon has some traction, and is supported by the observation that household transmission is limited, despite the relatively high average infectiousness of COVID-19 [12] [13] [14] .",

Pandemic influenzas such as the 1918 Spanish flu, on the other hand, are believed to be far more \"democratic\" [10] . The heterogeneity of transmission is usually quantified using the Gamma distribution [8] . This is the origin of the dispersion parameter or k value, which determines the fraction of infectious individuals who account * bjarkenielsen@nbi.ku.dk \u2020 sneppen@nbi.dk for the majority of infections (Fig. 1) . Smaller k means greater heterogeneity -in fact, when k is small (|k| 1) it approximates the fraction of infected individuals who give rise to 80% of infections.

Given a contact network, and a corresponding degree distribution P C (c) -for example a Poisson distribution in the case of an Erd\u00f6s-Renyi network -the connectivities can be summed to yield a distribution of individual reproductive numbers, P (R) = c P C (c)P (R; c). As reflected in the equations above, the actual number of secondary infections depends not only on biological infectiousness. In Fig. 2a-b , we explore how the number of personal contacts affects the resultant distribution of infections. Without superspreading (2a), a reduction in the contact number has a very modest effect and the distributions overlap. When the heterogenity is at a COVID-like level (2b), it is quite a different story. Here, a decrease in mean connectivity has a considerable effect, and mitigation suddenly looks feasible.",

            "text": "To quantify the sensitivity of the epidemic to social network size, we consider the basic reproductive number R 0 , meaning the average number of infections that each infected person causes in a situation where all contacts are still susceptible. In Fig. 2c , the R 0 is given as a function of the dispersion parameter k and the average contact number. The epidemic is evidently much more sensitive to reductions in average contact number when the transmission heterogeneity is high. A mitigation in which the average number of contacts goes from being unrestricted, down to about 10, causes a reduction in R 0 which lowers both the peak and total number of persons infected during the course of the epidemic (the attack rate). The overall trajectory of a homogeneous disease is largely unaffected by social connectivity (Fig.  3a) , whereas a heterogeneous epidemic is very sensitive (Fig. 3b) . We find a particularly large sensitivity to a reduction of contact number from 15 down to 10 (Fig.  3b) , indicating a critical threshold for disease spreading occuring at a contact number \u223c 1/k. Crucially, a reduction in contact time is not necessary when the disease is characterized by superspreading. What counts is rather a reduction in contact diversity, meaning the number of different persons with whom you come into contact during the time you are infectious. This differs fundamentally from SIR models, .

So far, our analysis has been based on the Erd\u00f6s-Renyi network, which is largely devoid of clusters. This was chosen as a clean setting in which to probe how social network affects superspreaders. However, any realistic social network will involve clusters of people who know each other [21] [22] [23] -after all, your colleagues know each other, as well as knowing you. It is thus natural to ask whether such cliquishness impacts superspreading. In Fig. 4 , we compare a cluster-free network to one characterized by a high degree of clustering [24] .",

However, such individuals would also be superreceivers, a trait which impacts the epidemic even in the absence of mitigation [20, 25] . In any case, ability as well as opportunity is necessary for superspreading to occur. In our model, we have focused on inter-individual variation in ability to produce and transmit virus. This simplification is supported by cases of one person infecting many people at different times and locations [26] , and by the observation that most infected people do not even infect their spouse [12] [13] [14] . However, more complex models could incorporate realistic social heterogeneity as well as large temporal variations in viral load [27] -effects which we have not probed.
