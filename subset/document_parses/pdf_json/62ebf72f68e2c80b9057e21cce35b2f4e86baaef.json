The first phase of goal and scope definition consists of establishing the objectives and scope of the study (which is an important step, especially for comparative analysis), the system to be studied and its boundaries, the quality of the data, the assumptions and the level to be reached. The functional unit (FU) is also defined in order to be able to associate the inputs and outputs of the system. Secondly, in the inventory phase, data are collected and quantified to determine the inputs and outputs of matter and energy of the system, including the use of resources (raw materials, energy, water, etc.), and the emissions to air, water and soil that are produced. In our analysis, this data is obtained via computational transformation using baseline values coming from the state of the art as well as from the field study in the UMA workshops. Thirdly, the impact assessment stage is a technical process aimed at understanding and evaluating the magnitude and significance of the potential environmental impacts of a system throughout its life cycle. The assessment is carried out in stages, which are differentiated between mandatory and optional. Finally, there is the stage of interpretation of results that provide information consistent with the defined objective and scope, leading to conclusions and recommendations in decision-making for the recipient.

Hence, the temperature and humidity sensors (DS18B20 and SKU-SEN0193 respectively) have a probe encapsulation format that easily allows their introduction into the soil, as well as presenting a good accuracy in the range of expected temperatures. The humidity sensor also has a relevant feature compared to other DIY sensors of the same category, particularly its capacitive nature [88] , instead of resistive, which allows for a longer lifetime due to its insulation and consequent reduced exposure to corrosion [89] . In the case of the CO 2 measurement, the majority of the gas sensors of the DIY market are analogic electrochemical sensors that require pre-heating and whose measures tend to drift strongly with time. Conversely, the selected SCD30 component is NDIR (non-dispersive infrared) sensor. This works by the emission of infrared light through a portion of air. Depending on the quantity of CO 2 , a certain amount of this light is absorbed, providing accurate measurements [90] .

The Green ICT [45] implemented by this project has supported the architectural construction and improvement of an urban space with greening. In addition, our project is in line with the projects and initiatives that the European Union enhances to make Europe again a green continent and supported by a more sustainable economy [45] . After the pilot design stage of the Smart Tree furniture, it can be seen that the Circular Economy is a link in the tool chain that uses ecodesign to achieve sustainable designs. The eco-design of the Smart Tree furniture has succeeded in conserving and enhancing natural capital by controlling finite stocks and balancing renewable recurrent flows. This design has provided eco-innovation, decreasing IA, increasing product awareness, decreasing costs, making an attractive product, decreasing legal liability and improving the image of the UMA and increasing the motivation of the community (multidisciplinary project). For this design to be reproducible, it is necessary to continue with the cataloging of the products that have finished their first life cycle in the UMA community, even increasing the cataloging of this type of products from other institutions, creating synergies and control tools. In addition, other materials can be recovered for the remanufacturing of other products, since projects are currently being developed at the UMA for the reuse of plastic waste generated at the university itself [97] .",

The choice of species has to be very careful, as there are undesirable functions such as toxicity, presence of allergens or attraction of unwanted fauna that have to be avoided or the timing of the flowering has to be take in consideration and in combination with the different plants. The selection of species may also be conditioned by the availability of native versus non-native plants, so it is important to have a good net that supply native plants.",

As shown inFigure 5, the resulting Smart Tree is an open-air classroom-pavilion of 48 m 2 , of which 36 m 2 are covered with a methacrylate roof and 12 m 2 are uncovered. The intervention proposes greening an area of 522 m 2 in its immediate surroundings. The pavilion is located in the central part of the area, protected by strips of vegetation from noise pollution from the road to the north and from the car park to the south and west. A pedestrian path crosses the garden in the central area connecting Smart Tree with the boulevard that serves as the main communication axis of the Uma university campus. The different species of plants and trees used and the location of the sensors are depicted, which form Smart Tree as an inseparable ensemble of architecture, botany and new technologies.",
