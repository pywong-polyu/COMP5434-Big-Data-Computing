For example, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test [6] requires minimum equipment and can deliver almost an immediate mobility evaluation that can be reported to the tested person. Likewise, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) [7] is also a quick assessment measure used to evaluate lower extremity functioning and mobility in older persons. Although these clinical gait assessments are widely accepted, they are partially subjective in the sense that the gait evaluation process is carried out by individual specialists who observe the quality of a patient's gait. This process is sometimes followed by a survey in which the patient is asked to give their subjective gait quality evaluation, which may result in a negative effect on the diagnosis accuracy, follow-up, and treatment of the pathologies [8] .",

Wearable technology can be applied in different domains, from fitness and healthcare to disability service, providing a simplified alternative, or \"add-on\", to more costly and strictly lab-based methods of quantifying gait characteristics [11] [12] [13] . Wearable technologies incorporate aspects of traditional gait analysis techniques into everyday wearables. For example, smart in-shoe insoles [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] aim to obtain ground reaction force measurements in or out of lab environments. The most widely used insole models are capacitive, piezoelectric, and piezoresistive sensors. The selection of sensor type relates to the range of pressure it will withstand, its sensitivity, and the linearity of the output signal [8] . In addition, inertial measurement units (IMUs) are a useful method of kinematic data collection, due to their reduced size and the low cost of their components. With ability to record physical activity measurement both in clinical practice and at home, IMUs are a leading contender in the field. Recorded data is usually based on accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors, which allow an objective estimation of kinematic parameters with great accuracy, as well as the position, acceleration, and speed produced during physical activity [19] .",

The table was adapted from [22] , which was originally derived from two methods of quality assessment outlined by Campos et al. [23] and Downs and Black [24] . The quality assessment consists of 12 items distributed between four sub-scales including reporting, external validity, internal validity (bias), and power analysis. Two authors (Y.W. and O.T.) independently evaluated the methodological quality of each study included in this systematic review. Each item had two possible answers: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Any disagreement in scoring between authors was discussed until an agreement was reached.",

After a database search, a total of 1992 potentially relevant papers were found. Next, 857 papers were removed based on article duplication and title screening, and an additional 1014 were excluded based on abstract screening. Following the removal of these manuscripts, 121 publications were subjected to more detailed full-text analysis based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, of which a total of 6 final papers [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] were identified to be included in this systematic review. Table 1 shows the study and participant characteristics for all six selected studies that used a sensor-based wearable for gait assessment in people with dementia, for different purposes. Three studies [26] [27] [28] focused on falls prognosis and risk factors such as cognitive functioning and Fear of Falling (FoF). One study [25] aimed to assess whether an IMU wearable could differentiate dementia disease subtypes. One study [30] focused on the impact of different environments (lab and real-world) on gait, and another study [29] investigated the differences in executive functioning during single and dual tasking. The included studies were published in the past ten years, between 2012 and 2021, and assessed gait in people living with dementia using body-worn sensors. The total population sample size ranged from 40 to 85 participants with the age ranged from 60 to 88 years old. All six studies included mixed genders and selection criteria based on initial cognitive and gait evaluation of the participants as part of the inclusion and exclusion process.

In addition, all the studies had an adequate experiment setting and conditions, and three studies [25, 27, 30] were conducted in real-life environments with the sensor-based part of the measurements conducted in an unsupervised setting during the subjects' everyday lives. The statistical tests and outcome measures were defined in all the studies; however, none of the studies computed test-retest reliability and minimum detectable change values of the sensors or provided sample size justification, power description, or variance and effect estimates. -cognition was related to duration of walking sub-phases and total time to complete iTUG (r = 0.25-0.28) suggesting that gait speed was related to cognition.",
