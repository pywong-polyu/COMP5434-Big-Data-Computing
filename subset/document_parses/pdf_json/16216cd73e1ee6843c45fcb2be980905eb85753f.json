As exhaustive exploration of the vast chemical space is infeasible, discovering novel inhibitor molecules for emerging drug-target proteins is challenging, particularly for targets with unknown structure or ligands. We demonstrate the broad utility of a single deep generative framework toward discovering novel drug-like inhibitor molecules against two distinct SARS-CoV-2 targets -the main protease (M pro ) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. To perform target-aware design, the framework employs a target sequence-conditioned sampling of novel molecules from a generative model. Micromolar-level in vitro inhibition was observed for two candidates (out of four synthesized) for each target. The most potent spike RBD inhibitor also emerged as a rare non-covalent antiviral with broad-spectrum activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants in live virus neutralization assays. These results show that a broadly deployable machine intelligence framework can accelerate hit discovery across different emerging drug-targets.",

For instance, a key objective in the drug discovery workflow is to identify candidate molecules, known as hits, that can interact with and inhibit a known drug-target protein with measurable activity. Searching for hit compounds that serve as the chemical starting points for further design of drug candidates typically involves high-throughput screening of libraries containing standard chemical compounds or smaller chemical fragments. Success rates for this method of hit discovery are between 0.5 and 1 percent 1 , depending upon the size of the library screened (typically on the order of 10 4 entries) and target characteristics. This low success rate is in part due to the immense search space, now estimated to span between 10 33 -10 80 feasible molecules 2 , from which only a minute fraction typically possesses the traits sought. Exhaustive enumeration of this vast chemical space is infeasible. Consequently, the cost of developing a single new drug is high, reaching up to $2.8 billion, while the duration from concept to market typically exceeds a decade 3 .",

Such models thus offer access to previously unexplored chemical space unrestricted by conscious human bias. However, for the task of target-specific drug-like inhibitor design, an \"inverse molecular design\" 4 approach must be utilized, where the navigation through the learned chemical representation is guided by molecular property attributes, such as target inhibition activity and drug-likeliness. In the scenario of designing inhibitors for a new target, a sufficient amount of exemplar molecules is required, which is likely unavailable and requires costly and time-consuming screening experiments to obtain. As the majority of existing deep generative frameworks (see Sousa, et al. 5 for a review of generative deep learning for targeted molecule design) still rely on learning from targetspecific libraries of binder compounds, they limit exploration beyond a fixed library of known and monolithic molecules, while preventing generalization of the machine learning framework toward more novel targets. As a result, while some studies 6-8 that use deep generative models for target-specific inhibitor design have been experimentally validated, rarely have such models demonstrated sufficient versatility to be broadly deployable across dissimilar protein targets, without having access to detailed target-specific prior knowledge (e.g., target structure or binder library).",

In this study, the deep generative framework, built upon large-scale data of chemical molecules, protein sequences, and protein-ligand binding, serves as a foundation for inhibitor molecule design, as it can be extrapolated to new target sequences not present in the original training data. A set of novel molecules targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which was designed by CogMol, was shared under the Creative Commons license in April 2020 in the IBM COVID-19 Molecule Explorer platform 10 . Here, we provide experimental validation of the broad utility and readiness of the CogMol deep generative framework, by synthesizing and testing the inhibitory activity of a number of prioritized designs against SARS-CoV-2 M pro and RBD of the spike protein. We further demonstrate the applicability of the binding affinity predictor model used in the CogMol framework by subjecting it to virtual screening of a library of lead-like chemicals and successfully identifying three compounds that were ultimately confirmed to be bound at the active site of the M pro by crystallographic analysis, one of which showed micromolar inhibition.",

A VAE is comprised of an encoder-decoder pair. The encoder neural network maps the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) 12 string of a molecule into a low-dimensional representation. We will denote the encoder as q \u03c6 (z|x), where z is a latent encoding of input SMILES x and \u03c6 represents the encoder parameters. The decoder p \u03b8 (x|z)), which is also a neural network, then converts the latent vector z back into the reconstructed SMILES x. The encoder in a VAE is probabilistic in nature as it outputs latent encodings that are consistent with a Gaussian distribution. The decoder is therefore stochastic -it samples from the latent distribution to produce an output x. The encoder-decoder pair is trained end-to-end to optimize two objectives simultaneously. The first objective includes minimizing a loss term to ensure accurate reconstruction of an input SMILES from the corresponding latent embedding. The second objective consists of a regularization term to constrain the latent encodings to a standard normal distribution. The resulting latent space is continuous, enabling smooth interpolation as well as random sampling of new molecules from the latent space. To learn meaningful latent molecular representations that have general knowledge about diverse chemicals, in CogMol the VAE is trained on more than one and half million small molecules from public databases (see the Material and Methods section for details).",

The generative framework thus has important information already encoded about protein sequence homologies, chemical similarities, and protein-drug binding relations. This allows the framework to serve as a foundation, as it is instantly adaptable to different targets, without any further model retraining or fine-tuning on target-specific data. The approach further saves time and cost associated with generating target-specific binder libraries or resolving the target structure, which are typically considered as privileged information, i.e., not broadly available. The model can also extrapolate to a target that does not share high similarity with the training data. This is indeed the case for the SARS-CoV-2 targets considered (see SI Table 2 ) where the lowest Expect value, a measure of sequence homology (lower values indicate high homology), with respect to the BindingDB protein sequences is 0.51 (query coverage = 40%) and 1.9 (query coverage = 26%) for M pro and spike RBD, respectively.

For practical considerations, we sought to keep the number of prioritized machine-designed de novo compounds to be synthesized and tested very small -around 10 for each target, as opposed to screening thousands of chemicals in a more traditional set-up. We used a combination of physicochemical properties (estimated using cheminformatics), target-molecule binding free energy predicted by docking simulations, and retrosynthesis and toxicity predictions by using machine learning. For retrosynthesis prediction, we used the IBM RXN platform 15 that is based on a transformer neural network trained on chemical reaction data. For toxicity prediction, an in-house neural network-based model trained on publicly available in vitro and clinical toxicity data was used. See Material and Methods for details of candidate filtering and prioritization criteria. At the end of the in silico screening, the number of candidates per target is around 100, which was further narrowed down to around 10 per target by using the discretion of Enamine Ltd., the chemical manufacturer. Feasibility of the predicted reaction schema, as evaluated by organic synthetic chemist experts, as well as commercial availability and cost of the predicted reactants, was used to finalize the candidate synthesis list. The final four candidates for each target were chosen based on the synthesis cost and delivery time, as provided by Enamine. Figure 2 lists the eight de novo compounds designed by the generative machine learning framework that were synthesized (See SI Tables 3-4 for the predicted molecular properties). Details of the experimental synthesis protocols is provided in Methods and SI Section C.2. We also provide a comparison between the predicted and the actual retrosynthetic pathways for those eight machine-designed compounds in SI Table 5 . Five were synthesized using the top predicted pathway of IBM RXN. For two compounds, GEN626 and GEN777, predictions were found to be unsuccessful, so alternative pathways as designed by Enamine were employed (see Methods for details). For GXA104, reactants included in the RXN prediction were not available, so an alternative route was employed. Overall, these results show the usefulness of machine learning-based retrosynthesis predictions for reliably identifying plausible candidates and recommending viable synthesis routes.",

Docking simulations on the generated molecules were performed in the presence of their respective target structure -PDB ID: 6LU7 18 for M pro and PDB ID: 7Z3Z for spike RBD (See Methods for details). As shown in Figure 6 , both machine-designed M pro inhibitors, GXA112 and GXA70, revealed mainly hydrophobic contacts to the residues from the P1 and P2 subsites which are the hotspots of interactions 18 . The hydrogen bonding pattern revealed by the two molecules is, however, starkly different: GXA112 forms hydrogen bonding mainly with P1' site (T25), whereas GXA70 interacts with the P2 residues (D187 and Y54). The non-extensive and diverse interaction pattern of the de novo and commercially sourced M pro inhibitors reported in this study is consistent with reported observations for non-covalent inhibitors 27 . For the validated de novo spike inhibitor, docking simulation (see Figure 7 ) reveals that GEN727 contacts with several hydrophobic residues, such as Tyr365, Tyr369, and Phe374, from RBD. Those residues that constitute the lipid binding pocket of the spike RBD are conserved across seven coronaviruses that infect humans 28 . Also, the docking strikingly recapitulates the binding of the natural lipid (see Figure 7d ), suggesting that the lipid binding function maintains the conserved site targeted by GEN727. Therefore, binding of GEN727 might stabilize the closed form of the spike, reducing receptor interactions. In line with that, the thermofluor results (SI Figure 9 ) showed an (albeit weak) indication that incubation of spike with GEN727 somewhat destabilized the spike, suggestive of a direct interaction underlying its broad-spectrum neutralization ability. We also perform docking on the other de novo-designed spike inhibitor that showed pseudoviral neutralization, GEN725, which can be found in SI Figure 10 , revealing an interaction pattern similar to that of GEN727.",

For example, the use of docking or molecular simulation methods to screen on the order of 10 8 to 10 9 commercially available compounds, would incur a prohibitively high computational cost, estimated to reach 10 CPU years 21 per target (as opposed to screening of less than a thousand machine-designed de novo candidates via docking in the present study).",

Such information is not guaranteed to be available for all drug targets of interest and may take months to derive experimentally, and consequently these approaches are not broadly applicable to the case where such structures are unknown. Recently, the field of structural biology has been revolutionized by deep-learning based methods, i.e., Alphafold 32 and RoseTTafold 33 , for predicting three-dimensional structure of a protein from its sequence. Whilst predicting structures with often astonishing accuracy, the structural models derived from neural networks are still relatively limited in aiding the understanding of natural protein function, in particular understanding the interactions with protein partners or small ligands. Therefore, the deduction of functional ligand and drug interaction still remains predominantly reliant on resource-intensive In general, reliance on privileged information (the target protein structure and/or known hits), confines the discovery space to the neighborhood of known chemical entities. This dependency therefore presents a practical challenge to expand the accessible chemical exploration space and to devise more readily generalizable approaches to inhibitor design for multiple targets, the structure and binders of which may not be known.",

In contrast, as shown in Figure 1 , it took us less than a week to design and prioritize the set of candidate molecules to be synthesized and tested in wet lab for the two SARS-CoV-2 targets, as our approach does not reply on target structure or binder information. The information on SARS-CoV-2 sequences was made publicly available starting around January of 2020 and CogMol-designed candidates were open-sourced in the IBM COVID-19 Molecule Explorer platform in April 2020. While the prioritized de novo compounds were ordered in August 2020, and the first round of wet lab validation was completed in October 2020. This rapid pace of novel drug-like inhibitor discovery across two distinct drug targets, when the world was experiencing a pandemic, shows the potential of a sequence-guided generative machine learning-based framework to help with better pandemic preparedness and other global urgency.",

Additionally, the validated hits reported in this study appear to be novel, based on molecular similarity analyses with existing chemicals and SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, indicating impressive creative ability of the generative framework, which is not possible when screening known compounds. The efficiency of hit discovery realized here and the demonstrated generalizability to different targets advocate for pre-training on a large volume of general data, e.g., molecular SMILES, protein sequences, and protein-ligand binding affinities. Conceptually this is a key feature of so-called foundation AI models 39 , which are trained on broad data at scale and can be easily adapted to newer tasks. This perspective is also consistent with recent work, establishing the informative nature of a deep language model trained on large number of protein sequences, in terms of capturing fundamental properties 14, 40 . The broad-spectrum efficacy across SARS-CoV-2 VOCs of the most potent spike hit observed is a further example: the VOC sequences were never made available to the generative framework during training or inference. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a novel spike-based non-covalent inhibitor that exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity. This contrasts with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, the only drugs currently in use that target the spike protein, where rather few are effective across VOCs 41 .",

Molecular attribute predictors for conditional generation: Two predictors trained on the latent z vectors were used for target-specific inhibitor molecule design, which are also drug-like. The QED regressor was comprised of 4 hidden layers with 50 units each and ReLU nonlinearity. Further, a target-chemical binder (strong/weak) predictor was trained on the latent z vectors of chemicals and the pretrained protein sequence embeddings 13 , which used the data released as part of the DeepAffinity 51 . A pIC 50 value of > 6 was used as a threshold to decide if a compound was a strong binder. The protein embeddings and the molecular embeddings were concatenated and passed through a single hidden layer with 2048 units and ReLU nonlinearity. The z-based QED and pIC 50 predictors yield an RMSE of 0.0281 and 1.282, respectively. These set of predictors were used for controlled sampling from the VAE model to design molecules with desired attributes. CLaSS sampling used for conditional generation in CogMol: We briefly describe Conditional Latent (attribute) Space Sampling (CLaSS) 14 here. CLaSS uses (i) a density model of the VAE latent representation, and (ii) a set of molecular attribute predictors trained on the VAE latent vectors, to generate molecules in an attribute-controlled manner. For this purpose, a rejection sampling approach utilizing Bayes' theorem is used. To elaborate further, first an explicit density model is learned on the latent embeddings of the training data to ensure sampling is uniformly random. A Gaussian mixture model with 100 components and diagonal covariance matrices was used for this purpose. Assuming the attributes are all independent of each other and can be conditioned on the latent embeddings (i.e., the latent space encompasses all combinations of attributes), Bayes' rule was then used to define the conditional probability of a sample, given certain properties in terms of the predictor models above. Finally, we employ this definition in a rejection sampling scheme, such that samples drawn from the density model are accepted according to the product of the attribute predictor scores. For more details on the algorithm, see SI Section C.1. Generating the 875k samples for each target took around two days using an NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU.",

Each simulation takes only a few minutes and can be run independently in parallel which means the entire in silico screening can be performed in less than a day when run on a compute cluster consisting of Intel Xeon E5-2600 v2 processors.",

Here we applied the recent advances made by machine learning-based approaches to predict retrosynthetic routes from large reaction databases. To estimate the ease of synthesizability and facilitate synthesis planning of the selected compounds, we predicted the retrosynthesis pathways for each candidate using the IBM RXN platform 15 . RXN combines a transformer neural network for forward reaction prediction and graph exploration techniques to evaluate retrosynthesis paths, scoring them according to probability. The path is terminated when all reagents are found to be commercially available. Candidates for which RXN was unable to determine a feasible retrosynthesis route or which terminated with non-commercially available compounds were removed from consideration. For each prediction we used the following parameters: maximum single step reactions (depth), 6; minimum acceptance probability for a single step, 0.6; maximum number of pathways (beams), 10; number of steps between removal of low probability steps (pruning), 2; and maximum execution time, 1 hour. Commercial availability was determined by searching the eMolecules database 60 with a restriction on lead time of 4 weeks or less but no restriction on price.",

We considered three main aspects in the comparison: number of reaction steps leading to the final product, overlap of the products in the intermediate reaction steps, and overlap of reactants used in the reactions. We chose the best path from the top six predicted for comparison by optimizing first for product overlap and then for reactant overlap. Overall, the total number of actual reaction steps showed good agreement with predictions, generally only off by one or two steps. This was confirmed by the overlap of intermediate products, which showed that retrosynthesis often predicted the correct high-level path. Product overlap is highly variable, though, since there are relatively few per route (often only two or three). The actual synthesis routes even used many of the same reactants as predicted, although occasionally alternatives had to be found due to stock limitations. In general, the retrosynthesis prediction was used as a starting point and any \"major\" deviations required were considered a failure.",

Cross-coupling of 13 with sulfonamide-pinacolborane led to the final product with a moderate yield (see SI Section C.2 steps K-L for full details of the synthesis procedure). Several unsuccessful attempts were made to carry out the first step according to the retrosynthetic strategy for GEN626, which led to obtaining the desired intermediate with very low yield. As a result, the synthetic pathway was changed (Figure 8c ). SNAr reaction was carried out with cyanide 8, which was followed by hydrolysis of intermediate compound 10 (obtained with a moderate yield). Reduction of nitro-group of 11 led to GEN626 (see SI Section C.2 steps H-J). Unfortunately, following the pathway suggested by retrosynthesis for GEN777 didn't give good results and the synthetic strategy needed to be changed (Figure 8d ). We synthesized acyl chloride 5, which reacted with methyl amine on the next step. Thereafter, amide 6 was treated by PCl 5 and the resulting intermediate was reacted in situ with azide-anion (see SI Section C.2 steps D-G).",

The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 mins and the firefly luciferase activity was measured using CLARIOstar \u00ae (BMG Labtech). The percentage of neutralization of compounds towards pseudotyped lentiviruses was calculated relative to the untreated control and IC 50 was determined using the probit program from the SPSS package.",

Table 5 . Consolidated results comparing predicted and actual synthesis paths. The top 6 predicted retrosynthesis paths (by confidence) are considered and the path with the best agreement is shown. \"Steps\" is simply the number of reaction steps actual / predicted number of reaction steps. \"Products\" shows the intermediate (not including the final molecule) reaction products overlap in terms of recall (with respect to the predicted path) while \"reactants\" similarly shows the overlap of reactants from all steps in terms of recall. The \"success\" column shows whether the given predicted path was successfully synthesized as is or with minor changes or failed (but still synthesized via an alternative method devised by Enamine). Figure 9 . Thermofluor assay results. Thermofluor raw fluorescence data for experiments with AI-designed compound GEN727 (black) and a DMSO control (grey). Data were recorded using protein that was used immediately after dilution into neutral buffer (solid lines), incubated overnight in neutral buffer (long-dashed lines), or incubated overnight with the compound in neutral buffer (short-dashed lines). For comparison, data from protein in pH 4.6 buffer is also shown (dotted lines).
