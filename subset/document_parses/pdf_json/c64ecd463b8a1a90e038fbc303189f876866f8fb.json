Previous studies asserted that Indian society passes through the transitional phase of culture [7] . The traditional family system underwent structural and functional changes, which weakened the family ties [8] , causing migration and individual disconnection with family. Additionally, hectic city lives leave little time for socializing or leisure living. Therefore, one may find isolation even while living in a big family or a big condominium with several neighbours [9, 10] . Social media has a profound role in compounding the problem by making people connect virtually, diminishing the importance of real face-to-face interaction [11] . This anonymity of living in a big city can end in a scarcity of trust, making it harder to attach. In this way, people are paying a high price for its stretched emphasis on privacy and individuality that many people have no friends and close ones [12] . Also, reaching a threshold point of virtual contacts, isolation backfires probably too when this threshold has been crossed [13] . In this scenario, emotional seclusion may be a tricky thing that strikes different people for different reasons. So, there is no rule or set method to beat loneliness. The lonely person continues to suffer from numerous problems in life.",

            "text": "Empirically loneliness is defined in several ways. It is a natural human feeling triggered by an unpleasant experience of life that occurs when a person's social relationship network is deficient in some significant way, either quantitatively or qualitatively [14] . Sadler (1975) describes \"loneliness is caused not by being alone but by being without some needed relationship or set of relationships [15] . \" He divided loneliness into two types: emotional loneliness: characterized by the lack of an attachment; and social isolation which is manifested through the absence of a social network [15] . Besides, Tiwari (2013) categorized loneliness circumstances into three parts 1) situational loneliness: it arises as a result of adverse socio-economic and cultural situations such as unpleasant experiences due to the disagreement of needs, loss of social contact, migration of distress, interpersonal conflicts, accidents, disasters or emptiness [16] . 2) Developmental loneliness: It appears when individuals are unable to balance, for example, personal inadequacies, separation, poverty, living arrangements, and disability, between innate desire and need [16] . 3) Internal loneliness: it appears to be due to certain inferior personality characteristics such as low self-esteem, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and poor situational coping skills [16] . In addition, every city dweller values privacy, and therefore the terms of urban living encourage it; hence, loneliness is more often voluntary than imposed. However, when loneliness becomes chronic, it can severely affect both health and well-being; unfortunately, it is continuously emerging as a modern urban life problem [17] . It is a hidden killer that can trigger many problems, including biological dysfunction, psychological distress, and behavioural problems [16, 18] . It is a common stereotype that it mainly affects older people, but previous studies have shown that even younger people suffer from it [19] . Typically, the progression of loneliness has a nonlinear U-shaped distributional curve with people under 25 years of age and people over 65 years of age [20] . Likewise, the magnitude of loneliness shows variations across all ages [21] . In this context, Singh (1991) stated that everyone has to suffer from their ravages at one time or another [22] . Despite this, in India, very little comprehensive research has been done to capture the growing phenomenon of loneliness. However, most related studies concentrated on the elderly population [17] .",

These localities were High-Rise Residential Buildings (HRB), Old Colonies, Chawls, Slums, and Slum Rehabilitated Houses (SRH). These particular localities were chosen as they are uniformly distributed in selected areas, and they differ in terms of built forms and socio-economic aspects, psychological unity among people living in these housing localities, the feeling of belongingness, or intense use of an area's commerce, recreational, and learning service [23] . The localities were identified by creating a buffer zone of 5 km aerial radius from a fixed landmark (i.e., main Government Hospital) in selected areas. The selection of a government hospital as a landmark was made in light of its comprehensive serviceability across socio-economic groups in the proximate area. A total of 450 household were interviewed using the quota sampling method: 30 households from each locality of the area were randomly surveyed using a sampling frame. The sampling frame has been created by house listing before the survey. Likewise, each locality consists of 90 sampled households across three areas (i.e., 30 households \u00d7 3 areas), and 150 households from each area were taken from five different localities (i.e., 30 households \u00d7 5 localities). The purpose of fixing a quota of samples was to avoid high non-response rates, particularly from HRB and Old colonies, and to fulfil the desired sample size.",

High-rise residential buildings (HRB): Highrise residential buildings refer to tall buildings specially structured for residential purposes. In India, a building higher than 75 feet (23 m), generally 7 to 10 stories, is considered a high-rise. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) proposed that any building with at least a height of 30 m or nine floors can be categorized as high rise. It is a multi-dwelling unit that may be owned or rented. For this study, we considered those buildings having a minimum of nine-storey and maximum is having no limit. The dwelling unit here is considered as one unit of the flat of the building. Chawls: A Chawl is a building form particularly found in Mumbai. They are often one or two and sometimes three storeys with about 10 to 20 tenements, referred to as kholis, which means room on each floor. A usual tenement in a chawl consists of one all-purpose room that functions as a living and sleeping room. Families on each floor have or may not have to share a common block of toilets. Old colonies: Here, old colonies refer to those colonies established a long time ago by the migrants of the same ethnic or cultural group. In this study, we have selected Parsis (migrated from Arab to India) and Sindhi colony, as they are considered as one of the oldest settlers of Mumbai. Slum Rehabilitated House (SRH): The Government of Maharashtra has launched a comprehensive slum rehabilitation scheme by introducing an innovative concept of using land as a resource and allowing incentives on floor space index (FSI) in the form of tenements for sale in the open market, for cross-subsidization of the slum rehabilitation tenements which are to be provided free to the slum-dwellers.",

Three models of logistic regression were constructed to assess the correlates of loneliness among household heads. The probability of significance was set at 5%. The conceptual thinking behind these models were to understand the built form of a neighbourhood in an aesthetic form that influences the psychology of its residents. In some places where the built form is unfavourable, residents face a variety of physical and physiological challenges. Individual and social factors assist residents in coping in a negative or unfavourable built environment. So, in this direction the Unadjusted Model-1 initiated to examined the relationship between the types of localities and loneliness.

Slum followed HRB comprises the highest percentage of 25-45 years household head population whereas old colonies followed by HRB have a higher level of older household head population. The sex-wise distribution of household heads is significantly skewed towards male counterparts compare to females in general. However, slum followed by HRB consists the highest number of the female household head by 18 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Four-fifth (82%) of the respondents were currently married, followed by others (widow/widower), 15 percent, and 3 percent never married. Besides, it was found that people living in old colonies had a high mean level of years of schooling, per capita income, and years of stay, followed by HRB. Table 2 depicts the mean distribution of respondent in selected localities by background characteristics. Mean years of schooling was highest in Old colonies (17.2 years) and lowest among respondents residing in slums (7 years). Figure 2 shows the percent distribution of household heads who felt loneliness in last seven days categorized as never, Some of the time, and Often. For further analysis (logistic regression analysis), responses were converted into a dichotomous form such as never lonely and lonely. Table 3 shows the level of loneliness pattern among household heads by their background characteristics. The level of loneliness was varying with the type of locality, among the household heads of the SRH, 60% reported about loneliness followed by old colonies (33%). The chisquare value (\u03c7 2 -66.3; P = 0.000) is showing a significant association of loneliness with locality type.

The unadjusted and adjusted OR value shows that SRH followed by old colony residents strongly associate with loneliness. Previous studies also asserted that SRH residents complain about the unfavourable built environment, which reduces the sensory connectedness and restricts traditional flows with other neighbours due to random allocation of flats [31] . It eventually hampers their collective identity, weakened their social support network, and significantly leads to loneliness. Hence, they want to go back to the horizontal slum again; this willingness considers as a rebound phenomenon [32] . On the other hand, old colonies comprised mainly of old-age Parsi and Sindhi populations. The present study asserted that factors like disability and health, loss of a spouse, living alone, and ageing were significantly associated with their perceived loneliness. There is no direct empirical evidence on this issue. However, some previous studies indicate about declining demographic trend of these communities, particularly Parsis.

It might be happening due to a greater number of chronic diseases creating hindrance to engage in social activities and roles such as spouse, parent, and worker. This finding is consistent with the previous studies [34, 35] . Multimorbidity leads to social isolation which can be a cause of loneliness [36] . Furthermore, Barlow et al. (2015) demonstrated that multimorbidity affects physical functioning, which can further affect loneliness [37] . Another plausible explanation was provided by Kristensen et al. (2019) , where they associated loneliness with quality of the relationships and not with the quantity of the relationships [34] . They suggested that multimorbidity may affect loneliness by reducing the quality in relationship [34] . Furthermore, Jessen et al. (2018) also provided a plausible explanation for the relationship between multimorbidity and loneliness and stated that household head with multimorbidity have to deal with health care system on a regular basis, thereby restricting their social participation leading to loneliness [38] . To add more, people with multimorbidity may have to leave labour market thereby reducing the everyday contact with colleagues, which could also be a plausible factor of loneliness among them [38] . Gender is an important determinant in the context of perceived loneliness; and in agreement with previous research results indicate that females were lonelier than their male counterpart [39, 40] . In contrast, few studies have also noted an otherwise outcome where men were more likely to experience loneliness than their female counterparts [41, 42] .The likelihood of odds was also significantly three times more among females after adjusting all other factors. This situation occurs because females are not highly interconnected or have cohesive sets of friends compared to their counterparts. Moreover, women are also more likely to precise and share their emotions with, and be more responsive to the emotions of others [43] . However, the stigma related to loneliness, mainly among men, is different; men are less likely to interact and intimate closure than women; but relational connectedness is more important for ladies than men [44] .",

In a marital union, protection from social loneliness come from involvement with spouse, thereby reducing loneliness [45] . Women not in marital union may perceive loneliness due to the adjustment in a new role of singlehood [46] . Another plausible explanation suggest that with increasing age, friendship ties become weak and the spouse is the only person with whom older adult feel attached; thereby reducing loneliness among them [47] .",

Although different dimensions of social capital attribute, unlike personal characteristics. Results show that a high level of personal relationships leads to a high level of loneliness. This positive, strong relationship considers as a dark side of close personal relation [49] . Fafchamps (2006) argues that sometimes an excessive amount of social bonding and connection results in pressure and tension, and it becomes negative, creating conformity instead of variety [50] . In contrast, a high level of trust and cooperation and civic engagement reduces loneliness by three quarters. It is evident that the quality of social engagement and trust is protective against loneliness and a key factor to achieve personal and social desired goals [9, 20] .",

The study acknowledges that the physical illness was self-reported and was not verified against other data sources such as medical records. This might have resulted in misreporting in some instances, especially as evidence suggests that while self-reports of physical illness mostly accord with doctor's reports, not all diseases are reported with equal accuracy, and there might also be age-related differences in the reliability of reports for some diseases. Nonetheless, the cross-sectional nature of the present study restricts the claims of causal inferences; hence we cannot conclude that an increase in loneliness is caused by any particular factor or vice-versa. As this study was crosssectional, we could not establish causality or determine the direction of the observed association. Also, the information on loneliness was self-reported and was assessed using one item only. Furthermore, the study findings shall not be generalized to a larger set of population as purposive sampling was done in a metropolitan region only.",

In this context, loneliness rapidly emerged as a public health concerns in urban part. Hence, current study tried to examined the level of loneliness and its significant factors. Finding reveals that level of loneliness symptomatology in urban dwellers may be attributed significantly by individual (i.e., morbidity status and sex of respondent), social (i.e., personal relation) and residing locality characteristics. On the other hand, some factors (i.e., civic engagement, and trust and cooperation) identified as inversely associated with loneliness. In nutshell, study concludes that that there is a significant effect of locality in the subjective feeling of loneliness. Slum rehabilitees were found to be significantly lonelier than their counterpart localities. Furthermore, many identified the risk factors of loneliness could be avoided if timely preventive measures could be taken along with adequate care. Improvement in aesthetic design of future slum rehabilitation projects can promote socially cohesive environment. ",
