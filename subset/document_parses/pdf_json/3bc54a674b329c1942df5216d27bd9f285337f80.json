This is a promising concept for solving the problem of coordination, but until recently, examples of Learning Healthcare Systems were rare. We and colleagues have described Collaborative Learning Health Systems (CLHSs), termed Learning Networks, 2 that use a network organizational architecture to facilitate collaboration at scale in order to improve health outcomes. We have described the CLHS framework and methods 2 and the processes used to replicate these and have shown that CLHSs improve outcomes across multiple diseases and conditions and across participating sites with diverse contexts. [3] [4] [5] More recently, we have recently described a formal methodology for assessing network maturity. 6 As of Spring of 2021, we know of 11 CLHSs 7 (Learning Networks), encompassing almost 700 teams across almost 300 healthcare organizations in 43 States and Washington, D.C., and five countries. Given that CLHSs have been replicated, within pediatrics, across chronic conditions (eg, Reference 4), inpatient safety, [8] [9] [10] [11] preterm birth, 3 and community health, 12 it is appropriate to consider these as a class.",

Networks, due to their distributed, highly connected nature, achieve and sustain cooperation and collaboration broadly.

What kind of phenomena are CLHSs and what is an appropriate scientific approach? How might we frame CLHSs conceptually? What are potential mechanisms of action? In this commentary, we suggest answers to these questions, with the goal of helping researchers and practitioners better understand and improve CLHSs, including Learning Networks. Our approach to answering these questions is based on our own and colleagues' experiences, as well as qualitative literature review to synthesize a range of scholarship relevant to CLHSs. We incorporate sources from a variety of fields including complexity, organizational dynamics, political science, evolutionary biology, behavioral economics, sociology, innovation, and system design.

Moreover, these needs will change over the course of her illness as both she and her condition change. 19 Orleans and her family need resources such as optimal treatment (eg, medicine, appropriate nutrition), information about how and when to call the doctor in between clinical appointments, accommodations at school such as unrestricted restroom access, and support around body image, managing a colostomy, or how to navigate conversations with friends about the disease and its implications.

The rigor and relevance of resources posted to the commons must be ensured. Increasing the number of people aware of and involved in CLHSs and facilitating increasing levels of contribution is an ongoing effort required to scale up. Equity must be directly addressed, incorporating a range of stakeholders so that these advances do not widen, but rather reduce existing health disparities. Especially important are ways to change the system to make it possible for people with fewer resources or who face systemic racism to be able to benefit from CLHSs.",

Hospitals also employ this value creation logic to provide treatment in support of patient needs, as when individualized treatment plans are developed, deployed, and modified during an inpatient stay. Even with well-defined patient goals, needs, and accessible resources, the huge number of possible resource-by-need combinations easily overwhelms the knowledge available to individual or small groups of experts. This problem will only be exacerbated as the pace of knowledge creation accelerates (eg, advances in personalized medicine, through genomics, remote sensors, and other innovations). Moreover, some resources (eg, the lived experience of managing a colostomy bag 38 ) are simply not available to clinicians. The overwhelming variety of possible matches, as well as the diversity of resources that patients need, invites consideration of new models of value creation. 39 The value shop logic can be enhanced via a \"value network\" in which value is created by facilitating connections among actors as well as resources. 36,37 This organizational configuration is ubiquitous in other industries (eg, Wikipedia, Facebook, Travelocity, Lyft, Monster.com). In a value shop, doctors and patients can bring only their own resources to solve the matching problem. A CLHS uses value network logic to facilitate more flexible and dynamic connections and exchange between and among actors and resources. 36,40 A value network can thus allow and facilitate needed customization beyond what is often possible in an unconnected value shop configuration. A value network also makes it possible for resources to be more widely available by connecting individuals, organizations, and data. Bianca's expertise can be brought to bear, as can the data generated by Dr. Kapour's app. In a value shop, information about what works for the individual might not be shared beyond the patientclinical team dyad. Using a value network configuration, data and knowledge generated at each clinical encounter can be shared with the rest of the network, where it can be accessed and acted upon by other patients and clinicians. 41 Orleans' data from Dr. Kapour's app could inform Nurse Mars' consultation with a different patient in a different city. Patients and families may be able to access information from other patients and families, 27 and clinicians and care teams can do the same, 42 all using data shared and aggregated across people and organizations. In this way, the network configuration recapitulates the value shop at scale. This connectivity also allows the value network to facilitate resource creation and sharing outside of the clinical encounter, for example, via peer-to-peer interactions, information from remote sensors, and through other service providers. Ultimately, more IKK is available so that people get WINWIN.",

Given this reality, there are a variety of mechanisms possible to ensure the relevance and rigor of available resources and to mitigate the risk that such information would be spread. One way is to build a review process into the development of the resource. For example, in ImproveCareNow, the Patient Advisory Council (PAC) has a system for generating patient-led resources (eg, toolkits on nutrition and IBD, transitioning to college, body image concerns, or educational and occupational accomodations), with a review function distributed across a variety of actors within the network including clinicians and the broader community. 44 A second way is to create and sustain cultural norms (eg, integrity, transparency, pro-science) inconsistent with the propogation of misinformation. Such cultural infrastructure 45 makes it more likely that the community will develop behaviors (eg, asking peers to cite sources, considering accuracy before reposting 46 ) that mitigate against propogation of misinformation. CLHS culture typically views the creation and sharing of resources among patients as supporting, rather than supplanting, the clinical relationship by bringing more IKK to the clinical relationship.",

Third, their goals are tripartite-they are organized around clinical care, improvement, and research. This integration of effort sets them apart from networks focused only on QI or research.
