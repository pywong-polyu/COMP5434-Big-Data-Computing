            "text": "Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic . While respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the COVID-19 patients, coagulopathy Zhou et al., 2020a) , systemic inflammation and myocardial injury (Aghagoli et al., 2020) are also involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Elevated prothrombin (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and D-dimer have been reported in COVID-19 patients (Chen et al., 2020b; Wang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a) . During the disease progression, activation of the host defense system results in an imbalance between the procoagulant and anticoagulant systems (Liu et al., 2021) . This leads to thrombi formation that is termed as immunothrombosis (Key et al., 1990; Engelmann and Massberg, 2013) . D-dimer, as a fibrin degradation product, has been widely reported to be elevated in COVID-19 patients (Rostami and Mansouritorghabeh, 2020) , though without standard reporting Thachil et al., 2020) . However, fibrinogen as a clotting factor in coagulation and thrombosis, has not been well studied. In addition, fibrinogen acts as a positive acute phase reactants, which is increased during inflammatory response (Engelmann and Massberg, 2013) . Furthermore, fibrinogen has been considered as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Ernst, 1990; Heinrich and Assmann, 1995; Sweetnam et al., 1996; Ahmed et al., 2012) . It has been reported that fibrinogen levels are increased in COVID-19 patients (Arachchillage and Laffan, 2020) . Additionally, autopsy studies of COVID-19 patients demonstrated the fibrin rich thrombi in small vessels and pulmonary capillaries (Fox et al., 2020) . However, the overall profile of fibrinogen in COVID-19 patients has remained unclear. By analyzing the correlation of fibrinogen with disease severity, and laboratory markers, the goal of this study was to investigate the role of fibrinogen in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and evaluate the role of fibrinogen as a biomarker for disease severity.",

The institutional review board at UAB approved this study. The diagnosis was based on World Health Organization guidance and confirmed by 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples in the clinical lab of UAB Medical Center (WHO, 2020, May 27). Patients' demographic, clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively collected from the electronic health records. Clinically, severity of the COVID-19 patients was classified into mild, moderate, severe and critical disease according to the Clinical management of COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO, 2020, May 27) . Patients were divided into non-severe (mild or moderate) and severe (severe or critical) groups. Severe disease was defined with clinical signs of pneumonia plus one of the following: respiratory rate >30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, SpO2 < 90% on room air. Laboratory parameters including complete blood count (CBC) with differentiation, coagulation profile, liver function, renal function, cardiac markers and inflammatory markers were obtained at initial diagnosis. Fibrinogen level was tested using immunoturbidimetric assay with a reference range of 220.0-498.0 mg/dl. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters and outcomes were compared between patients with elevated and normal fibrinogen to evaluate the role of fibrinogen in COVID-19 patients.",

Categorical variables were expressed as number and percentage and compared by Fisher's exact test. To assess the predictive value of fibrinogen for disease severity and ICU admission, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted with the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity.

Fibrinogen levels on admission were associated with elevated inflammatory markers, and elevated fibrinogen levels may be used as an early biomarker to predict disease severity and ICU admission. COVID-19 is a systemic infection with significant impact on the coagulation system that often manifests in thrombotic complications and coagulopathy (Levi et al., 2020) . Previous data have showed that fibrinogen levels are elevated among patients with COVID-19 (Toh and Hoots, 2007; Han et al., 2020) and decreased at later stage of the disease when disseminated intravascular coagulation happens (Tang et al., 2020) . However, there is no consensus on the role of fibrinogen in predicting outcomes in COVID-19 patients regarding disease severity, ICU admission and mortality (Gao et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020) . Tang et al. have reported that fibrinogen levels are elevated in both survived and non-survived group, but the difference between two groups was not statistically significant (Tang et al., 2020) . However, studies by other groups reported an association between elevated fibrinogen levels upon admission and poor outcome (Gao et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) . In this study, we report that elevations in fibrinogen upon admission were significantly associated with disease severity and ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. Consistently, we found that LDH, a biomarker for severe disease or multiple organ failure was significantly associated with the fibrinogen level in our study.",
