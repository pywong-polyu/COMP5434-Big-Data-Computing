Several lines of evidence implicate overactivation of complement. To delineate the involvement of complement in COVID-19, we prospectively studied 25 ICU-hospitalized patients for up to 21 days. Complement biomarkers in patient sera and healthy controls were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Correlations with respiratory function and mortality were analyzed. Activation of complement via the classical/lectin pathways was variably increased. Strikingly, all patients had increased activation of the alternative pathway (AP) with elevated levels of activation fragments, Ba and Bb. This was associated with a reduction of the AP negative regulator, factor (F) H. Correspondingly, terminal pathway biomarkers of complement activation, C5a and sC5b-9, were significantly elevated in all COVID-19 patient sera. C5a and AP constituents Ba and Bb, were significantly associated with hypoxemia. Ba and FD at the time of ICU admission were strong independent predictors of mortality in the following 30 days. Levels of all complement activation markers were sustained throughout the patients' ICU stays, contrasting with the varying serum levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein, and ferritin. Severely ill COVID-19 patients have increased and persistent activation of complement, mediated strongly via the AP. Complement activation biomarkers may be valuable measures of severity of lung disease and the risk of mortality. Large-scale studies will reveal the relevance of these findings to thromboinflammation in acute and post-acute COVID-19.",

Indeed, some predict that the pandemic will transition to endemic, causing multiple reinfections [1] . It is furthermore widely recognized that there are long-term and often serious sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and these will pose further challenges to healthcare systems and economies worldwide [2] . It is clear that there remains an urgent need to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19, in the hopes that such knowledge will yield better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

            "text": "The complement system comprises > 40 soluble and membrane-bound proteins, serving to rapidly recognize and discard foreign pathogens and damaged host cells, recruit inflammatory cells, promote adaptive immunity, and facilitate healing (reviewed [12, 13] ). Complement can be activated via the classical (CP), lectin (LP), and alternative (AP) pathways. The CP is initiated primarily on immune complexes via recognition of IgG, IgM or pentraxins by C1q, a component of the C1 complex. This sequentially activates C1r and C1s, leading to proteolysis of complement factors C4 and C2 to generate the CP C3 convertase, C4b2b, and liberation of activation fragments C4a and C2a. The LP is initiated by binding of complexes of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), collectins or ficolins and MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) to microbial pathogen surfaces. Similar to C1s, MASP-2 cleaves C4 and C2 to generate the LP, C3 convertase C4b2b. The AP is constitutively active at a low level by continuous hydrolysis of C3 to a C3b-like moiety, C3(H 2 O). Circulating factor D (FD) cleaves factor B, liberating activation fragment Ba and generating Bb complexed to C3b, thus forming the AP C3 convertase, C3bBb. The C3 convertases cleave C3-C3b, promoting feedback amplification of the cascade that generates more C3 convertase and addition of C3b molecules to the AP and CP/LP C3 convertases to form the respective C5 convertases. Cleavage of C5 releases the potent anaphylatoxin C5a, while C5b spontaneously assembles with C6, C7, C8 and multiple C9 molecules to form the lytic C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC), which also circulates in a soluble form (sC5b-9) [14] . Several soluble and membrane-anchored proteins, including serum factor H (FH), prevent excess complement activation. Diminished functional expression of one or more of these negative regulators, increases the risk of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with diffuse microvascular thrombosis, inflammation and multiorgan damage, a syndrome with features similar to those of COVID-19 [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Notably, anti-complement interventions are highly effective in preventing thrombosis in aHUS [24] .",

We show that complement activation via all three pathways, but most prominently the AP, is markedly elevated in all critically ill COVID-19 patients; that this is sustained for the duration of their ICU stay up to 21 days; and that specific markers of complement activation correlate with lung function and are strong independent predictors of mortality. Our findings reveal potentially important biomarkers of disease activity and severity that may be useful in the design of treatments for acute and chronic COVID-19.",

To control for the effect of demographic variables on mortality, age and sex were tested alongside complement markers in multivariable logistic regressions, but given the low probability of an event (i.e., death within 30 days of ICU admission), the estimated minimum sample size required to reliably perform multivariable analyses was 118, using the formula 10\u00d7k p , where k is the number of independent variables (2) and p is the probability of an event (0.17).

Compared to healthy controls, median levels of C5a and sC5b-9 in COVID-19 patients at the time of enrolment were 8.8-fold and 4.2-fold higher, respectively (p < 0.001 for both), indicating markedly increased activation of the terminal pathway ( Fig. 2A , B) for all COVID-19 patients. We observed only a moderate association between serum sC5b-9 and C5a (rho = 0.48, p = 0.02), suggesting that circulating sC5b-9 and C5a levels vary somewhat independently, consistent with differences in their circulating half-lives and clearance. Given the feedback between coagulation and complement, which could potentially alter the between-group differences in complement Wieslab solid-phase screening assays were conducted to compare the residual complement pathway activity in healthy control (\u2022) and COVID-19 patient (\u25cb) sera.

Thus, as might be predicted, circulating Ba and FD were elevated in patients with renal dysfunction [26, 28] . We tested whether renal dysfunction could explain the higher serum levels of Ba and FD in critically ill COVID-19 patients by comparing Ba and FD to serum creatinine (Cr), the latter being a measure of renal function. We observed strong positive correlations between Ba and FD (rho = 0.75, p < 0.0001), Ba and Cr (rho = 0.76, p < 0.0001), and FD and Cr (rho = 0.67, p < 0.0003). Patients were then stratified into two groups based on normal (Cr \u2264 100 mg/dL) or elevated serum Cr. Compared to healthy controls, COVID-19 patients with normal serum Cr still had significantly higher serum levels of Ba (Fig. 3A ), but these Ba levels were significantly lower than those of the COVID-19 patients with elevated serum Cr (i.e. > 100 mg/dL). FD levels were similar between healthy controls and COVID-19 patients with normal serum Cr (p = 0.36, Fig. 3B ), but significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients with renal dysfunction (serum Cr > 100 mg/dL). This suggested that increased FD in COVID-19 patients may reflect renal dysfunction that is linked to, but not solely responsible for increased Ba, and that a portion of the elevated Ba in critically ill COVID-19 patients arises from hyperactivation of the alternative pathway in vivo.",

Given the strong positive correlations of serum Cr with Ba and FD, we similarly tested the ability of Cr, Ba, and FD to predict mortality in the 30 days following ICU admission in this cohort. Using a simple logistic regression model, we found serum Cr at the time of ICU admission was useful for discriminating between non-survivors and survivors, but elevated Cr at the time of ICU admission did not substantially affect the odds of dying (Table 1) . By comparison, we found that both Ba and FD were useful for discriminating between non-survivors and survivors, they fit the dataset well, and a one unit increase of Ba or FD increased the odds of dying 4-5-fold (Table 1) . Other complement analytes were also analyzed but none conveyed an increased odds of dying in this cohort. We also performed multivariable logistic regressions using Ba and age, Ba and sex, FD and age, or FD and sex as predictor variables (Table S5 ). These showed that neither age nor sex enhanced the power of Ba or FD in predicting mortality. Similar to serum Cr, d-dimer has been proposed as a biomarker for the severity of COVID-19 and risk of mortality. Therefore, we compared the models for complement analytes to ICU admission levels of d-dimer. d-dimer was poor at discriminating between non-survivors and survivors, evidenced by the model performance, goodness of fit, and odds ratio (Table 1 ). This suggests that while d-dimer is useful for predicting death in cohorts comprising individuals with mild, moderate, and severe disease, it may not be useful for predicting death amongst critically ill patients, as shown here.",

Drawing from work with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, the spike protein and nucleocapsid (N)-protein of SARS-CoV-2 can bind to MBL, ficolin-2 and collectin-11, thereby triggering activation of complement via the LP [32, 35, 36] . There is also a highly conserved motif within the N-protein of the highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that binds to MASP-2 and triggers its autoactivation, resulting in enhanced generation of the LP C3 convertase in the presence of mannan and MBL [32] . Increased C4d levels in COVID-19 patients in our cohort and that of others, cannot distinguish the CP from the LP [3] . However, our Complement System Screen data implicate the CP in contributing to increased complement activation in most of our COVID-19 patients.",

The CP may also be initiated in an antibody-independent manner via a direct interaction of the globular region of C1q with viral envelope glycoproteins shown for several viruses including, HIV-1, HTLV-1, EBV and CMV (reviewed in [37, 38] ). To the best of our knowledge, these antibody-independent mechanisms of activation of the CP have not been definitively shown for SARS-CoV-2 or any of the other highly pathogenic coronaviruses. However, viral surfaces may be also recognized by serum amyloid peptide P, SIGN-R1 (a C-type lectin) and CRP, to which C1q can bind and trigger the CP [38] . In this regard elevated CRP levels, observed in our patient cohort, have been correlated with severity of COVID-19 [39] and may therefore contribute to CP activation.",

Thus, most complement components, including C3, C5 and FH, may be synthesized by immune and non-immune cells, including epithelial and endothelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection of respiratory epithelial cells has been shown to induce cleavage of intracellular C3, which may result in local release of C3a [41, 42] . Interestingly, generation of C3a by the virus-infected cells could not only be blocked by JAK 1/2 inhibitors, but also by a factor B inhibitor, the latter effect implicating an alternative-like pathway of activation [41] . The discovery of such intriguing cellular mechanisms of complement activation obviously have potential therapeutic implications and are worthy of further study.",

            "text": "Of the three complement pathways, it was only the AP, via which increased activation was observed in all of our COVID-19 patients. Recent studies have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may trigger activation of complement via the AP by competing with FH for cell-surface heparan sulfate, thus compromising its AP inhibitory role [4] . Changes in the function and/or quantity of other components of the AP might also contribute to heightened activation via the AP. In our COVID-19 cohort, elevated serum Ba and Bb levels were accompanied by a ~ 25% decrease in FH, a key negative regulator of the AP. The basis for the FH reduction is unknown, although it may be caused by increased clearance by the acute-phase reactant, CRP [43] , the levels of which were elevated in our cohort of COVID-19 patients, as in others [30] . Nonetheless, this reduction in FH alone would not likely be sufficient to cause the thromboinflammatory response observed in COVID-19, but could contribute. Our finding of sustained activation of complement in critically ill COVID-19 patients, has also been noted by others [3, 34] . These were extended by our studies by evaluating patients for up to 21 days. Even over that prolonged time period, complement activation persisted at a high steady level. This is notable, as the short circulating half-lives of the C3/C5 convertases and most of the complement activation products (e.g., Ba, Bb, and C5a) implies that, despite patients being discharged from the ICU to the ward and without obvious evidence of organ dysfunction, there is likely ongoing damage that is sustained or perpetuated by complement activation. Particularly in light of the relatively common occurrence of long-term and often serious sequelae post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, underlying complement activation may be clinically relevant. The fact that serum levels of other inflammatory markers, including IL-6, ferritin and CRP, varied widely in concentration and duration of elevation within and between patients, suggests that the complement pathway(s) may offer a more efficacious target for prevention/treatment of the \"long-haul\" post-acute syndrome, since biomarkers were persistently elevated in every patient.",

In these COVID-19 patients, we show that Ba, Bb, and C5a were independently associated with lung function and that the associations with PaO 2 /FIO 2 were as reliant as IL-6. Interestingly, although Ba, Bb, C5a, serum ferritin, CRP and IL-6 are each independently associated with PaO 2 / FIO 2 , there was no significant correlation between the markers of complement activation (Ba, Bb, C5a), and the acutephase reactant markers of inflammation (IL-6, CRP, ferritin).

Larger cohort studies could further support the utility of Ba and FD as early predictors of mortality in COVID-19, and the current study serves as rationale. Small sample size also limited our ability to develop multivariable models of complement analytes to predict mortality as well as the performance of forward selection of additional variables to control for potential confounding effects of age, sex, and known comorbidities. Age-dependent changes in complement factors have been reported, but these observations only strengthen our findings, in that with age, circulating levels of FD decreased, while the complement inhibitor protein, C1-INH, increased [51] . The novelty of our findings also limited our ability to perform cross-validation of these models using other published datasets. Finally, although we attempted to consider age in the selection of our control cohort, strict age matching of patients to controls was not feasible, limiting our control of the effects of age-related changes in complement responses.",

Here we present the first study to report serum levels of Ba and FD in COVID-19, thereby providing additional insights into the pathways involved and the potential utility of these markers as predictors of disease and outcome. From a therapeutic perspective, there are numerous anti-complement therapies in preclinical and clinical development for COVID-19, none of which have yet yielded overwhelming benefit. This may be due to many factors, including for example, the dose and timing of administration, the complement activation site of intervention, the subset of patients being treated, and the use of concomitant therapies. Lack of major success by blocking the terminal pathway with a C5 inhibitor alone may be due to in part to the existence of C5 bypass pathways [52, 53] . Recent studies implicating the C5a-C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) axis in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated acute lung injury and ARDS [54, 55] , suggest that blockade of this pathway may be more beneficial [56] [57] [58] . Our data and that of others would support interfering with the AP by, for example, inhibiting FD. Most intriguing is the potential contribution of intracellular complement that may yield entirely new therapeutic strategies [41, 42] . Overall, our study highlights the involvement of complement in COVID-19, and provides strong rationale for continued efforts to identify predictive biomarkers of disease activity, and to delineate the underlying mechanisms toward the development of better treatments.",
