The choice of this hashtag was a result of the controversies and uncertainties created among South Africans with the unveiling of the National Health Insurance Bill for discussion in parliament. This inquiry was grounded in graph and network theory in order to conduct a social network analysis of the national conversation of #NHI. This resulted in a visual graph model based on 4112 #NHI tweets, done by 1 902 Twitter users (vertices) indicating 4 110 Twitter interactions (edges). The key influential actors in this SNA was the Minister of Health, the media and to a limited degree, citizens of South Africa who will be influenced by the bill. The degree distributions revealed that relationships between the major #NHI Twitter users were limited, as the majority of closeness and eigenvector centrality indicated low connectivity. This could indicate the lack of involvement of the South African citizens in public discourse around the NHI bill which will affect all South African. From the preceding discussions, it is clear that social media is inevitably central to modern day society, with widespread influence that cannot be refuted or disregarded. In this paper, it was demonstrated how big, real-time data from Twitter can be employed using NodeXL Pro, to draw insights through social media metrics with visualizations. The paper further demonstrated NodeXL Pro as an enabler to harness big unstructured data which are mass-produced on a daily basis. More so, that it enables, through using appropriate analytic techniques, inference from seemingly uncoordinated microblogs that may assist businesses and governments alike in decision-making. The #NHI case study further reinforces that emerging economics are part of the social media race.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Networked co-production of 311 services: investigating the use of Twitter in five US cities", "authors": [{"first": "X", "middle": [], "last": "Gao", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2018, "venue": "Int.
