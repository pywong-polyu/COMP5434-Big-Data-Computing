TPB posits those attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behaviour control are key antecedents of behavioural intention, which is a proximate predictor of behaviour. In addition, perceived behavioural control is expected to have a direct association with behaviours in so far as the target behaviours are within one's realm of influence. Finally, past behaviour is considered as an additional predictor of intention and behaviour. A number of empirical studies and meta-analytic reviews, across a variety of personal health behaviours, provide credence to these theory predictions [17] [18] [19] . Generally, perceived behaviour control is considered as reflected in self-efficacy or beliefs that one has the capabilities to perform directed health behaviours [20, 21] . When both perceived control and self-efficacy variables are tested, self-efficacy appears to be more strongly associated with health behaviours [17, 21] .",

Several studies conducted in Netherlands on HPV vaccination show that the association between attitudes, norms, and efficacy beliefs with behavioural uptake is mediated through intentions [24, 33, 34] , consistent with research in other health domains. In contrast, Wu et al., [25] conducted a longitudinal study of Chinese parents in Hong Kong and found that parental positive attitude, norm, and intention-but not negative attitudes and behaviour control-were significant predictors of their child's influenza vaccination only among parents who had previously vaccinated their children. Among parents who had not previously vaccinated their children, only intention was predictor of future influenza vaccine uptake. They asserted that TPB is less predictive of new health-related behaviour than predicting repeated behaviours. A recent study longitudinally tested TPB on COVID-19 safety behaviours (but not vaccine intentions) and found that baseline attitudes, norms, and perceived behaviour control for social distancing were all associated with baseline intentions to social distance, which in turn were significantly associated with social distancing behaviour at follow-up in 3 months [22] .",

In total, 650 respondents completed both the surveys, and the reinterview response rate was 60%. Compared to the complete sample in March 2021, the follow-up panel survey composed of slightly more older respondents (66 years and above), European New Zealanders, and fewer M\u0101ori. The sample composition was similar on gender, education, and annual income between the two waves (See Table 1 ). Qualtrics and its affiliates maintain nationally representative active panels composed of over~350,000 respondents in New Zealand. The respondents are recruited using a variety of media channels and they receive gift cards or sweepstakes entries for larger prizes to participate. Hard-to-reach population receive additional compensation for taking and for recruiting others to do a survey, ensuring a good representative sample.

Other studies also show no association between social norms in encouraging vaccine behaviour, arguing instead that attitudes are better predictor of public-facing health behaviours rather than private behaviours such as vaccination [17, 40] . At least one study in the UK shows that communicating descriptive COVID-19 vaccination norms to young people, even by other young people, does not increase vaccine intentions any more than a standard government notification on vaccines [43] . It is also possible that the association between social norms and vaccine intentions is mediated by other variables of TPB [41] .

Similarly, other variables of perceived susceptibility and severity from Health Belief Model should be evaluated for a more comprehensive model [1, 4, 27] . The associations between social norms and vaccine intentions-tested using multinomial logistic models and multiple imputation models-were inconsistent and weak at best.

Future research should investigate how changing severity of the disease spread influence vaccine intentions. Recent research shows that vaccine hesitant and unvaccinated are much less worried about the coronavirus, the Delta variant, and have less confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines compared to those who are vaccinated [48] . Future research should also survey medical staff, social workers, and other frontline healthcare staff on vaccination intentions. The influence of media sources and trust on intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine and to encourage others to get one should also be investigated [28] .
