The precise molecular mechanisms of HIV MTCT remain unclear. HIV-1 transmigrates through fetal/infant oropharyngeal and tonsil mucosal epithelia, indicating a critical role of oral mucosal epithelium in HIV MTCT [1, 2] . The majority (>90%) of virions internalized into vesicles of infant tonsil epithelium, including multivesicular bodies (MVB) and vacuoles, are sequestered in the endosomes for up to 9 days [3] . In contrast, such prolonged intracellular sequestration of HIV is not observed in adult tonsil epithelial cells, where intracellular virus is rapidly inactivated by high-level expression of the anti-HIV innate immune proteins human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) and hBD-3 [1, 4] . However, the lack of, or low-level expression of hBD-2 and -3 in fetal and infant oral epithelial cells leads to the transmission of infectious HIV via fetal/infant oropharyngeal and tonsil epithelia [1, 4] .",

To achieve the higher level of penetration of hBD-2 and -3 into vesicles containing HIV-1, we used synthetic hBDs containing the unique motif YGRKKRRQRRR, which may promote hBD internalization into cells and vesicles. This motif has been identified in the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat and is known as a protein transduction domain (PTD) [19] [20] [21] [22] . The PTD signal is located between 47 and 57 amino acid residues of HIV-1 Tat's basic domain. It contains arginine and lysine residues, which are positively charged and play a critical role in the penetration of Tat into cells [19] . A similar peptide has also been found in the VP22 protein of herpes simplex virus-1 [23] . The PTD peptides rapidly penetrate mammalian cells and tissues and are therefore called cell-penetrating peptides (CPP). The PTD signal has been used to promote the delivery of various proteins into cells and tissues [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, the molecular mechanism of PTD-mediated penetration of proteins into mammalian cells is not fully understood. It has been shown that the PTD may initiate endocytosis and macropinocytosis [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , which facilitate internalization of cargo proteins tagged with PTD. Furthermore, PTD could induce the penetration of proteins directly via cell membranes [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Direct penetration is energy independent and may occur at a low temperature [39] [40] [41] [42] . It is also possible that PTD-mediated internalization of cargo proteins is facilitated by a combination of endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and direct penetration [33] [34] [35] .",

Before infection, PBMC were activated with 2.5 \u00b5g/mL phytohemagglutinin (Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA) and 1 \u00b5g/mL interleukin-2 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for 3 days. All stock viruses of HIV-1 were purified by using Amicon Ultra-15 columns as described [43, 44] . Primary tonsil epithelial keratinocytes were expanded from tonsil tissue samples collected after routine tonsillectomies in HIV-negative children under 5 years of age. Mucosal epithelial layers were separated from subepithelial connective tissues, and epithelial cells were dissociated with 1 mg/mL collagenase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 500 mg/mL dispase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) for 5-10 h at 37 \u2022 C. The cell suspension was washed with KGM medium twice by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was dissociated into single cells in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA for 10-30 min. To remove debris, cells were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m membrane (BD Biosciences). Trypsin then was inactivated with KGM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were washed, and keratinocytes were grown in KGM medium. The purity of the epithelial cells was verified by immunostaining of cells in a cocktail of antikeratin antibodies containing Ab-1 and Ab-2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, South San Francisco, CA, USA); 100% of cells expressed keratin and were used in all experiments.",

TER measurement of hBD-treated and untreated polarized cells showed that none of the hBDs or their combination reduced the TER, in contrast to EDTA treatment, which drastically reduced TER ( Figure 1B ) by disruption of tight junctions [47] . Thus, these experiments showed that hBD-2 and -3 or their combination, with or without PTD signal, did not alter the polarity of infant tonsil epithelial cells.",

To examine if hBD-2 and -3 containing PTD can also inactivate vesicular HIV-1 by cointernalization of virions, we exposed polarized tonsil epithelial cells to HIV-1 SF33 and to hBDs with or without PTD signal for 2 h. In parallel experiments, we exposed polarized tonsil epithelial cells to HIV-1 SF33 for 48 h for viral sequestration and then exposed cells to hBDs with or without PTD signal for 2 h. Cells not exposed to hBD served as a control. Cells were then homogenized, and the infectivity of virus was evaluated in PBMC ( Figure 2A) . ELISA p24 showed that, in the cointernalization experiments, hBDs with or without PTD signal inactivated intraepithelial HIV-1 SF33 , indicating that coendocytosis of hBDs with or without PTD inactivates HIV-1 in the endosomes, i.e., PTD does not alter the antiviral activity of hBD-2 and -3. Analysis of the infectivity of virions sequestered in tonsil epithelial cells after 48 h showed a lack of viral inactivation by hBD-2 and -3 without PTD. In contrast, viral inactivation was clearly detected by hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD , showing that PTD delivered the hBDs to pre-existing vesicles containing the virus. 20 ng/mL) was added to the apical surface, and cells were incubated at 37 \u2022 C for hBD-HIV cointernalization. After 2 h, cells were homogenized and samples were divided into two groups. In parallel experiments, tonsil cells were exposed to HIV-1 SF33 (20 ng/mL) for viral sequestration; after 24 h, hBDs (100 \u00b5g/mL) were added to the apical surface of the cells for 2 h. Cells were then homogenized and divided into two groups. One group of samples was examined by ELISA p24, which shows intracellular HIV-1.

Cells were coimmunostained for HIV-1 p24 and hBD-2 or -3. Confocal microscopy of cells exposed to hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD showed that HIV-1 p24 colocalized with both hBDs, indicating that hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD were internalized into vesicles containing HIV-1 SF33 ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, colocalization of HIV-1 p24 with hBD-2 and -3 was not detected in the cells exposed to hBD-2 and -3 without PTD ( Figure 4B ). These findings indicate that hBDs without PTD were internalized into cells, but they did not enter already-formed vesicles containing virions. Coimmunostaining of cells for HIV-1 p24 and hBD-2 or -3 with LBPA or rabankyrin-5 showed that virus in the MVB and vacuoles colocalized with hBDs, indicating the penetration of hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD into these vesicles containing virions ( Figure 4C ). Thus, PTD may play a critical role in the delivery of hBDs from cytosol into MVB and vacuoles by direct penetration via vesicular membranes. ",

After 1 h, cells were exposed to HIV-1 SF33 for 4 h in the presence of NH 4 Cl or bafilomycin. For the next 4 h, cells were treated with hBD-2 PTD or hBD-3 PTD , after which cells were examined for intracellular HIV-1 SF33 by ELISA p24. The results showed that the antiviral effect of hBD-2 PTD or hBD-3 PTD was eliminated in both NH 4 Cland bafilomycin-treated cells ( Figure 7A ). This reveals that the acidification of lysosomes plays a functional role in viral inactivation. The antiacidic effect of bafilomycin and the recovery of viral infectivity were stronger in hBD-2 PTD -or hBD-3 PTD -treated cells than in untreated cells. Thus, PTD may play a functional role in the fusion of vesicles containing HIV-1 and hBDs with the lysosomal compartments where virus was inactivated. After 1 h, cells were exposed to HIV-1 SF33 for 4 h in the presence of NH 4 Cl and bafilomycin. During the next 2 h, cells were treated with hBD-2 PTD or hBD-3 PTD (50 \u00b5g/mL each) and cells were examined for intracellular HIV-1 SF33 by ELISA p24. (B) Polarized tonsil epithelial cells were exposed to HIV-1 SF33 (20 ng/mL); after 48 h, cells were treated with various concentrations of hBD-2 PTD or hBD-3 PTD or their combination (50 \u00b5g/mL each) for 2 h. Cells were then homogenized, and intracellular HIV-1 was examined by ELISA p24. (C) Polarized tonsil epithelial cells were exposed to HIV-1 SF33 (100 ng/mL); after 24 h, cells were treated with hBD-2 PTD or hBD-3 PTD (50 \u00b5g/mL) or their combination (50 \u00b5g/mL of each) for 2 h. Cells were trypsinized and lysed, and intracellular virions were examined by Western blotting using antibodies against p24 and gp120. Results were reproduced in two independent experiments. (A,B) Results are shown as mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001 compared with untreated cells. Figure 5A (upper panels) shows that hBD-2 PTD , hBD-3 PTD and hBD-2 PTD + hBD-3 PTD reduce HIV-1 p24 of intraepithelial virions, suggesting that hBDs may cause the degradation of p24. To examine the role of hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD in the degradation of HIV-1 p24, we exposed polarized epithelial cells containing endosomal HIV-1 SF33 to various concentrations of hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD independently or in combination for 2 h. Analysis of intraepithelial virions by ELISA p24 showed that 40-60 \u00b5g/mL of hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD reduced p24 by~20 and 25%, respectively ( Figure 7B ). The combination of hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD reduced p24 by 50-55%, suggesting that hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD may cause the disruption of p24. To test this possibility, intraepithelial p24 was examined by Western blotting. Exposure of tonsil epithelial cells containing HIV-1 SF33 to hBD-2 PTD and/or hBD-3 PTD resulted in cleavage of the p24-generated additional protein band to 18 kDa ( Figure 7C, left panel) . Cells treated with a combination of hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD also generated 10, 8, and 6 kDa of small fragments of p24. This result indicates that hBD-2 PTD and/or hBD-3 PTD cause degradation of p24, which may reduce the infectivity of virions. Figure 5A (upper panels) also shows that the hBD-2 PTD -and hBD-3 PTD -mediated reduction in viral infectivity in PBMC was partially or fully independent of the reduction in p24 in epithelial cells by these hBDs, particularly hBD-2. This could be the result of hBDdependent disruption of gp120, an envelope protein of HIV-1. To examine the integrity of gp120 proteins, tonsil cells containing intravesicular HIV-1 SF33 were exposed to hBD-2 PTD and/or hBD-3 PTD and after 2 h, gp120 was detected by Western blotting. Results showed that gp120 had two bands: 120 kDa and 50 kDa. The 50-kDa band was smeared ( Figure 7C , right panel). In contrast, the untreated cells showed only one band at 120 kDa. These data clearly indicate that hBD-2 PTD and/or hBD-3 PTD disrupt the gp120 protein in the vesicles, generating one additional protein band.",

            "text": "In our previous work we showed that the direct interaction of PBMC and CD4+ T lymphocytes with tonsil epithelial cells containing intravesicular HIV-1 leads to the release of sequestered virions from epithelial cells and their spread to lymphocytes [3, 9] . This mechanism may serve as a critical step for initiation of HIV MTCT. Therefore, we examined the role of hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD in HIV-1 spread from tonsil epithelial cells into lymphocytes. To test if hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD reduce the spread of HIV-1 from epithelial cells to lymphocytes, we exposed polarized tonsil epithelial cells from three independent donors to HIV-1 SF33 . After 48 h, epithelial cells containing intracellular virus were treated with hBD-2 PTD and/or hBD-3 PTD for 2 h and then tonsil cells were cocultivated with activated PBMC for the next 4 h. PBMC were then collected and cultured for 5 days, and viral infectivity was examined by ELISA p24. In hBD-2 PTD -treated tonsil cells from one donor (tonsil #3), the spread of HIV-1 SF33 from epithelial cells to lymphocytes was reduced by~45% (Figure 8, top panel) . In hBD-3 PTD -treated tonsil cells from three donors, HIV-1 SF33 spread was inhibited by 35-40%. Tonsil cells from all three donors exposed to a combination of hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD also showed inhibition of virus spread from epithelial cells to lymphocytes. Inhibition of viral spread from one donor's tonsil cells was 50%, and in two others was~90%. Notably, hBD-2 PTD treatment in cells from one donor (tissue #2) did not show significant inhibition of viral spread, whereas hBD-3 PTD treatment showed 35% inhibition. However, a combination of hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD in tissue #2 reduced viral spread by 90%. A similar trend was observed in tonsil cells from tissue #3. These data clearly demonstrate that hBD-2 PTD -and/or hBD-3 PTD -inactivated intraepithelial HIV-1 SF33 leads to reduction in viral spread from epithelial cells to lymphocytes. The combination of hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD has a higher antiviral effect than does hBD-2 PTD or hBD-3 PTD alone and strongly inhibits viral spread from epithelial cells to lymphocytes. Thus, PTDmediated penetration of hBD-2 and -3 into tonsil epithelial cells containing HIV-1 may play a critical role in reduction in HIV MTCT. Figure 8 . PTD-mediated hBD-2 and -3 internalization into tonsil epithelial cells containing HIV-1 reduced virus spread from epithelial cells to PBMC. Polarized tonsil epithelial cells from three independent donors were exposed to HIV-1 SF33 . After 48 h, epithelial cells containing intracellular virus were treated with hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD for 2 h; cells were washed and cocultivated with activated PBMC for the next 4 h. PBMC were then collected and cultured for 5 days, and viral infectivity was examined by ELISA p24. Results are shown as mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001 compared with untreated cells.",

We then added HIV-1 SF33 to the mucosal surface of polarized-oriented tonsil epithelial explants. After 4 h, we coimmunostained tissue sections for HIV and markers of early endosomes (EEA1), late endosomes (LAMP1 and LBPA), and vacuoles (rabankyrin-5). Confocal microscopy showed that HIV penetrated tonsil epithelium and colocalized with all four markers ( Figure 9A ). These data reveal HIV intravesicular localization of infant tonsil mucosal tissue, which is consistent with our findings in monostratified polarized epithelial cells (Figure 3, Figure 4 , and Figure 6 ) [3, 9] . (100 ng/mL) was added to the mucosal surface of polarized-oriented tonsil explants, and after 4 h, one set of tissues was fixed, sectioned, and costained for HIV-1 p24 (green) and endosome markers EEA1, LAMP1, LBPA, and rabankyrin (red). (B) Polarized-oriented tonsil explants were infected with HIV-1 SF33 from the mucosal surface. Uninfected tissues served as a control.

In merged panels, yellow indicates colocalization of HIV-1 p24 with endosome markers or markers of T lymphocytes, macrophages, and DC. Magnification: \u00d7 400. Results were reproduced in two independent experiments. Next, we added HIV-1 SF33 to the mucosal surface of tonsil explants and examined one set of tissues for HIV-1 infection by p24 immunofluorescence assay after 24, 48, and 72 h. Confocal microscopy showed that a dot-like vesicular staining pattern of p24 was detected in the mucosal epithelial cells at 24 h after inoculation of virus; a similar vesicular pattern was detected at 48 and 72 h ( Figure 9B ). This indicates that intraepithelial HIV-1 SF33 was present for a relatively long time, i.e., virions were sequestered in the vesicles of infant mucosal epithelium.",

Untreated explants served as a control. After 5 days, culture medium was collected and tested by ELISA p24. Inhibition of HIV-1 SF33 infection was detected in four of six tonsil tissues (60%) ( Figure 11B ). hBD-2 PTD + hBD-3 PTD mediated viral inhibition in three tonsil tissues (tonsils #1, #4, and #5) by~50% and in one tonsil tissue (tonsil #2) by 80%. These data reveal that hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD may have a significant antiviral function in ex vivo infant tonsil tissues by reducing viral spread from epithelial cells into CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages, and CD1c+ DC.",

PTD-mediated delivery of hBDs into vesicles already containing virions may occur by the following mechanisms. First, penetration by hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD via endocytosis/macropinocytosis generates vesicles in cytoplasm that contain hBD, which subsequently may fuse with vesicles already containing virus ( Figure 12 ). It has been shown that HIV-1 Tat PTD-derived CPP aggregate at phospholipid membranes, inducing the fusion of vesicles [29, [78] [79] [80] [81] . Thus, the newly generated vesicles with hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD may fuse with existing vesicles containing HIV-1 because of PDT-induced fusion pores [81] . Second, hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD may be released from newly formed vesicles into cytosol and subsequently enter existing vesicles, including those that contain HIV-1 ( Figure 12 ). CPP may be released from endosomes into cytoplasm [82] [83] [84] and enter other vesicles [33] [34] [35] 69] . PTD-mediated release of HIV-1 Tat from endosomes into cytosol has also been shown [85] . A third mechanism could be the direct penetration by hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD into cytoplasm and their subsequent entry into various endosomes, including vesicles containing HIV-1. HIV-1 is internalized into polarized tonsil epithelial cells, and the majority of virions are sequestered in the MVB and vacuoles. hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD internalize into tonsil epithelial cells through endocytosis and direct penetration. hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD endocytosis generates endosomes containing hBDs, which are released from endosomes into cytosol and subsequently enter other endosomes, including those containing HIV-1, by direct penetration. hBD-2 PTD and hBD-3 PTD that directly penetrate via plasma membrane will also subsequently penetrate various vesicles, including MVB and vacuoles containing HIV-1. Vesicles containing HIV/hBD-2 PTD /hBD-3 PTD may fuse with lysosomes by PTD, leading to the inactivation of intravesicular virions.",
