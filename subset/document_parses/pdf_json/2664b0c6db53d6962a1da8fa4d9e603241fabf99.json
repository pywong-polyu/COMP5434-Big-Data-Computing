One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentially unknown. Without this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. These include why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H 2 O 2 , are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in phagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplification mechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H 2 O 2 and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 fold in phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled that H 2 O 2 is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can cause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging and cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of invading pathogens such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), cancer and other diseases, and provide a molecular mechanism of action of the drugs or candidates.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide (O 2", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "\u2022\u2212 ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxyl radical (OH \u2022 ), are constantly produced from aerobic metabolism of the cell. It is known that OH \u2022 is potent but non-selective oxidant, while O 2 \u2022\u2212 and H 2 O 2 are far less reactive. Moreover, increasing evidence shows that H 2 O 2 is a necessary signaling molecule in the regulation of a variety of biological processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation, tissue repair, immune cell activation, circadian rhythm, vascular remodeling and aging [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . H 2 O 2 is also a signaling molecule of plant defense against pathogens [6] . [7] . For instance, it was observed that genetic knockout of SOD produced deleterious phenotypes in organisms ranging from bacteria to mice [8] [9] [10] [11] . Knockout mice lacking Mn-SOD died soon after birth or suffered severe neurodegeneration [8] . Mn-SOD was also shown to be required for protecting ROS-induced injury in O 2 metabolism [11] . Mice lacking cytosolic Cu, Zn-SOD developed multiple pathologies, including liver cancer [9] , muscle atrophy, cataracts, and a reduced lifespan [10] . Research on biological action of ionizing radiation (IR) also showed that modifying SOD activity in bacteria reduced the oxygen radiosensitizing effect and that SOD injection following whole body x-irradiation significantly protected mice from lethality [12, 13] . Also, active SOD or SOD mimic compounds inhibited IR-induced deleterious effects including transformation assays, bystander effects, normal tissue damage associated with inflammatory responses and fibrosis [14, 15] . These studies clearly demonstrated that O 2 \u2022\u2212 was somehow participating in radiation-induced injury, whereas H 2 O 2 (SOD) was required for normal physiological functions. Given that O 2 \u2022\u2212 is a weak oxidant and the downstream formation of OH \u2022 from H 2 O 2 is responsible for causing oxidative damage, the precise role of H 2 O 2 (or O 2 \u2022\u2212 ) in these critical physiological functions is essentially unknown [15] . Respiratory burst is the rapid release of reactive species from different types of cells, particularly myeloid cells (phagocytes) such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, dendritic cells, osteoclasts and eosinophils. It is usually utilised in immunological defence. Exposure to ROS or reactive halogen species (RHS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) kills the engulfed pathogens, resulting in pathology of infection. Similar respiratory burst is found when cells are exposed to IR at a clinical radiation dose [15] or when the ozone layer is exposed to ionizing cosmic rays in the polar stratosphere especially in the presence of halogenated molecules (particularly freons, CFCs) [16] [17] [18] [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 506, "end": 509, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 510, "end": 513, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 514, "end": 517, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 518, "end": 521, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 522, "end": 525, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 600, "end": 603, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 606, "end": 609, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 746, "end": 749, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 750, "end": 753, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 754, "end": 758, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 759, "end": 763, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 854, "end": 857, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 949, "end": 953, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1048, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1105, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1366, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1367, "end": 1370, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1583, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1587, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2004, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2534, "end": 2538, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2704, "end": 2708, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2709, "end": 2713, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2714, "end": 2718, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2719, "end": 2723, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Phagocytosis is the process by which a cell uses its plasma membrane to engulf a pathogen, forming an organelle called phagosome. It plays a major role in the innate immune defense by effectively killing pathogens. The phagosome then moves toward the centrosome of the phagocyte and fuses with lysosomes, forming a phagolysosome for degradation of pathogens. A phagocyte has various receptors on its surface, including opsonin receptors, scavenger receptors and Toll-like receptors. The widely accepted belief is that phagocytosis is most effective for killing microorganisms (e.g., bacteria), while the adaptive immune defense, mainly by lymphocytes, is more important for viral infections. However, increasing evidence has shown that phagocytosis plays a crucial role in killing a variety of intracellular or cytoplasmic viruses ranging from influenza, mumps, measles and rhinovirus to Ebola and HIV, either directly protecting against viral infections in the innate immune defence [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] or through the antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis providing mechanisms for clearance of virus and virus-infected cells and for stimulation of downstream adaptive immune responses by antigen presentation or the secretion of inflammatory mediators [26] [27] [28] . Particularly in humoral (adaptive) immunity, B cells upon activation produce antibodies, each of which recognizes a unique antigen and neutralizes a specific pathogen. The binding of antibodies to antigens makes the latter easier targets for phagocytes and gives rise to several protective mechanisms. These include activation of complement to cause inflammation and cell lysis, the opsonization by coating antigen with antibody (e.g., immunoglobulin G, IgG) or complement to enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens through binding to the opsonin receptors of phagocytes, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by attaching antibodies to targeted cells to cause the latter's destruction by macrophages, eosinophils, and natural killer (NK) cells. Interestingly, ROS-regulated RHS formed by phagocytes showed the strong viricidal effect on HIV-1 [21, 22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 984, "end": 988, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 989, "end": 993, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 994, "end": 998, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1003, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1008, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1009, "end": 1013, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1270, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1275, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1280, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2141, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2142, "end": 2145, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The importance of bats in the evolution of human SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease COVID-19 has been well documented and indirectly supported by a high degree of similarity with the bat coronavirus genomes. High levels of ROS in bats have been associated with the negative effect on the proof-reading activity of coronavirus RNA polymerases, and it was hypothesized that coronavirus infection in bats is mostly asymptomatic (i.e., bats maintain and disseminate deadly viruses) because high levels of ROS can indirectly enable the bats to control the levels of viral replication [29] . The bat genes most likely to reflect this phenomenon are those directly related to the first line of antiviral defense-the innate immune system [29] . O 2 -dependent degradation in phagocytosis depends on the production of ROS, RHS and RNS, as shown in Figure 1 genes most likely to reflect this phenomenon are those directly related to the first line of antiviral defense-the innate immune system [29] . O2-dependent degradation in phagocytosis depends on the production of ROS, RHS and RNS, as shown in Figure 1 . First, the NADPH oxidase (NOX2) embedded in the phagolysosome membrane is activated to produce O2 \u2022\u2212 by O2 capturing an electron from cytosolic NADPH. H2O2 is generated from O2 \u2022\u2212 via superoxide dismutases (SOD) or heme(halo)peroxidases (MPO, EPO and LPO); OH \u2022 is then generated via the Haber-Weiss reaction. Through MPO/EPO/LPO, H2O2 activates a halogenating system, which generates hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and kills pathogens [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) also catalyze the production of NO \u2022 from L-arginine; NO \u2022 then reacts with O2 \u2022\u2212 to produce a peroxynitrite (ONOO \u2212 ) that forms NO2 (via reaction with CO2) [35] [36] [37] .

This leads to the question of how the ROS produced by the few primary ionization events is amplified to account for observed biological effects. The mechanism remains elusive, as recently reviewed by Lehnert [15] . This is a vivid reminder of the hypothesis of significant CFC-induced ozone loss in the Earth's stratosphere by atmospheric scientists in the 1970s, giving birth to the modern ozone depletion theory. It is now well established that there is an amplifying mechanism where a Cl atom catalytically destroys up to 100,000 ozone molecules via halogen reaction cycles [38, 39] . Note that during respiratory burst, the increases in O 2 (not NO \u2022 ) consumption were typically observed to be only 2-20 fold among different cells and/or conditions [42] .

Moreover, the exothermic energies for the DET reaction in water of halogenated organic compounds such as RNX is E A (X) \u2212 D(N-X) + E p [45, 46, [49] [50] [51] , where E A (X) is the electron affinity of a X atom [E A (Cl) [58] is the polarization energy of an anon in water. The thus calculated exothermicities for the DET reactions of RNX to form a RN \u2022 and a X -(or a RNand a X \u2022 ) are 2.83 (or 2.68), 2.16 (or 2.26) and 2.71 (or 3.11) eV for X = Cl, Br and I, respectively, significantly larger than the reduction energies of the redox couples (Compound I/native enzyme, H 2 O) of enzymes MPO/EPO/LPO. For X = Cl, the DET of RNX favors the dissociation pathway to form RN \u2022 (and X -), whereas it preferentially leads to the production of X \u2022 (and RN -) for X = Br and I. These estimates indicate that the catalyzed cyclic reactions of RHS must effectively take place and sustain for numerous cycles in phagosomes with those endogenous electron-donating enzymes replacing solar photons or cosmic-ray-produced electrons. This is analogous to the established O 3 depleting cyclic reactions.

The net effects of both reaction cycles are the alternations (damages) to at least two biological targets R 1 NH and R 2 NH with no halogen consumption. Similar reaction cycles can occur for other RHS such as XO \u2022 and X 2 . They are most effective (i.e., cycle 2 occurs), if the X \u2022 atom is yielded, which was indeed observed for radiolysis of N-bromoimides but not for N-chloroimides [52, 53] . Cycle 2 will be more significant with the formation of X 2 in reaction (1) (as X 2 + e \u2212 \u2192 X \u2022 + X \u2212 readily), and therefore will become dominant as the halogen level reaches above a threshold. Indeed, HOX was also observed to be in equilibrium with X 2 or BrCl in the MPO-H 2 O 2 -halide system under acidic conditions in the presence of excess X \u2212 , as in phagosomes [31, 32, 43, 44] .

[59] , have been proposed previously to enhance the reaction efficiency, but each of those reaction cycles occurs at the consumption of a halogen species.

Both are quite similar, involving identical species of O2 \u2022\u2212 , CO2, NO, NO2, and ONOO \u2212 [19, 61, 62] , except that O3 is far more abundant in the stratosphere though its presence in phagosomes was also arguably observed [32] . For negative ion chemistry in the atmosphere, the primary ions are quickly converted into CO3 \u2212 (H2O)n ions on the order of 10 \u22123 s by a series of reactions with O2, CO2, O3 and H2O [61, 62] . In the stratosphere, the CO3 \u2212 (H2O)n ions are converted relatively slowly into the more stable ions NO3 \u2212 (H2O)n or NO3 \u2212 (HNO3)m(H2O)n on the order of 1 s by reaction with the trace gases NO, NO2, HNO3, and N2O5 [61, 62] . For altitudes below 30 km, the hydrated NO3 \u2212 ions are the dominant and terminal species. The positive-ion chemistry is even simpler and the cluster ions H3O + (H2O)n (n = 3-6) are the sole primary ions since their formation is also rapid (10 \u22123 s). This is much shorter than the (positive) ion-(negative) ion recombination lifetime (i.e., the residence time of ions) of approximately 100-1000 s in the atmosphere [62] . Looking into the rate constants in Table 1 and reactant abundances of all the cyclic reactions (1-5), we can see that reaction (1) or (3f) or (4f) is the rate-determining step; that is, the haloperoxidase catalyzed converting reaction of X \u2212 and H2O2 into HOX is the rate-limiting reaction. We further notice that H2O2 is stable, while the lifetime of negative ions including Cl \u2212 /Br \u2212 /I \u2212 and NO3 \u2212 is controlled by Looking into the rate constants in Table 1 and reactant abundances of all the cyclic reactions (1-5), we can see that reaction (1) or (3f) or (4f) is the rate-determining step; that is, the haloperoxidase catalyzed converting reaction of X \u2212 and H 2 O 2 into HOX is the rate-limiting reaction. We further notice that H 2 O 2 is stable, while the lifetime of negative ions including Cl \u2212 /Br \u2212 /I \u2212 and NO 3 \u2212 is controlled by the recombination time with the abundant hydronium ions H 3 O + (H 2 O) n (protons) in the acidic phagolysosome, which are long-lived, in contrast to hydronium in neutral solutions. It was indeed observed that the increase in IR-stimulated ROS/RNS generation persisted for 2-5 min post-irradiation in most cell lines and for~15 min after irradiation in some cell lines [63] . Thus, the reaction period of RHS in the phagolysosome is approximately 100-1000 s, identical to that in the lower atmosphere. Given the Cl \u2212 and Br \u2212 concentrations in phagocytes are 120 mM (median) and 60 \u00b5M (median) [54] and the rate constants of 2.6 \u00d7 10 4 -3.9 \u00d7 10 6 M -1 s -1 and 3.0 \u00d7 10 7 -1.1 \u00d7 10 8 M -1 s -1 for the converting reactions with H 2 O 2 at pH 5.0 respectively [64, 65] , we calculate that the overall Cl and Br cyclic reactions occur with respective rates of approximately 3120-4.68 \u00d7 10 5 s -1 and 1800-6600 s -1 . These give rise to at least 3.1 \u00d7 10 5 -4.7 \u00d7 10 7 and 1.8 \u00d7 10 5 -6.6 \u00d7 10 5 reaction cycles during the lifetime (\u2265100 s) of Cl \u2212 and Br \u2212 in the phagolysosome respectively. These estimated values are fairly close to the ozone depleting reaction cycles in the atmosphere [38] . These appear quite surprising, but they are actually mainly determined by the levels of Cl \u2212 and Br \u2212 and the ion residence time. The latter is governed by the recombination with H 3 O + (H 2 O) n [61, 62] , resulting in the apparently identical ion lifetime in both the stratosphere and the phagolysosome. It must be noted that although the proposal of halogen reaction cycles in phagocytosis appears striking and novel, each of the reactions (1-5) is very well-established in the literature [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Given the abundances and low reduction potentials [31, 32] of endogenous haloperoxidases (MPO/EPO/LPO) in phagosomes and the high resemblance [19, 61, 62] of the negative ion chemistry in phagosome to that in the atmosphere, there is every reason to deduce that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by~10 5 fold, analogous to the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions [38] . For the latter, RHS is known to be far more efficient than OH and NO at catalyzing the destruction of ozone, and among RHS, Br or I is much more efficient than Cl at catalyzing the cyclic reactions [18, 19, 38, 39, 45, 46, 49, 50 ].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 291, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 292, "end": 295, "text": "61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 296, "end": 299, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 419, "end": 423, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 608, "end": 612, "text": "[61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 613, "end": 616, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 833, "end": 837, "text": "[61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 838, "end": 841, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1262, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2479, "end": 2483, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2704, "end": 2708, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2870, "end": 2874, "text": "[64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2875, "end": 2878, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 3298, "end": 3302, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3502, "end": 3506, "text": "[61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3507, "end": 3510, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 3798, "end": 3802, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3803, "end": 3807, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3808, "end": 3812, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3813, "end": 3817, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3818, "end": 3822, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3823, "end": 3827, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3828, "end": 3832, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3833, "end": 3837, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 3838, "end": 3842, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 3843, "end": 3847, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 3848, "end": 3852, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3853, "end": 3857, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3858, "end": 3862, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3863, "end": 3867, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 3920, "end": 3924, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3925, "end": 3928, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4012, "end": 4016, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 4017, "end": 4020, "text": "61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 4021, "end": 4024, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 4306, "end": 4310, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4511, "end": 4515, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4516, "end": 4519, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 4520, "end": 4523, "text": "38,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4524, "end": 4527, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 4528, "end": 4531, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 4532, "end": 4535, "text": "46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 4536, "end": 4539, "text": "49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 4540, "end": 4542, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 188, "end": 196, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1307, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1726, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Halogen Cyclic Reaction Rates"}, {"text": "This proposed mechanism has multifold significance:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Significance of Halogen Cyclic Reactions"}, {"text": "(1) The H 2 O 2 -initiated halogen cyclic reactions should greatly amplify the pathogen-killing effects of RHS in phagocytosis for innate and adaptive immune defenses.

We propose that these molecules are highly effective for DET reactions and their action is quite similar to the formation of endogenous RHS in the phagosome. It has been long known that the DET reactions of halogenated aromatic organic molecules AXs with weakly-bound electrons in water are highly effective [18, 19, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] .

This was indeed observed by comparing the DET reactions of FMDs with BrdU and IdU [79] . BrdU is very similar to bropirimine in structure [77] . Thus, we predict that the in-vivo anti-pathogen effectiveness of FMD compounds with proper formulations will be at least 10 times higher than that of any of HCQ, chloroquine, bropirimine, BrdU and IdU.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 416, "end": 420, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 421, "end": 424, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 621, "end": 625, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1009, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1065, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Potential New Therapeutics"}, {"text": "Also of particular interest is the finding that in treated normal cells, a FMD compound at 100 \u00b5M caused an increase of about 40% of the reduced glutathione (GSH) level, which is an endogenous protective antioxidant [15, 32] , whereas the GSH level in human cervical (ME-180) cancer cells significantly dropped upon treated by the FMD and decreased to~35% at 100 \u00b5M FMD [69] . This marked selective depletion of the GSH was consistent with the proposed preferential DET reaction to activate in cancer cells and with the observed selective cytotoxic effects of FMDs in vitro and in vivo [69] [70] [71] .

In contrast, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 4,5-dibromo-1,2-diaminobenzene was measured to be 220 \u00b1 20 mg/kg (i.p), and no significant multiple dose toxicity in blood, liver, kidney, gut and spleen for 90 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks in mice (i.v) were observed. The oral MTD, which is usually at least 5 times higher, may be over 1000 mg/kg. These results indicate that FMDs are essentially non-toxic but highly effective chemotherapeutic agents at used doses that can preferentially kill abnormal cells. It is therefore useful for natural targeted chemotherapy of cancer and other diseases, which potentially include viral infections and autoimmune disorders. By contrast, due to the increased risk of developing retinopathy during treatment with HCQ, the current ophthalmology guidelines recommend a maximal daily dose of 5.0 mg/kg (actual body weight) per day for HCQ, while in cancer studies, high HCQ doses up to 1200 mg (17-18 mg/kg) daily was prescribed [72, 80] . Given these data, FMD compounds are estimated to have a clinical safe dose at least 10 times higher than HCQ in humans.

[82] showed that ACE2 is enhanced in human nasal epithelia and lung tissue by interferon and influenza but not upregulated in mice.

In contrast, by analysis of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other respiratory viruses, Blanco-Melo et al. [83] found that cell and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, consistently showed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response, which was defined by low levels of Type I and III interferons juxtaposed to elevated chemokines and high expression of IL-6.

These halogenated aromatic drugs may be used for experimental treatment of COVID-19, especially for preventive, mild and moderate stages, and probably treatment of developed chronic conditions. In these applications, the halogen compounds should provide strong pathogen-killing effects. During autoimmune disorders, however, precaution should be taken if these drugs are to be used, because they will produce an excess number of exogenous RHS, much larger than that of endogenous RHS. In the latter case, using a NO (iNOS) inducer to enhance the production of the electron killer (NO 3 \u2212 /CO 3 \u2212 ) neutralizing RHS might be helpful to the patients. This paper provides a plausible molecular mechanism that might help with clinical practice of the drugs. It may improve the clinical efficacy, control the toxicity within a tolerated range, and suggest the optimal timing/sequential administration or possible combination therapy. This might meet the current medical challenges faced in this global pandemic and save many lives across the globe. Furthermore, this research also reveals that H 2 O 2 is a necessary signaling molecules (angel) in the defense system fighting against pathogens and maintaining normal physiological functioning and signaling and its dysfunction can cause many diseases of organisms ranging from plants to humans. The role of phagocytosis in both innate and adaptive immune defenses is probably underestimated under the current context of immunology and virology. New mechanistic insights into immune defense might lead to a discovery and development of more potent and/or targeted drugs for treatment of many diseases or conditions such as viral infections such as HIV and SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19), aging and cancer.
