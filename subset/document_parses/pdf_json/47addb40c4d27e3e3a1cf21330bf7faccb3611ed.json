Indeed, HSI cannot be thought without concurrent and incremental design of technology, organizations, and people's activities, and consequently jobs. The environment is where the TOP Model is defined (e.g., health care environment, airspace, battlefield). This should be seen from various perspectives: safety; competence and professionalism; sustainability; habitability; occupational health; social, cultural, and organizational factors; training; HSI planning; human factors engineering; workforce planning; integrated logistics support and maintenance. These perspectives require four core disciplines and practices: Systems Engineering; Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE); Information Technology; and the Operational Domain at stake.",

This paper focuses on HSI sociological factors, and proposes a viewpoint, coined as \"socioergonomics\". The main purpose of this definitional contribution is to provide an articulated set of concepts toward an ontology useful for HSI development from a societal, cultural, and organizational perspective (Norman, 2019) . Instead of considering single-agent cognitive modeling from an integrative approach going from the human nervous system to measurable indicators like what neuroergonomics proposes (Parasuraman, 2003) , socioergonomics considers a multi-agent socio-cognitive modeling approach that is based on organizational knowledge of the world influencing agents involved in, and reciprocally. This approach requires an integrative definition of what a system is about and the various relationships this system has with the various systems surrounding it. In other words, we will better define what is inside an agent or system by mastering what influences it from the outside. Note that the meaning of the term \"agent\" used in artificial intelligence is very similar to what \"system\" means in systems engineering.",

Macroergonomics, a systemic branch of HFE, considers the organizational and sociotechnical context of work activities and processes. It emphasizes sociotechnical systems (STSs). STS integration is an instance of HSI. For example, the SEIPS (Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety) model of work system and patient safety is a sociotechnical approach successfully applied in healthcare research and practice. Carayon and her colleagues claimed that healthcare systems and processes need to be systematically redesigned. They provided several macroergonomic approaches, principles, and methods for healthcare system redesign (Carayon et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Why should not we keep the term macroergonomics instead of inventing a new term such as socioergonomics? Both refer to sociotechnical systems. First, socioergonomics is more anchored into sociology than psychology. Psychology is devoted to study the mind of an individual (i.e., the single agent approach). Instead, sociology extends the study of individuals toward society (i.e., the multiagent approach). Sociology is \"a social science that studies human societies, their interactions, and the processes that preserve and change them. It does this by examining the dynamics of constituent parts of societies such as institutions, communities, populations, and gender, racial, or age groups.\" (https://www.britannica.com/topic/sociology: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2021). Sociology is devoted to the study of communities and organizations to better understand their internal and external interdependencies and properties. In systems engineering, we would talk about Systems of Systems (SoS). As a matter of fact, SoS representations should nicely support sociological studies. This is the reason why socioergonomics is currently developed to support HSI by providing not only a vocabulary for talking about it, but also meaningful societal representations and patterns for HSI analysis, design, and evaluation.

HITLS were used before but in very specific ways, for isolated subsystems of a system. Today, we can develop virtual prototypes of the whole system, considered as a system of systems (Popper, Bankes, Callaway, & DeLaurentis, 2004) . In the meantime, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) contributed to enhance HITLS toward more holistic HCD. HITLS enables us to further develop the relationship between HCD teams, as anthropologists, and their object of study as a particular instance of the relationship between knowing and doing, interpreting, and using, symbolic mastery and practical mastery of a system. Bourdieu developed the \"logic of practice\" to this end in his anthropological investigations (Bourdieu, 1992) .",

For a long time, ergonomics was dominated by physiologists (after World War 2) and psychologists (since the early 1980s during personal computers development and massive software expansion in our everyday lives). Today, information and transportation technologies enable us to be more interconnected. They also increased and modified the nature of societal complexity. This is the reason why sociology, anthropology and social sciences in general are emerging disciplines in ergonomics. We cannot explore human activities in the real-world without considering cultural issues and practices. It is interesting to notice, for example, how various countries developed very different solutions to current COVID-19 pandemic problems. Indeed, facing unexpected situations requires using deeper knowledge, skills and ways of doing things. In these situations, people use socially admitted and organizationally driven approaches, sometimes based on educated common sense (Boy, 2021) . Ergonomics almost always ends up with procedure-based solutions; socioergonomics requires more problem-solving approaches that require collaboration using several types of knowledge and skills.",

VHCD enables to observe people's activity in virtually simulated possible future systems. Agile development is then possible. However, virtual environments bring to the front tangibility issues. Tangibility of a system addresses the grasp of its physical aspects and cognitive aspects (i.e., its meaning). Consequently, methods and tools need to be developed to support progressive tangibilization of virtual prototypes toward concrete products (Figure 2 ). This tangibilization process involves various kinds of stakeholders, and therefore requires us to address concepts and metrics such as trust, collaboration, and coordination. Digitalization does not concern only interaction between people and increasingly digital machines, but also between people through this type of smart machines. Consequently, both technological maturity and organizational maturity need to be assessed. Figure 2 . Tangibilization process from VHCD to a tangible sociotechnical system product.",

In other words, function allocation can be done incrementally using formative evaluations and agile system development. The way structures and functions are defined and incrementally modified strongly influence system flexibility in terms of both system upgrade and activity adaptation to operational context. Sociotechnical systems should be flexible. First, they should be intrinsically flexible in terms of structures (i.e., the architecture of a system should be designed to possibly enable easy modification of current function allocation) and functions (i.e., a function should be able to perform correctly in a wider context than initially specified). Second, systems should be extrinsically flexible in terms of possibly expended service within the systems of systems where it belongs (i.e., the service that was initially defined can be extended outside the system's context of validity). Intrinsic and extrinsic flexibility of a system involve two crucial properties: adaptability and expendability. They both refer to services. For example, if a machine or human service within a system can be easily replaced by another equivalent human or machine service, then the system will be said to be flexible. This kind of flexibility should exist during the whole life cycle of a (sociotechnical) system at various levels of granularity.",

            "text": "Another property of a sociotechnical system is separability (Figure 4) . The more complex a system is (the term \"complex\" is taken in the Latin sense of \"complexus,\" i.e., what is woven together), both structurally and functionally, the more difficult it is, not only to apprehend its behavior, but also to understand its internal functioning (i.e., understanding the interactions between the various components of a system of systems). Can parts of the system be separated to study them in isolation and thus simplify the analysis? This is a difficult question, but one that biologists and physiologists have been considering and studying for a long time. Surgeons, for example, know how to momentarily separate an organ from the human body without irreversibly damaging the whole body, considered as a system of systems. They also know that certain organs, such as the brain, cannot be separated because the human being could die from this separation. These vital organs must be studied and treated while being connected to the rest of the body. The traditional silo engineering design approach associated with late components integration, most often leads to major problems that are difficult, and even impossible, to solve at the end of the chain because rebuilding the entire system is difficult and at times impossible. This approach does not usually consider the separability property and often considers that all system components are separable, like Lego blocks. The more we master the separability property of a system of systems, the more we will be able to address its fluidity and flexibility at operations and maintenance times, for example. It is important to realize that separability was not a major problem if systems were purely mechanical. However, now that systems not only include a large amount of software, but are also highly interconnected, it becomes imperative to understand their intrinsic separability properties. Today, experts solve most problems of these complex sociotechnical systems, often using prosthetic devices, but we need to better formalize them, systemically speaking, to enable finding better and more integrated solutions.",

During the second half of the 20 th century, societal analyses have been interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic (Babich, 2017) . Since the beginning of the 21 st century, sociological methods are increasingly rigorous analytically, mathematically, and computationally, supported for example by agent-based modeling (Chattoe, 2013) and social network analysis (Borgatti, Everett & Johnson, 2013) .",
