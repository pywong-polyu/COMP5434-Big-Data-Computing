Despite this broad classification, there are clear differences in urgency among the waitlisted candidates. Moreover, the intensity of peritransplant immunosuppression, and the complexity of posttransplant recovery, varies by organ and patient, adding additional dimensions of dynamic risk. Therefore, transplant centers have a responsibility to consider the conduct of each clinical program during current and future phases of the pandemic. Transplant activity is also inherently dependent on donor organ availability. With many hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) having been or likely to become overwhelmed, shifting priorities may deemphasize donor identification and management and result in lower numbers of deceased donors.",

These critical decisions must be based on the pandemic trajectory and resource availability, 2 which may inherently be difficult to predict. Resource availability must take into account the availability of ICU beds, ventilators, blood products, and personal protective equipment (PPE).

In the posttransplant period, the increased incidence of early allograft dysfunction and acute kidney injury may necessitate additional interventions.

Our practice is to test all live donors before donation. Additionally, we request both our donors and recipients shelter in place before testing and up until the time of surgery. Healthcare provisions such a minimizing team size, sequestration of transplant patients into designated COVID-free wards, appropriate PPE and hand hygiene practices, are essential to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission.

Though DGF is managed regularly in the postoperative period with acceptable outcomes, during a state of emergency these additional risks need to be carefully evaluated. Resumption of dialysis postkidney transplant exposes a newly immunosuppressed patient to their dialysis centers. In addition, for those patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), DGF may be more problematic and resource-intensive, as they require new hemodialysis access and placement in a new dialysis center. The PD catheter may also be left in place and used postoperatively if needed, though this has variable efficacy. Acceptance of kidneys with a high risk of DGF, especially in those patients on PD, should be carefully considered. Live kidney donation also needs to be adjusted based on local disease prevalence. Live kidney transplants should be conducted in those recipients whose benefit from transplant outweighs the current infectious risk both to themselves and the donor. COVID-19 RT-PCR assays on all live donors and recipients is imperative during the pandemic. Further, advanced-age (>60 y) living kidney donors with comorbid conditions such as medication-controlled hypertension have risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 and should be considered for deferral. There is anecdotal data that obesity may be a risk factor for a more severe COVID-19 disease course, and until this is further been defined, consideration should be given to also deferring such donations (body mass index >30).",

In the absence of available real-time RT-PCR testing, robust clinical (fever, cough, anosmia, dysgeusia) and contact history is essential and should be taken before consideration of any transplant, however, due to the prevalence of asymptomatic disease with COVID-19, this approach should be used with caution.

Creation of \"COVID-19-free areas\" (hospital buildings, ICUs and wards, with dedicated staff) can significantly reduce transplant patients' exposure to those with COVID-19. With increasing availability of testing at our institution, all patients being admitted to the hospital are tested by RT-PCR, so their status is known before or on admission, and those with confirmed disease are preferentially cared for at a dedicated COVID site.
