            "text": "Although previous studies have shown that the host immune response is crucial in determining clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, the association between host immune signatures and COVID-19 patient outcomes remains unclear. Based on the enrichment levels of 11 immune signatures (eight immune-inciting and three immuneinhibiting signatures) in leukocytes of 100 COVID-19 patients, we identified three COVID-19 subtypes: Im-C1, Im-C2, and Im-C3, by clustering analysis. Im-C1 had the lowest immune-inciting signatures and high immuneinhibiting signatures. Im-C2 had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the best and worst clinical outcomes, respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response had a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response. The patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger persons have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we found that the type II IFN response signature was an adverse prognostic factor for COVID-19. Our identification of COVID-19 immune subtypes has potential clinical implications for the management of COVID-19 patients.",

The host immune defense system and immune response are crucial factors responsible for clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . For example, Takahashi et al. demonstrated that sex biases in COVID- 19 were associated with differences in immune responses between males and females [2] . The excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, known as COVID-19 cytokine storm, may cause severe COVID-19 [8] . In fact, multiple organ dysfunction caused by aberrant immune responses is presented in a substantial number of severe COVID-19 patients [9] . Despite these previous studies, the association between host immune responses and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients is worthy of further in-depth investigation.",

Im-C2 had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immuneinhibiting signatures. In contrast to Im-C1, Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures and the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures. Thus, Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the strongest and weakest antiviral immune responses, respectively. As expected, the ratios of immune-stimulatory to immune-inhibitory signatures (CD8+/CD4+ regulatory T cells and pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines) were the highest in Im-C3 and the lowest in Im-C1 (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.01) (Fig. 1B) .

Moreover, the proportion of COVID-19 patients requiring MVS was the lowest in Im-C3 (8.8%) and the highest in Im-C1 (81.5%) (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001). The scores of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), both of which measure the severity of ICU patients [21] , were significantly different between the three subtypes: Im-C3 < Im-C2 < Im-C1 (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.001; mean APACHE II score: 13 versus 19 versus 26; mean SOFA score: 5 versus 8 versus 10) (Fig. 1E) . The numbers of ventilatorfree days, which is an outcome measure in treatments for acute respiratory distress syndrome [22] , and the hospital-free days at day 45 (HFD-45) values, which correlated inversely with disease severity, were significantly different between the three subtypes: Im-C3 > Im-C2 > Im-C1 (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.001; mean ventilator-free days: 26 versus 20 versus 11; mean HFD-45: 32 versus 23 versus 8) (Fig. 1E) . Additionally, some laboratory measurements, such as Creactive protein, D-dimer, procalcitonin, ferritin, and lactate, whose elevation was associated with COVID-19 severity, tended to display the lowest levels in Im-C3 while the highest levels in Im-C1 (Fig. 1F) . Altogether, these results showed that the Im-C3 subtype of COVID-19 had the best outcomes, while the Im-C1 subtype had the worst outcomes. It suggests that antiviral immune responses can reduce COVID-19 disease severity. Furthermore, we found that the patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1 (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.04) (Fig. 1G ). It indicates that younger persons tended to have a stronger antiviral immune response than older persons after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we did not observe a significant difference in the proportions of female and male patients between Im-C3 and Im-C1 (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.61).",

Moreover, their enrichment levels were significantly higher in non-ICU versus ICU patients and in non-MVS versus MVS patients (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2B) . Collectively, these results indicate that the elevated enrichment of these immune-inciting signatures is associated with better outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we found five immuneinciting signatures (HLA Class II, CD8+ T cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and NK cells) whose enrichment levels correlated inversely with ages of COVID-19 patients (P < 0.1, \u03c1 < -0.18) (Fig. 2C) . However, none of the eight immune-inciting signatures showed significantly different enrichment levels between female and male patients. Again, these results indicate that younger patients have a stronger immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection than older patients, while the strength of immune response is not different between female and male patients. We further demonstrated the significant negative correlation between the immuneinciting signatures and ages of COVID-19 patients in two other RNA-Seq gene expression profiling datasets for COVID-19 patients (GSE156063 [13] and GSE152075 [14] (Fig. 2C) . Likewise, the associations between gender and these immune-inciting signatures were not significant in both datasets. Interestingly, in GSE156063, six immune-inciting signatures displayed significantly lower enrichment levels in COVID-19 patients than in the patients infected with other viruses (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2D) . It suggests that SARS-CoV-2 causes a weaker human host immune response compared to other viruses, a potential explanation for the higher infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 versus other viruses. In contrast to the immuneinciting signatures, the immune-inhibiting signatures were likely to have a negative correlation with outcomes in COVID-19 patients, as evidenced by that the three immune-inhibiting signatures (type II IFN response, Treg, and neutrophils) displayed significantly higher enrichment levels in MVS than in non-MVS patients (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.05) (Fig. 2E ). In addition, the type II IFN response signature had inverse correlations with ventilator-free days and HFD-45 values (P < 0.05, \u03c1 < -0.21) and was significantly higher in ICU versus non-ICU patients (Fig. 2F ).",

In predicting MVS versus non-MVS, age, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells were significant negative predictors, while type II IFN response was a significant positive predictor (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3) .

These results indicate that COVID-19 outcomes are correlated positively with immune-inciting signatures and negatively with immune-inhibiting signatures and age, consistent with previous results. Meanwhile, logistic regression analyses indicate that the adaptive immune response (CD8+ T cells) has a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response (NK cells), as evidenced by the larger \u03b2 values of CD8+ T cells versus NK cells in predicting ICU and MVS.

The ssGSEA scores-based clustering method has been shown to be more robust than the gene expression values-based method in identifying subtypes of diseases [23] [24] [25] . Im-C1 had the lowest immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C2 had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 and Im-C1 COVID-19 patients had the best and worst clinical outcomes, respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response exerted a greater impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response. The patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger persons have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we found that the type II IFN response signature was an adverse prognostic factor for COVID-19 in the dataset GSE157103. This result appears inconsistent with previous findings [26] [27] . The reason behind this needs to be further investigated.",

            "text": "Our data suggest that a strong antiviral immune response can reduce COVID-19 severity. Thus, a strong host immune system is crucial for fighting against COVID-19, as bolstered by a recent study [28] . However, previous studies have revealed that serum inflammatory cytokine levels had an inverse association with clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients [29] [30] [31] [32] . It suggests that excessive immune response, known as cytokine storm, may cause immunopathological damage in COVID-19 patients [7] . We compared the expression levels of several cytokine genes in leukocytes between ICU and non-ICU COVID-19 patients, including IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF, CCL2, CXCL10, IFNG, IL7. We found that these genes displayed significantly higher expression levels in non-ICU than in ICU patients (Fig. 6) . A potential explanation for these different results could be the different sources of these cytokine. In addition, our findings suggest that weak immune responses are associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. It appears to conflict with previous indications that strong immune responses may cause severe COVID-19 outcomes [7] . Nevertheless, the present and previous results together may indicate that both inadequate and excessive immune responses will lead to severe COVID-19 cases. Certainly, the association between host immune responses and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients needs to be further explored based on large sample size. ",

The ratios were the mean expression levels of the marker genes of immune-stimulatory signatures over those of immune-inhibitory signatures (log2-transformed). The Student's t test P-values are indicated. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001 (This also applies to the following figures). C. Principal component analysis confirming that COVID-19 can be divided into three subgroups based on the enrichment scores of the 11 immune signatures. D. Proportions of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) or requiring mechanical ventilatory support (MVS) in the COVID-19 subtypes. E.
