This study examined changes in smoking behavior during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Osaka, Japan. To assess differences in smoking behavior among 5,120 current smokers before and after the declaration of a state of emergency, prevalence ratios (PRs) for two outcomes, increased smoking and quitting smoking, were calculated using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for potential covariates. Results: We found 32.1% increased the number of cigarettes smoked and 11.9% quit smoking. After adjustment for all variables, we found risk factors for COVID-19 (men and older age group) had both significantly higher PR for quitting smoking (men: PR 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.62) and participants aged \u226565 years: PR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.92-3.12) and significantly lower PR of increased smoking (men: PR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93 and participants \u226565 years: PR 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.49).",

Conclusions: We suggest people who have high-risk factors for COVID-19 might change their smoking behavior for the better, while people who work from home or live alone might change their smoking behavior for the worse, during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Additionally, changing from smoking cigarettes to using HTPs makes smokers less likely to quit.",

It can also request closure of schools, some child and senior care or community centers, and stores and businesses that are considered non-essential. 11 Unlike the European or Wuhanstyle lockdowns, the Japanese government can neither force private companies to close and citizens to stay indoors nor impose penalties for non-compliance. 12 The prefecture-level state of emergency continued for 4 to 7 weeks, depending on the infection level in each prefecture. 13, 14 In the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 cases started rising in large numbers. During this period, three international Big Tobacco companies, Philip Morris International, Altria Group, and Japan Tobacco International, reported overall net revenue increases of 6.0%, 13.6%, and 2.8%, respectively. 15 In Japan, during the state of emergency, tobacco companies ran advertising campaigns to encourage people who stay at home long-term to use heated tobacco products (HTPs) (Figure 1 ). For example, an IQOS starter kit, including five packs of tobacco sticks, was available for 2-weeks' free rental in the Philip Morris campaign. Anyone could join this campaign online and would be sent the HTPs and the tobacco sticks without the need to leave their home.",

According to several systematic reviews, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at higher risk of severe complications and a higher mortality rate from COVID-19. A previous study showed nearly 20% of respondents reported having seen claims that smoking can protect against COVID-19 in Hong Kong. 21 Most smokers perceive themselves to be at higher risk of COVID-19 complications, and this risk appears to relate to intention to quit using tobacco and to attempting to quit. 22 On the other hand, in some previous studies, more smokers reported increasing the number of cigarettes smoked rather than quitting or decreasing the amount they smoke due to COVID-19. [22] [23] [24] In one study, 14.1% of smokers reported decreased smoking and 18.9% reported increased smoking. 24 So far, there has not been a population-level observational study which examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behavior in a large number of participants (over 1,000) and also considered a change from conventional cigarettes to HTPs. Few studies have examined the determinants of either increasing or quitting smoking due to COVID-19. During the COVID-19 lockdown, among patients with chronic coronary syndromes, the increase in number of cigarettes smoked was significantly greater in urban patients. 25 Living alone more than doubled the odds of smoking more cigarettes during lockdown compared to living with others. 26 Participants who had diabetes had a significantly higher odds ratio of wanting to quit smoking since the beginning of the pandemic. 27 On the other hand, previous studies have reported that smoking behavior changes were unrelated to age, 28-30 sex, [28] [29] [30] population density, 29 and living alone. 28 While increased smoking is detrimental to health, quitting can improve health outcomes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the effect of the COVID-19 state of emergency on smoking behavior change using data from the Osaka health application (app) survey. We examined factors for both increased smoking and quitting smoking.",

In Osaka, the state of emergency was applied from April 7, 2020 to May 21, 2020. Initially, the Osaka Prefecture governor requested people to stop going out or attending open events (with no penalty for non-compliance). Daily necessities, such as medical visits, food shopping, and commuting to work, were allowed, although working from home (teleworking) was strongly encouraged. 33 From April 14, the use of exercise facilities (eg, gymnasiums, swimming pools, bowling alleys, and sports clubs), recreation facilities (eg, nightclubs, bars, internet cafes, and karaoke boxes), education facilities (eg, schools), and theatres (eg, movie theatre) was also restricted. Restaurants, including pubs, were only allowed to open between 5:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., and to serve alcoholic beverages until 7:00 p.m. 34 The online survey was designed to collect demographic information and details of smoking behavior change that occurred during the state of emergency. Approximately 195,000 people had installed the Asmile health app when the online survey started (May 27, 2020) and all users were invited to participate in the survey. The characteristics of the Asmile users were as follows: most users were in the 40-60 year age group, there were 1.5 times as many women users as men users, and the percentage of users in each municipality was 1.035-3.702%. 31 When participants installed the health app, they provided the following web-based informed consent 35 : \"Osaka Prefecture can use your basic registration information, personal health information, terminal information, and other information. Additionally, Osaka Prefecture can use participant's data for the purpose of administrative measures for Osaka Prefecture or participating municipalities. Users who downloaded the app agree their data can be used for this purpose or disclosed as statistical information in a non-personally identifiable form.\" Their age consistency was verified using some form of identification (eg, driver's license and health insurance card). However, 120 participants did not provide such identification, so anyone with missing for age was excluded from the analysis. There were no missing responses in other variables.",

In a previous study of Japanese smokers in their 50s, about 7-8% of smokers quit smoking the following year. 38 Compared with this figure, the percentage of quit smoking observed in the present study was slightly higher. The COVID-19 pandemic may have increased smoking cessation. In previous studies that have examined smoking behavior change during the COVID-19 pandemic, 45.2% of smokers increased their smoking in Poland, 40.9% in the United States, and 18.9% in the Netherlands. [22] [23] [24] The COVID-19 state of emergency may have had a large negative influence on increased smoking, as in other disasters. After the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, 16.5% of smokers increased their smoking. 39 Increased smoking is detrimental to people's health while quitting smoking improves health outcomes. In the present study, we examined determinants of both increased smoking and quitting smoking. Factors significantly associated with increased smoking during the state of emergency were men, young age group (<45 years), older age group (\u226555 years), living alone, decreaced income, changes in stress, and working from home. Factors associated with quitting smoking were tobacco type change (cigarettes to HTPs), men, youngest age group (<35 years), older age group (\u226555 years), decreased stress, not working, and highest of population density of residential area.",

Smokers who changed from cigarettes to HTPs were significantly less likely to quit smoking than those who did not change tobacco type (PR 0.15). This may be because some smokers were persuaded by tobacco industry promotions (Figure 1 ) to change to HTPs rather than quit. Although HTPs contain similar toxic substances to combustible cigarettes, many smokers believe the risks of smoking HTPs are lower because of these promotions. 40 Smokers who were living alone or working from home were likely to increase their smoking. This is possibly because they were less likely to receive complaints from family members or co-workers about smoking or were not governed by workplace smoking restrictions. A previous study showed people who live alone were more likely to smoke than those living in threegeneration households in Japan. 42 An environment free from smoking rules or no fear of exposing others to second-hand smoke may have led to an increase in the number of cigarettes smoked by those working from home. The government strongly recommends \"working from home\" as a \"new normal lifestyle\" for infection control measures for COVID-19 but \"quitting smoking\" should also be strongly recommended as part of the \"new normal lifestyle\". Men and older age group were associated with behavior changes for the better (ie, they were less likely to increase smoking and were likely to quit). This may be because concern about health is the most common reason for quitting smoking and these groups appeared to be at higher risk from COVID-19 infection. 43, 44 Before the state of emergency, a Chinese study reported that the rate of infection and mortality rate due to COVID-19 was higher in men than in women. 45 Furthermore, the older age group has been reported to have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 complications and mortality than the younger age group. 46, 47 Compared with regular employees, Smoking Behavior and the COVID-19 State of Emergency people who did not work were more likely to quit smoking, which is consistent with previous studies. 48 Smokers with decreased stress were more likely to quit smoking, and smokers with increased stress were likely to increase the number of cigarettes smoked per day. These results were consistent with a previous study which found that stress was associated with higher nicotine dependence. 49 Surprisingly, smokers with decreased stress were also likely to increase the number of cigarettes smoked per day simultaneously. Potential reasons for this includes the increased opportunity for smoking created by working from home during the COVID-19 Pandemic.",

First, due to the crosssectional design, causal interpretation of the association between smoking behavior change and the COVID-19 state of emergency was limited. Second, Osaka Prefecture is in the central part of Kansai, and has the third-highest population in Japan. However, the study only targeted one of the 47 prefectures in Japan and used an online self-reported survey; therefore, generalizability is limited. For example, people who are familiar with the smartphone app generally and with government campaigns to make people more active would be more likely to download the Asmile app and therefore the results might potentially be under or overestimated due to self-reporting and socially desirable bias. Third, misclassification of smoking behavior may occur, because it is a time dependent variable which might continue to change in complex ways during that time. However, in our study, the smoking behavior change was categorized as only four patterns of \"increased\" \"no change\" \"decreased\" and \"quit\". Fourth, our survey lacks some important variables on health conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and nicotine therapy.",
