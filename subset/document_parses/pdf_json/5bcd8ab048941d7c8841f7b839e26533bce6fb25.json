            "text": "A small human oral droplet contains millions of coronavirus claims (Nikam et al. 2020) . van Doremalen et al. (2020) found that the virus lives the longest on plastic and steel, surviving for up to 72 h, 4 h in copper, and 24 h in cardboard. They observed and confirmed that when the virus suspended into small droplets (aerosols, which are smaller than 5 \u03bcm) can survive in the air for about half an hour before settling down on the surface and stays there for hours. Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention, a United States Department of Health and Human Services, reported that COVID-19 spread mainly through close contact from human to human respiratory droplets of an infected person. Furthermore, a new study by Zhang et al. (2020) confirms that COVID-19 could spread through the oral faecal route and classify human virus carriers as symptomatic and asymptomatic, both of which have Da high chances of spreading the virus. Singhal et al. (2020) reveal that homeless and slum dwellers living in congregate settings without regular access to basic hygiene and sanitation could be the main route of spreading the virus. They recognize older people and children as vulnerable groups. On the other-19hand, Borah et al. (2020) identify five prominent groups, namely, children, women, migrants, daily-wage earners, and self-employed individuals as the vulnerable groups to the economic and health shocks of COVID-19 pandemics. In the light of this revelation, Borah et al. (2020) find it essential to identify the geographic concentration and the number of migrant workers to ensure that the relief efforts focusing on this vulnerable group can be better planned and targeted. Thacker (2020) quotes Raman R Gangakhedar, the Chief Epidemiologist of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), that 80% of the people infected with coronavirus in India are asymptomatic. This revelation has put India in grave danger because the testing rate in India per thousand is very low compared with other countries. We have not done enough tests to put us at mental peace. For instance, Dubey (2020) reported in Business Standard that India has one of the lowest tests per million with a mere 1973 person test per million which is only half of the test that Brazil has done, whereas Spain has done 60,000 tests per million and they are on the road to recovery. As per ICMR data as on 17th June 2020, there are only 953 (699 government and 254 private) operational testing laboratories in India which are inadequate to accommodate the testing service of the massive population in the country. It is physically and economically not viable for a country like India to test every citizen to confirm the total numbers of COVID-19-infected persons.",

So the question here is how do we prevent ourselves from the virus? What are the precautions to control the spread of the viruses? What action can be taken by the government, the public health system, and the community in limiting the spread of COVID-19? What are the economic and health-related remedial measures at the community level? Thus, the global community needs to take additional efforts in controlling the spread of viruses until vaccines and antidote are available. The significance of community participation, understanding, and behaviour change was highlighted by Golechha (2020) in his study. The authors of this paper attempt to develop action-oriented principles that could assist in curbing the spread of COVID 19 to a great extent. The techniques propagated by the authors can be employed at the community level with a poor public health system where there is a high chance of community transmission.",

Bobdey et al. (2020) have rightly concluded that pandemics' impact is far from the imagination as it causes a loss of human lives and threatens the economic set-up of the infected counties. They underline the importance of being vigilant, prepared, and contained, and make any efforts to prevent the spread of the virus in the future because COVID-19 has impacted every country in different ways except the facemask manufacturers who has the last laugh. The economic impact of COVID-19 is more severe than SARS or MERS (Scott 2020) . The main concern of the government will be to save not only lives but also the livelihood. Kumar (2020) has strongly advocated on the dangers of the pandemic second wave from the experience of Spanish flu which has caused more death in the second round. He predicted that the worse is yet to come. So the global community needs to be well-prepared to face any Fig. 1 COVID-19 progress graph for India based on the SIR model (Ghosh 2020) .

With the support of the local community, the government can play a pivotal role in controlling the spread of the diseases. They can act as a watchdog in reporting a suspected case with travel history, assisting the government in isolating the travellers, and educating the illiterate rural mass through Information Education and Communication (IEC). The Government of India has done a tremendous job by announcing countrywide lockdown and special economic packages during the COVID pandemic to save lives and livelihoods. The global community viewed this as a very successful and wise decision to prevent the virus spread and save the country's economy.",

The segregation will minimize the size of the outbreak and impact on the public health system until an effective vaccine becomes available. He et al. (2020) advocated that controlling sources of infection, protecting the susceptible people, and cutting off the transmission as the best alternative to deal with COVID-19. Furthermore, the WHO also advises that the most effective ways to protect ourselves from COVID-19 are to frequently wash our hands, cover our mouth with bend elbows or tissue, and maintain social distancing at least 1 m (3 ft) from people who are coughing and sneezing. Social distancing measures and personal etiquettes like wearing a mask in public and frequent washing of hand will be achieved through public awareness and campaigns within the community level.",

Speaking at the Global Online Conference on combating COVID-19 organized by Bennett University, Dale Fisher, Chair of the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, highlighted the importance of social and community engagement in tackling transmission of COVID-19 (Tejonmayam 2020) . Dale Fisher's comments are in tune with the previous studies of Blendon et al. (2008) , Sangam (2020) , Bedford et al. (2020) , and Khandelwal (2020) . The measures to control the spread of COVID-19 are varied, but the current study is limited only on the role played by community leaders and individuals at a grass-root level. The present study will shed light on the policy-makers in decision-making and implementations of programs and policies in tune with society's structure. The government must implement its programs and policies with the healthy participation of the people. The authors found that the local populations in different parts of the country were very callous about implementing the lockdown. The local people barricade their localities, restrict the funeral of COVID-19 patients, alienate health workers, block emergency health services, and strictly implement social distance in place of physical distance giving impetus to stigma within the community. Stigma within the community is a sign of lack of mass awareness among the people. The spread of COVID-19 pandemic is beyond health and will have a profound impact on the country's social and economic settings. Thus, intervention by the government through community involvement is the need of the hour. A future researcher can aim to curb the pandemic through a public health system with government-linked volunteers like Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA), Village Level Workers (VLW), and Anganwadi.",
