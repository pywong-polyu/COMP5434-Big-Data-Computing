This system comprises natural and social factors as transmission elements of COVID-19. It finds that aside from temperature and relative humidity, the rate of Wuhan's inflow is directly related to a province's COVID-19 incidence. Inter-provincial distance, daily passenger transport, and the proportion of equity investments reflect the proportion of Wuhan's inflow into the provinces. These four elements reflect the scope of the epidemic. The urbanization rate, per capita GDP, business environment index, passenger density, and population density indirectly reflect the degree of population mobility in the province, which constitutes the transmission route of the epidemic. The theoretical framework of the structural elements of epidemic transmission under conditions of inter-provincial openness is constructed based on the analysis. In the process of preventing and controlling the spread of the virus, isolation of infectious sources is the most important factor. Under conditions of inter-provincial openness, limiting inter-provincial openness is the key to mitigating the spread of COVID-19.",

Since entering the new era of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has adhered to a people-centered development thought and put forward a development concept comprising innovation, coordination, green environment, openness, and sharing [3] . Open development, as one of the five development concepts for the medium and long-term development of China, provides a guide to promoting the transformation and upgrading of China's open economy and high-quality development. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the CPC clearly stated that we should \"build a new open economic system with a higher level, and implement a comprehensive opening up in a wider range, wider fields and deeper levels.\" [4] .",

Although it promotes high-quality development of China's economy, it also brings a series of challenges to the prevention and control of infectious diseases. In an open, inter-provincial environment, the probability of inter-provincial infection and difficulty of epidemic prevention and control both increase. The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan around the Spring Festival of 2020 and rapid spread across the country is closely related to the free flow of various elements in the context of inter-provincial openness. With an inter-provincial openness index system as basis, this study follows the law of epidemic transmission and proposes hypotheses regarding the relationship between inter-provincial openness and epidemic spread, and through empirical research, validates and analyzes the structural elements of epidemic transmission in the context of inter-provincial openness. It then draws conclusions on the relationship between inter-provincial openness and the spread of the epidemic.",

Sharia et al.

Xiang et al. [9] examined human avian influenza cases in China from 2005 to 2009 and also found that human avian influenza cases had obvious seasonal distribution characteristics. Wang [10] analyzed the peak of the intestinal epidemic in Hebei Province from 1958 to 1963 and concluded that the outbreak and prevalence of the epidemic were caused by multiple factors, among which, the role of social factors was far greater than that of natural factors. Therefore, epidemic disease is not only a physiological phenomenon of individuals, but also a social problem that is closely related to economic and social development, living customs, natural environmental changes, transportation, and international exchanges [10] . Guoning et al. [11] believed that temporal and spatial changes in the epidemic situation are affected by natural meteorological and socioeconomic factors [11] . This broadens the perspective of the analysis of the factors of epidemic spread, which point to natural and social factors.",

The findings have deepened our understanding of epidemic transmission in the real world from the perspective of complex networks, making it possible to predict and control the spread of epidemics [15] . McCluskey [16] analyzed the occurrence, transmission rules, and factors affecting infectious diseases using the infectious disease transmission model.

As the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control situation has changed, the number of clinically diagnosed cases was included in the index system that captures the epidemic's spread. Among these indicators, the number of confirmed patients is a relatively good indicator and is suitable as a dependent variable. The numbers of suspected cases and isolated observations are affected by many aspects and are greatly uncertain; thus, they are not suitable as dependent variables for this study. Although the number of confirmed cases is also affected by various factors, such as diagnosis and treatment methods, admission conditions, and so on, it is generally more certain. Considering the incidence rate as a measure, we can scientifically reflect the differences in epidemic situations in different provinces. Therefore, this study takes the incidence rate as a dependent variable for analysis. The incidence rate is a dependent variable, and the difference in the flow rate between the infection's sources (virus-carrying people) is undoubtedly an important factor causing the difference in the incidence rate in different provinces.",

According to the emergency response law of the People's Republic of China, public emergencies are mainly divided into four categories: natural disasters, accidents, public health events, and social security incidents [21] . The epidemic situation of infectious diseases is a typical public health event, and its spread comprises three links: source of infection, route of transmission, and susceptible population. The source of infection of COVID-19 is mainly people who carry the virus, and its spread is mainly through droplet transmission and contact between people. In the context of inter-provincial opening, we assume that some indicators closely related to interprovincial openness constitute the factors affecting the spread of this epidemic. These \"openness\" factors contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in two ways: the source of infection and the route of transmission, and the degree of the epidemic's spread also differs depending on the degree of openness between provinces. Based on certain assumptions, combined with the understanding of inter-provincial openness, we constructed and verified a schematic diagram of the transmission path and factors affecting the spread of COVID-19. A schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 2 .",

            "text": "In general, \"openness\" means opening up to the world. When evaluating a province's degree of openness, it generally refers to the province's openness to the world. However, building a new system for a higher-level, open economy means opening up domestic and international markets, making efficient use of domestic and international resources, forming a unified and open modern market system with orderly competition, giving full play to the decisive role of the market regarding resource allocation, greater involvement from the government, and promotion of an orderly and free flow of domestic and international resources and efficient global allocation [22] . Therefore, opening up includes not only the opening of a country or region to foreign countries, but also the opening up of different domestic regions. In addition, \"if the vertical relationship between local governments is mainly political and administrative, then the horizontal relationship between local governments is mainly of economic significance\" [23] . That is, although the content of opening up is very rich, \"economic work is the central work\" [24] . Local governments take economic opening up as the core of opening up. Since the start of China's reform and opening up, with the adjustment of intergovernmental power and responsibility relations, China's intergovernmental relations have gradually tended toward a network model [25] , and the horizontal and oblique links between local governments have been vigorously developed, thereby greatly expanding the scope and level of mutual openness between local governments in China. The concept of open development includes active, two-way, fair, comprehensive, and cooperative openness, and other important ideas [26] . Therefore, openness is a distinctive feature of mutual openness, and the free flow of various elements and resources is an inevitable requirement for mutual openness.",

It includes both opening up to the outside world and domestically, that is, the opening up of various regions and departments in China. In terms of content, openness to the outside world includes openness of the economy, politics, science, technology, and culture [27] . Opening up should \"focus on economic opening up and promote open cooperation in various fields such as politics, military, and social culture, so as to achieve balanced opening up\" [28] . This suggests that opening up is mainly economic, but also covers other aspects. At present, research on the index system of the openness of provincial administrative regions echoes the main content of economic openness, mainly focusing on the content of the economic index system of opening up provincial administrative regions, and also covers some other content. For example, Wang [29] selected the basis, structure and scale, quality and efficiency, and the potential of opening up as the four first-level indicators of the index system. Combined with the economic development of Zhejiang Province, Wang [29] selected 22 secondary indicators to support the first-level indicators, and used the entropy method to calculate and analyze the economic openness indicators of 11 cities in Zhejiang Province. Sun et al. [30] believed that the evaluation indicators of an open economy are mainly divided into two categories: one is based on the economic opening-up rules (or economic opening-up policies), and the other is based on the results of economic opening up. Based on the analysis, the evaluation indicators for opening up the economy to the outside and inside are constructed [30] . Cheng et al. [31] built an inland economic openness index system that included three target layers, six firstclass indicators, and 21 secondary indicators, and performed a comparative analysis of Chongqing's economic openness from vertical and horizontal levels using principal component analysis. Based on their analysis, Wang et al. [32] constructed an index system of urban innovation culture. In addition to research on the provincial-level administrative region openness indicator system, research on the inter-provincial openness indicator system is mainly focused on the economic openness level. For example, Li et al. [33] combined expert scoring and principal component analysis to construct the openness indexes for the total economic, domestic, import, and global levels from three dimensions: opening up to the inside, bringing in, and going out, which were used to measure how open the economy is in China's 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) from 2003 to 2012. Yang et al. [34] examined the possible regional heterogeneity and spatial homogeneity of industrial green innovation under the unbalanced development of inter-provincial openness in China, and constructed an evaluation index system for interprovincial openness, including five first-level indicators and five second-level indicators.",

Transportation convenience is measured by the number of daily passenger trains (railways and flights) from the capital of each province to Wuhan. The per capita GDP of each province is measured by the province's 2019 GDP. The urbanization rate of each province is calculated by the ratio of the urban permanent population to the total permanent population of the province at the end of 2018, and the proportion of mutual equity investments is measured by the ratio of the number of mutual equity mutual investments transactions between each province and Wuhan to the number of companies surviving in each province as of October 2019 (10,000). These nine factors are social factors closely related to inter-provincial openness. Meanwhile, the standardized correlation coefficients show that the variables reflecting the economic development level and degree of openness of each province have a greater impact on the incidence rate, which highlights the importance of openness and the level of economic development when looking at the epidemic's spread from the perspective of inter-provincial openness.

If the VIP value is greater than 1, this indicates that the independent variable plays a very important role in explaining the dependent variable. If the VIP value is 0.5-1, this means that the importance of the independent variable in explaining the dependent variable is low, and there is a need to increase the sample size or consider other conditions. If the VIP value is less than 0.5, the independent variable has no meaning in explaining the dependent variable. Therefore, the VIP value of the variable can be used to filter out the variables that have greater contribution to the model. The VIP values of the 11 independent variables in the model are shown in Table 5 . Table 5 shows that among the selected variables, the proportion of inflow population to each province (X1) and interprovincial distance (X3) are the variables most related to the incidence in each province, and their VIP values are 1.24029 and 1.21942, respectively. COVID-19 is caused by people carrying the virus. The main routes of transmission are through droplets and contacts. Hubei became a severe disaster area of the COVID-19 epidemic, and Wuhan was the hardest hit area of Hubei. The difference in the incidence rate during the early stage of the epidemic for each province is closely related to the proportion of the population from Wuhan visiting each province; therefore, this variable has the strongest explanatory power. During the pandemic's early (later) stages, it was important for the provinces to investigate the population imported from Wuhan (Hubei Province) for a better understanding of the influential factors concerning the inflow of the said population, and use the information to address the source of infection for purposes of prevention and control. The inter-provincial distance (X3) is also very powerful in explaining the incidence. In provinces close to Hubei, such as Jiangxi, Hunan, Chongqing, Anhui, and Henan, the distance between the capital of these provinces and Wuhan, and the incidence of COVID-19 in the province are negatively correlated. Several cities in Hubei Province close to Wuhan (such as Huanggang, Xiaogan, etc.) have become the hardest hit areas of COVID-19, which also shows that distance has a great influence on the incidence. For the cities mentioned, the distance from Wuhan is short, and the flow of various resource elements (human capital elements) between the provinces is more frequent, thereby exacerbating the spread of COVID-19; this finding is in line with the basic law of epidemic spread.",

The number of daily passenger flights reflects the degree of transportation convenience between Wuhan (Hubei) and the provinces (provincial capitals) and the level of convenience for inter-provincial population movement. The more convenient the transportation is the more frequent the inter-provincial contacts and exchanges between Wuhan (Hubei) and the other provinces, including the flow of various resource elements, inter-provincial tourism, and business exchanges between inter-provincial enterprises. A high urbanization rate stimulates the potential for economic development and brings about urban-rural mobility and cross-regional mobility of labor. Therefore, the urbanization rate also shows a significant positive correlation with the incidence rate. GDP is an important indicator of the economic strength and market scale of a country or region. Provinces with high GDP per capita reflect economic strength and market scale, and their open economy has strong ability to attract a large amount of labor and bring about labor mobility; this is why the per capita GDP of each province has a strong explanatory power for the incidence in each province. In other words, a high per capita GDP does not bring about the spread of the epidemic, but provinces with a high per capita GDP are generally more open, with greater population mobility, therefore, the risk of epidemic transmission is greater. Among the three influential factors, the daily passenger transport frequency (X4) relate to the infection source, while the urbanization rate (X6) and per capita GDP (X5) relate to the transmission routes.",

Generally speaking, provinces and regions with a high business environment index have a high level of economic development, and the level of talent and labor force aggregation is high. The incidence rate of this epidemic is relatively high (the VIP value is close to 1). According to the epidemiological transmission law, climate factors have a great impact on the spread of respiratory infectious diseases. For example, SARS in 2003 mainly prevailed during the winter and spring, which shows the general characteristics of seasonal and climatic influences on common respiratory infectious diseases. COVID-19 also broke out in late winter and spring, and had characteristics similar to those of SARS in 2003 from the perspective of season and climate. However, there is no scientific conclusion and basis for exactly what temperature is the most suitable for the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, although the temperature is related to the transmission of the epidemic, its explanatory power is not very strong. The influence of relative humidity is similar to that of temperature, which is a natural factor affecting the spread of the epidemic. Although its explanatory power is not very strong, it also reflects the complexity of epidemic transmission elements under conditions of inter-provincial openness. The correlation between these two natural factors and epidemic spread has also been confirmed in the existing literature on epidemic transmission.",

The VIP value of the variable population density is also lower than 1, possibly because both urban population density and rural population density are not calculated separately when determining the population density. COVID-19 has spread from urban to rural areas. In cities with a high population density, the risk of spreading from person to person is higher. Transmission of the epidemic in rural areas lags behind that in cities, and its prevention and control measures (closed roads and closed villages) can also effectively confine villagers in a given space, and the prevention and control effects are relatively obvious. Thus, the explanatory power of population density on the spread of the epidemic is weaker. The VIP value of the equity mutual investments ratio is the smallest among all the independent variables. Under conditions of inter-provincial openness, the variable of equity mutual investments ratio reflects the actual situation of interprovincial equity mutual investments. The higher the equity mutual investments ratio, the closer are the economic ties among provinces. However, equity investments and human resource flow are not proportional to each other; as such, the equity index cannot reflect the flow of personnel, nor can it be consistent with the incidence rate. Therefore, the proportion of equity mutual investments in some provinces can explain the transmission of the epidemic well, such as in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces, while this is not true for some provinces such as Tibet. Except for the two natural factors of temperature (X10) and relative humidity (X11), among the other four social factors related to interprovincial openness, the equity mutual investments ratio (X8), which reflects the equity investments between Wuhan and each province, relates to the source of infection.

Epidemic prevention and control involves two aspects: one is \"prevention and control\" and the other is \"treatment.\" Treatment belongs to the scope of medicine, and we will not discuss it here. \"Prevention and control\" means implementing isolation measures and curtailing inter-provincial openness toward a closed state for the region, to control the spread of the virus more effectively. Implementing epidemic prevention and control measures in an open environment has made us more aware of the importance of closing the borders. In other words, in an open environment, we get a better understanding of the elements of openness, how to manage/reverse inter-provincial openness more effectively during epidemics, or even limit inter-city and city center openness, which is a major issue.",

In other words, the greater the government's control efforts (starting first-level response time, strong emergency management capabilities, strict traffic control, etc.) are, the higher the incidence rate. This is contrary to common sense. Why is there such a contradictory result? The main reason is that during the early stage of the COVID-19 spread, each province initiated its first-level response based on the severity of the epidemic, and there was almost no difference in terms of timing. After Wuhan announced the closure of the city in the early morning of January 23, the provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hunan took the lead in launching a major public health emergency response to COVID-19 on January 23, while in other provinces, the first-level responses were launched successively on January 24-25. In fact, at this time, the population flow from Wuhan to the provinces had already taken place. During Fig. 3 Theoretical framework of the structural elements of epidemic transmission under conditions of inter-provincial openness the epidemic's spread, factors such as emergency management capabilities and traffic control were not very different between the provinces.

For example, the special circumstances of individual provinces affect the VIP value of the independent variable, thereby shifting the importance of a certain factor in the spread of the epidemic. For example, in Zhejiang and Jiangsu, nine out of 10 influential factors are roughly similar.",

The reason for such a large gap between the two provinces lies in the different proportions of the floating population working in Hubei and Wuhan. For example, Wenzhou City in Zhejiang Province has hundreds of thousands of employees. Therefore, the incidence rates of the two provinces have also been quite different because of the structure of the population inflow. Such a large disparity in the incidence of the two provinces also reminds us that under conditions of inter-provincial openness, with the free flow of various element resources, economic development and risk accumulation coexist.",

In addition to the influential factors related to inter-provincial openness analyzed and verified in this study, the spread of the epidemic is also related to the response speed of the epidemic prevention and control measures implemented in various provinces, the related strategies, efficiency level, citizen awareness, and other factors such as the degree of cooperation in implementing such measures. Therefore, in the process of epidemic prevention and control, all localities must be comprehensively considered. Only when the structural elements that affect the spread of the epidemic are included in the prevention and control system can the path of the epidemic spread be cut off and the epidemic be controlled effectively. The main contribution of this Under the background of normalization of epidemic prevention and control, consistent with the theme of this study, we will continue to analyze the factors related to interprovincial openness that affect epidemic prevention and control, and bring these factors into the analysis framework of this study, to further improve our work.",
