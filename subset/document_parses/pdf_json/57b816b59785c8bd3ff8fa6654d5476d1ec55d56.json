Surveillance of the Alpha VOC circulation was ascertained using a duplex RT-qPCR, targeting and discriminating the S gene. Our results showed that in a period of 6 weeks the Alpha VOC was present in all the studied WWTPs, and became dominant in 11 weeks on average. The outcompetition rates of the Alpha VOC were estimated, and their relationship with different parameters statistically analyzed. The rapid spread of the Alpha VOC was influenced by its initial input and by the previous circulation of SARS-COV-2 in the population. This latter point could be explained by its higher transmissibility, particularly advantadgeous when a certain degree of herd immunity exists. Moreover, the presence of signature mutations of SARS-COV-2 variants were established by deep-sequencing of the complete S gene.

Although spreading of the different SARS-CoV-2 lineages relies on their relative fitness, founder effects, as well as on the social behavior of the infected patients (Laur-ingHodcroft, 2021) , the rapid propagation of the Alpha variant has been mostly related with its higher transmissibility, i.e. fitness, compared with the previously dominant variant B.1.177 (Davies et al., 2021; Frampton et al., 2021; Volz et al., 2021) .",

The next weeks ( Fig. 1D and E), the Alpha variant advanced from these two focusses, into the WWTPs MIR (Vall\u00e8s Occidental) and FIG (Alt Empord\u00e0) on January 18, 2021, and further into the WWTPs ABR (Baix Llobregat) and SRS (Vall\u00e8s Occidental), as well as into the WWTP VEN (Baix Pened\u00e8s) on January 25, 2021. Finally, on February 1 and 8, 2021, the virus was already detected in the less populous regions covered by the WWTPs BER (Bergued\u00e0) and PUI (Cerdanya) in the Pyrenees mountains ( Fig. 1F and  G) . In a period of 6 weeks, the Alpha variant was present in all WWTPs with an average spread of 293 Km 2 /week, which represents a 17% of the area under study per week, with a maximum of 679 Km 2 (39%) in the week of January 11, 2021, and a minimum of 23 Km 2 (1%) in the week of February 1, 2021.",

However, the effect of the lockdown, causing a decrease in the overall virus titers, might well be a confounding factor. In contrast, a significant positive correlation (r 2 = 0.45; P = 0.67; p = 0.034) was found between the outcompetition rate of the Alpha variant in sewage, and the increase in the weekly number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants, in the period since its initial detection in sewage until its complete dominance (Fig. 3A) . In most WWTPs (VEN, ABR, MRT, FIG, GIR, GRA, MIR and PDL) the deconfinement started before the Alpha variant was dominant. With the aim to include the effect of the deconfinement in all plants, the same correlation analysis was repeated but relating the rate of outcompetition with the incidence increase in the period since the first detection of the Alpha variant until the end of the study (April 12, 2021), when the Alpha variant was dominant in all WWTPs (Fig. 3B) .

To understand this kinetics, we analyzed the relationship between the outcompetition rate and a series of variables. The differences in the rate of the Alpha variant outcompetition were not explained by environmental variables such as temperature and humidity. At least two factors influencing the virus-host interaction could partially explain the variation in the outcompetition rate: the initial relative abundance of the Alpha variant and the previous circulation of SARS-CoV-2 within the served population. While the potential influence of the initial input is intuitive, i.e., the highest the input of the variant the fastest the rate of outcompetition, the relationship with the previous circulation of SARS-CoV-2 (mainly the B.1.177 variant) within the population is less evident. Although the Alpha variant may escape from antibody responses generated by natural infection, reduction of the neutralization is modest (Supasa et al., 2021) . However, the higher the virus circulation the higher the herd immunity, implying a reduction of potential hosts, and a more efficient transmissibility of the Alpha variant (Davies et al., 2021; Volz et al., 2021) might represent a clear advantage.",

Mutations T73A and D253N are located in loops N2 and N5, respectively, of the NTD of the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (Cerutti et al., 2021a) . While loop N5 is integrated in the antigenic supersite, loop N2 is outside. However, it has been suggested that mutations in the N2 loop could significantly impact the conformation of the NTD supersite (Cerutti et al., 2021a) . In consequence, the occurrence of both mutations in the same genome in two samples from the VDP WWTP collected 11 weeks apart, may suggest a certain advantage of the virus harboring them. Similarly, mutations S477N and A522S which were present in the same genome molecule, could represent a combination of concern. In the period under study, replacement S477N was one of the most common in the GISAID database, while A522S although frequent was much less common. In fact, both mutations had been described to be among the top 12 mutation positions in the RBD (Cerutti et al., 2021b; Wang et al., 2021) . Mutation S477N has been described to induce resistance to neutralization by multiple monoclonal antibodies and, in the presence of the S514F replacement, to human immune sera as well . The effect of the combination of the S477N and A522S mutations on the resistance phenotype to immune sera has not yet been elucidated, but it cannot be rule out. However, these mutations were only detected in mid-February, suggesting that they would not provide any advantage, or even they could be associated with a loss of fitness, in the absence of herd immunity. The identification of VOCs in sewage is not as easy as it can be anticipated due to many difficulties such as: i) occurrence of many mutation signatures shared between variants, ii) lack of robust algorithms for the identification of the occurrence of distant mutations and/or deletions in a genome and iii) technical problems such as the lack of amplicon coverage homogenization, particularly when virus titers are low. Despite these technical difficulties, the identification of signatures (mutations and indels) of concern and the study of their spatiotemporal evolution in sewage could be highly valuable for public health management.",

In a period of 6 weeks the Alpha VOC was present in all the studied WWTPs, and became dominant in 11 weeks on average. However, the pace of spread was not homogeneous across the WWTPs. Obviously, the pace was faster when the Alpha VOC introduction in a population was stronger, but also when the previous circulation of SARS-CoV-2 was higher. This latter point could be related with the advantage of a more transmissible variant in a population with a certain level of herd immunity. The aproximation used for the estimation of the Alpha VOC outcompetition rate could be applied to other VOCs, broadening the WBE-derived results which in consequence may further contribute to the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.",
