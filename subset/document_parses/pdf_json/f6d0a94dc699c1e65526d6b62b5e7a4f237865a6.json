Meanwhile, Hemodialysis (HD) machines, which use membranes to supplement failing kidneys, are extremely common and widespread, with orders of magnitude more available than for ECMO machines[1]. This short study examines whether the membranes for HD can be modified for use in blood oxygenation (ECMO). To do so, it considers mass transfer at the micro-scale level, and calculations for the macro-scale level such as blood pumping rates and O2 supply pressure. Overall, while this conversion may technically be possible, poor gas transport likely requires multiple HD membranes for one patient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Background on HD and ECMO HD and ECMO machines both operate by removing large volumes of blood from the body and passing them through membranes that rely on diffusion to transfer desirable or undesirable solutes. HD machines focus on adding and removing compounds to assist with kidney failure, including removing salts and small organic compounds like urea. Meanwhile, ECMO uses membranes to replace O2 and help remove CO2.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Custom HD machines made for blood oxygenation [2] have been successfully demonstrated in the past; the question is whether existing HD machines can be converted readily. The blood flow paths of the two machines are similar, although flow rates and pipe diameters are smaller in HD: this may require multiple machines. Catheter insertion points for ECMO are chosen to provide O2 where it is needed; the same placement would be necessary for a HD to ECMO conversion. The dialysate side of the HD membrane presents numerous problems that limit the use of a liquid dialysate. While it is possible to use an oxygenated dialysate for ECMO, it would need a separate oxygenation chamber along with high pressure O2 supply. On the contrary, directly connecting a O2 supply to the dialyzer ports allows for a far simpler arrangement that requires a lower O2 supply pressure. Therefore, it was assumed that a pressurized O2 gas would be far more viable, although it presents its own concerns like bypassing the machine warning and shut-down systems triggered by no flow through the dialysate pump. Such pressurized O2 tanks are common in hospitals. Simply described, such a conversion would resemble the invasive setup of venovenous ECMO (VV-ECMO), with blood connected to HD machine(s) that house the membranes, pump and controls, and the dialysate side connected to a high pressure O2 tank. The number of HD machines required to be connected in parallel for the conversion depends on the maximum flow rate through the blood pump. With a flow rate of 1.63 l min -1 through the blood pump, an array of at least three HD machines is needed for the conversion. The number of membrane modules required depends on the blood flow rate through them. While the blood circuit is the same as in a conventional dialysis machine, the dialyzer circuit is modified to operate with O 2 gas from a compressed cylinder or a medical gas supply line. Gas exchange occurs inside the dialyzer as deoxygenated blood gets oxygenated while rejecting CO 2 to the gas stream due to partial pressure differences of O 2 and CO 2 across a hollow fiber.
