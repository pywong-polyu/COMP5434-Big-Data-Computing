The project digiDEM Bayern will set up a prospective dementia registry to collect long-term data of people with dementia and their caregivers in Bavaria (Germany) supported by more than 300 research partners. Objective The objective of this article is to outline an information technology (IT) architecture for the integration of a registry and comprehensive participant management in a dementia study. Measures to ensure high data quality, study governance, along with data privacy, and security are to be included in the architecture. Methods The architecture was developed based on an iterative, stakeholder-oriented process. The development was inspired by the Twin Peaks Model that focuses on the codevelopment of requirements and architecture. We gradually moved from a general to a detailed understanding of both the requirements and design through a series of iterations. The experience learned from the pilot phase was integrated into a further iterative process of continuous improvement of the architecture.",

Therefore, the implementation consists of three systems: (1) electronic data capture system for Web-based or offline appbased data collection; (2) participant management system for the administration of the identity data of participants and research partners as well as of the overall study governance process; and (3) videoconferencing software for conducting interviews online. First experiences in the pilot phase have proven the feasibility of the framework. Conclusion This article outlines an IT architecture to integrate a registry and participant management in a dementia research project. The framework was discussed and developed with the involvement of numerous stakeholders. Due to its adaptability of used software systems, a transfer to other projects should be easily possible.",

The overview of Krysinska et al 9 provides a recent status of both completed and ongoing dementia registries worldwide. The Krysinska et al study identified a total of 31 dementia registries, but digital tools are not yet widely used to establish dementia registries. 9 Thus, there exists no study in the literature of how an architecture for a digital prospective, multicenter dementia registry can be realized.",

Due to the electronic data capture (EDC) from such a large group of RPs, working as \"interview centers\" for digiDEM distributed all over Bavaria, the participants and RPs' management means a great challenge. 9 Therefore, a clear framework for managing the study, RPs, and participants must be established to ensure the registry's success.",

Furthermore, a survey was conducted among the RPs to obtain consensus on registry objectives and data set. 17 A workshop with project members from the preceding dementia registry project BayDem [18] [19] [20] was organized to take their experiences into account. The next step was defining a set of critical activities and requirements in the processes determining the final architecture decision. The derived processes were visualized using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 21 for better understanding. \u25baFig. 1 shows parts of the iterative development using the process \"follow-up interview (t6) by the RP\" as an example. Based on this, a prototypical blueprint of the architecture was developed and discussed with stakeholders.

To avoid significant bias and low data quality, inconsistent tracking measures and delayed interviews have to be minimized at all costs. 44, 64 Therefore, a central feature of the architecture is its dedicated participant and study management realized in the PMS.

            "text": "This article focuses on the retention of participants rather than the recruitment process. There are enough studies, for example, recruitment via direct mail 72 or online social media campaign 73 and online enrollment of potential participants. 74, 75 The retention and the reduction of loss to follow-up are crucial in studies with a long follow-up period. 76, 77 Special attention must be paid to keep these rates as low as possible. 78, 79 Limitations As described above, the RPs are informed about upcoming follow-up interviews in a paper-based letter. This decision may represent a disruption in the framework's digital workflow design, but it contributes to the project's success. To comply with data protection regulations, sending the information electronically to the RPs would only be possible in encrypted form, with subsequent decryption by the RP, or providing the information in a secure online portal with user-specific access. In conversations with our RPs, the paper-based method has proven to be more feasible, but this may differ for other studies.",
