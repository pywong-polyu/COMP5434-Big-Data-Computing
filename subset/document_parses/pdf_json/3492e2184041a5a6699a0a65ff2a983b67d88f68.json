            "text": "In spite of government counter-terrorism expenditure and efforts, the prevalence of insecurity in Nigeria appears to be rising and fast evolving into an existential crisis that is shaking the foundation of its nationhood. The current study used annual time-series data from 1980 to 2019 and the ARDL methodology to analyse the fiscal and socioeconomic consequences of insecurity on economic growth in Nigeria. The empirical findings demonstrated that high unemployment rate, domestic capital formation, foreign direct investment, government spending on education and security are negatively affected by the growing level of insecurity and consequently retarded growth in the long and short run. Conversely, improved health services, equitable income distribution and productive use of public borrowing were positively correlated with security and, therefore, stimulated growth in the long and short run. Government revenue and inflation rate accelerated growth in the long run whereas their short-run effect was deleterious. The findings suggest that good governance, provision of a safe and secured environment for human capital development and businesses, improved access to social and economic services will curb violent tendencies, create jobs, reduce poverty, increase government revenue and engender long-term inclusive growth.",

Good governance entails ensuring justice, empowerment, employment and efficient service delivery. So, governments should continue to work toward eradicating poverty, narrowing income and wealth disparities, eliminating corruption and nurturing good governance policies (Mazumdar and Bhattacharjee 2019) , On the other hand, rising levels of insecurity and anti-national activities pose a significant challenge to national rules and regulations, human rights and, in particular, have a significant negative impact on the economy, affecting price, output, employment, trade balance, poverty, inequality, defence expenditure, government budget patterns, socio-political environment and several others (Isola et al. 2019) .",

            "text": "It has been widely argued that insecurity and violent extremism can have a negative impact on economic growth in the short run through a variety of channels. Terrorism reduces the capital stock of a country by destroying human and physical capital. To combat terrorism, increased government spending on security may crowd out more growth-enhancing public and private investments in social sectors such as health and education, affecting a country's long-term growth (Micheal et al. 2019) . The risk and uncertainty effect associated with rising level of insecurity causes Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) to be redirected away from countries with higher security risk and toward countries with lower risk. Increased levels of insecurity reduce investment returns, reducing a developing country's capacity to attract foreign direct and portfolio investments (Chuku et al. 2019) . Furthermore, terrorist activities create economic risks and uncertainties that distort the equilibrium resource allocation within a country by influencing individuals' savings, investment and consumption behaviour. Terrorist activity also stifles growth by increasing the cost of doing business through higher wages, higher insurance premiums and increased security expenditures. These higher costs result in lower profits and, as a result, a lower return on investment. Terrorist attacks can also devastate infrastructure, causing business disruptions (Brodeur 2018) . However, the intensity of the consequences of terrorist events on the economy may be varied across countries based on the economic structure.",

The disturbing level of insecurity has rendered the economy unappealing to local and foreign investors, who have become apprehensive of investing and putting their hard-earned resources in profitable investment in Nigeria (Chuku et al 2019) . In addition to the country's deteriorating security situation, Nigeria is beset with significant developmental issues that constitute a severe threat to socioeconomic progress. These socio-economic issues include widespread poverty in the midst of plenty, sharp inequality in income distribution, extreme youth unemployment, poor industrial output, high inflation rate, decrepit infrastructure and fragile GDP growth (Edeme and Nkalu 2019) .

Insurgency, banditry, organized kidnapping and other forms of criminality have created a thriving trade in small arms, light weapons and other illicit trafficking. The proliferation of weaponry has increased insecurity in the country, resulting in over 80,000 deaths and 3 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) despite the fact that the country is not at war (United Nations refugee agency and the Council on Foreign Relations 2021). The number of small arms and light weapons in the hands of non-state actors and civilians in Nigeria is estimated to be around 6,145,000, compared to 586,600 firearms in the hands of the armed forces and law enforcement agencies (The Institute for Security Studies 2021). Security forces have been overwhelmed, allowing terror groups to operate with little or no resistance, primarily in huge swaths of ungoverned spaces. Local disputes are used by violent extremist organizations, who take advantage of insufficient governmental security and protection to establish their own influence over local communities and safeguard their groups' survival. In the absence of government security, community members may be forced to assume control of their own security. This would result in increased violence, the loss of lives and livelihoods and the proliferation of weapons.",

Why has the government effort at stemming the tide of insecurity in Nigeria yielded little results despite increased security spending? To understand this, one must ask whether government attempt at resolving the problem of insecurity in Nigeria is directed at the root causes, or the symptoms of insecurity or both. It argued that unless the root causes of insecurity in Nigeria are effectively addressed while attacking the symptoms of insecurity, the government may not succeed much in addressing the myriad of security challenges in the country. This study relies on documented evidences to interrogate these questions and proffer necessary policy recommendations premised on the findings.",

In the short run, growth is affected by shocks that cause the economy to temporarily deviate from its long-run growth trajectory, because sources of friction, such as sticky wages and prices, prevent the economy from adjusting instantaneously. By contrast, long-run economic growth is typically driven by productivity improvements, capital accumulation, employment growth, macroeconomic trends, technological innovation and structural transformation. Consequently, econometric models must distinguish between different time horizons or else risk arriving at flawed conclusions regarding economic relationships, which may translate into poor policy decisions (Usman and Olivier 2021) . Because the effect of insecurity on economic growth may vary according to the time horizon, the short-run relationship between the two variables may differ from the long-run relationship.",

This dearth of thorough quantitative empirical research may be credited as the primary source of insufficient policy direction in Nigeria on how to holistically address varying degrees of insecurity and criminality. Given the importance of time horizons in econometric modelling, the current study fills a vacuum by systematically assessing the long and short-term fiscal and socio-economic effects of insecurity on economic growth in Nigeria using annual time-series data from 1980 to 2019. The stochastic properties of the variables are looked into by carrying out the conventional Augmented Dicky-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Peron (PP) and the Zivot and Andrews structural break unit root test followed by the Pesaran et al. (2001) Auto-Regressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach for testing the existence of co-integration relationship among the study variables. Aside from the scholarly benefit this study portends for counter-terrorism and related issues; it is also expected to be a significant contribution to Nigeria's effort in resolving various security challenges. In addition to the military-driven strategy being undertaken at the moment, the study argued that inclusive growth and good governance is more certain to scale down insurgency and suggest a holistic solution that will also address other identified factors responsible for societal failures that lead to the creation of ready-made manpower for the various violent sects in Nigeria.",

This form of security comes with a sense of awareness of the measures that create an enabling environment for safety, minimizes vulnerabilities in any form and aspect of human wellbeing and guarantees protection in the face of threatening situations (Micheal et al. 2019) . The liberal school of thought believes that the government should focus on improving individual economic prosperity over crime prevention because economic uncertainty is the root cause of insecurity.

First, there is the notion of frustration and aggression, which states that frustration generates aggressive behaviour (Hogg 2016) . Second, there is the expectation theory, which holds that failure to achieve an expected outcome will result in violence (\u00d6zdamar 2008) . Third, the reactance thesis proposes that the removal of behavioural freedom, which causes the arousal of reactance, may lead to violence (Baumeister et al. 2002) . These three ideas emphasize the fact that different types of insecurity in Nigeria may be the result of varying levels of impoverishment.",

Existing studies have suggested that violence in Nigeria may be considered as a consequence of economic and political factors such as poverty, unemployment, inequality, corruption and poor governance. The predominance of socio-economic insecurity might make survival a vital concern (Purity and Anigbuogu, 2019). The more challenging problem, however, is that the motivation for terrorism in a resource-rich, socially heterogeneous developing country like Nigeria could be confounded by additional dimensions, such as resource competition, ethnic fractionalization and economic deprivation; all of which interact to make the situation more intricate to understand or deal with, especially because of the relatively lower capacity of a typical developing economy to confront the increasing sophistication of terrorist activities. Hence, the consequences of terrorism in such an environment are likely to extend beyond the destruction of lives and property to longer term macroeconomic impacts (Isola et al. 2019) .",

Their findings indicate that, on average, the occurrence of terrorism may have a significant negative impact on economic growth. They also discover that terrorism is associated with a shift in economic activity away from investment spending and toward government spending, with varying degrees of occurrence across different groups of countries. Similarly, Gassebner and Luechinger (2011) used extreme bounds testing to evaluate more than seventy previous terrorism studies and discovered that economic activity had a robust and negative relationship with terrorism. In the case of Pakistan, Mehmood (2014) calculates the cumulative cost of terrorism to the Pakistani economy between 1973 and 2008 to be 33.02%.",

These channels can be divided into two types: direct and indirect costs. Collier (1999) identifies the most obvious and direct peril of civil war (of which terrorism can be considered a subset) as the destruction of physical capital, including the destruction of public infrastructure and the loss of human capital. As the effectiveness of government institutions is jeopardized, this destruction leads to a simultaneous increase in transaction costs as a result of reduced security. Another important factor is the proportion of GDP allocated to investment spending. Terrorism causes economic activity to diverge from investment spending to government spending on terrorism, primarily for the installation of non-productive defence mechanisms against terrorist activities, according to Gaibulloev and Sandler (2008) . Furthermore, Eckstein and Tsiddon (2004) argue that terrorism raises the perceived likelihood of an untimely death, prompting people to substitute future savings for current consumption in order to maximize utility in the present at the expense of the future, which is another cause of decline in economic activity. Chuku et al., (2019) adopted the ARDL and Structural Vector Auto-regressive (SVAR) technique to examine the growth and fiscal consequences of terrorism in Nigeria using different measures of terror incidence, government expenditure and economic activity. The empirical results indicated that terrorism leads to the reallocation of economic activity away from private investment spending to government counter-terrorism spending thereby impacting negatively on growth. The study omitted the revenue side of fiscal policy and proxy growth using the inflation-unadjusted GDP. There exist some gaps in the reviewed studies, despite the fact that they cover a large body of literature. The literature has not taken into account the possibility that the economic costs of terrorism may be determined by the extent of resource dependence and the nature of the political regime in place. The focus on a developing country, such as Nigeria, aids in understanding whether growth is sustainable under the conditions that developing countries face, particularly in terms of the weak institutional and military capabilities to protect their citizens and assets from acts of terrorism, which could have severe repercussions for the development process. (Blomberg et al. 2011) . Furthermore, most of the existing empirical studies are panel based and are unable to uncover country-specific idiosyncrasies in the economy-terrorism relationship, particularly for a resource-rich developing country. This study attempts to fill these identified gaps by interpreting the country-specific characteristics of the economy-terrorism relationship in Nigeria, a resource-rich country.",

In addition to their effects on real activities, prolonged armed conflict can destroy part of the tax base and weaken the efficiency of tax administration (Gupta et al. 2004 ). Typically, increased defence spending can affect the composition and pattern of public expenditure by lowering the expenses on productive and growth-enhancing sectors of the economy such as education and health (Edeme and Nkalu 2019) . Apart from the destruction of physical infrastructure and human capital, violent conflicts have a lagged effect on investment, which ultimately reduces the fiscal position of a country. These fiscal imbalances may have ripple effects on economic growth.

(2001) . This methodology is recommended over traditional cointegration approaches (Engle and Granger, 1987; Johansen 1988 Johansen , 1991 Johansen and Juselius 1990) , which necessitate a long sample time and all variables to be I(1). Firstly, endogeneity problems and inability to test hypotheses on the estimated coefficients in the long run associated with the Engle-Granger (1987) method are avoided. Secondly, the model's long-and short-run parameters can be estimated concurrently, as can the speed of adjustment to long-run equilibrium caused by any short-run external shocks, thereby removing the issues associated with omitted variables and the occurrence of autocorrelation. Thirdly, the econometric methodology is relieved of the responsibility of determining the order of integration among variables and pre-testing for unit roots. Because the variables are assumed to be stationary at levels (I(0)), first difference (I(1)) or fractionally integrated, pre-testing for unit roots in time-series variables and determining first-order integration or I(1) behaviour are not necessary for this technique (Ewetan et al 2020) . However, to assure the relevance of the co-integrating relationship, Pesaran et al. (2001) stated that the dependent variable should be first difference stationary. Rahman and Islam (2020) also believe that the presence of any I(2) variable(s) may cause the system to crash. As a result, it is preferable to perform some efficient unit root tests to check that no I(2) variable(s) is/are included in the model. Furthermore, while the results from the estimation process derived from the Engle and Granger and Johansen and Juselius methods are not efficient and consistent for studies with small sample size, Pesaran et al., (2001) indicated that the short and long-run parameters estimated using the ARDL methodology are reliable and efficient for small sample analyses that can be compared to what we have in this study. According to Nguyen (2020) , the ARDL bounds testing methodology has considerably superior small sample qualities than multivariate co-integration. Likewise, in contrast to vector autoregressive (VAR) models, the ARDL model can accommodate a greater number of variables and is more versatile in terms of lag structure because it can accept multiple optimal lag structures for distinct variables Micheal et al., (2019) .",

The Jarque-Bera probability values of the other variables demonstrated a distinct lack of normality in their residuals, as evidenced by the significant Jarque-Bera probability values of less than 0.05. The non-normality of residuals could be attributable to the fact that these variables are particularly susceptible to oil price shocks and other economic instability, which may have caused outliers, resulting in residual non-normality. The Jarque-Bera probability of the log-transformed values of FRR, GEE, GHE, GSS and PCI were, however, estimated to be normally distributed. Furthermore, normality of data distribution is not required to apply the ARDL co-integration method used in this study (Rahman and Islam 2020) . Consequently, the estimated results reported in the study are deemed to be quite efficient. Also, the correlation analysis was conducted to scrutinize the magnitude and severity of multi-collinearity among the explanatory variables in the empirical model.

Table 4 indicates that the calculated F-statistic of 16.115 is greater than the upper bound critical value of 3.61 at the one percent significance level, evidencing the fact that a significant long-run relationship exist between economic growth and the socio-economic influencers of insecurity in Nigeria explicitly captured in Eq.

The long-run estimated results are displayed in Table 5 . From Table 5 , the estimated coefficient of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) indicated a significant negative relationship with long-term economic growth. Nigeria, as a developing country with poor domestic capital formation and a scarcity of vital infrastructure, requires considerable inflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment to spur growth. The country has become increasingly unattractive to foreign investors caused by growing insecurity, shortage of critical infrastructures and the relocation of multinational companies to neighbouring countries. No investor, whether domestic or foreign, will be inspired to invest in a risky and insecure environment. The risk and uncertainty associated with rising level of insecurity in Nigeria has resulted in the redirection of foreign direct investments away from Nigeria to other West African countries which negatively affect growth. The government's apparent incapacity to provide a secure and safe environment for people, property, and the performance of business and economic operations and the country's dismal economic state is responsible for the gradual withdrawal of Portfolio as well as foreign direct investment from Nigeria to other West African countries which adversely affect government revenue generation. The result is in concord with previous studies of Edeme and Nkalu (2019) and Nguyen.

Based on Table 5 , a percentage increase in domestic capital formation will ceteris paribus, generate a decrease of about 0.003% in long-run economic growth. Terrorist activities create economy-wide risks and uncertainties that distort the equilibrium resource allocation within a country by changing individuals' savings, investment and consumption behaviour. Terrorist attacks can destroy infrastructure, thereby leading to business disruptions and raising the cost of doing business in a country. These higher costs result in reduced profits and, thus, smaller return on investment. Insecurity is a drag on economic progress, frustrating and undermining domestic investment in Nigeria because of its evident negative effects on long-term growth. With the country's widespread and systemic security challenges and the seeming incapacity of the state to ensure safety and security, numerous factories have been burnt, lives and properties have been lost, investors have fled, and many enterprises have relocated or shut down. All of these impediments stifle domestic capital formation and private investment in Nigeria consequently inhibiting long-term economic growth. The finding sanctions a priori expectation but contradicts extant studies of Apanisile and Okunlola (2014) and Babu et al. (2020) who reported a significant positive relationship between domestic capital formation and long-term economic growth in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan African countries, respectively. The long-run coefficient of Public Debt (GTD) demonstrated a positive impact on economic growth that was significant at one percent level. From Table 5 , a percentage point increase in total debt stock holding other explanatory variables constant triggered an increase of about 0.008% in long-term economic growth. Prolonged period of insecurity can destroy part of the tax base and reduce government revenue generation thereby increasing deficit financing. The use of government borrowing to support increased public expenditures can boost the nation's productivity by allowing for increased investment in physical and social infrastructure. The findings support neoclassical investment theory, which emphasizes that government borrowing is an important tool for financing capital formation and might be utilized to successfully increase economic growth if productively employed to fund vital infrastructures that increase efficiency. The result is in agreement with earlier studies of Edeme and Nkalu (2019) and Amana et al., (2020) who reported a significant positive impact of public debt on economic growth of Nigeria in the long run.",

The result is in tandem with the findings of Gupta et al., (2004) , Ikechukwu (2019) , Edeme and Nkalu (2019) and Chuku et al. (2019) who reported a significant negative impact of insecurity on economic growth of Nigeria. The escalating level of insecurity in Nigeria by disrupting the allocation of scarce resources to the protection of lives and properties thereby threatening the desperate attempt to industrialize, the existing socio-cultural tranquillity and sustainable growth.",

The escalating level of insecurity in Nigeria has resulted in the loss of over N1.4 billion to N1.6 billion in business and commercial assets between 2015 and 2018, as well as a decline in daily oil production from 2.2 million to 1.5 million barrels per day in 2018, leading to low government revenue generation. The study result in violation of a'priori expectation indicated evidence of a positive relationship between government revenue and economic growth. In today's globalized international order, the effects of terrorist activities in one country can reverberate positively or negatively in the economy of different countries, Nigeria being a resource dependent economy might have benefited positively from the oil windfall occasioned by various act of instability in other oil producing countries.

In order to mitigate terrorism, increased government spending on security can crowd out more growth-enhancing public and private investments in social sectors such as health and education, which in turn can affect the long-run growth of a nation adversely. Moreover, there is evidence that insecurity endangers growth of real per capita income and thereby growth in government revenue, resulting in lower growth of real per capita government spending on education which in turn has an adverse impact on economic growth. When people are deprived of access to quality education, hungry and not sure of where the next meal will come from, they can become increasingly more rebellious, aggressive and violent. Nigeria needs a well thought out process to combat leadership failure, poor governance system and better secure the country. Procuring all the weapons in the world will not bring an end to insecurity unless governance is improved.

Based on Table 5 , a percentage point increase in government security spending activated a decrease in economic growth of approximately 0.63%. An increase in government security expenditure can negatively affect growth by crowding-out scarce fiscal resources needed for productive investment in other critical sectors of the economy. Insecurity is insidious and grows from one stage to another. It is one thing to get the equipment you need to combat terrorism and another thing to get the desired results. Nigeria's counter-terrorism operations put primacy on military strategy instead of focusing on the things that prevent insecurity. Security is not a gadget you buy in the shelve but a product of premeditated planning. Nigeria's defence budget has increased significantly during the last two decades while the threat of insecurity appeared to be worsening and fast evolving into an existential crisis that is shaking the foundation of its nationhood. A disproportionately large security expenditure would normally come at the expense of social service provision, crowding-out scarce fiscal resources to other growth-enhancing sectors of the economy. The inverse relationship between government security expenditures and economic growth in Nigeria can be linked to a variety of factors such as the lack of transparency in military purchases. There is also evidence of lax monitoring, controls and audits of the military budget, allowing corruption and waste to flourish.

Increasing level of insecurity can destroy part of the tax base, endanger the growth of government revenue and depress the present rate of growth, For many years, Nigeria has been plagued by a succession of incompetent leaders, resulting in mismanagement of scarce fiscal resources, criminal neglect of the population and widespread poverty, all of which endanger the nation's security. Nigeria has the resources to meet her people's requirements, but corruption in public offices at all levels has made it hard for public office holders to focus on meeting the people's basic requirements. Prudent utilization of government revenue in improving access to social and welfare services can reduce poverty, mend security and encourage inclusive growth.",

The results showed that increase in current level of government security spending by crowding-out scarce fiscal resources to other growth-enhancing sectors of the economy, significantly decreases the current level of economic growth. Despite increased budgetary allocations to security in recent years, the country has continued to witness an upsurge in violent crimes and various forms of insecurity. This explains why it is almost impossible to cure a problem based on violence with violence. The use of military/force to deter security concerns by Nigeria's government has not achieved much in stemming the tide of insecurity which creates the impression that the government is not doing enough to secure the people. Curtailing the plethora of security challenges in Nigeria would require a combination of military approach and a dynamic, effective and responsible leadership that has the courage to tackle various forms of socio-economic deprivations from their root causes. A disproportionate security expenditure can ultimately impede economic efficiency, notwithstanding the significance of security for economic growth.",

Consequently, an increase in the current level of per capita income motivated an increase of about 1.33% in the present rate of economic growth at one percent significance level while an increase in the one-period lag of per capita income produced a decrease in the current rate of economic growth of about 0.51%, respectively. The coefficient of present level of unemployment D(UMP) in accord with the long-run results exhibited a significant negative relationship with the current rate of economic According to theoretical literature, RGDP can be utilized as a precise gauge of economic growth. It is an inflation-adjusted measure that represents the value of all final products and services produced each year expressed in a base year price. FDI is a control variable used in the model to assess the impact of insecurity on the level of foreign capital inflow and their ripple effect on growth. FRR in millions of Nigerian Naira measures the financial strength and resources available to the federal government of Nigeria to address the myriads of socio-economic challenges confronting the nation. GFCF is investment in fixed assets funded with money raised via the stock market. Following IMF (2018), the GFCF was adopted as a proxy for the level of private investment. GEE in billions of Naira was used as a proxy for the level of human capital development and its impact on economic growth in Nigeria. GHE in billions of Naira is a fiscal and conditioning variable to evaluate the level of social and welfare services provided by the government and its effect on growth. GSS, measured in millions of USD, includes all current and capital expenditures on the armed forces, including peacekeeping forces, defence ministries and other government agencies engaged in defence projects. GTD was included in the model as a fiscal and conditioning variable for government revenue. Growing security concerns has made it extremely difficult to meet government spending plan solely through tax collection. Public debt has become imperative for financing government operations to stimulate the economy. INFR measures the annual percentage increase in consumer prices. It was adopted as a conditioning variable to control for the instability in price changes which affects business forecasts and standard of living of the populace. INS is a dummy variable included in the model to test for the effect of escalating level of insecurity on economic growth in Nigeria. The variable was measured with an index of 1 in years 1980 to 1982 during the Maitatsine crisis and 2009 through 2019 for the duration of the Boko Haram insurgency and zero for other years. PCI in USD was adopted as a proxy for inequality in income distribution and poverty level. Poverty is pronounced deprivation in well-being and includes low incomes and the inability to acquire the basic goods and services necessary for survival with dignity (d 'Agostino, et al. 2016) . UMP measures the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the labour force. It refers to those who are currently not working but are willing and able to work for pay",

The diagnostics test statistics in Table7 revealed that the model's residuals are normally distributed, with no significant evidence of multi-collinearity, serial correlation, heteroscedasticity, or model misspecification error. As the aforementioned attributes are desirable qualities of OLS models, the model was properly specified. The CUSUM and CUSUM of squares tests (Figs. 1 and 2) suggests that the estimated model parameters are within the critical boundaries at 5% significance level, accepting the null hypothesis that all coefficients and the ECM are dynamically stable and the estimated findings are reliable and adequate for forecasting and policymaking.",

The most important of these is the creation of a safe and favourable environment that ensures lives, livelihoods and investment. Insecurity has reached frightening proportions in Nigeria, rearing its ugly head in numerous aspects of our national life. Day after day, lives are lost, the population is depleted, businesses are paralysed, investments are plummeting, multinational corporations are shutting their operations and leaving the country, unemployment is skyrocketing, and the citizenry terrified and acutely impoverished. Clearly, this represents a severe threat to Nigeria's government and economic growth. Using the ARDL technique, this study undertook an empirical examination of the relationship between the enablers of insecurity and economic growth in Nigeria during a 40-year period from 1980 to 2019. The empirical results indicated that high unemployment rate, domestic capital formation, foreign direct investment, government security and education spending are negatively affected by the growing level of insecurity and, thus, retarded growth in the long and short run. Conversely, improved health services, equitable income distribution and productive use of public borrowing to improve access to socio-economic infrastructure were positively correlated with security and, therefore, stimulated growth in the long and short run. Government revenue and inflation rate accelerated growth in the long run while their short-run effect was deleterious. The error-correction term suggested a 42% speed of adjustment to any disequilibrium in the long run.",

The results suggest that the impact of terrorist activities should be systematically taken into account when preparing government budgeting and expenditure plans. From the study findings, it is evident that an effective growth strategy that addresses the various forms of socio-economic deprivations has not been developed to tackle various forms of security challenges in Nigeria. The traditional state-centric and militaristic tactics have guided the government's counter-terrorism programme, thus far. Unless a more robust counter-terrorism strategy involving kinetic and non-kinetic means is implemented alongside major governance and political reforms aimed at reversing Nigeria's historic, social and economic imbalance, the predominantly military approach to countering various forms of insecurity in Nigeria could continue to create tensions between the government and the populace. The study, therefore, suggests that policy makers should, in order to prevent or combat terrorism, focus on improving the economy by improving access to socioeconomic infrastructures that reduce poverty, creating job opportunities through provision of conducive environment that supports businesses and reduces inequality gaps. Although the current study provides remarkable insights on the fiscal and socio-economic impacts of insecurity on Nigerian economic growth, it is susceptible to significant limitations, mostly related to data availability and the econometric technique. Future research could look into a comparative assessment of the effects of insecurity on agricultural output and food security in Nigeria's various geopolitical zones using additional variables.",

Error t-Statistic P-value number of severely impoverished nations in the world, with substantial income disparities despite its enormous human and material resources. Government has a responsibility to create the enabling and secured environment for businesses to flourish and provide jobs. When the government have little or no economic plan to be able to reverse the growing unemployment, you are likely to create a very fertile ground for the employment of large army of unemployed youths by those who have violent intentions. The absence of economic prospects and earning power associated with high levels of youth unemployment degrades or undermines the quality of life, promoting anger, dissatisfaction and other negative tendencies among young people. The cumulative result of this deviant behaviour is a slowing of economic growth. The result is consistent with theoretical expectation of the study and extant findings of Evans and; Kelikume (2019),Nkwatoh and Nathaniel, (2018), Brodeur. (2018).",
