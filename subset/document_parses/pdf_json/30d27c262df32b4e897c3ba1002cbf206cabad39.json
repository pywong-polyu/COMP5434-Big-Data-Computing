            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI), which manifests clinically as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units globally, with mortality rates as high as 46% for patients with severe ARDS [1] . Most recently, in the context of the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an estimated one-third of hospitalized patients developed ARDS [2] . Despite the clinical magnitude of the problem, no effective targeted ARDS therapies exist and treatment remains largely supportive, including lung-protective low tidal volume mechanical ventilation [3] and the use of interval prone positioning to optimize oxygenation [4] . ALI is characterized by an extensive inflammatory cascade that ultimately impairs gas exchange and lung function. A cardinal feature of ALI is increased lung endothelial cell (EC) permeability, resulting in increased transit of cells, protein-rich fluid, and inflammatory signaling molecules into the surrounding lung parenchyma and alveoli [5] . Direct consequences of this dysregulated inflammatory process are tissue hypoxia from pulmonary edema and the need for mechanical ventilatory support. Thus, strategies aimed at mitigating lung vascular permeability offer promise as novel and effective ALI therapies. One potential target in this regard is the EC tight junctional protein, claudin-5.",

The importance of tight junctions in regulating EC permeability is evidenced by increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier in mice deficient in claudin-5 [6] , which is predominantly expressed in ECs [7] . Moreover, we previously reported claudin-5 is an important mediator of ALI protection by simvastatin in a murine model [8] . Subsequent reports have further supported a significant functional role for claudin-5 in lung EC barrier regulation [9] . Notably, a recent study identified increased expression of claudin-5 in brain ECs induced by the antipsychotic medication, haloperidol [10] . Thus, we investigated the effect of haloperidol on lung EC claudin-5 expression and its role as a potential mediator of EC permeability relevant to ALI.",

Consistent with the TER studies, a significant attenuation of thrombininduced FITC-dextran flux was observed with haloperidol treatment ( Figure 2B ). In separate experiments, human pulmonary artery ECs were grown to confluence in Transwell inserts. Cell monolayers were then treated with haloperidol (10 \u00b5M) for 24 h prior to the simultaneous administration of FITC-dextran (2000 kDa) to the media in each insert and treatment with thrombin (1 U/mL). After 1 h, the media underneath each insert was collected and fluorescence measured (n = 3/condition, * p < 0.05).",

These two signaling events have been shown to accentuate inflammation in ALI models [28] .
