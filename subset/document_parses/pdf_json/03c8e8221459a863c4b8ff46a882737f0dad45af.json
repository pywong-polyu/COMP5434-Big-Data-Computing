            "text": "Open access refers to all persons whose self-identified gender is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. This is the same definition used in the 2009-2010 Canadian community-based research study Trans Pulse. 4 Trans Pulse explored the experiences and social determinants of transgender people's health. It identified employment discrimination, 5 discrimination in healthcare services 6 and a higher suicide rate 7 in this population. Higher rates of suicidal behaviour have also been described in other transgender contexts 8 9 and are associated with discrimination and family rejection 10 . Trans Pulse also showed that racial/ethnic and gender discrimination can increase HIV infection risk in transgender people. 11 A systematic review, covering January 2006 to March 2017, highlighted gender disparities between transgender men and transgender women in terms of HIV infection risk and risky sexual practices. 12 In the USA, HIV prevalence in transgender women is high, especially for African-American and Latina women. 13 In a study of 3818 people living with HIV (PLHIV) in San Francisco, 35 were HIV-positive transgender (TRHIV) women on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Results showed that with respect to non-transgender people, they had a lower rate of adherence to treatment, experienced more side effects, had a higher rate of depression and had less positive interactions with care providers. 14 Data on TRHIV people are scarce and most only concern TRHIV women. A meta-analysis of 39 studies in 15 countries in 2013 showed an HIV prevalence of 19% in transgender women, and that the risk of infection was 50 times higher in this population than in the general population. 15 A systematic review performed between 2012 and 2015 showed that globally, transgender women had a greater risk of HIV infection, the prevalence reaching 40%. 16 That review also described the association of 'syndemic' factors with the risk of infection. More specifically, some transgender people are exposed to biological and social factors that most likely impact not only HIV infection risk, but also prevention behaviours and disease progression. These vulnerability factors influence ART adherence and viral load control in transgender people who are screened, treated and followed. 17 18 TRHIV women may also have a greater risk of drugdrug interactions between ART and feminising hormonal regimens. Hormonal treatments may increase the risk of comorbidities (osteopenia, cardiovascular risk factor, venous thromboembolism). However, data on possible interactions are scarce 19 and contradictory. 20 TRHIV women are more adherent to ART when they have few side effects and when female hormone effectiveness is not affected. 21 With regard to transgender men, little information is available about interactions between masculinising hormone and ART. The few studies to date estimating HIV prevalence in this population reported a small number of positive cases, 22 23 which suggests that the HIV burden is lower in transgender men than in transgender women. TransPulse (see above) is one of these studies; it looked at the effects of testosterone in transgender men who have sex with men and showed that using the hormone did not influence HIV-related sexual risk behaviours, despite the fact that testosterone increases libido. 24 In France, gender identity is still a complex issue from a legal perspective. The first small step forward towards recognising this population was taken in 2010 with the decree no 2010-125, whereby 'transsexualism' could no longer be considered a mental pathology in the country's social security's system's classification of long-term illnesses. The '21 st century justice law' 25 subsequently stipulated that a person can change their sex designation in their civil status if desired, that such a change must not be subject to medical treatment obligations, and that it must be legally recognised.",

In 2007, an exploratory study exploring transgender people's social situation, sexual behaviours and use of healthcare, showed they were more socially isolated than the general population, that one in three reported discrimination in getting employment, that 1 in 5 had decided not to seek healthcare care for fear of discrimination, and that they took significant risks in terms of HIV infection exposure. 30 PLHIV are still subject to multiple forms of discrimination which hinder them from achieving their 'life project' and can compromise therapeutic success. For example, the ANRS-VESPA2 survey, conducted in 2011 showed that PLHIV still experienced discrimination in employment Open access (24%), in their family (11%), and in healthcare services (8 %). 31 32 Although sex work was legalised in France in 2016, the law penalises clients; this is detrimental to SW safety, health and living conditions (eg, more risks at work, less condom use). 33 These negative effects are more frequent in transgender SW. 34 In France, universal healthcare covers all public medical costs for people working or residing in the country on a stable basis, and PLHIV receive free healthcare. Access to care is more difficult for PLHIV whose administrative situation is irregular (eg, no work permit). Migrant people or people with social vulnerability respond less well to ART. 35 A survey analysing the Bichat hospital's HIV care unit database in 2015 showed that transgender people were more exposed to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) than other populations, and that their dermatological complications needed better management. 36 A second survey in the same care unit, which aimed to highlight the dangers associated with the clandestine use of cosmetic surgery, reinforced these results and showed that transgender women also presented physical health risks related to the illicit use of silicone. 37 In order to improve knowledge about the situation of TRHIV in France, we designed the community-based research study ANRS Trans & VIH, which aims to better understand this population's living conditions and healthcare pathways. To encourage TRHIV to participate, we partnered with the transgender self-support association ACCEPTESS-T, and AIDES, a long-established international association in the fight against HIV. Both associations have in-depth knowledge of the issues and problems facing TRHIV. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown the value of involving associations in research for a better understanding of community-based health problems, 38 especially in the most marginalised populations. 39 Both associations were fully involved in the conception and writing of the study protocol, the coconstruction of the research questions and data collection tools. They highlighted important issues to be investigated (gender affirmation trajectories and specific discrimination situations), played a role in adapting the questionnaire and interview guide, and suggested how the field survey could be organised. They are also fully implicated in the ongoing data collection process.",
