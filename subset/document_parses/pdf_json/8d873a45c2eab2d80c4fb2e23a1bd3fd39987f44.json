            "text": "Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 St. Gallen/Vienna Consensus Conference on Early Breast Cancer Treatment Standards had to be held virtually. Despite the challenge of convening global contributors to both the conference itself as well as the important Consensus Panel, the scientific committee and the organizers managed to organize a well-received scientific conference, and also the panel discussion was well received in the worldwide scientific community, as indicated by numerous positive feedbacks already within the first 24 h. The virtual format was unusual, but opened the door for new elements such as Consensus questions proposed from the audience, but also live audience interaction on both days -the Consensus was split into 2 parts in order to accommodate as many time zones globally as possible, leading to almost a doubling of discussion time compared to previous meetings. Also, about 3,400 participants from over 100 countries and all continents came together, including many colleagues who could attend for the first time from world regions with restrictions that so far did not allow the travel to Vienna. Traditionally, the Panel votings and discussions were preceded by 3 days of highlevel live-discussions about the lectures that were available on demand already a week before. Also, all the lectures and live discussions in mini-panels are made available online for at least 6 months (https://www.oncoconferences.ch/events/ bcc-2021/). The traditional panel votings were once more moderated by Eric Winer from Harvard and included interactive elements such as audience votings and audience questions, presented by Michael Gnant. This rapid report by the editors-in-chief of Breast Care summarizes the results of the 2021 international panel votings with respect to locoregional and systemic treatment as a quick news update for our readers and clearly does not intend to replace the official St. Gallen Consensus publication that will follow shortly in Annals of Oncology.",

Over 3 days, these high-level state-of-the-art and educational lectures addressing local and systemic therapy issues as well as imaging, biomarkers, survivorship, and even COVID-19-related subjects led to great live discussion sessions that gave opportunity for expert discussions of defined topic and -for the first time -for audience questions. A great proportion of sessions were dealing with biology, pathology, and translational research issues, providing not only a great basis for future clinical trials but also defining areas of focused greatest need. Again, a large number of participants from all over the world joined and Thomssen attended the virtual meeting and were actively involved.

            "text": "While some areas of controversy persist for which no consensus could be found (platinum salts for TNBC, adjuvant CDK4/6 inhibitors, anthracyclines for HER2-positive disease, addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to OFS in premenopausal patients at moderate risk, anthracyclines for node-negative luminal breast cancer), the Consensus Panel once more re-defined the standard of care for early breast cancer. We are looking forward to both the full Consensus manuscript as well as to the 18th SG-BCC to be held in Vienna in March 2023.",
