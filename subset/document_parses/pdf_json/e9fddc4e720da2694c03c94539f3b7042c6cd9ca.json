Electron microscopy revealed coronavirus-like particles in the proximal tubular cells, podocytes, and distal tubular cells. ACE2 is expressed in the apical brush border cells in the proximal tubule and in podocytes, and the presence of virus-like particles correlates with this distribution of the ACE2 receptors [3] . These histopathological findings clinically present as transient function loss of the proximal tubular channels, manifesting as Fanconi syndrome. A study in France, found proximal tubulopathy in 68%, proteinuria in 85%, phosphate leakage in 48%, and glycosuria in 44% [4] . This is commonly self-limiting, with resolution of derangements on recovery, although more profound injuries could present as acute tubular necrosis and acute kidney injury.",
