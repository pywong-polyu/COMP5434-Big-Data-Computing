In times of the current pandemic, individuals are confronted with several challenges including social distancing [3] and economic uncertainties. According to a metaanalysis (including general populations globally during the pandemic), the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 32% (95% CI: 28-37) and 34% (95% CI: 28-41), respectively [4] . Globally, it should be emphasized that most of the studies used convenience samples and only some studies using nationally representative samples (from a specific country, e.g., United Kingdom, Austria, United States, Australia, Scotland or Republic of Ireland) during the pandemic (e.g., [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] ).",

Particularly high prevalence rates were identified among younger individuals aged 18 to 29 years, among individuals with migration background and among individuals with at least one chronic disease. Some groups (gender: diverse; without school-leaving qualification) also reported very high prevalence rates.

However, compared to April 2021, prevalence rates were slightly lower for probable major depressive disorder (23.7%), whereas they were markedly lower for probable generalized anxiety disorder in Germany (22.3%) [23] . This may be explained by differences in the tools used (GAD-2 versus GAD-7).

In particular, young adults may be confronted with challenges such as financial hardships or concerns about the future. Similar findings were made by Ranta et al. in Finland [24] . Such factors may explain their high prevalence rates. Individuals with chronic diseases may fear a potential severe course of an infection with the corona virus. Therefore, they may have comparably high prevalence rates. Moreover, individuals with a migration background may have high prevalence rates since they may be concerned about friends and relatives who may live abroad. They may fear that they cannot visit these friends and relatives in case of emergency due to potential travel restrictions. Such concerns were also described by a recent qualitative study examining different migrant groups living in Finland during the pandemic [25] . Additionally, fear due to insufficient knowledge about the coronavirus (resulting from language barriers) may also explain the comparably high prevalence rates. Apart from that, the correlates of probable major depressive disorder and probable generalized anxiety disorder (e.g., sociodemographic factors, lifestyle-related factors and health-related factors) during late summer 2021 are well in line with previous studies (e.g., [26] ). For example, previous research also demonstrated associations between cigarette smoking [27] or marital status [28] and our outcomes.",
