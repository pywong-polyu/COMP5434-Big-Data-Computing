Approaching TMPRSS2 as a therapeutic target for the inhibition of SARS-Cov-2 infection is highly promising. Hence, in the present study, we docked the binding efficacy of ten naturally available phyto compounds with known anti-viral potential with TMPRSS2. The aim is to identify the best phyto compound with a high functional affinity towards the active site of the TMPRSS2 with the aid of two different docking software. Molecular Dynamic Simulations were performed to analyse the conformational space of the binding pocket of the target protein with selected molecules.",

            "text": "The dreadful global pandemic of this century caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) has affected over 170 million people across the world. It has taken the lives of nearly 38 million people in the past 19 months [1] . Though several vaccines are being used, notable disproportions in the vaccine manufacturing rate and world population size of approximately 7.8 billion significantly limit the speed of global vaccine administration. Moreover, developing an effective vaccine with one hundred percent protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection is tricky due to the possible mutation in the spike glycoprotein of coronavirus. Moreover, all the possible mutations supported the virus to emerge as the most virulent strains in the fore coming waves [2] . Mounting studies show that people with excess viral load and other comorbidities, especially with diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD), are at high risk for COVID-19 associated mortalities [3, 4, and 5] . Thus, in the current situation identifying some methods that can either reduce or prevent the colonization and adhesion of the viruses in the lungs of humans or having the ability to increase the human immune response against viral infections would be more acceptable for the prevention of coronavirus infections.",

            "text": "The mechanism underlying COVID-19 viral entry into a host cell is now well understood. The SARS-CoV-2, the enveloped virus with a positive-sense RNA genome, is majorly composed of four structural glycoproteins, namely spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and Nucleoplasmid (Nsp) [6] . Recently it has been shown that the host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is reliant on two host proteins, such as Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) located on the surface of epithelial cells in the target organ [4, 5, and 6] . Meanwhile, all other proteins, including M, E, and Nsp are involved in the viral particle assembly release into the host cell [7, 8] . The TMPRSS2 primes the viral spike (S) protein by cleaving it at two sites and facilitates the fusion of the viral and host membrane for the smoothening of the cellular entry of viral genome with the aid of a terminal carboxypeptidase and type I transmembrane glycoprotein, ACE2 [1] . Thus, focusing on the inhibition of either ACE2 or TMPRSS2's biological functions has become more attractive targets to prevent the viral genome's entry into the host cells. Among the two proteins, inhibition of TMPRSS2 is more convincing and has recently been shown to inhibit SARS-2-S-driven access in lung cells [9] . Therefore, developing therapeutic agents targeting the inhibition of TMPRSS2 function will have a promising impact against the current and emerging coronavirus outbreaks.",

To find the best anti-viral compound against SARS-COV-2 infection, we analyzed the binding efficacy of the selected compounds with the core function site of the human TMPRSS2 using 2 different molecular docking software. The three-dimensional model of TMPRSS2 shows three domains such as an N-terminal Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor class A domain (113-148), a Scavenger Receptor Cysteine-Rich (SRCR) domain (153-246), and a C-terminal peptidase S1 Catalytic domain ranging from 256 to 487 amino acids. It has three catalytic residues, such as HIS296, ASP345, and SER441, in the C terminal serine domain. The six amino acid residues that are more important in the active site make-up of TMPRSS2 are the HIS296, ASP345, and SER441, and are located at the catalytic site (catalytic triad). The remaining three are the ASP435, SER460, and GLY462 and are located at the substrate-binding site (Additional file 1: Fig. S1 ) [11] . The model was considered to investigate the interactions between the TMPRSS2 and the selected anti-viral phyto compounds. ",

Binding energy analysis of all the ten compounds obtained from the Schr\u00f6dinger was shown in Fig. 3 .

            "text": "To assess the binding stability and interaction of Quercetin and Genistein against TMPRSS-2 receptor, the molecular dynamic simulation was performed for 50 ns with NAMDv.2.14 using the CHARMM force field parameters. The protein backbone RMSD of TMPRSS2 alone (Protein alone) and TMPRSS2-Quercetin complex (Quercetin-complex) and TMPRSS2-Genstein complex (Genistein-complex) reached convergence at 30 ns and remained stable till 50 ns (Fig. 5A) . Post-convergence, the ligand backbone RMSD of Quercetin was found to show a slight increase at 36 ns by 0.61 \u00c5 and continue to remain stable till 50 ns (Fig. 5C ). Conformational cluster analysis of Quercetin revealed that the ligand adopted two major conformation ensembles, ensemble-1 (22.6%) and ensemble-2 (54.3%) (Fig. 5D ). The structural alignment and ligand interaction analysis showed significant difference between the ensemble-1 and 2 arose due to the orientation of the 3, 4-Dihydroxyphenyl group (side group). In contrast, the orientation and interaction of the core, benzopyran-one ring, was found to remain the same in both the ensembles. In ensemble-1, the side group was protruding outside by interacting with the solvent, whereas in ensemble-2, the side group had re-oriented itself by a rotation of 84.2\u00b0around the axis to fit inside the pocket (Fig. 5D ). This increased the total number of H-bonds interactions in ensemble-2 concerning ensemble-1 (Fig. 5B) . The binding pocket's solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) plot shows that the SASA decreases over time as the ligand fits more stably inside the binding pocket (Fig. 6A) . The ligand interaction analysis plot confirms that at t = 0 ns, the side group of Quercetin is solvent-exposed, and at t = 50 ns the compound has undergone conformational rearrangement (ensemble 2) to fit inside the binding pocket (Fig. 6. B and 6 . C). The critical interacting amino acids were LYS340, THR421, LEU419, ILE420, and TRP461 with b-occupancy of 21.3%, 4.2%, 12.7%, 6.2%, and 7.8%, respectively. TRP461 and ILE420 were found to be involved in the hydrophobic and pi-pi stacking interaction. The MM-PBSA binding free energy calculated with the CaFE VMD plugin was found to be with -22.37 kcal/mol, with major energy contribution from Vander Waal (\u0394E {VdW} ) and electrostatic energies (\u0394E {Elec} ) (Fig. 6.D) . Moreover, Quercetin bound closer towards the hydrophilic catalytic site of TMPRSS2. In the case of the Genistein complex, it was observed that the ligand had exited the binding pocket after 26 ns which reflected in an abnormal deviation in the ligand backbone RMSD of Genistein. This may be due to the weak interaction formed by the Genistein with the hydrophobic substrate-binding site of TMPRSS2. To further understand this phenomenon, the iMODS webserver has been used to understand the deformable and highly mobile residues/regions of the Genistein complex. The main-chain deformability is the measure of the capability of a given molecule to deform at each of its residues under dynamic conditions. The iMODS analysis of the Genistein complex revealed that the vital interacting residues of Genistein (CYS465, GLY-465, GLY-462, and CYS-437) have high deformability (Additional file 7: Fig. S5 ). This deformability may be due to the presence of these residues in the loop region. In addition, the major portion of the benzopyran-4-one core of Genistein was exposed to the solvent and is not involved in the interaction with the protein. The weak interaction of Genistein with the loop residues might be one reason for its unstable binding against TMPRSS2. Moreover, Genistein was bound closer to the Site S2-substrate binding site, which is relatively more hydrophobic in nature. Whereas, Quercetin was bound closer to Site S1, which is hydrophilic (Additional file 8: Fig. S6) . Thus, the molecular dynamics study reveals that the compound Quercetin can be a lead molecule with more stable ligand-binding towards TMPRSS2 than Genistein and hence can be taken further to design a novel drug against the current corona virus infection.",

Moreover, the world is threatened by many waves of SARS-CoV-2 hit with much more genetic variations in the viral RNA structure. In this scenario, developing or boosting the body's self-defence system against viral attack is the right choice to prevent SARS-CoV-2 viral infections [31] . Here we performed a computational approach to identify potential anti-viral phyto molecules that could inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host cells.

The TMPRSS2 C-terminal peptidase S1 domain is anticipated to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The amino acids located at the triad of the catalytically active site (HIS296, ASP345, and SER441), and substrate binding sites (ASP435, SER460, and GLY462) are more critical for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein entry into the host cells [33] . Thus, the compounds that could bind with the mentioned core functional unit of TMPRSS2 can potentially restrict the viral access to the host cell. The molecular docking analysis supported to identify the best anti-viral phyto compounds with potential binding affinity with the substrate-binding site of TMPRSS2 protein among the chosen. Based on the scoring parameters and interaction, both Genistein (PyRx) and Quercetin (Schr\u00f6dinger) could potentially interact with the substrate binding and catalytic site amino acid residues of the TMPRSS2. In addition, the compounds also exhibited interaction with several neighboring residues of the catalytic site and highlighted the importance of neighboring residues in the establishment of the molecular complex between TMPRSS2-Genistein and TMPRSS2-Quercetin complexes [11] . Apart from this, the identification of charged residues at the intermolecular interactions and calculation of binding affinity values supported the complex's structural conformation reliability.",

Mounting studies have proven the therapeutic effects of Quercetin against various dreadful diseases, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, etc. [35, 36] . Most importantly, many in vitro and in vivo studies have supported potent antiviral properties of Quercetin [11, 37, 38] . The phytoestrogen Genistein (C 15 H 10 O 5 ) is a natural isoflavaone found abundantly in several plants, including lupin, fava beans, soybeans, kudzu, Psoralea, etc. Studies have shown that Genistein possesses enormous antiviral, anti-oxidant, and anthelmintic properties [39, 40] . Like Quercetin, Genistein is also proven to be an ideal drug to treat various dreadful viral infections, including coronaviridae, HIV, Epsein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus etc. [38, 40] . Our in silico analysis clearly shows that both Quercetin and Genistein could bind to the catalytic and substrate binding sites of TMPRSS2. Quercetin has a higher binding affinity with a -7.847 kcal/ mol binding energy towards the catalytic site, which is more hydrophilic than the substrate-binding site. On the contrary, Genistein showed higher binding energy with the substrate-binding site. This may be because the compound Quercetin (XLogP = 1.5) is more hydrophilic than Genistein (XLogP = 2.7). Overall, our research data show that both the phyto compounds inhibit the principal function of the TMPRSS2 protein and thus prevent the fusion of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome into the host cell.",

The molecular dynamics simulation reveals that the Quercetin-TMPRSS complex is stable until 50 ns and the ligand forms a stable interaction with the protein, whereas the Genistein-TMPRSS2 complex was found to suffer unstable binding. It was observed that the Quercetin binds to the S1-hydrophilic site with average MMPBSA binding free energy \u2212 22.37 kcal/mol (at 50 ns) with significant energy contribution from Vander Waal and electrostatic energies. The binding of Quercetin with TMPRSS-2 was also found to decrease the solvent-accessible surface area, indicating a better fit of molecule in the binding pocket. On the other hand, Genistein was found to bind at the S2-hydrophobic site, forming weak interactions with the loop residues and suffering unstable binding, thereby exiting from the binding pocket. This suggests that the catalytic-S1 site of TMPRSS-2, including the residues LYS340, THR421, LEU419, ILE420, and TRP461, can be a potential site for targeting and designing inhibitors. On the contrary, the ligand interaction with loop region residues in the S2-site (substrate binding site), CYS465, GLY465, GLY462, and CYS437, should be avoided to have stable binding. Therefore, Quercetin which has stable and higher binding affinity with S1-site, compared to Genistein, can be considered as a potential molecule for lead optimization and drug development. The ability of Quercetin to exhibit a strong binding affinity with the core functional unit of TMPRSS2 indicates that the compound can effectively inhibit the binding of the virus with the host TMPRSS2 receptor and thereby prevent the viral genome entry into the host cells.",

Considering all the possibilities of today's pandemic scenario, depending on naturally occurring substances continue to be one of the primary sources of preventing the infectious rate of SARS-CoV-2. Centuries ago, it was proved that a healthy food intake positively influences a person's health, and instead of pills, functional foods can be consumed as part of a regular diet. Improving our natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through consuming healthy foods rich in phyto compounds, especially with anti-viral activities, is the safest and easier way to fight against all kinds of coronavirus infection, including the present global pandemic SARS-CoV-2 spread. In the present study, the molecular docking analysis prioritized Quercetin and Genistein as the best phyto compounds against SARS-Cov-2 infection based on the interaction energy with the binding site of TMPRSS2. But when compared to the Genistein ability, the compound Quercetin has the strongest binding affinity with the core functional unit of TMPRSS2. Hence, the analysis concludes that the phyto compound Quercetin can be used as an effective lead molecule to control the novel coronavirus-2 entry into the human cells. Further studies have to be carried",

The figure shows the binding site of Genistein (ligand in black) and Quercetin (ligand in red) with TMPRSS2. The binding site surface mesh was coloured based on the hydrophobicity index. Genistein was bound closer to the site S2-substrate binding site, which is relatively more hydrophobic than the S1 region. Quercetin was bound closer to towards site S1 catalytic region, which is hydrophilic.",
