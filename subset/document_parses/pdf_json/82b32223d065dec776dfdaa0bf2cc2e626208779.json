To explore the factors important in LSC-mediated resistance, we use mass spectrometry to screen the factors related to LSC chemoresistance and defined IFN-\u03b3-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) as a candidate. We found that the GILT expression was upregulated in chemoresistant CD34+ AML cells. Loss of function studies demonstrated that silencing of GILT in AML cells sensitized them to Ara-C treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic findings revealed that the ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage plays a pivotal role in inducing apoptosis of GILT-inhibited AML cells after Ara-C treatment. The inactivation of PI3K/Akt/ nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway, causing reduced generation of antioxidants such as SOD2 and leading to a shifted ratio of GSH/GSSG to the oxidized form, contributed to the over-physiological oxidative status in the absence of GILT. The prognostic value of GILT was also validated in AML patients. Taken together, our work demonstrated that the inhibition of GILT increases AML chemo-sensitivity through elevating ROS level and induce oxidative mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis, and inhibition of the PI3K/ Akt/NRF2 pathway enhances the intracellular oxidative state by disrupting redox homeostasis, providing a potentially effective way to overcome chemoresistance of AML.",

[6] The dysregulation of ROS, small molecules that are overproduced upon stress response such as chemotherapeutic drugs, [7] [8] [9] [10] has been described in many malignant diseases. [11] Large amounts of ROS can oxidize DNA, protein and lipids, inducing cell death. [12] In fact, cancer stem cells (CSCs) generally maintain a relatively low ROS level compared with the bulk cancer cells and the low ROS level in CSC was related to chemoresistance and disease recurrence. [13] Strikingly, previous studies found that ROS-low cells have higher engraftment potential and are LSC-enriched, indicating that regulation of intracellular ROS is critical for LSC to maintain proliferative capacities. [14] [15] [16] [17] However, whether the low ROS level in LSC was responsible for therapeutic resistance and the underlying mechanism have not been fully investigated. Disruption of cellular redox hemostasis of LSC may provide a potential way to sensitize them to chemotherapeutic agents.",

[18] The ablation of GILT in fibroblasts and T cells led to oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased production of ROS with decreased expression of antioxidants such as SOD2 and reduced glutathione (GSH). [19] [20] [21] In addition, it has been indicated that after treating relapsed/refractory AML patients with MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine), GILT showed significantly differential expression between responding and resistant patients. [22] However, whether GILT plays roles in the chemoresistance of LSC remains unclear. Although the surface markers of LSC are still controversial, leukemia stem cells have been found to be enriched in the CD34+ compartment [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] and CD34+ LSC are generally served as leukemic progenitors. [29] In this study, we screened a factor GILT that was upregulated in LSCenriched CD34+ chemoresistant AML cells through mass spectrometry. Our data confirmed that the knockdown of GILT by genetic silencing, producing a higher level of ROS and resulting in mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, enhanced the sensitivity of AML cells to Ara-C treatment both in vitro and in vivo. The PI3K/Akt/NRF2 pathway was remarkably inhibited in GILT-inhibited cells, which in turn, the antioxidant level was reduced, and this possibly contributes to this unbalanced redox state. Finally, we found that low GILT expression at diagnosis is associated with a better prognosis of AML.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence shows that LSCs are resistant to chemotherapy and are responsible for leukemia relapse. [34] [35] [36] In order to investigate the critical factors attributed to LSC-related chemoresistance, we collected the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 24 AML patients (Table S1 ) at diagnosis including 16 high responders and 8 low responders (cohort 1). Patients grouped in high responders showed CR after the first intensive chemotherapy, with low responders defined as failing to achieve CR. Then the LSC-enriched CD34+ progenitors were isolated from BMMCs, followed by comparison of the protein levels in CD34+ cells between high and low responders using proteome analysis (Fig 1A) . All the raw data were first processed using a double boundary Bayes imputation method (Fig S1A-S1B) and were standardized for further analysis (Fig S2A-S2D) . Our data showed a clear stratification among different cohorts according to the principal component analysis (Fig S3A-S3B) . We identified 6889 proteins in these samples, among which 237 proteins were significantly upregulated and 184 proteins were downregulated, in low responders compared with high responders (Fig 1B-1C ). Next, we explored the publicly available database GSE52919, a mRNA expression profile comparing transcript levels between Ara-C-resistant and Ara-C-sensitive leukemia blasts, to further find mediators that are associated with chemoresistance. [37] We found that among 237 upregulated proteins in low responders, 33 proteins were upregulated in Ara-C resistant leukemic blasts comparing with Ara-C resistant group (Fig 1D) , while 11 among 184 downregulated proteins were found that are overlapped with factors expressed at higher level in Ara-C resistant group (Fig S4A) . Considering that chemotherapy reshapes the LSCs that alter their metabolic status to survive, we designed cohort 2 (Fig. 1A) , with 3 patients (Table S1 ) providing paired samples taken at diagnosis and at the time of confirmation that fails to achieve CR. Only 3 samples in cohort 1 met the requirement that more than 20% blasts and at least 20% CD34+ cells present in the BM samples were analyzed in cohort 2. The protein alterations of LSC-enriched CD34+ cells before (therapy-na\u00efve) and after (chemo-reshaped and more resistant) chemotherapy were analyzed using the same way (Fig S1C-S1D, FigS3C-S3D ) to identify the changes in LSCs in response to chemotherapy. The differential expressions of above-mentioned 33 upregulated and 11 downregulated factors were further validated in cohort 2 by showing a heatmap (Fig 1D-1E, Fig S4A-4B) . No factor among 11 downregulated proteins was found to show a consistent alteration in cohort 2 (Fig S4B) . Seven among the 33 upregulated factors were screened that were consistently increased in CD34+ progenitors after chemotherapy, including CKAP4, ECHDC3, FCGR3A, HMOX1, GNPDA1, NFKB and IFI30 (Fig 1E) . The mRNA levels of these seven upregulated genes were further validated in six paired samples (Fig 1F and Fig S4C) . We next focused on the role of IFI30-encoded GILT in chemoresistance of AML since the association of GILT and AML chemoresistance has not yet been deeply studied. To further confirm that GILT expression is associated with Ara-C resistance, primary CD34+ cells were cultured with and without Ara-C in vitro. Consistent with our previous data, GILT was upregulated in response to Ara-C treatment (Fig 1G) . Similar results were also seen in AML cell lines such as MOLM13 and U937 cells both in mRNA and protein levels (Fig S5A-S5D) . Taken together, these results strongly revealed that chemoresistant AML CD34+ progenitor cells elevated GILT expression, indicating that GILT may be a key factor of LSC to attenuate chemo-cytotoxicity.

The results showed that the highest expression of GILT was detected in MOLM13 and U937 cell lines (Fig  2A) , and the value of IC50 positively correlated with the GILT level in cell line (Fig S6A-6B) . Consequently, we used lentivirus-transfected shRNAs to silence the GILT expression in MOLM13 and U937. The two shRNAs efficiently decreased the GILT level (Fig 2B-2D) . Different doses of Ara-C were added to GILT-deficient AML cells and their negative control (NC) counterparts, and apoptosis and cell growth assays were performed. The percentage of viable cells were significantly lower in cells with GILT deletion than control group, indicating that GILT knocking-down enhanced the cellular apoptosis induced by Ara-C treatment (Fig 2E-2F) . Furthermore, knocking down of GILT led to a significant reduction of 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) comparing with the NC group in both cell lines (Fig 2G-2H) , implying that deletion of GILT sensitized AML cells to Ara-C. Concomitant elevation of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, mediators that are activated during apoptosis, were also detected in GILT-silencing cells by western blot, which could further confirm our results (Fig 2I) . In addition, we also explored whether the deletion of GILT could enhance the sensitivity to daunorubicin (DOX), another first line-used chemotherapeutic agent treating AML. Although there is no significant correlation between the DOX IC50 and GILT level in AML cell lines (Fig S6C-6D) , the cell apoptosis analysis showed that the GILT deletion could also improve daunorubicin sensitivity (Fig 2J-2K) , confirming the role of GILT in chemoresistance. Taken together, all these results indicate that GILT (K-L) The ratio of GSH/GSSG (upper panel) and NADPH/NADP (lower panel) was measured by the corresponding kits, and reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratios and NADPH/NADP ratios were analyzed in two modified AML cell lines.

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that GILT ablation in fibroblasts and T cells led to increased production of cellular ROS. [19] [20] [21] ROS is well known to play a crucial role in the regulation and induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. and modulating ROS levels render leukemia cells more susceptible to chemotherapy due to the distinct metabolic signatures of AML LSCs and blast cells compared to their normal counterparts. [15, [38] [39] [40] [41] To ask whether inhibition of GILT in AML cells could elevate the ROS levels in the aim of sensitizing them to Ara-C treatment, the cellular ROS level were measured by CellROX staining prior to flow cytometry analysis. The results demonstrated that two AML cell lines with GILT knockdown increased cellular ROS level upon Ara-C treatment ( Fig   3A-3C) . The cellular ROS levels showed no significantly alteration in the MOLM13, with a slight elevation in the U937 cell line without addition of Ara-C (Fig 3A-3C) . Moreover, as mitochondria are the main source of ROS generation, we also used the MitoSOX staining probe to analyze the mitochondrial ROS levels in the two AML cell lines. The two AML cell lines with GILT knocking down showed obvious increased mitochondrial ROS levels relative to the NC group both before and after Ara-C treatment (Fig 3D-3F) , indicating that the elevation of cellular ROS level is perhaps mainly derived from mitochondria. Next, considering that mitochondria are also the primary targets of ROS damage, tetramethyl rhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) was added to judge the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the MitoTracker probe was used to detect the mitochondrial mass upon Ara-C stimulation. Our data showed that compared with the NC group, loss of MMP and mitochondrial mass was more apparent in GILT-deleted cells with Ara-C treatment ( Fig  3G-3I, Fig 3J-3K) . Then we pretreated the AML cells with the N-acetyl NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgttm1Vst/Vst (NPG) mice were injected with MOLM13-shNC or MOLM13-shGILT#2 cells (5\u00d710 5 cells) via tail vein. Ara-C (80 mg/kg) or PBS were used on Day 7, Day 8 and Day 9 by intraperitoneal injection. Kaplan-Meier plots for overall survival is shown in (A) (n=8). At Day 23 (Day 16 post-Ara-C therapy), the mice were sacrificed, and the tumor burden was measured by detection of double-positive (GFP/human CD45) cells in BM (n=5) (B). and the spleen size (C) and the tumor infiltration in BM, spleen and liver (D) of three mice from the Ara-C treated group were also assessed after euthanasia.

NAC prevented the Ara-C induced loss of MMP, indicating that GILT down-expression could cause ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage, and this could be rescued by ROS inhibitor (Fig  3G-3I) . We next investigated whether loss of MMP caused by excessive ROS generation could further induce the cell apoptosis. In line with the mitochondrial performance, GILT deficiency led to increased apoptosis in the context of Ara-C, and NAC pretreatment reversed the enhanced apoptosis induced by GILT suppression, illustrating that NAC inhibited the ROS-mediated pro-apoptotic effects by Ara-C (Fig 3L-3M ). It is worth to point out that NAC alone was unable to influence apoptosis of AML cells as there was no significantly different apoptotic rate between the two groups with and without NAC pretreatment (Fig 3L-3M) . Taken together, in the face of Ara-C, AML cells devoid of GILT over-produce ROS, and excessive ROS damage mitochondrial membrane potential, which in turn, promotes cell death.",

Additionally, western blot results illustrating the level of Akt, phosphorylated AKT, PI3K and phosphorylated PI3K also confirmed the inhibition of this pathway ( Fig  4H) . SOD2, an antioxidant typically downstream of NRF2, [43] decreased in the absence of GILT, indicating an unbalance redox state (Fig 4J) .

Next, to examine whether GILT expression had a prognostic significance in AML, we detected the GILT level of AML patients at diagnosis. The samples were divided into high and low GILT expression, with transcript expression levels \u226575% (relative expression to GAPDH \u226510.37%) and \u226425% detected percentage (relative expression to GAPDH\u22640.91%) defined as high and low GILT expression, respectively.

We compared the protein levels of CD34+ LSC-enriched BMMCs of high and low responders through high-accuracy mass spectrometry. To our knowledge, the present study is the first research using a mass spectrometry-based DIA quantitative proteomic approach to screen the factors in LSCs contributing to the poor prognosis. The chemoresistant AML cells (data from GSE52919) upregulates certain gene expressions and 33 of them were shared with upregulated proteins in low responders. The 33 factors were shown in the heatmap (Fig 1E) , some of which have been abundantly studied as increasing research delved deeply into topics of LSC-corresponded chemoresistance. A recently published project illustrated that CD9, a potential biomarker of LSC population, is able to induce chemo-resistant characteristic of LSCs. [47] In addition, previous studies have reported that HMOX1 (HO-1), MTSS1, SLC2A3 (Glut3) and CSF3R (CD114) were important factors expressed in cancer stem cells, and these proteins play critical roles in chemoresistance. [48] [49] [50] [51] These studies further confirmed that our screen strategy is credible and reasonable to search for the factors related to LSC chemoresistance. Despite recent interest in this topic, the role of GILT in AML chemoresistance is still not in hand. To further validate that, the GILT level was compared in CD34+ progenitors extracted from 3 individuals who failed to achieve CR taken at the time before and after the first induction chemotherapy, respectively. GILT showed an increasing trend of expression in persisting LSC-enriched CD34+ cells, as compared with preexisting ones. Previous report has shown the association between GILT expression and treatment response of glioblastoma. [52] On top of that, few studies shed light on the involvement of GILT in chemoresistance of tumors. Loss-of-function studies confirmed that AML cells deleted with GILT were more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. Here, our work is the first to demonstrate that GILT inhibition attenuate chemoresistance in AML cells both in vitro and in vivo.",

[41, [53] [54] [55] Furthermore, targeting LSC metabolism has become an emerging approach to the development of new chemotherapeutic regimens as the idea concerning that LSCs and bulk leukemia blasts have distinguished metabolic strategy. It has been shown that ROS-low LSCs are more sensitive to BCL-2 inhibitor because they are unable to preserve energy supplies in response to BCL-2 inhibition, with the underlying mechanisms pointing to the impaired oxidative phosphorylation in ROS-low LSCs that lack a compensatory energy production from glycolysis. [15] The LSCs are benefit from the intracellular ROS-low environment in which they can alleviate internal and external stress to support their proliferation. [56] The most common stress the tumor cells encounter was chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and therefore increasing recognition of resistance by ROS-low LSCs comes to attention. One study demonstrated that the prostate CSC has increased survival potential after ionizing radiation due to the ability to recede oxidative stress and to refrain from ROS-induced damage. [57] Another study showed a naturally occurring small molecule named parthenolide (PTL) triggered LSC-specific apoptosis through increasing ROS production to disrupt the redox homeostasis, [39] All the studies indicate that perturbation of ROS-related pathways in LSC may be an effective strategy to eradicate the highly chemo-resistant tumor population. In line with these studies, here, we demonstrated that GILT inhibition could improve treatment response of AML by promoting excessive production of ROS, leading to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and strengthened Ara-C-induced apoptosis, further providing novel insights that regulation of GILT-mediated redox metabolism might overcome chemoresistance of LSCs.",

[45] The excessive ROS is as a result of increased ROS production or declined ROS scavenging systems. NRF2, a transcriptional factor that promotes the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, has been identified as a vital mediator of ROS eradication. [43] There has been much discussion about the role of PI3K/Akt/NRF2 pathway in chemoresistance for its effect on promoting cancer survival by conferring protection against excessive oxidative stress. [58] [59] [60] An attractive therapeutic prospect of perturbing redox homeostasis in tumors points to target PI3K/Akt/NRF2 signaling to re-sensitize cancer cells and attenuate chemoresistance. A good example for that is a study by, Liu et al who reported the Diosmetin-induced apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in which ROS was accumulated via inhibition of PI3K/Akt/NRF2 pathway. [61] In the present research, our results showed that this axis was repressed in GILT ablation group following Ara-C treatment, promoting an increased understanding of the role of PI3K/Akt/NRF2 pathway in the regulation of ROS-mediated chemoresistance.",

GILT knockdown facilitates disturbance of redox homeostasis of AML cell by (i) enhancing Ara-C-stimulated ROS overproduction, (ii) reducing antioxidant level which is associated with inactivation of the P13K/Akt/NRF2 axis. The resulting severe oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial damage and apoptosis.",
