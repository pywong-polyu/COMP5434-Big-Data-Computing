Among vector control techniques space vector proportional-integral (PI), direct-torque control (DTC), field-oriented control (FOC), model-predictive control (MPC) are being widely used in industries. But their limitations have urged researchers to develop more advance techniques. In this paper, a new technique learning and adaptive model -based predictive control (termed as LAMPC) is proposed for the vector control of three phase induction motor. In the proposed method, the dynamic model of induction motor is updated adaptively based on prediction (receding horizon principle) for the inner control loop (current control) while the brain emotional learning-based intelligent controller (BELIC) is used for the outer control loop (speed control). The proposed methodology offers desired dynamic response, precise tracking, good disturbance handling capability along with satisfactory steady-state performance.",

            "text": "Induction motors are among the most widely utilized electric motors in industries due to their robustness, better efficiency, and lower maintenance. However, the control of induction motor is relatively complex task because of its nonlinear torque speed curve. In general, the control strategies of induction motors are broadly classified as scalar control and vector control [1] . Scalar control uses a simple and more direct approach for controlling the speed of induction motor. However, these techniques cannot be used with systems having dynamic behavior. The scalar techniques of induction motor control are variable supply voltage control, variable rotor resistance, and constant voltage/HZ control [1] . The scalar methods have fol-lowing inherent flaws. Firstly, the equivalent model applied with three-phase sinusoidal wave is based on steady state analysis. This could induce the high spikes of voltage and current in the system during the transient period, which could potentially reduce the overall power conversion efficiency [1] . Moreover, the control design should compensate these additional transients by increasing the size of power components [2] . Secondly, the control of three-phase circuit looks like three separate single-phase circuits, instead of single three-phase circuit. Therefore, the three-phase sinusoidal reference variables are difficult to control by PI controllers because they would distort the sinusoidal reference [3] . Thirdly, the torque and speed are interdependent on each other [4] and lastly, the poor dynamic performance is observed [5] .",

            "text": "On the other hand, vector control techniques [1] overcome the above shortcomings of classical drives by incorporating some advanced mathematical techniques. The control of induction motor could be modeled as that of DC machine by transformation of three phase time variant into two phase time invariant system by mathematical transformations like Clark (conversion of balanced three phase quantities into time variant and balanced two phase quantities) and Park (balanced two phase orthogonal system into orthogonal rotating reference frame) [6] . The precise control of machine in both steady state and transient regions could improve the dynamic performance of induction machine [7] . The widely used field-oriented control (FOC) technique is precisely based on this concept [2] and therefore, offers better performance during start and steady-state operation but at the expense of computational cost [8] . Lower robustness is another main issue associated with the FOC's mathematical framework [9] . In comparison, direct-torque control (DTC) is other established technique which is known for its simple structure and fast dynamic response [10] and therefore, highly suitable for lower performance applications [8] . The major limitations of DTC are sluggish response (during start and steady state) and lower steady-state performance. However, improved algorithms have been developed in the control arena such as DTC-SVM, Modified Direct Torque Control and 12-sector DTC to improve the performance of DTC [11] . Similarly, PI-control based designs for vector control applications [12] are also developed but those are relatively simple and possess many limitations ranging from static gains, parametric dependency, linearity and associated trade-offs [13] . Alternatively, many non-linear control-based approaches are being extended towards the induction motor control to address these limitations namely, but not limited to the backstepping control [14] , sliding mode control [15] , finite control set -model predictive control (FCS-MPC) [16] . Usually, model-driven techniques, for instance, FCS-MPC involves estimation of the unmeasured variables using measured variables, prediction of the future outputs of the system using its model, optimization of the control signal using cost function and lastly, the inverter switching (applying the optimal voltage vector to induction motor). Therefore, the modified techniques enhances the results and performance by addressing the limitations or shortcomings of these parts, but also increases the complexity of algorithm, model dependency, sensitivity and computational cost [17] .",

In these AI or evolutionary computing-based approaches, critic (AI agent) constantly evaluates the outcome of actuations based on overall performance which in turn enables controller to learn online and gain required intelligence. Brain emotional learningbased intelligent controller (BELIC) was one such approach that adopted the computational model for mimicking the emotion producing brain's parts such as sensory cortex, amygdala, thalamus and orbitofrontal cortex [21] . BELIC can be categorized into direct or indirect approach based on their usage [22] . In indirect approach, BELIC tunes the parameter of the required controller whereas, direct method of BELIC itself acts as a controller. This emotion based reinforcement learning approach is also being utilized in decision support systems, control engineering problems, robotics and obtaining refined results [21, 23] .

            "text": "Recently, enhanced cascaded approaches are being explored for induction motor control. In [25] , the authors have reported significant improvement in performance through cascaded GPIO-PCC approach over conventional PI-PCC. The relative improvement is due to the inclusion of disturbance observer-based PI controller in outer loop which allows precise computation of reference current values which in turn allows inner predictive current control loop to yield better results. The proposed work has also taken cascaded approach but on contrary, the proposed method combines the benefit of both modeldriven [26] and model-free [19] methodologies through forming a hybrid of direct BELIC and adaptive MPC for the vector control problem of Induction motor. Specifically, the outer-loop of proposed control methodology is model-free in nature, therefore, incorporates the high auto-learning rate, simple structure and independency from motor or other parameters. However, unlike [19] which also uses BELIC in inner current control loop, the proposed methodology utilizes adaptive MPC in inner loop. This cascaded structure is selected mainly due to two reasons: 1) BELIC computational complexity makes it infeasible to use in high-speed current control loop, there-fore, as the outer-loop bandwidth is much lower than that of the internal-loop, BELIC is only used in outer-loop of the proposed methodology. 2) For inner loop current control, predictive control methodologies are well-established techniques due to their inherent stability, higher flexibility and relatively better performances especially for motor control applications [1, 27] . Therefore, this proposed architecture fundamentally utilizes MPC in current control loop but augment it with features such as adaptation, skipping model update, partial pre-computation and varying receding horizon as per given the vector control problem of induction motor (discussed in Section 3). Moreover, the performance of proposed controller is compared with the conventional schemes through simulation results benchmarked with specified criteria to further validate the proposed methodology presented.",

As the MPC performance is model dependent and induction motor model is highly non-linear in nature, there always exists a trade-off between performance and computational burden. Therefore, this paper presents a way of dealing with non-linearity associated with the model through successive linearization at each control instant and then feeding it into the adaptive MPC. Thus, this provides better performance as evident from results, and is also less computationally expensive in-comparison to conventional MPC. Moreover, the proposed technique ingeniously incorporates few additional features to resolve excessive computation problem as discussed in the following paragraphs. The proposed technique along with previously discussed BELIC block is shown in Fig. 2 to supplement the theoretical details.

Moreover, MPC computational complexity and performance are directly associated with the lengths of prediction (p) and control (m) horizons [33] . Therefore, performance and stability can be enhanced by increasing 'p' and 'm' which in turn increase memory requirement, solution and computation time [26, 33] .

Numerical solution methods of quadratic programming such as Interior-point, Active-set and Trust-Region methods are equally applicable to the given optimization problem. However, an active-set approach is chosen in this work primarily due to its higher reliability, robustness and data-efficiency [35] . Active-set method decides active set of constraints based on KKT conditions [36] . The MATLAB quadprog toolbox is being utilized as solver for quadratic optimization.

The data of stator currents of all discussed techniques are acquired and then analyzed in MATLAB using fast Fourier analysis (FFT) for THD present in stator currents. It can be clearly seen that proposed technique i.e., LAMPC has the least current THD in both low-speed and high-speed operations i.e., 1.32% and 1.61%, respectively. The Table 3 summarizes as well as presents the basic qualitative comparison of transient, steady-state and THD of all discussed techniques. As far as the textual topological assessment and comparison of discussed techniques are concerned, the theoretical basis for elevated performance of proposed controller are explained here. In this regard, the absence of current regulation loop, control realization through predefined switching table and hysteresis comparators are the key differences of DTC. This control formulation requires less computation that limits control resolution and hinders quiescent state operation i.e., steady-state performance deterioration (error fluctuates between hysteresis band as evident from Fig. 11 ). The adjustment in hysteresis band gap can be made to alter error tolerance and average switch- The main benefit of predictive control methodologies is their added flexibility in the form of cost function. Additional control sub-objectives can be added in FCS (\u03b1\u03b2 ), FCS (dq) and LAMPC by modifying the cost function such as common-mode voltage reduction, constraints minimization, switching behavior etc. However, LAMPC provides additional flexibility than the other two in the form of model adaptation, provision of inherent constraint minimization, online horizon scheduling and auto-learning as discussed in Section 2.
