NT-proBNP has been shown to predict short-term and long-term mortality in patients with pneumonia. [13] [14] [15] Critically ill patients with pneumonia have elevated NT-proBNP concentration in the intensive care unit setting. 14 Hence, NT-proBNP can be used for the risk-stratification purpose in patients without chronic heart failure. Indeed, NT-proBNP has also been shown to be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with sepsis and ARDS. 16 17 Hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in patients with pneumonia may increase ventricular wall stress and leads to the release of NT-proBNP. 18 The use of vasopressor in critically ill patients may also contribute further to the wall stress. 14 Presence of renal failure in critically ill patients may also impair NT-proBNP clearance. 19 20 Pneumonia is postulated to cause relative ischaemia, sympathetic upregulation, systemic inflammation and direct pathogen-mediated damage to the cardiovascular system. 18 Furthermore, pneumonia has been shown to increase short-term and long-term risk of cardiovascular disease, bridging the aforementioned hypothesis. 21 A similar mechanism may underlie NT-proBNP elevation in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia; this meta-analysis only demonstrates the short-term outcome, follow-up is needed for the longer term outcome. NT-proBNP is postulated to increase the risk of heart failure in patients with COVID-19. 22 A meta-analysis showed that elevated troponin increased the risk for mortality and become a possible confounder in the analysis. 23 Nevertheless, the current meta-analysis also showed the possibility that NT-proBNP was independently associated with mortality after adjustment to troponin and creatine kinase myocardial band.",
