The repercussions of this pandemic extend beyond the direct effect of the virus itself as other services contemporaneously adapt to this new challenge. John F. Kennedy may have infamously misinterpreted the Chinese symbol for crisis simultaneously representing danger and opportunity but the sentiment perseveres and it is well recognised in the field of economics that crises do induce reform [1] . The work environment in which orthopaedic surgeons now practice has shifted rapidly and is ever-evolving. We propose this will serve as a catalyst for changing our clinical practice in the future in a way that will ultimately improve patient care. We examine the changes that have been introduced to streamline the foot and ankle service in our hospital in light of the current crisis and the underlying evidence for these changes.",

Whatsapp is the most popular of these applications worldwide, although there are limited guidelines regarding its use for sensitive patient data, compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and concerns have been raised regarding the security of its end-to-end encryption system [3, 4] . Our service recently established a formal referral pathway between the emergency department and the orthopaedic service using Siilo, an IMA marketed as a GDPR-compliant alternative to Whatsapp [5] . Referrals containing a brief history and relevant imaging are sent into a Siilo group, which includes both orthopaedic and emergency medicine consultants. This multimedia evolution from the preceding pager system allows rapid, consultant lead decisionmaking, minimising the time between referral and a final management decision and serves as a quality assurance mechanism for resident decisions documented in the group. It also facilitates immediate input from sub-specialist interest groups when required without recourse for attending an additional outpatient appointment. Another positive reverberation has been the reduced congestion at emergency department workstations and computers due to an overall decrease in human traffic. Use of digital referral pathways are supported by a strong evidence base in a number of different specialties [6, 7] . They markedly reduce response times to referrals [8] , and allow specialist treatment advice be relayed to remote sites [9] .",

Our current healthcare environment has seen us expand our VFC criteria to include all new referrals from both outside and within our institution and to include follow-up for patients who previously would have been seen at in-hospital clinics. Should imaging be necessary this can be arranged at a local unit and reviewed remotely on the national integrated medical imaging system (NIMIS). Our new criteria have reduced clinic attendance from a mean of 68 to fewer than 10 patients in the 4 weeks since stringent national measures were introduced to \"flatten the curve\" of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We conduct outpatient follow-up at 1 week for compression bandage change, 2 weeks for compression bandage change and suture removal and 6 weeks to perform a check X-ray and remove the controlled ankle movement (CAM) boot if appropriate. Further follow-up is arranged as needed. However, on the basis of a number of recent articles we have now curtailed routine follow-up X-rays after operative fixation of ankle fractures. Van Gerven et al. found only 1.2% of 1174 radiographs booked routinely for 528 patients post ankle ORIF resulted in changes to management [17] . Instead, we use focused imaging as indicated by patient symptoms or signs. The need for routine follow-up of wounds is maintained and Ovaska et al. found that only 37% of wound complications presented with an unscheduled visit. [21] However, our practice of only using removable CAM splints mitigates cast-related complications and will allow virtual or public health nurse woundassessment. We are in the process of setting-up remote wound assessment as proposed in \"The journal of the American College of Surgeons\" in 2018 who outlined a specific protocol for vascular surgery patients who took photographs and dressed wounds at home [18] .",

Our review of the evidence suggests that a supervised rehabilitation programme confers no additional benefits for both operative and non-operative groups after immobilisation for isolated ankle fractures when compared to physiotherapy advise alone [19] .
