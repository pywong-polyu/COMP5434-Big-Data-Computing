            "text": "An infection outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus has proliferated rapidly around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease as COVID-19 [1, 2] . The pathogen was named SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) [3] . The pathogen has resulted in 225,488,491 COVID-19 cases and 4,644,376 deaths worldwide as of September 13, 2021 , posing a significant challenge to public health worldwide [4] . Furthermore, because SARS-CoV-2 keeps on circulating, the chances of mutations in the virus also increases. The recent delta variant with Pango lineage as AY.1, AY.2, AY.3, and B.1.617.2 was first identified in India in April-May 2021 [5] . The spike protein substitutions for the delta variant are T19R, (V70F*), T95I, G142D, E156-, F157-, R158G, (A222V*), (W258L*), (K417N*), L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, and D950N [5] . The lineage proliferated quickly and demonstrated somewhat partial resistance to existing vaccines. The variant pushed the confirmed cases in India to 400,000 plus a day [6] . On June 15, 2021, it was declared as a variant of concern (VOC) [7, 8] . According to a recent study published in the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, \"viral loads in Delta infections are [about] 1,000 times higher\" than those caused by prior SARS-CoV-2 variants [9] . In such situations (virus mutations), existing vaccines may prove to be somewhat less effective against new strains. To guard against these mutations, the only option is to either adjust the composition of the existing vaccines or produce new vaccines [10] .",

They are enveloped viruses with extremely long single-stranded RNA genomes ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length [11] and their structure is similar to that of known CoVs. Almost 2/3 of the 5 genome region is constituted by orf1ab genes that encode orf1ab polyproteins. In contrast, 1/3 of 3 is formed by genes that encode the structural proteins, i.e., envelope-E, surface-S, nucleocapsid-N, and membrane-M [12] . In a study conducted by Lineburg and colleagues [13] , it has been found that SARS-CoV-2 consists of 26 viral proteins. Among them are some surface proteins, such as spike-S protein, and others are more conserved and internal, i.e., nucleocapsid-N protein. The sequence conservation of non-surface proteins qualifies them as prime vaccine targets for cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell activation.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers both innate and adaptive immune responses [14] . Viruses are generally detected and processed by antigen-presenting cells. The CD4+ T cells primarily differentiate into effector cells that release cytokines and chemokines after T-cell activation; cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are essential players in the immune response to viral infections because they directly participate in viral clearance [15] . T cells have been shown to be the target structural proteins of coronaviruses and are implicated in immunopathological lung damage in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [16, 17] . Identification of viral T-cell epitopes on human leukocyte antigens (HLA) is required to characterize T-cell immunity and develop vaccines and immunotherapies [18, 19] . T-cell activation occurs when SARS-CoV-2 peptides are recognized on the infected cell surface via a HLA (human leukocyte antigen) molecule [20] . A large international effort is still underway to devise different strategies to fully contain coronavirus infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and control the virus mutations. Thus, it becomes vital to apply an epitope-based peptide vaccine development approach that is cost-effective, safe, and takes less time compared to inactivated vaccine, live-attenuated vaccine, and viral vector vaccine approaches. To design an epitope-based peptide vaccine, it is essential to identify and select T-cell epitopes which are antigenic. With ML techniques the T-cell epitopes can be predicted with high accuracy. It would also save more physical experimental time and effort for speedy vaccine development compared to wet-lab techniques. This study proposes an ensemble machine learning model to predict T-cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The predicted T-cell epitopes can act as potential vaccine targets for developing an epitope-based peptide vaccine against this pathogen.",

            "text": "According to the literature, researchers started using machine learning methods reasonably quickly once the initial genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 became public in early 2020 to recommend T-cell epitopes which are antigenic in nature as potential vaccine candidates against this pathogen [21] . In their study, Naz et al. [22] have reported a collection of SARS-CoV epitopes (T and B cell) from the spike and nucleocapsid protein parts by taking into consideration the scientifically proven fact that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are genetically very similar. As per their study, the epitopes screened using existing bioinformatics tools can help experimental efforts in developing a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Grifoni et al. [23] , in their study, have retrieved peptide sequences of SARS-CoV from the IEDB [24] repository because SARS-CoV-2 has high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV [22] . Later, a number of candidate B-and T-cell epitopes were identified for SARS-CoV-2 using bioinformatics-based prediction tools. The predicted epitopes could act as potential vaccine targets and help design an effective vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In their work, Baruah et al. [25] have used immunoinformatics to identify prominent B-cell and (Cytotoxic T lymphocyte) CTL epitopes from surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their associated MHC class I supertypes were further explored using molecular dynamics simulations. From the surface glycoprotein of the virus, five (05) CTL, three (03) sequential, and five (05) discontinuous B-cell epitopes were identified. Some of the identified epitopes have been considered as suitable candidates for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. In their study, [22] have explored the spike protein to identify epitopes that are immunogenic for epitope-based vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2. Two portions, i.e., S1, S2 of the spike protein, were later analyzed and two vaccine constructs were prioritized with B-and T-cell epitopes. The epitopes so prioritized have been modelled using adjuvants and linkers by creating their 3D models to assess their physicochemical properties and possible interaction with HLA, ACE2, and TLR2, as well as TLR4. In their study, Crooke et al. [26] have established a computational approach for analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identified probable B-and T-cell epitopes utilizing several open-source web tools and algorithms. After applying the defined computational approach, a total of forty-one (41) and six (6) B-and T-cell epitopes were identified. These epitopes could act as potential targets for designing the peptide-based vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Dong et al. [27] , in their study, attempted to build a multi-epitope vaccine for treatment and prevention of COVID-19 using immunoinformatics methods. The epitopes were computed by using B cells, CTLs, and (Helper T lymphocytes) HTLs of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. By combining the B-cell, CTL, and HTL epitopes with linkers, a vaccine was finally devised. The EAAAK linker was used to attach the 45-mer peptide sequence, called \u03b2 -defensin and pan-HLA binding peptide (13aa), to the vaccine's N-terminus to improve immunogenicity.",

Few studies have also used algorithms specific to HLA-I, namely, NetCTL1.2 [39] and Net_Chop [40] , where extra intracellular variables responsible for presentation of HLA antigen were integrated to improve the prediction accuracy of binding the peptide HLA. The methods NetCTL-1.2 [39] and NetChop [40] have also been utilized by few studies where extra intracellular variables have been integrated, which are responsible for presenting HLA antigen. The main aim was to improve the prediction accuracy of peptide HLA binding. It is essential to mention here that almost all modern T-cell epitope prediction systems use artificial neural networks (ANNs). A few early ones (such as RANKPEP [41] and CTLPred [42] ) used a different ML approach, support vector machines (SVMs). Meyers et al. [43] , in their study, have identified T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 using immunoinformatics based methods by taking onto account T cell epitopes from envelope, membrane, and spike portions of the pathogen having maximum potential HLA binding. Other factors used for selecting T-cell epitopes were HLA diversity and circulating virus coverages as well as \"minimum cross-reactivity with self\". To identify CD8 T-cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteome which are mutationally constrained, Nathan et al. [44] , in their study, have used a structure-based analysis of network and assessments of class I HLA sequences stability. These findings identify mutationally restricted areas and epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome which are immunogenic and that could be used to develop a global T cell-based vaccination against new variants and SARS-like coronaviruses.",

Few duplicate entries were eliminated before performing feature extraction. For each sequence in CSV files, the feature extraction generated a high dimensional dataset consisting of 162 features. These two datasets corresponding to two CSV files were merged later into one CSV file. The physicochemical properties used in the current study are illustrated in Table 2 . The dataset generated after feature extraction is displayed in Table 3 . Feature selection is a technique of selecting important and relevant features to improve the performance of an ML classifier. Features that provide irrelevant information and those that are less important are eliminated from the dataset. Since the dataset is high dimensional, consisting of 162 features, it is important to identify the best subset of features. In this study, the feature selection process was carried out using the Boruta() [54] function in R. Boruta() is a wrapper function that finds the important features by considering the values of minImp, maxImp, meanImp, medianImp, and normHits [54] . The input arguments to Boruta() is the dataset of 162 features and the outcome variable (Class). After its execution, it returned only 20 important attributes out of 162. Only these 20 attributes were used for building the proposed model. Table 4 list these important features. The importance of features is listed in decreasing order of rank with rank 1 as highly important. ",

The number of non-epitopes is nearly five times more than the number of epitopes. To mitigate this problem, we divided the non-epitopes dataset into five data frames. Subsequently, we added the epitope dataset copy to all of the data frames. At this point, all of the five (5) frames contain about an equal number of epitopes and non-epitope data instances.

Research conducted by Bukhari et al. [57] on Zika virus epitope prediction for epitope-based peptide vaccine design, demonstrated that building a voting-based ensemble model for epitope prediction is considered a reliable and effective technique because epitope prediction is a delicate and sensitive task. In voting ensemble, the base classifiers vote for a new data instance and based on the majority of the votes, a class label is returned. An ensemble model proposed in the current study is based on five base classifiers, i.e., five random forest classifiers, and combines the predictions from all these five base classifiers. For a given peptide, each base classifier will predict its label, i.e., epitope or non-epitope (vote by a given base classifier). Since it is a voting ensemble and the predictions for each label are summed and the label with the majority vote is predicted, the ensemble model can be developed either using homogeneous or heterogeneous base classifiers. We have used homogeneous approach because our main intention is to use the most robust base classifier among all available machine learning classifiers. The random forest classifier is considered as the most robust and powerful classifier among all. Second motivation for building the ensemble model based on homogenous classifiers is whether we want to split the dataset into multiple different data frames or use the entire dataset for training the base classifiers. Keeping this mind, we can create an ensemble model by training homogeneous base classifier using a particular subset of the original dataset, i.e., data frame or training the heterogeneous base classifiers using the entire training set.",

The model proposed in the manuscript is based on the first approach where the training set was divided into different splits to improve model performance, ideally achieving better performance than any single model used in the ensemble. The random forest classifier has been used as a base learner on all the splits because its performance is better than other classifiers. Now, we have five different and balanced datasets. Figure 2 depicts the ensemble learning technique used in the current study to build the proposed ensemble model. To predict whether a particular peptide is an epitope or non-epitope, each base classifier will predict the label of that peptide, i.e., epitope or non-epitope. Then predictions for each label are summed up and the label with the majority vote is predicted. Suppose the given peptide is \"SFYVYHK\" and the predictions for the label \"epitope\" is represented by 1 and for \"non-epitope\" by 0. Suppose the five random forest base classifiers used are represented by RF1, RF2, RF3, RF4, and RF5 and their predictions for the given peptide are 1, 1, 0, 1, and 0. As can be seen, there are three votes for epitope, i.e., 1, and two vote for non-epitope, i.e., 0. The majority vote is for label epitope (three 1 s) and hence the peptide is classified as an epitope.

A confusion matrix is a two-row, two-column table that provides the number of FPs, FNs, TPs, and TNs. This enables for more in-depth examination than a simple proportion of right classifications (accuracy). The performance evaluation metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, Gini coefficient, precision, F-score, accuracy, and Area under ROC Curve (AUROC), are defined by using these outcomes.

The difference in terms of performance between two runs in K-fold CV is called noise and it is certain for a noise to be there in case of K-fold CV.

Since the NetMHC server only estimates the binding capacity of a peptide sequence, as shown in the third column of Table 8 , the proposed model is more efficient since it deterministically predicts whether a peptide is an epitope or not. The predictions by the proposed ensemble model can be seen discretely; either 1 (meaning epitope) or 0 (meaning non-epitope). This is shown in the last column of Table 8 . However, CTLpred server predicts sequences in a discrete way, unlike NetMHC, but can only predict sequences of length up to 9-mers. As shown in Table 8 , prediction by CTLpred for sequences having a length greater than 9-mers are represented by hyphen (-), which mean \"unpredicted\" as CTLpred cannot predict them. In this case, the CTLpred server could not predict epitope sequences \"QLNRALTGIAVEQDK\",\"NFSQILPDPSKPSKR\" and \"SQDLSVVSKT\". However, the proposed model classified them correctly as SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes. Similarly, non-epitope sequences \"EYHLMSFPQSAPHGV\" and \"SLP-SYAAFATA\" were also not predicted by CTLpred, but the proposed model predicted them correctly as SARS-CoV-2 non-T-cell epitope. Thus, the proposed model correctly classifies peptide sequences having length greater than 9-mers. As demonstrated in Table 8 , the proposed ensemble model's prediction outcomes in terms of prediction accuracy are outstanding (100 percent in this case) since it correctly classifies all of the peptide sequences in the blind dataset. The comparison results clearly indicate that the performance of the proposed model is better as compared to existing techniques and hence outperforms the existing techniques.",

            "text": "The future of the current COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable. Vaccines are an essential tool to fight against COVID-19. The epitope-based vaccines outshine all other types of vaccines due to their easy production process, low cost, and safety. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is continually mutating, with its recent variant called the delta variant [5] . Existing vaccines may prove to be less effective. To protect against these mutations, the existing vaccine composition must be changed or a new vaccine must be developed. Time and cost being the critical factor, epitope-based peptide vaccines can be a great alternative. To design an effective and viable peptide vaccine based on epitopes against this pathogen, i.e., SARS-CoV-2, it is essential to select the T-cell epitopes which are antigenic. An in silico machine learning approach is less costly and more stable than conventional wet laboratory experimental techniques for vaccine development. In this study, we proposed an ensemble machine learning model to predict SAR-CoV-2 virus T-cell epitopes. The main reason for using the ensemble approach is that it is more resistant to outliers and has a better chance of generalizing with future data. Feature extraction of peptide sequences obtained from IEDB [24] was performed based on physicochemical properties of amino acids using peptides and peptider packages of R. The resultant dataset was high dimensional with 162 features. To discard features with irrelevant information, the feature selection technique was carried out using the Boruta() [54] algorithm in R language. This is because choosing the right subset of features enables the model to train faster, reduces model complexity as well as overfitting, and model accuracy is improved. Another problem with the dataset was that it was highly imbalanced. To address this problem, the majority class dataset (non-epitopes) was divided into five data frames. A copy of the minority class dataset (epitopes) was added to each data frame, resulting in five data frames having almost equal numbers of epitopes and non-epitopes. For building the ensemble model, a robust and powerful classifier, namely, random forest, has been used. The ensemble model proposed is based on the majority vote of five random forest models. The model proposed was compared with standard exiting prediction models and achieved an accuracy, AUC, Gini, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, and precision of 98.20 %, 0.991, 0.994, 0.982, 0.971, 0.990, and 0.981, respectively, when evaluated on the test set. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble model performs better than the existing classification models. The repeated 5-fold cross validation was used to assess model consistency and reliability, and it was discovered that the proposed model's performance is practically linear and a mean accuracy of 97.99% was recorded. Finally, the proposed model was compared with two widely used existing techniques for T-cell epitope prediction, namely, NetMHC and CTLpred, using a blind dataset. Results obtained clearly indicate that the proposed model performs much better than existing techniques.",
