In England a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been introduced throughout the pandemic, including guidelines on healthcare attendance (for example, promoting remote consultations), increased handwashing and social distancing. These interventions are likely to have impacted the incidence of non-COVID-19 conditions as well as healthcare seeking behaviour.

Data from the syndromic surveillance systems monitored by Public Health England were used to describe the number of contacts with NHS 111, general practitioner (GP) In Hours (GPIH) and Out-of-Hours (GPOOH), Ambulance and Emergency Department (ED) services over comparable periods before and during the pandemic. Results: The peak pandemic period in 2020 (weeks 13-20), compared to the same period in 2019, displayed on average a 12% increase in NHS 111 calls, an 11% decrease in GPOOH consultations, and a 49% decrease in ED attendances. In the GP In Hours system, conjunctivitis consultations decreased by 64% and mumps consultations by 31%. There was a 49% reduction in attendance at EDs for fractures, and there was no longer any weekend increase in ED fracture attendances, with similar attendance patterns observed across each day of the week. There was a decrease in the number of ED attendances with diagnoses of myocardial ischaemia. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically impacted healthcare utilisation for non-COVID-19 conditions, due to a combination of a probable decrease in incidence of certain conditions and changes in healthcare seeking behaviour. Syndromic surveillance has a valuable role in describing and understanding these trends.",

Primary care (general practitioner; GP) services in England started to conduct remote consultations in the first instance [8] .

Ambulance services and emergency departments (EDs) continued to operate as usual throughout; however, significant changes in healthcare seeking behaviour were observed, potentially due to changes in need for urgent healthcare, possible fears of contracting the infection in healthcare settings, and a desire to 'protect the NHS' [10] .",

To investigate changes in healthcare utilisation, the indicator for herpes zoster was chosen, monitored through GPIH, as incidence of a re-emergent viral infection was considered unlikely to be significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic NPIs, but rather indicate changes in individuals' decision making threshold for seeking healthcare. 5. Cardiac indicators (chest pain/myocardial infarction indicator (GPOOH), myocardial ischaemia (ED), and chest pain (ambulance calls)) were chosen as indicators of severe life-threatening conditions which would usually require healthcare, therefore demonstrating changes in healthcare seeking behaviour during the pandemic.",

These figures represent the data routinely available through the syndromic surveillance systems, but for some systems this is not necessarily representative of the whole of England ( Table 1) Daily trends in total activity across all five syndromic surveillance systems showed significant variation during the COVID-19 pandemic in England compared to equivalent months in 2019 (Fig. 2) . The daily mean percentage changes in activity during the peak pandemic period in 2020 (Weeks 13 to 22) compared to the same period in 2019 are shown in Table 1 . These showed the least difference for NHS 111 calls (12% increase; 95%CI: 9 to 15%) and GPOOH consultations (11% decrease; 95%CI: \u2212 8 to \u2212 14%). The total number of ambulance calls varied markedly throughout the pandemic period, increasing during the introduction of social distancing, before reducing during lockdown, such that the mean daily number during the peak pandemic period hides the marked variation seen in Fig. 2 . The total number of attendances at ED nearly halved during the peak pandemic (daily mean percentage change: -49% (95%CI: \u2212 45% to \u2212 52%). (Trends in healthcare usage during the peak pandemic period in 2020 compared to 2019, stratified by weekdays, and weekend and bank holidays, for each syndromic surveillance system and indicators are available in Additional Table 1.) Eye conditions, monitored through GPIH, GPOOH, and NHS 111, showed a sharp decline in mid-February (earlier than other syndromic indicators). GPIH conjunctivitis remained low throughout the 2020 peak pandemic period (64% reduction; 95%CI: \u2212 63% to \u2212 65%, compared to 2019 during peak pandemic period) as did GPOOH eye irritation (71% reduction; 95%CI: \u2212 68% to \u2212 74%). In contrast, though the number of calls to NHS 111 for eye problems initially reduced during March, call numbers returned to baseline (2019) by May, resulting in a smaller (25%; 95%CI: \u2212 20% to \u2212 31%) reduction across the entire peak pandemic period (Fig. 3) .",

The persistence of low activity of eye conditions may be due to the closure of schools and nurseries during the peak pandemic period. Improvements in hygiene behaviour, combined with social distancing and in particular the closure of universities in mid-March, may also explain the dramatic reduction in mumps consultations in GPIH, bringing a rapid end to the national mumps outbreak of 2019/2020 that was concentrated particularly in university student populations [24] .",

Other data sources for incidence of trauma during COVID-19 show the same trend: referrals to specialist spinal surgery decreased significantly compared to the same period in 2019, most apparent for the number of high-energy traumatic presentations, which declined by 72% (p < 0.002) [34] . This is likely because of significant changes to daily activities, including the closing of schools and less participation in team sports, during the peak pandemic period. Data from the UK Government Department for Transport show mean car traffic use during the peak pandemic (weeks 13 to 22) was reduced by 61% compared to the baseline first week of February 2020 [35] likely resulting in fewer road traffic collisions. The trends in attendances for fractures show a loss of the weekend effect which may be partly due to a reduction in team sports and a reduction in alcohol-related attendances, as a consequence of the closure of the service industry, which has previously been shown to account for a peak of 72% of attendances in males in early hours at weekends [36] . The significant decline in ED attendance due to myocardial ischaemia during the COVID-19 pandemic was of concern to clinicians especially given the association between acute infection and myocardial infarction [37] . Further analysis of ED data showed the reduction in attendance was greatest at lower levels of acuity, and yet level 1 acuity 'immediate' attendances still reduced by 31% during COVID-19 [10] . This is in keeping with other reports on the reduction in the number of stroke patients attending, where the greatest decline was among mild severity stroke [38] and systematic review finding larger reductions in utilisation among people with milder spectrum of illness [33] . These dramatic declines in attendances at ED prompted public health messaging urging patients to continue to seek medical care as required [39] .",

This routine, real-time monitoring of syndromic indicators of disease provides a greater understanding of trends in healthcare utilisation, particularly for infectious diseases [13, 40] . The ability of ED data to add insight into changing trends in attendances by hour of day and day of week provides an added benefit of working with this syndromic data. This has previously been used to analyse the impact of sporting events on the timing of ED attendances [18, 41] .",

            "text": "One limitation of the study is that some changes in indicator trends may result from modifications that have been made to the underlying health care systems to improve patient management rather than actual changes in activity. However, experience and detailed knowledge of the surveillance system and data by those undertaking the surveillance can help to minimise these limitations. For example, opposing trends in chest pain syndromes were observed throughout the first lockdown, however, the marked reduction in chest pain in the Ambulance system followed the introduction of a 'pandemic' chief complaint pathway (the basis of a newly defined COVID-19-like syndromic indicator) in early March. This suggested that the earlier peak in chest pain may have been detecting increased incidence of COVID-19 and/or anxiety, rather than cardiac-related chest pain. A COVID-19-like indicator was not introduced in the GPOOH system and therefore the chest pain/myocardial infarction indicator may have continued to capture some COVID-19 activity (albeit a small increase in percentage of Read code consultations). This demonstrates the importance of detailed interpretation from experts who understand the data's strengths and limitations. Additionally, it is difficult to disentangle behavioural changes in healthcare usage and changes in disease incidence. This was in part minimised by exploring a range of different surveillance systems and indicators, for both mild and more severe health conditions. This study improves our understanding of how healthcare usage changed during the first national lockdown, which began on the 23rd March 2020, both in total and for a range of syndromic indicators. This understanding is key when interpreting syndromic surveillance data and considering healthcare utilisation during the second Fig. 6 Numbers of contacts for chest-pain syndromes in three different syndromic surveillance systems. These graphs show daily syndromic surveillance data (dotted line) and 7-day moving average (solid line) for a) number of attendances with 'Myocardial Ischaemia' at emergency departments b) number of calls to 999 for an ambulance due to 'Chest Pain', and c) number of GP Out-of-Hours contacts for 'Chest Pain / Myocardial Infarction' as a percentage of contacts with a Read code and third national lockdowns (which were introduced in November 2020 and January 2021 respectively), when the NHS continued much of its routine healthcare provision and public health messaging about the importance of attending healthcare when needed was generally better emphasised [42] . Future work could describe how trends in syndromic indicators changed throughout summer 2020 when fewer restrictions were in place. Future sub-analyses could include exploring the trends in attendances for fractures by gender and age-groups and myocardial ischaemia by severity of illness markers. Importantly, our increased knowledge of how trends in syndromic surveillance are changing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic will be important when interpreting trends in other conditions, for example the monitoring of influenza throughout the seasonally expected peak influenza activity season, against a background of changing healthcare usage, behaviours, and incidence of other conditions.",
