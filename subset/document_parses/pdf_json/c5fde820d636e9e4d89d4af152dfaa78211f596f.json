Design Online survey and validation workshop. Setting Lockdowns and social distancing policies impact on clinical and public health research in various forms, especially if unrelated to COVID-19. Research institutions have reduced onsite activities, data are often collected remotely, and during the height of the crisis, clinical researchers were partially forced to abandon their projects in favour of front-line care. Participants survey 120 investigators of health research projects across Germany, performed between 15 and 25 May 2020; workshop: 32 investigators, performed on 28 May 2020. Results The response rate (78%) showed that the survey generated significant interest among investigators. 85 responses were included for analysis, and the majority of investigators (93%) reported that their projects were affected by the pandemic, with many (80%) stating that data collection was not possible as planned, and they could not carry out interventions as intended (67%). Other impacts were caused by staff being unavailable, for example, through child or elder care commitments or because of COVID-19 quarantine or illness. Investigators also reported that publications were delayed or not feasible at all (56%), and some experienced problems with PhD or Masters theses (18%). The majority of investigators had mitigation strategies in place such as adjustment of data collection methods using digital tools (46%) or of project implementation in general (46%), others made changes in research design or research questions (27%). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted on health research projects. The main challenge is now to mitigate negative effects and to improve longterm resilience in health research. The pandemic has also acted as a driver of innovation and change, for example, by accelerating the use of digital methods.",

It causes COVID-19 disease, primarily affecting the respiratory system, with evidence of the effects on other organs and systems also emerging. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. 1 The virus is spread from person to person through direct contact and droplets. 2 Subsequently, governmental responses worldwide have focused on mitigation strategies such as social distancing, travel and movement restrictions, school closures, restricting group and mass gatherings, up to the banning of public transport and lockdown of offices, services and industries. 1 3 4 In most countries, these restrictions have disrupted people's lives and work in an unprecedented way. 5 6 The pandemic has also impacted on clinical and public health research in various forms. On the one hand, the pandemic has placed scientific virologists, epidemiologists and pneumologists at the forefront of COVID-19 research, and the number of academic publications on Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing non-COVID-19 health research projects, mitigation strategies employed by investigators and needs for support. \u25ba The sample is representative of the projects from the 'Healthy-for a lifetime' funding programme in Germany, which includes different types of health research projects and involves different population groups. \u25ba We were not able to clearly distinguish the effects on different types of projects (clinical studies, observational studies, secondary data analyses, etc), because a small number of investigators led more than one project and were not asked to report on each project individually. \u25ba The survey presents a snapshot of the situation in May 2020. \u25ba To assess effects more widely as well as long-term impacts on projects, the survey would need to be repeated.",

Many research institutions have  severely reduced onsite research, 8 research activities have  to be performed remotely (especially research unrelated  to COVID-19) , and during the height of the crisis, clinical research programmes were forced to abandon their schedules in favour of front-line care and crisis response. 9 Personal contacts with study participants and meetings among research partners needed to be cancelled 8 or restricted. This is also a setback for public health and health services research. The strengthening of diversity aspects as well as patient and civil rights over the past decades has transformed health-related research: patient and public involvement in the planning and evaluation of clinical studies and in health promotion have evolved to be the gold standard. 10 Studies now prefer 'real life', complex interventions engaging multiple stakeholders and partners in settings and healthcare institutions. 11 In order to assess the effectiveness of these multilevel interventions, mixed-method designs have become increasingly popular, as they combine standardised measurements and surveys with intensive qualitative data collection methods such as interviews and focus group discussions. [12] [13] [14] These achievements in health-related research may have now made this kind of research particularly vulnerable to social distancing measures and stay-at-home policies. Settings such as nursing homes or schools cannot be approached easily anymore, participatory in-person meetings with stakeholders, patients or citizens are not possible or made difficult, as are face-to-face data collection methods. Inouye et al reported that field researchers may have to abandon an entire field season due to bans on travelling and recruiting, and thereby lose irreplaceable data. 15 In addition, parents face novel challenges induced by closures of schools and day care centres, as they need to devote time to looking after and home schooling their children and doing household chores. Combining child care needs with remote academic working can prove difficult, if not impossible in many cases. 16 17 This may further slow health-related research.",

For the research initiative, the Federal Ministry has provided approximately 100 million euros in funding to promote the development of new and effective concepts for health promotion, prevention and care. In total, 174 single projects and subprojects as part of consortia are being funded in 79 different German universities or research institutions. The funding programme consists of projects in five funding areas: gender health (n=32), occupational health (n=35), child and youth health (n=60), clinical studies in old age (n=18), as well as healthcare and nursing studies in old age (n=29). The majority of these projects can be defined as health services research or prevention research in the form of interventions (53%); fewer studies relate to literature reviews and studies with existing data (20%), observational studies (17%) or biomedical/laboratory research (3%).",

They were impeded in their recruitment of participants, implementation of interventions or data collection. A lack of staff availability due to private or other professional commitments or as a result of COVID-19 quarantine or illness were also observed by half of the investigators surveyed. Several participants reported that projects had to be suspended temporarily, and at the time of the survey, it was not clear whether they could be resumed in the near future. Investigators were creative in developing mitigation strategies for restrictions in data collections, with many drawing on digital communication, but this was not an option for all projects. A quarter of participants stated that they bridged the imposed suspension in their projects by adjusting their research, including pursuing novel COVID-19-related research. Investigators also expressed a need for exchange on digital communication as well as guidance regarding issues such as hygiene and participation. Methodological issues related to deviation from study protocols or validity of mid-study changes in data collection methods.

A survey of 1212 university health researchers by Research Australia found similar rates of investigators reporting that their research was affected by the pandemic (79.6%). The mentioned difficulties referred to participant recruitment in trials (49.3%), working remotely (51.2%) and access to equipment, supplies and materials (28.4%). In this Australian study, the researchers also frequently anticipated delays in project implementation (88.7%) and publications (80.9%). 20 Other surveys focused on particular areas of health research. In April 2020, a European survey of 184 eating disorder researchers found that about half of respondents had moved at least part of their research to online settings; only 14% did not expect COVID-19 to induce changes in their future research practices, whereas 30% expected to make such changes (57% indicated that it was 'too soon to tell'). 20 Meaning of study and implications for policy and practice Commentators agree that the pandemic will affect research for a long time to come. [21] [22] [23] Due to the ongoing need for social distancing, personal contact with study participants and therefore resumption of regular data collection and implementation of interventions is likely to remain difficult. The delay of outputs from non-COVID research can lead to a lack of progress in fields of health research that lack the urgency of COVID-19 but nonetheless take a significant toll on human health. 22 Also, there is the risk of new waves of infections and either local or general lockdowns due to SARS-CoV-2, but possibly in the future also due to other pandemics. Therefore, future strategies for planning, implementing and funding health research need to incorporate the possibility of potential disruptions and restrictions inflicted by pandemics and infection control measures. The importance of research, especially in crisis situations, as well as the need for new paradigms and models of resilient and efficient research has been highlighted in the literature. 24 25 Therefore, it seems important to not only handle the current challenges but also to plan for long-term approaches preventing or taking into consideration these challenges for future research. Our study raises the following important questions: (1) How can progress made with participation in health research be maintained despite difficulties and uncertainties about the future? (2) How can resilience be built into study protocols to ensure that they can be adapted if necessary and data already collected is not lost, and at the same time protocols remain methodologically robust? (3) How can different intervention and data collection methods be meaningfully combined and biases introduced be accounted for? (4) How can funding instruments be designed to accommodate changes more easily, and (5) How can funders support investigators during crises such as pandemics?",

This should be accompanied by a thorough investigation of the strengths and weaknesses as well as the comparability of different tools for interventions and data collection methods. Existing findings on the comparison of analogue and digital data collection methods are sparse and limited in scope, but so far indicate that there are no far-reaching differences. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] More research is required regarding issues such as acceptance, reach and over/ under-representation of different groups, usability in different settings and for different topics. During data analysis, the influence of changes in collection methods and other deviations from study protocols as well as missing information need to be considered. Descriptions should delineate which of these irregularities are likely to be a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and which uncertainties remain. 37 Funders should consider granting extensions to projects if these face delays because of the pandemic, and Open access allow for adjustments in research design and research questions, as has already happened in the case of many funders. 38 Changes to funding itself may also be needed. To prepare for ongoing restrictions, further lockdowns or other pandemics, policy makers and funders could introduce more flexible funding instruments. Research that generates evidence about the validity and scientific rigour of digital methods or about the combination of digital and traditional methods will be needed to accompany the shift to a 'new normality' in research, and it will also be a task for policy makers to ensure research priorities are set accordingly.",

The scientific community at large will have to deal with results of research that have taken place under different circumstances than usual, and maybe with methodological compromises. Consensus will be needed about how these findings can be meaningfully integrated with other scientific outcomes, both in terms of comparison to existing findings and in terms of research validation. Ultimately, it is a joint responsibility of policy makers, researchers, health professionals and funders to ensure that research funding is spent efficiently and effectively. The pandemic has changed the way in which scientific knowledge is produced, and some of the changes may be permanent, which will ultimately require adaptions to what constitutes good scientific practice.",

We used a representative sample of heterogeneous projects from the 'Healthy-for a lifetime' funding programme in Germany, therefore giving important insights into the impact on health research in general. However, the study only presents a snapshot of the situation in May 2020, and captured the experiences of a limited number of investigators. Due to the dynamics in the COVID-19 pandemic and infection control measures, restrictions in project work and data collection processes vary significantly over time. Therefore, it would be helpful to repeat the survey at certain intervals. As the pandemic has been imposing ongoing challenges on health research, with mitigation strategies and social distancing regulations being present for months, further surveys, for example, after 6 or 12 months, may reflect impact on projects even better and capture lessons learnt by project investigators.",

Among biomedical, laboratory-based studies, regulations about social distancing may have a different influence (eg, by rendering access to labs difficult, rather than preventing contact to patients or participants). Still, our survey results highlight the range and extent of challenges imposed on health research.",
