            "text": "Football is the most popular sport, with more than 265 million footballers around the globe, the vast majority involved in amateur and recreational football. 10 There is solid scientific evidence that recreational football is an effective broad-spectrum health-promoting activity across the lifespan, and an international platform, 'Football is Medicine', has been established. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Football is, however, considered a contact sport, with frequent and close contacts between players during training and games, which is considered to put players at high risk of disease transmission. 16 Authorities may therefore be reluctant to allow sports such as football, but the consideration that football is a contact sport with frequent and close contacts is not built on scientific evidence but on an assumption. This assumption can be evaluated using high time-resolution tracking data collected for all players during training and small-sided games (SSGs). 17 COVID-19 is a viral infectious disease transmitted between humans by either direct contact or by respiratory droplets produced while breathing, coughing, sneezing and talking. 9 Larger respiratory droplets (>5 \u00b5m) fall rapidly to the ground within 1 m, whereas smaller droplets can remain in the air for a longer period and distance depending on airflow, temperature and humidity. 18 Authorities have therefore recommended social distancing of 1-2 m between individuals to limit virus transmission. 19 20 Direct contact, for example, touching hands or contact with surfaces, for example, the ball can be limited by not allowing throw-ins or touching during play and celebration, whereas keeping 1-2 m distance during match play may be more problematic.",

This is modelled as an exponential decline in exposure score, and our function is based on the studies by Wells (1934) 26 and Wang et al (2020) 27 . The danger value of this tail exponentially declines with a half-life of 2 s. Thus, being within the area of 1.5 m from the other player returns a danger score of 1, while being in the area where the other player was 2 and 4 s ago equates to danger scores of 0.5 and 0.25, respectively. If a player is within multiple zones at the same time, the score is determined as the maximal score of the zones. Accordingly, the maximal danger score at any time and position is 1. An exposure score is calculated based on the sum of all danger scores divided by the sample frequency (10 Hz), which is then translated to how much time a player spent in DZ throughout the game. The calculations were performed with one infected player in each game and repeated until all participants had acted as the infected player, as previously described. 25 Moreover, number of contacts was evaluated as the number of times a player entered in DZ, and the time of each entry was noted.",

A study by Blocken and colleagues 31 used computer simulation of aerodynamics of droplet movements in a wind tunnel to show that exposure is up to 5 m when walking at 4 km/h and 10 m when running 14.4 km/h in the slipstream of an infected person, but exposure dropped markedly when running side by side or staggered. Unlike track or trail running, running in the slipstream for several seconds is unusable in football. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that, for adults, speed exceeds 13 km/h 30-70 times during a training session, with each high-speed run lasting only a few seconds. [21] [22] [23] [24] In U10 players, less than 10% of the total time was spent at speeds above 12 km/h. 32 Thus, the increased exposure due to slipstream dynamics for a footballer may be negligible.",

However, these tracking data reflect normal player behaviour before any engagement with official guidelines, meaning that the players came together to celebrate goals and in general may be expected to have had more close contacts than under COVID-19. Only game periods were analysed, and it is very likely that players gather together during breaks. It is, nevertheless, easier to follow official guidelines during breaks than during match play, when players may be expected to act more intuitively and based on the game routines. It should be emphasised, however, that activities around the sporting activity usually include close and prolonged social contact, such as transportation, changing room activities and meetings, which were not evaluated in this study.",

The present results suggest that recreational small-sided football is better defined as sporting activity with brief, sporadic contact rather than a contact sport.",
