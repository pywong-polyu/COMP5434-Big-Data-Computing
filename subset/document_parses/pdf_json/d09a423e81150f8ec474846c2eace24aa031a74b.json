These differences result in different cell tropisms and low fusogenicity from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Recent studies have revealed that host metalloproteases are also involved in cell surface entry and fusogenic activity of SARS-CoV-2, independent of TMPRSS2. However, the involvement of metalloproteinasemediated cell entry and fusogenicity in Omicron infections has not been investigated. Here, we report that Omicron infection is less sensitive to the metalloproteinase inhibitor marimastat, like the TMPRSS2 inhibitor nafamostat, and is more sensitive to the cathepsin B/L inhibitor E-64d than infections with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and other variants. The findings indicate that Omicron preferentially utilizes the endosomal pathway rather than cell surface pathways for entry.",

Intriguingly, the pseudovirus assay showed that a single mutation, H655Y, of the Omicron spike (S) is responsible for the preferential entry pathway usage without affecting the S cleavage status. These findings suggest that the Omicron variant has altered entry properties and 3 fusogenicity, probably through the H655Y mutation in its S protein, leading to modulations of tissue and cell tropism, and reduced pathogenicity.",

However, comprehensive analyses of the usage of viral entry pathways in Omicron variant have not been performed. Here, we used protease inhibitors to block each viral entry pathway mediated by the three host proteases (cathepsin B/L, TMPRSS2, and metalloproteinases) in various cell types. The results clearly indicated that Omicron exhibits enhanced cathepsin B/L-dependent endosome entry and reduced metalloproteinase-dependent and TMPRSS2-dependent cell surface entry. Furthermore, the H655Y mutation of Omicron S determines the relative usage of the three entry pathways without affecting S cleavage by the host furin-like proteases. Comparative data among SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, may clarify the biological and pathological phenotypes of Omicron but increase the understanding of disease progression in infections with other SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

Despite its high infectivity, the pathogenicity of Omicron seems to be lower than that of other SARS-CoV-2 variants [1] [2] [3] [4] . The Omicron variant has a large number of mutations in the viral genome, especially in the spike (S) region, which appears to contribute to the rapidly increasing number of cases worldwide by evading host immune responses in vaccinated or previously exposed individuals. Several research groups have reported that Omicron escapes from the neutralizing activities of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccine-elicited antibodies [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . In addition to immune response escape, Omicron appears to exhibit different cell tropism from other SARS-CoV-2 variants [10] [11] [12] [13] , which may also contribute to the rapid spread of Omicron infection.",

            "text": "The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for viral entry into target cells. Prior to viral entry, the S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 by host furin-like proteases before the release of viral particles from infected cells [14] [15] [16] . The first step is the binding of the S protein to the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 domain [17, 18] . In the second step, the S2 domain is further cleaved into S2' by either transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) localized in the plasma membrane or 5 cathepsin B/L in endosomal vesicles. This step is called priming [19, 20] . S2' priming causes membrane fusion between the viral particle and the plasma or endosomal membrane through interaction between the fusion peptide region and the cellular membrane, resulting in the release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm and its replication. We and others recently showed that host metalloproteinases are also involved in cell surface entry, independent of transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [21] [22] [23] . These results suggest that metalloproteinases act as the third host proteases for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Additionally, the S protein localized in the cell membrane is primed by TMPRSS2 or metalloproteinases after binding to ACE2 on the surface of neighboring cells, resulting in cell-cell fusion to generate syncytia. Syncytia formation is attributed to tissue damage [24] [25] [26] .",

The Delta variant, which was the predominant SARS-CoV-2 strain before the spread of Omicron, displays increased usage of the TMPRSS2-mediated cell surface entry pathway compared to wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 [26] . In addition, the Delta variant shows enhanced syncytia formation, which may be related to its more severe pathogenicity compared to other variants [26, 27] . In contrast, the Omicron variant shows decreased usage of TMPRSS2dependent cell surface entry [2, 10, 12, 13] . Furthermore, Omicron has low fusogenicity mediated by TMPRSS2, forming smaller syncytia than WT and Delta viruses [2, 10, 12, 13] . The reduction 6 in TMPRSS2-mediated fusogenic activity may partially explain the low pathogenicity of the Omicron variant. However, the involvement of metalloproteinase-mediated viral entry and syncytia formation in Omicron infections has not been fully elucidated. In addition, the function of Omicron S mutations on entry pathway usage and fusogenicity remains unknown.",

Although WT and Delta predominantly used the TMPRSS2 pathway in these cells, Omicron entry was significantly dependent on the 9 endosomal pathway (Fig. 1B) . We further evaluated the effects of protease inhibitors on the viral infection of HEC50B cells ectopically expressing TMPRSS2 (HEC50B-TMPRSS2), which have all three entry pathways for WT infection (Fig. 1B) .

In addition, increased usage of the endosomal pathway by the Omicron S pseudovirus was observed in both VeroE6-TMPRSS2 (ATCC) cells ( Fig 1C) and Caco-2 (colon cells) harboring the TMPRSS2 and endosomal pathways (SFig. 2). Taken together, these results suggest that Omicron S preferentially uses the cathepsin B/L-dependent endosomal entry pathway, rather than metalloproteinase-and TMPRSS2-dependent cell surface entry pathways. Interestingly, there was no difference in the dose-dependency of the inhibitory effects of nafamostat between Omicron and the other variants in Calu-3 cells (SFig.1 C and SFig. 2). In OVISE cells, WT and Omicron infections showed similar sensitivities to E-64d (SFig. 2).

Thus, we examined the ability of Omicron to form syncytia via metalloproteinases in these cells. After 24 h of infection with WT, Omicron, or Delta, the cells were stained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 N 11 protein to observe the formation of syncytia.

However, Omicron infection induced much smaller and fewer syncytia than WT infection, even when the cells were infected at the high MOI of 1 ( Fig. 2A) .

We generated various pseudoviruses with chimeric S proteins that consisted of the S1, S1/S2 boundary, and S2 regions derived from either WT or Omicron (Fig. 3B) . In HEC50B cells, pseudoviruses bearing the S proteins consisting of the WT S1 region (WOO, WOW, and WWO) infected the cells mainly through the metalloproteinase pathway (Fig. 3C) , similar to the WT pseudovirus. In contrast, the pseudoviruses bearing the S proteins consisting of the Omicron S1 13 region (OWO, OOW, and OWW) infected the cells mainly through the endosomal pathway (Fig.   3C ).

Luciferase activities from HEC50B cells infected with Omicron and the (Omicron S +655H) pseudoviruses were almost the same (Fig. 3E) . The Omicron S +655H pseudovirus infected cells more efficiently than the Omicron pseudovirus when the cathepsin B/L-dependent endosome pathway was blocked by E-64d (Fig. 3E ). In contrast, the Omicron +655H pseudovirus was less infectious than the Omicron pseudovirus when the metalloproteinase pathway was blocked by marimastat (Fig.   3E ). Moreover, the Omicron S +655H pseudovirus was more infectious to Calu-3 cells, which have only the TMPRSS2 pathway, and less infectious to OVISE cells, which have only the endosome pathway, than was the Omicron pseudovirus. Western blot analysis of the S proteins on the pseudoviruses revealed no significant difference in the cleavage status between Omicron S and Omicron S +655H (Fig. 3F) . These results strongly suggest that the H655Y mutation of Omicron S is responsible for alteration of the usage of the entry pathways by facilitating entry through the cathepsin B/L-dependent endosome pathway and impairing entry through the metalloproteinase-and TMPRSS2-dependent cell surface pathways without affecting the S1/S2 cleavage status.",

Although tissues and cells preferentially use the metalloproteinase pathway for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo are still unknown, reduced usage of the metalloproteinase pathway by Omicron could contribute to the modulation of tissue and cell tropism. Moreover, our data clearly show that Omicron displays a significantly reduced metalloproteinase-dependent fusogenic activity. Given that the fusogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 correlates well with disease severity, the low fusogenic activity of Omicron for metalloproteinase dependence is likely to contribute to the less severe disease phenotype of Omicron in cooperation with the low fusogenicity mediated by TMPRSS2. Conversely, the high fusogenic activity mediated by metalloproteinases, as observed in Delta (Fig. 2AB) , may lead to severe pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, fusogenicity mediated by metalloproteinases, as well as TEMPRSS2, may be useful as a barometer for the pathological severity of SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

Furthermore, recent studies reported that the Omicron S protein expressed in some cell types, such as VeroE6-TMPRSS2 and HEK293 cells, is poorly cleaved into S1 and S2 compared to the WT S, resulting in a reduction in the fusogenic activity of Omicron [2, 12, 13] . However, we did not observe any significant differences in the cleavage of the S protein in the virions and infected HEC50B cells between Omicron S and WT S cells, even when the cell surface entry pathway and fusogenic activity were markedly suppressed ( Fig. 1D and 2C) . These data strongly suggest that Omicron S has the ability to change the entry pathway usage and fusogenicity, regardless of the S1/S2 cleavage status, in some cell types used in this study. Importantly, pseudovirus analysis shows that the H655Y mutation of the Omicron S causes a change in entry pathway usage without affecting the S1/S2 cleavage status, strongly suggesting that H655Y regulates entry properties through mechanisms other than the reduction of the S1/S2 cleavage efficiency.",

            "text": "A putative mechanism is that the H655Y mutation alters the Omicron entry pathway by affecting the stability of the S1/S2 complex formed after cleavage by furin-like proteases. The H655Y mutation is localized in subdomain 2 (SD2) of the S1 domain. Structural studies of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein indicate that SD2 is proximal to the S2 domain [37] [38] [39] , suggesting that the stability of the S1/S2 complex may be influenced by some amino acid mutations in SD2. In fact, the D614G mutation in SD2 destabilizes the interface between S1 and S2, facilitating disorder of a region including the S2' cleavage site, leading to increased infectivity [37, 39] . In contrast, the H655Y mutation in SD2 may make the S1/S2 complex more stable in the backbone of the Omicron S. According to the recently reported three-dimensional structure of Omicron S [40] , the S trimer has a structure that is broadly common to that of WT S (SFig. 5AB). The Cterminal peptide of the S1 domain containing the H655Y mutation interacts with the N-terminal peptide of the S2 domain. Comparing the structures around amino acid position 655 in the spike protein of Omicron and WT, both spikes have hydrogen bonds between the two main chains (position 655-656 in S1 and position 694-695 in S2). Interestingly, Omicron S has an additional hydrogen bond between the side chains of the tyrosine residue at position 655 (Y655) in S1 and the threonine residue at position 696 (T696) in S2) (SFig. 5C). This additional hydrogen bond in Omicron S suggests that it may stabilize the S1/S2 complex. The increased stability possibly prevents TMPRSS2-and metalloproteinase-mediated S2' priming on the cell surface by interrupting the exposure of the S2' priming site. However, increased stability may have a positive effect on the endosomal entry of Omicron. For instance, a stable S1/S2 complex may increase the chance of endocytosis of viral particles by persistent anchoring of viral particles to the target cell membrane. In other words, stabilization of the binding between the S1 domain bound to ACE2 and the S2 domain anchored to the viral membrane may allow for efficient internalization of viral particles during endocytosis, which involves a dynamic change in cell membrane curvature.",

            "text": "We first assessed viral replication of WT SARS-CoV-2 and an Omicron BA.1 variant in three cell types that have different entry pathways for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intracellular viral RNA replication in Calu-3 airway epithelial cells after infection with WT (NCGM02) was severely blocked by nafamostat, but not by E-64d or marimastat (SFig. 1A). The findings indicated that WT infection predominantly depends on the TMPRSS2 pathway in Calu-3 cells. Infection of HEC50B endometrium cells was sensitive to E-64d and marimastat, but not to nafamostat (SFig. 1A). These findings indicated that WT infects HEC50B cells via both the endosomal and metalloproteinase pathways. Infection of OVISE ovary cells with WT was highly sensitive only to E-64d treatment, revealing that viral entry into OVISE cells predominantly depends on the endosomal pathway (SFig. 1A). The amount of intracellular viral RNA in the three cell lines was measured after 24 and 48 h of infection with WT or the Omicron variant (TY38-873) in Fig. 1A. Titers of WT and Omicron were measured using VeroE6-TMPRSS2 (JCRB) cells, which predominantly use the endosomal pathway, like OVISE cells (SFig. 1B). Compared to WT,Omicron replication was reduced in Calu-3 and HEC50B cells, which use TMPRSS2-or metalloproteinase-dependent cell surface pathways. In contrast, in OVISE cells, which predominantly utilize the endosomal pathway, WT and Omicron replicated similarly in accordance with the multiplicity of infection (MOI) measured using VeroE6-TMPRSS2 (JCRB) cells(Fig. 1A). These results support the hypothesis of a difference in the usage of viral entry pathways between the WT and Omicron variants.To compare the usage of the entry pathways by Omicron, WT, or Delta variant (TY11-927), we evaluated the effects of E-64d, nafamostat, and marimastat on infections in various cell types. In HEC50B cells, E-64d inhibited WT and Omicron infections, whereas Delta infection was less sensitive(Fig. 1B). In contrast, marimastat significantly suppressed WT and Delta infections, but not Omicron infections. In addition, in A704 human kidney cells, which use metalloproteinase and endosomal pathways for WT infection, similar to HEC50B cells (SFig. 1A),",

Although the link between the altered usage of entry pathways and the rapid spread rate of Omicron is unknown, it is possible that if Omicron acquires mutations again around amino acid position 655 in the S protein, it may be a mutant strain that preferentially utilizes cell surface entry pathways, similar to WT and Delta, and could be seriously pathogenic with high infectivity. It may be necessary to monitor the occurrence of a mutation at tyrosine 655 in the S protein of Omicron during the current COVID-19 pandemic.In summary, the findings of this study show that the Omicron variant preferentially uses the endosome pathway over cell surface pathways through the H655Y mutation in the S protein, even in cases where S cleavage by furin-like proteases is not affected. These results may contribute to the understanding of the biological and pathological features of the Omicron variant and the next emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, and to the development of therapeutic approaches for COVID-19.",
