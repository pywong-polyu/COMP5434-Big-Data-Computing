Based on the optimal sensitivity and specificity, we identified that ODI \ufffd15 is useful to accurately identify moderate-to-severe and severe OSA in surgical patients with cardiovascular risk factors. To predict moderate-to-severe OSA, ODI \ufffd15 events per hour showed high accuracy of 93.3% and AUC of 0.98. Similarly, for severe OSA, ODI \ufffd15 events per hour showed very good predictive performance as shown in the results. Ideally, identification of patients with OSA, and those with suspected OSA should take place well in advance of elective surgery to allow time for potential evaluation and management of OSA preoperatively [15] . In clinical practice, many patients are identified close to the operative time, often just days before surgery. Oximetry serves as a simple tool to identify these at-risk surgical patients to ensure optimal perioperative management. A recent systematic review on patients referred to sleep clinic also recommended using ODI \ufffd15 events per hour for predicting OSA but ODI \ufffd10 events per hour for further evaluation of OSA [9] . Although there has been a number of studies to predict OSA using oximetry [10, 11, 16, 17] , this is the first study to show that overnight pulse oximetry is a valid screening tool in predicting OSA in surgical patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally, this multicenter study involved a large sample size of different ethnic groups, which allows the findings to be generalizable to diverse population.",

The combinations of opioids plus sedatives were associated with worse outcomes sustained by OSA patients after a critical event [3] . Before surgery, identifying patients at high risk for OSA with a screening tool such as the STOP-Bang questionnaire [19] , for targeted perioperative precautions and interventions may help to reduce patient complications. For those Table 3 who were identified to be at high risk of OSA with co-morbid cardiovascular risk factors, we showed that oximetry serves as a quick and accessible tool to predict OSA. Compared to in-lab PSG which is not economical to use in resource limited situations and often delays treatment by long wait time [20] . Our study showed that high predictive performance of oximetry using ODI \ufffd15 and ODI \ufffd30 for predicting moderate-to-severe OSA and severe OSA. Regardless, ODI \ufffd15 cannot distinguish between moderate-to-severe or severe OSA. In the clinical setting if someone has ODI \ufffd15, they can be considered as high risk of OSA. This helps in further management of high-risk patients. However, PSG has been recommended to evaluate patients with other sleep disorders and comorbid conditions [21, 22] . Although PSG provides more accurate information compared to HSAT as well as oximetry, lack of accessibility has limited its use in preoperative assessments. Therefore, oximetry is valuable in identifying at risk patients for optimal perioperative management. After surgery, we can refer patients with ODI \ufffd15 or greater for further evaluation and management [15] . The recent coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) pandemic has been shaping the mode of health care delivery, and telemedicine is particularly beneficial for patient assessment before surgery. Due to the highly contagious nature of the COVID-19, individuals are asked to limit unnecessary physical interaction and maintain physical distance. In such situation, oximetry is a viable alternative for in-lab polysomnography as well as HSAT which requires more equipment and instruction. Oximetry is a simple device which does not require extensive patient instructions and is mailed to patients' home. It is easily disinfected due to its size.",
