Without an effective treatment or vaccine during the first year of the pandemic, the only preventive action to control the spread of COVID-19 comprised social distancing, imposed by governments as a series of unpopular lockdowns, hand hygiene, and the use of face masks. 6 These strategies were openly advertised by the WHO as the only effective way to prevent infection, limit the spread of COVID-19, and avoid the collapse of healthcare systems when vaccines were not available.",

Considering that the COVID-19 cases-to-fatalities ratio is relatively low compared with the Ebola virus (40% during the 2013\u22122016 outbreak), 7 some governments quickly relaxed lockdowns to allow the reopening of businesses and services to avoid the collapse of their economies. In some cases, this permissiveness promoted massive infection to achieve herd immunity before vaccination. However, the consequences of unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 infection are tragic, as observed in the outbreak in Manaus, Brazil. 8 The Amazon state was hit hardest by COVID-19 in Brazil as a consequence of multiple factors including the resistance of local and federal government to impose nonpharmacological mitigation measures, such as social distancing and masks use, allowing virus circulation among the population which fuelled the emergence of a highly transmissible new variant (gamma). Altogether, the combination of these factors boosted infirmary and ICU hospitalizations, culminating in the collapse of oxygen supply and massive deaths in Manaus.",

            "text": "implementation of an active anti-science campaign can aggravate the outcomes of the pandemic. Despite Brazil accounting for approximately 2.7% of the world's population, its contribution to COVID-19 cases and deaths is unevenly high, reaching around 8.15% and 11.55% of the global share, respectively. 3 Indeed, Brazil ranked just behind the United States in total deaths (617,121 deaths) as of 15 December 2021. 3 Several factors may explain the unexpected severity of COVID-19 outcomes in Brazil. First, historical socioeconomic inequalities have directly contributed to the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. 9 Second, the widespread surge of a novel and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (P.1) in Manaus led to the collapse of healthcare systems in many localities. 10 Third, the disinterest of the federal administration in implementing a coordinated and aggressive national response to tackle COVID-19, focusing on the promotion of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as local lockdown measures, social distancing, the mandatory use of masks, vigorous testing, and contact tracing of the population, has been a factor. 11 Fourth, the delay in implementing a robust vaccination campaign has played a role. 12 Lastly, a wellorganised campaign of scientific denialism and misinformation led by the Brazilian federal administration, endorsed by the right-wing-oriented Brazilian medical associations, which have promoted self-medication with chloroquine and ivermectin, has amplified the severity of COVID-19, mainly among the elderly population. 13 The practices implemented by the federal government were essentially through 'medical demagogy' and included: (i) the propagation of conspiracy theories about the origins of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) the consistent (since March 2020) defiance about the severity of pandemics, with the president declaring on TV that 'it's just the flu' 14 ; (iii) the 'repositioning' of pre-existent drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 patients through the so-called 'kit-covid' 15, 16 ; (iv) the frequent changes in the Ministry of Health (four in total) in less than a year resulting from disagreements between the current administration and Ministers of Health, especially on the push to implement ineffective drugs for COVID-19 treatment; and (v) the delay in acquisition and denial about the effectiveness of vaccines for controlling COVID-19. As a result of the disastrous management of COVID-19 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, a parliamentary committee of inquiry established by the Senate has confirmed the hypothesis that President Jair Bolsonaro deliberately spread COVID-19 among the population, allegedly to accelerate herd immunity. 13 In contrast to the US case, the Brazilian anti-science movement has not been organised but has quickly risen in the three years since the present administration took office. Nevertheless, the top-down implementation of an anti-science agenda permeated Brazilian society. 16 Indeed, adherence to social distancing and mask use is lower than that in other countries. 17 Denial is a defence mechanism for individuals against an unbearable reality, not just death. 18 Denialism, on the contrary, is a mass phenomenon based on the trivialisation of death, adoption of distractions from reality, production of imaginary enemies (usually associated with conspiracy theories), the disempowerment of institutions, and displacement to personal and symbolic authority. 19 Specifically, scientific denialism questions scientific knowledge and replaces it with beliefs. Unsurprisingly, the Bolsonarian narrative is based on the supremacy of individual freedom, above any other Enlightenment value such as equality, the defence of life, justice, and solidarity. 20 In this case, freedom, frequently evoked by Bolsonarians, delegates to each individual the care of their health and introduces the idea of death as a fortuitous event, for no apparent rational reason.",

A retrospective study was carried out on COVID-19 deaths registered in the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (SIVEP-Gripe), a system used by local, state, and federal governments to monitor severe acute respiratory infections in Brazil, which indicated the epidemic process of COVID-19 as early as epidemiological week 12 of 2020. 24 As requested by the Ministry of Health, SARS deaths should be reported in SIVEP-Gripe regardless of hospitalisation. This data source contains information about hospitalisation and deaths and consequently deals with the most severe cases. Because COVID-19 is a disease that requires mandatory notification, the database includes information from public and private health systems. 25 We separated the two main waves of the pandemic in Brazil using the cut-off date of November 1st, 2020, when there was a large reduction in the number of deaths. We, therefore, analysed the data according to the two periods, from February to October 2020 and from November 2020 to June 2021. We analysed 472,634 COVID-19 deaths confirmed by laboratory tests with positive results from the quantitative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, from February 16th 2020 to June 17th 2021. The unit of analysis for this study was the municipality and the age-standardised mortality rate (SMR) was used to control for differences in demographic age structures. The SMR was calculated by the direct method using death data from COVID-19 from SIVEP Influenza. 25 The direct method was used to standardise the mortality rate in the municipalities in which the rates of the age groups (0 Data on city categories. We classified the cities hierarchically using the Regions of Influence of Cities structure produced by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), 27 which defines the hierarchy of Brazilian urban centres and delimits the regions of influence associated with them. This identifies, for example, the Brazilian metropolises and regional capitals as well as the spatial scope of their influence. The urban hierarchy and areas of influence were identified by classifying urban centres that have certain equipment and services that attract populations from other locations. The differentiated offer of goods and services among cities causes populations to travel to wellequipped urban centres to acquire health and education services or access an airport. Knowing the relationships among Brazilian cities based on the flows of goods, services, and management is an important tool for making locational choices, such as deciding the location of a university, hospital, or company branch. The hierarchical categories were local centres, zonal centres, subregional centres, regional capitals, and metropolises (ranked 1\u22125, respectively).",

The first step of the algorithm considers the global null hypothesis of independence between the contextual variables and outcome variable; if this hypothesis cannot be rejected, the partitioning stops. If the global null hypothesis is rejected, the most significant contextual variable in the conditional model relative to the other contextual variables is selected. When the selected variable is dichotomous, the choice of the best binary partition is trivial; for non-dichotomous variables, the algorithm identifies the best binary partition of all possible partitions. 31 Because conditional trees are based on statistical inference, pruning is not necessary, and nor is the approach used in the recursive partitioning algorithms as previously proposed. 32 The statistics for the partitioning are based on the asymptotic theory of permutation statistics proposed by Strasser and Weber. 32 Initially, the possible partitions based on all contextual variables are created and the analysis units are classified; then, a statistical test is applied to select the groups that will compose the tree. In this study, the Monte Carlo test was used to evaluate independence as well as compare the p-values and select the nodes. A significance level of 0.05 was adopted as a reference for the p-value to include the partitioning of the contextual variables. Based on these results, the groups were created and the predicted values of the terminal nodes were determined. Finally, the ctree function from the R package (or library), called partykit, version 3.4.0, was used. 33 A regression tree with conditional inference was built to classify the outcome variable according to the different levels of response of the contextual variables to verify their effect on the occurrence of COVID-19 in Brazilian municipalities. This regression with conditional inference allowed us to estimate the occurrence of deaths from the disease by groups of municipalities considering the partisan issue that influenced the behaviour of the disease in the country. Finally, estimates and errors with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each created group were presented. The results predicted by the model were processed in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to construct the final maps, and graphs of the rates by the groups of municipalities were prepared to evaluate the behaviour of the disease throughout the pandemic.",

Figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of the explanatory variables used in the model. The HDI-Income highlights the dichotomy that exists in the country, where the northern and northeastern regions contain municipalities with lower income than that in the southern, southeastern, and coastal regions of the northeast. In addition, municipalities with high income have significant inequality, as measured by the high Gini index and compared with the HDI-Income map. The preventable causes present a more random distribution concerning the other explanatory variables, and some municipalities in the northern region are facing the worst access to healthcare than those in other regions. The partisanship indicator that describes the result of the Brazilian presidential election in 2018 shows a clear pattern of income inversion. The first contextual variable, which defined the subsequent groups, was the hierarchical level of cities, demonstrating the importance of city function and connectivity in the regional impact of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Urban hierarchy is not directly related to city size but to its role in the regional economy and the national urban network, which may reflect both the capacity of cities health services to treat disease cases as well as their role in the propagation of the virus to their influenced surrounding areas. Higher hierarchical cities attract investments and are better equipped, including health facilities, while lower hierarchical cities play a minor role in human mobility and market of goods. S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro are national metropolises and influence great extension of Brazil. Other state capitals and large conurbated urban areas are also considered metropolises, while medium and less connected cities are classified as regional centres. Finally, small and remote cities are classified as zonal centres and comprise the majority (82.4%) of Brazilian cities. Small and remote cities (local and zonal centres) were less affected by COVID-19 than central and large cities (sub-regional and regional centres and metropolises). In small cities, income (HDI-Income) was the main differential and wealthier cities presented higher mortality rates than poorer cities. For large and central cities, income distribution (expressed by the Gini index) separated more equal cities presenting higher COVID-19 mortality from unequal cities with lower mortality rates. Votes for Bolsonaro was a subsequent variable in the classification tree, which indicates the importance of political partisanship in COVID-19 outcomes, after taking into account the underlying socioeconomic conditions in the composition of Brazilian municipalities. Figure 2 shows a regression tree with 25 internal nodes and 26 end nodes. The main contextual variable among the input variables in the model was the hierarchy of cities, with an emphasis on regional capitals and metropolises. The group with 21 cities (node 51) was the set of analysis units that presented the second highest COVID-19 SMR, 255 (95% CI: 189\u2212321) deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. This occurred in regional capitals and metropolises with high inequality and in which the current president won the election. Municipalities with the same characteristics, presenting only a difference in low electoral enthusiasm for Bolsonaro, showed much lower rates, with a mean of 161 (95% CI: 125\u2212197). Internal node 37 also highlights the importance of the political position manifested through the election results variable. Our analyses identified that in places with lower inequality, represented by the Gini index (V4), the COVID-19 SMR increased. Places with higher mortality rates from preventable causes (V5) also presented a higher COVID-19 SMR, even in localities with high incomes (HDI-Income, V3).",

The first wave, from March to October 2020, was characterised by low transmission rates and the disease diffusion from metropolitan areas to smaller and inner cities. After a peak of high incidence and mortality rates, between June and August 2020, a more uniform and synchronous pattern involving all cities nationally was observed. From November 2020 to June 2021, there was a new surge in the disease, hitting the entire Brazilian territory, with peak levels in April 2021 (second wave), namely, higher incidence and mortality rates and the collapse of the healthcare system. During the first wave, some measures to restrict mobility and economic activities were implemented, while during the second wave, these measures were more flexible and decentralised, except for certain metropolitan regions and small cities that adopted new restrictions in March 2021. Figure 3B shows the difference in the evolution of mortality according to groups of municipalities and Figure 3C shows the difference in the increase of SMR Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 00 Month , 2022 between the first and second wave among municipalities according to political preferences (voting for Bolsonaro). There was a significant increase in mortality in nodes identified as Bolsonaro voters, compared to those city nodes that voted in the other presidential candidate. Owing to this dynamic of the pandemic, small cities (nodes 8 to 34) ( Figure 3B ) had lower COVID-19 mortality rates in the first phase (i.e., expansion) than Brazilian metropolises and other hard-hit countries in Europe and the United States. Larger cities (nodes 39 to 51), on the contrary, had higher COVID-19 mortality rates in the first months of the pandemic (May and June 2020), such as those cities belonging to node 39 (mediumsized cities with low income, mainly in the northern and northeastern regions), node 50 (medium-sized and large cities, with higher income, spread nationally), and node 51 (medium-sized and large cities, with lower income and located mainly in metropolitan areas in the northeastern region). However, the largest distinction between cities emerged in the second wave, when many small cities, which had escaped the impact of the first wave, were seriously hit, mainly those belonging to nodes 20, 22, 23 (Group 1), 31, 32, 33, and 34 (Group 2). All these cities shared a preference for Bolsonaro in the second round of the 2018 election.",

This group presented a lower SMR (mean 85 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) than the other groups; however, there were important internal differences.

Predictably, Bolsonaro won in all 21 municipalities of this group in the 2018 presidential election. These data strongly indicated that in cities in the richer northern region, partisanship towards the right-wing movement was a strong driver of the poor COVID-19 outcome independent of the relatively high socioeconomic indices.",

Municipalities with similar socioeconomic profiles may have been differently affected by the pandemic depending on the local administration and ideological profile of the population that is reflected in its choice of party. Our analysis points out that as the first decision variable, the size and centrality of the municipality, which demonstrates the combination of contextual variables with the denial behaviour of an uninformed population, highly affected the outcome and translated into deaths. The opposite is also proven, as municipalities, even those with more deficient health conditions, lower-income, and greater inequality managed to go through the pandemic with less damage.",

The (false) purpose of the Bolsonaro government to decentralise decisions on measures to control the pandemic, such as the adoption of ineffective medicines, the lack of encouragement of vaccines, and risk communication campaigns, strengthened local authorities (not only mayors but also groups with economic or symbolic power). This decision was contradicted by the attitude of President Bolsonaro, who openly criticised some measures to restrict mobility, including judicial actions by the Brazilian Supreme Court against governors' decrees. 13 Since this is an ecological study and all variables were aggregated in municipalities as spatial units of analysis, we cannot assert that individuals identified with a certain ideology are prone to behave differently, are more exposed and have a higher risk of death. What this study design allows us to point out is that the impact of the pandemic is dependent on a combination of previous social and political conditions. In this sense, a municipality that could have better conditions to deal with pandemic management (better HDI, better health services and lower-income inequalities) may have higher mortality because of its political positioning. Other ecological studies carried out in Brazil have been showing that poverty, inequality and environmental contextual factors affect disease distribution and severity. 39, 40 The lack of integrated policies and national unity made each local manager adopt measures that met their local political and economic needs. The decentralization of policies to municipal governments also affected the health care emergence infrastructure. It was estimated that approximately one-quarter of COVID\u00c019 deaths in hospitals could be reduced with the correct management of hospital resources, as carried out in Belo Horizonte. 41 In the municipalities of metropolitan areas, characterised by the intensity of people's movement and dependence on the same healthcare services and equipment, we observed the worst effects of the collapse of healthcare services and the failure of the pandemic's contingency, mainly during the first pandemic wave. On the other hand, an extreme decentralization of pandemic management measures was a characteristic of the second wave. Politically, the two waves were marked by the performance of different ministers of health: LH Madetta and N Teich from March 2019 to May 2020, and E Pazuello and M Queiroga from September 2020 onwards. The transition between ministers was also marked by increasing obedience to president Bolsonaro, and failures of national coordination when faced with problems such as the indiscriminate use of the \"COVID kit\", the shortage of medical oxygen supply in Manaus, faltering in the purchase of vaccine, among other problems of pandemic management. These omissions by the Ministry of Health led to greater decentralisation and autonomy of municipalities to adopt control measures or strengthen the health system. This explains the main differences in the impact of the first and second waves in municipalities with a Bolsonaro orientation (see Figure 3C) .",

Meanwhile, the second wave of COVID-19 was explicitly shaped by the partisan choice of municipalities. That is, municipalities that chose Bolsonaro as the country's president showed intensified COVID-19 mortality rates in the second wave. This behaviour can be explained by the fact that almost a year after the pandemic, the federal government still refused to support recommendations of social distancing and face mask-wearing or promoted early treatment using drugs proved to be ineffective months before. This boosted the risk behaviour of people aligned to the thinking of President Bolsonaro, exposing them to COVID-19 and resulting in a higher mortality rate. Thus, our analysis demonstrates that partisan choice was one of the factors explaining why Brazilian municipalities with the same inequality, income, and healthcare service characteristics behaved differently in the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
