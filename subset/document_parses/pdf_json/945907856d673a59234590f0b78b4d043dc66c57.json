Although our aim is to offer the best of the best, we continue to be fascinated by work that finds its way into journals other than our own. There is much to learn from it so JHPS has selected six recent and topical subjects for those who seek a summary of what is taking place in our ever-fascinating world of hip preservation. What you see here are the mildly edited abstracts of the original articles, to give them what JHPS hopes is a more readable feel. If you are pushed for time, what follows should take you no more than 10 min to read. So here goes . . .",

[1] from the University of Rome, Italy report that the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revolutionized global healthcare in an unprecedented way with considerable repercussions. Resource reallocation, socioeconomic confinement and reorganization of production activities are among the current challenges that are being faced both at the national and international level, in the backdrop of uncertainty and fear. Hospitals have been restructured to provide the best care for the COVID-19 patients while adopting the preventative strategies to avoid spreading the infection among healthcare providers and the patients affected by other diseases. As a consequence, the concepts of urgency and indications for elective treatment have been profoundly reshaped. The authors further state that several providers have been recruited to serve in the COVID-19 departments despite their differing original skills, resulting in a significant rearrangement of both the in-patient and outpatient care. Orthopaedic daily practices have been significantly affected by the pandemic. Surgical indications have been reformulated, with elective cases being promptly postponed and urgent interventions requiring exceptional attention, especially in suspected or COVID-19 patients. This has made a strong impact on the in-patient management, with the need for dedicated staff, patient isolation and restricted visiting-hour policies. On the other hand, the outpatient visits have been limited to reduce contact between patients and the hospital personnel, which has considerable consequences for post-operative quality of care and the human side of medical practice.",

The KEGG pathway analysis showed that the hub genes were significantly enriched in the rheumatoid arthritis signalling pathway, IL-17 signalling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signalling pathway. The immune infiltration profiles varied significantly between OA and normal controls. Compared with normal tissue, OA synovial tissue contained a higher proportion of memory B cells, naive CD4\u00fe T cells, regulatory T cells, resting dendritic cells and resting mast cells, while naive CD4\u00fe T cells, activated NK cells, activated mast cells and eosinophils contributed to a relatively lower portion, which was significant.

[4] from Chicago, USA draw attention to the fact that COVID-19 has drastically altered our lives in an unprecedented manner, shuttering industries and leaving most of the country in isolation as we adapt to the evolving crisis. Orthopaedic surgery has not been spared from these effects, with the postponement of elective procedures in an attempt to mitigate disease transmission and preserve hospital resources as the pandemic continues to expand. During these turbulent times, the authors state, it is crucial to understand that although safety of patients and care providers is paramount, cancelling or postponing essential surgical care is not without consequences and may be irreversibly detrimental to patients' health and quality of life in some cases. The optimal solution to how to balance effectively the resumption of standard surgical care while doing everything possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 is undetermined and could include such strategies as social distancing, screening forms and tests, temperature screening, segregation of in-patient and outpatient teams, proper use of protective gear, and the use of ambulatory surgery centres to provide elective, yet ultimately essential, surgical care while conserving resources and protecting the health of patients and healthcare providers. The authors emphasize that these recommendations do not and should not supersede the evolving guidelines from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, relevant federal, state and local public health organisations. The study design involved personal interviews that were conducted with the four doctors involved in the management of COVID-19 outbreak in one of the main orthopaedic hospital of Italy.",
