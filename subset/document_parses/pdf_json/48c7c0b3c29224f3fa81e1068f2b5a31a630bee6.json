            "text": "There has been growing interest in virtual care solutions in clinical medicine, but until the onset of COVID-19, traditional in-person visits have remained the primary method of delivering outpatient services. The lack of telehealth has been a common focus of discussions on improving the delivery of value-based and patient-centered care. 1, 2 Outdated reimbursement structures, inertia, a lack of value assigned to patients' time, and the paucity of quantitative data on novel clinical models have all contributed to this stagnation. 3, 4 Further, a paradoxical lack of agility within electronic systems to encompass new modes of care delivery have contributed to the reluctance of many physicians, hospitals, and health systems to fully embrace virtual care. 5 A national Canadian task force on virtual care released their recommendations in February 2020 and identified current electronic ecosystems as a major impediment to virtual care and provided a set of recommendations on how these may be addressed. 6 With the widespread imposition of social distancing laws just one month later to combat the spread of COVID-19, payers, providers, and patients have been forced to challenge the status quo and adapt to new models of virtual care to meet the demands of the moment. 7, 8 Within oncology, there have been several calls that the current model of traditional in-person care delivery by the specialist team is unsustainable as the population of cancer patients and survivors grows. 9 Further, accessing both acute care and survivorship services for cancer patients in rural and remote areas has been a longstanding challenge. 10 Existing evidence suggests that cancer follow-up care can be delivered effectively using novel technological solutions while maintaining both patient safety and satisfaction. 9 However, this evidence has been limited to very specific clinical scenarios and has not been focused on large-scale institutional shifts toward virtual care provision. 9, 11 With COVID-19, several high-volume cancer centres made rapid shifts toward virtual care delivery, although many published reports of effective transitions were in centres with pre-existing and well-established telehealth programs. Further, these transitions were often accompanied by a reduction in overall outpatient volumes. 12, 13 Other health systems relied on a variety of technological platforms that were not all HIPPAA-compliant and were implemented in the absence of institutional strategies for effective post-pandemic virtual care delivery. 14 Taken together, the rapid and vast transition to virtual cancer care during the pandemic offers a demonstration of feasibility and poses the question: how might virtual care become a valuable fixture of health systems beyond COVID-19?",

With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and new directives to keep people at home and out of healthcare facilities, PM was faced with the dual challenge of minimizing exposure risk to an immunocompromised population of cancer patients while minimizing disruptions in the delivery of critical ambulatory services. To protect both patients and staff from exposure, the PM executive team instructed the front-line providers to reduce in-person ambulatory clinic visits by 50%.",

As compared to the United States' multi-payer system, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan facilitated these universal, province-wide changes in virtual care reimbursement. However, while these new billing codes addressed the issue of payment parity, they did not address the larger technological limitations that had prevented the more widespread uptake of virtual care across the cancer centre prior to the pandemic.

This research data is analyzed to produce currentstate process maps and prioritized problem-statements to be tackled by the design team. At PM, the VCMS team mapped and analyzed each step of the traditional ambulatory workflow to identify critical bottlenecks that could impede the delivery of care virtually. 22 The first critical bottleneck identified was the lack of a centralized, digital communication platform between members of the health care team. Prior to April 2020, orders at PM were traditionally processed using a combination of direct entry to EMR, paper notes, in-person conversations, email, and phone, whereas the new, integrated VMCS allowed for rapid online information exchange and digital order sets. This process also uncovered other bottlenecks in the system, including the lack of automated safety checks (e.g. allergies) built into physician order sets. After prioritization of the core challenges, the Design & Testing phase involved rapid ideation and exploration of many different ways to solve the problems. Software prototypes are rapidly designed and tested with core representatives from each role, followed by revisions and more testing, before committing to full development of the new technology. This process led to the decision to integrate existing infrastructure (OTN platform, scheduling, and electronic medical record (EMR) software) into the VCMS as-is to minimize adoption barriers and time to delivery. It also led to the inclusion of safety checks in the VCMS through mandatory order fields, as well as a tracking system to monitor deferrals of patient treatment due to COVID-19.",

Virtual training sessions were offered to designated \"super-users\" across the hospital, who championed the system amongst the rest of the staff. There were also regular meetings with site and clinic managers to identify any new challenges that were arising in real-time. This process of distributed leadership and decision-making fostered direct input from the front-line and allowed strengths of the existing electronic infrastructure to be leveraged to accelerate the digital transition. The alignment amongst the different stakeholders and actors, as well as between different digital tools within a single institutional platform, was essential in this process, and promoted a new institutional willingness to work around bureaucratic hurdles to adoption.",

For example, the paper order forms at PM were not standardized across clinics or providers and demonstrated large variability. Given the short timeframe available, it was not possible to assemble expert panels to reach a consensus on the design of new digital order entry forms. Instead, a service designer and oncologist from the VCMS team visited each clinic over the course of a day to obtain input from the frontline administrative staff on the most common orders. Following the VCMS launch, the forms underwent continuous revision every 2 weeks based on user feedback. Currently, steering committees of clinical experts are being struck to perform a review of all new changes proposed to the forms.",

The goal of a 50% transition from in-person to virtual care was achieved within four days, thereby minimizing interruptions to inperson treatment and avoiding an enormous backlog of ambulatory services. This rapid scale-up demonstrated the acceptability and feasibility of a virtual approach to care delivery by both patients and care providers in the oncologic setting. Such improvements, however, cannot be taken for granted and new telemedicine platforms must be subject to rigorous evaluative processes like other new health care interventions. An evaluation system has been embedded into the VCMS to study the impact of this initiative on patient and provider experience through voluntary and confidential surveys on an ongoing basis. Additional information on demographics and other quality-of-care indicators are being routinely collected to quantify the impact of the virtual care rollout on the quality, safety and equity of this evolving care paradigm within our cancer system. Moreover, this information will enable ongoing improvements to care delivery and will facilitate effective virtual care post-pandemic.",

This experience, however, demonstrated the possibilities for system-wide change and the opportunity to think about novel care models such as asynchronous messaging, nurse-lead virtual clinics, and virtual peer-navigation in post-Covid-19 cancer care. However, robustly advocating for its incorporation into the standard-of-care armamentarium will require attention to other critical elements of the Institute of Medicine's quality dimensions, 24 such as value, efficiency, and cost of telemedicine platforms. Temporary billing codes for phone calls in Ontario facilitated the uptake of telemedicine by physicians, but these easy billing encounters could encourage overuse in Ontario's fee-for-service system. It could also further de-incentivize physicians to assess patients in person, when such interactions are indeed required, and could risk exacerbating inequalities when less affluent patients cannot access necessary infrastructure (i.e. devices, internet) or private space to engage virtually. 7 While the COVID-19 pandemic has caused enormous disruption in health care and significant harm across all levels of society, it has also motivated nimble and rapid change and an opportunity for disruptive innovation, rare to healthcare. The adaptation of a process mapping approach to the ambulatory cancer context facilitated the scale-up of the VCMS amongst patients and providers who had not previously been accustomed to a virtual care workflow. Ultimately, the ideal system will likely not be an either/or approach for in-person and virtual encounters, but rather, the thoughtful integration of these paradigms. Indeed, there are dimensions of care that are enhanced by face-to-face human interaction. As new virtual models of care are rolled-out during pandemic times, we must build on this momentum of deep and rapid multidisciplinary-collaboration, while continuously collecting data on cost and quality, to ensure that virtual care remains integrated in the post-pandemic landscape.",
