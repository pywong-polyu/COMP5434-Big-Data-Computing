            "text": "Background The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in radical changes in the delivery of healthcare worldwide. Our oncology service (at an Irish national cancer centre) rapidly transitioned to the use of telemedicine or virtual clinics (VC) to minimise potential risk of exposure to COVID-19 amongst an immunosuppressed, high-risk population. Our study aimed to evaluate the use of VC in this setting. Methods An 18-point questionnaire was designed to investigate the patient experience of VC during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland and compliance with guidelines developed in Ireland to conduct VC and the role of VC in the future. Questionnaires were distributed following the receipt of verbal consent from patients during the VC. Descriptive statistics were utilised for data analysis using SPSS\u00ae. Results One hundred and four patients returned completed surveys (n = 104/164, 63% response rate). Overall satisfaction levels were high with most patients (n = 58/100, 58%; no answer provided (NAP), n = 4) equally satisfied or nearly equally satisfied with VC in comparison to a usual clinic encounter. The majority of patients felt that there should be a role for VC in the future (n = 84/102, 82%; NAP, n = 2). The majority of patients (n = 61/99, 61%; NAP, n = 5) were very relieved to avoid a hospital visit due to perceived risk of potential exposure to COVID-19. Conclusion The majority of oncology patients were satisfied with a VC encounter. VC may have a role in the future of medical care in Ireland post the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Clinicians have been asked to balance the risk to benefit ratio of diagnostics, therapeutics and in-person reviews. Balancing these benefits and risks for patients with cancer poses unique challenges. Clinicians need to minimise risk of infection for this vulnerable population while continuing their cancer treatment. National guidelines have been rapidly developed and shared with broad advice on minimising spread of COVID-19, how and when to screen and test for the virus and support for rationalising routine hospital visits where possible [3, 4] . It is evident that stringent infection prevention and control measures will need to be incorporated into the delivery of healthcare for the foreseeable future. In our hospital and others, this includes the provision of adequate physical distancing for our patients and staff wherever possible with ensuing restructuring of clinics. Due to the recent resurgence of COVID-19 in Ireland, healthcare practices need to be flexible to accommodate fluctuating demands and minimise infection risk [5] . Guidelines issued by the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) in conjunction with the HSE recommend that VC are conducted with access to patient notes. They also recommend that the doctor confirms at least two details of the patient, that the doctor explains the advantages and disadvantages of VC and that they verbally consent patients for the VC [3, 4] .",

Guidelines have been developed to assist clinicians in conducting safe and clinically useful VC [4, 6, 7] .

For example, patients with a history of breast cancer may be more appropriate to attend a face-to-face visit to allow for clinical examination. Clinicians and patients need to work in a collaborative manner to decide on the most appropriate patient, clinician and clinical appointments that are suitable for VC. We also learned that only a very small proportion of patients had experienced video consultations which may enhance the patient experience.
