In corporate financing schemes, debt is raised directly by the industrial/corporate player, and the set-up of an SPV is not usually needed; in project-financing schemes, the SPV itself borrows capitals through a syndicated loan granted by a pool of banks or from bondholders when the SPV issues project bonds. The SPV is indeed a requirement in the case of a project-financing debt structure because it ring-fences the cash flow generated by the project, which, in principle, is the main form of guarantee provided (Gatti 2013) , thus ensuring the provision of debt on a no-or limited-recourse basis. The assets of the SPV become collateral for the loans although they play a secondary role compared to project cash flows. This is in contrast to corporate finance where lenders rely on the borrower's creditworthiness for their loans. Furthermore, rights and obligations associated with an investment project are related to the SPV only.",

However, facilities to attract investors must be designed to prevent situations of moral hazard. Any form of guarantee that limits the construction risks can seriously reduce the incentives to deliver the infrastructure on time and on budget and, at the same time, generate public debt. In this context, the role of MDBs can be fundamental to crafting balanced facilities and to supporting governments in developing a feasible projects' pipeline and strengthening the applicable legal framework. As regards the need for mitigation of the demand risk, the use of availability charge payments could be a useful solution, as experienced in Europe after the financial crisis (Vecchi et al. 2015) .

Alternatively, the competent authority could use it during the ramp-up period according to a statistical approach based on previous tolls paid by users, keeping the option to switch it to regular toll-based payment, cashed in by the concessionaire when the demand becomes more stable and mature.

            "text": "PPP contracts should be able to mitigate the principal-agent problems typically associated with traditional procurement, such as conflicting goals, information asymmetries, and diverging levels of risk aversion. PPP does so by transferring many project risks to private parties, thereby providing stronger incentives for the latter to perform accordingly. However, if incentives are weak, PPPs become similar to standard procurement contracts. In PPP, and in the publicprocurement literature in general, evidence has been produced in relation to (1) comprehensive and rigorous contracts, (2) measurable output indicators, and (3) credible sanctions to manage the principal-agent relation (which is the basis of PPP transactions) and to prevent moral hazard by strengthening incentives to deliver highquality services. These measures are generally suitable for transferring endogenous risks to the concessionaire, such as those related to design, construction, operation, and maintenance, thereby avoiding or reducing the risk of renegotiation. Contract renegotiation, which is defined as a change in the original contractual terms and (continued) conditions (as opposed to an adjustment that takes place within a contract's provisions), is one of the most pervasive problems in PPP because the underpinning contracts tend to be incomplete. Renegotiations of PPP contracts also result from imperfections in the judicial and regulatory system, economic shocks, and weaknesses in the institutional environment. The most problematic issues arises when a public authority retains the demand risk (partially or totally, directly or indirectly), which is an exogenous risk, as a consequence of revenue guarantees to make projects more bankable and appealing for institutional investors: in these cases, EOs have stronger incentives to adopt strategic behaviors. Strategic bidders are those who include technical or financial features in their bids, which they may not be fully able to meet, with the sole purpose of winning the contract. Such bidders assume the CAs will activate the guarantee and, ultimately, renegotiate or review the contract to ensure its success. In fact, public guarantees exacerbate the problem of adverse selection, which is quite common in the general public-procurement system, where the preferred bidder may be the most optimistic bidder rather than the best one (a situation known as \"winner's curse\"). This situation arises from strategies of \"low balling\" and from optimistic bias in traffic, revenue, or cost forecasts. To overcome these problems public sector competence in PPP transactions proves fundamental to counterbalance the aggressive behaviors of the private sector. To understand the role of public sector skills, we can refer to the results obtained by an agent-based simulation model (Vecchi et al. 2016) , based on 120,000 simulations. Figure 2 .1 presents a plot of the results; it considers the probability of awarding the project to a strategic bidder (vertical axis) as a function of the environmental propensity for strategic behavior (horizontal axis) for different skill levels of the awarding authority (unskilled; skilled; highly skilled).",
