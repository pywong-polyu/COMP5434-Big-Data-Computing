We thus suspend our usual book review forum for this issue, and turn to a different way of thinking about what we might do with reading in pandemic times. In the following section, we have asked members of the BioSocieties editorial board, plus some other colleagues and friends, to tell us what they've been reading-scholarly or otherwise, instructive or not-during the period that has come to be known as 'lockdown' in many countries. The act of reading during a pandemic, of course, of having and taking time to read, is its own privilege and not always a comfortable one, as health, retail, maintenance and may other workers keep the world turning. Nonetheless, the texts we think though here are deeply embedded in the social, political, and biological present; the act of reading and writing about them, we hope, still help to diffract that present in some original and useful ways.",

That's not to say In recent years, there has been increasing worry that concussive blows to the head experienced during sport may result in long-term neurological damage: a highprofile article in JAMA, for instance, found evidence of a neuropathology known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which in advanced cases has Alzheimerlike symptoms, in the brains of 110 out of 111 ex-National Football League (NFL) players (Mez et al., 2017) . Just as worryingly, a study in the NEJM hinted that subconcussive blows-from heading a soccer ball, for instance-might also substantially increase rates of dementia (Mackay et al., 2019) . This summer, I should have been following the exploits of an amateur American football team, part of a threeyear project examining communities' responses to, and understanding of, these questions of concussion and neurodegenerative disease in sport.",

My mind immediately turned to Julie Livingston's deeply moving 2012 ethnography of a cancer ward at Princess Marina Hospital, in Gaborone, Botswana, a book I had recently taught in a class on medicine and power. In Improvising Medicine, Livingston critiques the widely accepted \"epidemiological transition\" theory, proposed in 1971, which holds that as a society \"modernizes,\" making gains in various economic and social indicators, the \"distribution\" of disease and death shift from epidemics of infectious diseases toward chronic degenerative diseases.",

As she writes, models of epidemiological transition, which take \"development\" as their temporal telos, are illsuited to fully capturing changes in disease burdens. And so, while Botswana's public health efforts had long focused on \"pre-transition\" issues like infectious disease, malnutrition, and childbirth, a cancer epidemic was silently taking hold. The cancers turn out to be facilitated by and synergistic with endemic infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS-and, curiously, its treatment-that rendered bodies susceptible to cancers, a fact that also escaped notice because of the \"conceptual impossibility\" of cancer in Africa.",

Ballard, whose work I hadn't read in well over a decade, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The news resonates with details that would find themselves at home in Ballard's novels and, especially, his short fiction. Passengers confined indefinitely on a luxury cruise ship. People panic-buying toilet paper at the first hint of future privation. A virus irremediably changing social mores. American citizens, distracted by constant updates from their senescent president, fail to fully appreciate a brewing national crisis. Barred from physical interaction, humans retreat into their homes and interact only through screens. Previously normal activities-shopping, walking, interacting-acquire an unreal sheen. Time fractures, dilates, liquifies, loses meaning. Space constricts and we retreat inward, into our homes, into our selves. I think most of the unnamed astronauts producing their \"Report on an Unidentified Space Station\" (2014). The structure is small, their stay will be short. They are puzzled by the station's immense gravitational field, but consider themselves \"fortunate to have found safe haven at a moment when the expedition was clearly set on disaster.\" The repairs take longer than anticipated. They begin to explore the station. Their initial projections were wrong; it is far larger than it first seemed. It consists only of immense, undifferentiated, empty concourses, way stations for long-departed travelers. They lose track of time and their estimation of the station's size expand. Their departure point is forgotten; the station interior is \"coeval with the cosmos.\" A brief stopover has metastasized into a new permanence: \"Despite our steady passage we sense that we are not moving at all, and may well be trapped within a small waiting room whose apparently infinite dimensions we circle like ants on a sphere.\"",

A chronicler of the razor-thin liminal space between primal inner urges and a screen-dominated, fully mediatized public sphere, Ballard has since the 1960s been heralded-for better and for worseas 'visionary.' The term often applies to totalizing dystopian visions; think George Orwell, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Margaret Atwood. Ballard was not a world-builder, however. He wrote snapshots of an emerging mediasphere. These images, myths of the near future, dormant for so long, continue to materialize, mutated, recombined, like a virus. For someone used to diving into the scientific literature and readily gaining a feeling of understanding more, reading the voluminous, rapidly produced medical and molecular research on Covid-19/Sars-COV-2 has been rather the opposite-a profusion of puzzle pieces, without a clear sense that they are all produced from the same jigsaw. Perhaps in an anxious reach for a thread to follow, I have been following the underlying condition rather than the virus. Studies of patients in China and Europe first highlighted underlying conditions-particularly metabolic disorders such as diabetes-as an indicator of vulnerability to more severe illness and death with Covid-19; soon after stark socioeconomic and racial disparities in the mortality and morbidity from Covid-19 were being explained in terms of prevalence of underlying conditions. And then, in May, came the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and the initial reporting of the autopsy highlighting his cardiovascular state as an underlying cause of death, as if the world had not seen him being asphyxiated. In what a group of physicians has called a \"weaponization of medical language,\" one that used Floyd's anatomy against himself, they write that the underlying condition has become a form of gaslighting (Crawford-Roberts et. al. 2020) .",

So here's a fragment of my underlying condition reading list, still very much under development: Anthony Hatch's 2016 Blood Sugar: Racial Pharmacology and Food Justice in Black America, because it helps us understand both the historical materiality of the underlying condition and the political race work that concepts of dysfunction do; Adam Dickinson's Anatomic, because he might be the poet of the underlying condition, using \"the hormone as a compositional method, with its emphasis on concentration, cascade and sequence\"-and, I would add, using the endocrine disruptor and the heavy metal and other anthropogenic cellular legacies as compositional method (2018, 145) . Jonathan Crary's 24/7 (2013), because sleep is, or should be, a social justice issue too.

Right in time, my family had escaped from Brooklyn, which emerged as the epicenter of the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States, to a leafy New Jersey suburb where our fellow whitecollar workers celebrated the fact that they no longer had to commute to the city by taking a walk in the park. The scene made me think of the early days of World War I when many Europeans enthusiastically embraced the looming disaster: \"Finally, something happens!\"-only that, in the commuter belt of the city that never sleeps, this holiday mood felt more like: \"Finally, nothing happens!\" Of course, the calm before the storm didn't last long. As Brooklyn's Prospect Park turned into a field hospital and the Bronx dug out mass graves, I put aside the New York Times and re-read Hans Blumenberg's Shipwreck with Spectator. This booklet, first published in 1979, traces the metaphor of shipwreck through the history of philosophy. It contributed to the author's project of what he calls a \"metaphorology,\" examining the non-conceptual underbelly of philosophical thought. But I returned to it because of the metaphor of the shipwreck itself: I had also become a spectator who observes the distress of those at sea from the safety of dry land. This was precisely the place of theoria in ancient Greek philosophy. I didn't lack compassion for those drowning in their own body fluids in a cytokine storm, but, like Montaigne, I felt pleasure that one of my useless qualities, the ability to be a spectator of an event I could not prevent, helped me and my family to survive (p. 17).",

At a time when his colleagues almost unanimously agreed that the subject-object dichotomy was among the great evils of modernity, he defended the existential importance of detachment. In recent years, the tendency to emphasize our interconnectedness with the microbial world has endowed parts of science studies with an almost mystical quality. Shipwreck with Spectator offers an untimely perspective on the difference the present introduces with regard to the past. In antiquity, seafaring symbolized a transgression of natural boundaries that invited disaster. By contrast, anthropologist Tobias Rees (2020), among others, has articulated a new cosmology in which a multispecies configuration of viruses, animal hosts, and humans will no longer seem like an illegitimate transgression as humans come to realize that they have always been part of the outside. With a PDF of Blumenberg on my iPad (the hardcopy could not be retrieved from my closed Manhattan office), I preferred biosocial distancing to a swim in the churned-up ocean of viruses.",

Considering that the COVID pandemic has become a moment of truth, not only for higher education, future-oriented readers might want to note Blumenberg's short book, and read about modern uses of a metaphor that would eventually abandon imagery of dry land and safe harbors, to prepare us for \"living with shipwreck\" indefinitely (p. 73).",

Drones were also used to patrol public places, tracking whether people were traveling outside without face masks or violating other quarantine rules. Chinese police forces debuted augmented reality (AR) smart glasses powered by AI capabilities designed to recognize individuals with potential COVID-19 symptoms. The glasses have facial recognition capability to identify and profile individuals in real time, and can also record photos and videos. As Wuhan started to open up again, 'Health Code' was introduced, an app the authorities required people to use when entering and exiting residential areas, supermarkets, subways, and taxis among other spaces. The app stores your personal information, including your ID number, where you live, whether you have been with people carrying the virus, and their symptoms. As you touch in or out on entering or exiting, the app gives you a colour: green means you can go anywhere, yellow means you have to quarantine for 7 days, red for 14 days. The app also surreptitiously collects-and shares with the police-your location data. 1 Beyond these interventions, and in a range of countries, we are seeing intrusive and coercive forms of surveillance and use of personal data more familiar to us from dystopian novels like Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World. As other countries went into lockdown, surveillance cameras with facial recognition tracked quarantine evaders or gauged elevated temperatures of potentially infected individuals in crowds. Fine-grained location data transmitted from mobile phones determined how many people were obeying lockdown orders, fever-detecting cameras screened travelers arriving at airports, and algorithms monitored social media posts for signs of COVID-19\u2032s spread. Contact-tracing apps, centrally storing user interactions, provide 'social graphs' of who you have physically met over a period of time. 'Immunity passports' or 'risk free certificates' combine facial recognition technology with COVID-19 testing and medical records. 2 To make sense of this trajectory, I turned to Eleonore Pauwels' 2019 policy brief for the United Nations on AI and converging risks. Developing an evidencebased scenario for understanding ways in which AI, affective computing, genomics and neuro-technologies can converge, Pauwels delineates how biosensors and algorithms will capture and analyze an ever more refined record of our biometrics, emotions, and behaviors. AI will enable governments and private companies to sort, categorize, trade, and use biological data far more precisely than ever before. The unprecedented access of algorithmic networks to bodies, genomes, and minds will, she says, \"create possibilities for social and bio-control that surpass Foucauldian concerns\" (p.17).",

Second, it estimates the economic impact of dealing with this virus to be higher than $150 billion.

Third, only a few weeks after I had read the paper, I heard German Chancellor Merkel addressing ministers from thirty different countries as part of the international Petersberg Climate Dialogue essentially delivering the core message of the paper. At a time, when most were expecting that looming health and economic precarity would push global environmental change off the agenda, Merkel clearly stated: if we do not get a grip on global land use change, these situations will keep on coming. This is good news. In times of widespread anti-intellectualism, a head of state delivering state-of-the-art scientific knowledge in an important programmatic statement is a welcome relief. Appreciating complex relations and not losing sight of long-term goals in the midst of an acute crisis is to be commended.",

One of these consists of normalized landscapes that sustain normalized subjects: geo-and biopolitical modes of governance closing ranks through synergies and integration, a total geo/bio/politics.

In their own ways, Wohlleben and Haskell seek to transform our understanding of trees as mere objects, or worse still, a standing reserve to produce timber or paper. To help us overcome the radical alterity that trees present to humans due to their immobile nature, their absence of a central nervous system or the slow pace at which their lives take place, both authors draw upon scientific research and personal observations to highlight the mutual entanglements between trees, fungi, bacteria, and other species that dissolve any ready distinctions between individual and collective in forest ecology. The rich and thick description of forest networks provided by Haskell and Wohlleben captivated me most as they brought to the forefront themes of the relationship between individuals (trees) and collectives (forests) as well as the tensions between competition and cooperation necessary for survival in often nutrient-poor environments.",

This form of co-existence further enables trees to share resources and information with one another in a mutually beneficial fashion. Wohlleben and Haskell also describe how trees share information above ground as well. When trees come under attack due to insect infestations or herbivores eating their leaves, trees emit scents to warn other trees, thus enabling them to change the chemical composition of their leaves to make them less appetizing to predators. As such, both books invite us to pay as much attention to microscopic life beneath the roots of trees as to the forms of life dwelling under the forest canopy.",

Haskell alternatively focuses on the important role that tree shade provides in mitigating the effects of urban heat sinks caused by global warming. He further documents how access to the cooling effects of trees is unevenly distributed across income levels and race in many cities around the world. Through sharing their deep understanding and appreciation of trees and forests, Wohlleben and Haskell invite us to think differently about all species and how they are all mutually entangled.

An essay called \"Identity in Transit\" (Kassel 28 May 2016) takes place in the spaces of travel that seem exotic now because they are estranged from experience under lockdown: \"the departure gate of an airport, or else at a border, at a hotel desk, at the counter for a car rental agency.\" For Preciado, who had at that point been taking testosterone but had not yet legally transitioned from female to male, showing his passport in these places often provokes the response: \"This is not you!\" To make it through the bureaucracy in such moments, Preciado invokes a far more essentialist notion of gender than the one he has learned from gender deconstruction, holding up a letter from a lawyer indicating that the female sex had been wrongly assigned to him at birth. He makes a provocative analogy with the refugee who seeks to be part of a new sovereign nation, \"trans and migrant people are placed in the parodic position of asking to be recognized as subjects by those same State apparatuses that exclude and violently threaten them.\"",

None have had quite the feeling of an event, as this one did. Will events ever return? I myself cross borders relentlessly, in ordinary times. Now, as is the norm for academics, I spend almost all of my time at home. Preciado still helps. His essay \"Learning from the Virus,\" published in Art Forum, has been one of the few lockdown think-pieces that has been thought provoking for me. It opens: \"If Michel Foucault had survived AIDS in 1984 and had stayed alive until the invention of effective antiretroviral therapy, he would be ninety-three years old today. Would he have agreed to confine himself in his apartment on rue de Vaugirard in Paris?\" At a time when almost everyone else I knew seemed to be embracing lockdown life and flaunting their own strict adherence to bodily isolation as if submitting to the dominant biopolitical order were suddenly uncomplicatedly good, Preciado was already attentive to the fraught biopolitical stakes.

Many of us, not least those whose lives are already tough, are anxious, sad, worried, miserable, angry, scared, exhausted, stir crazy, lonely, troubled, distressed, perturbed, apprehensive, occasionally dejected, sometimes terrified as our meager financial resources melt away before our eyes. But this language of the emotions seems not enough. What is at stake, it seems, is our mental health. The newspapers are full of stories about those experiencing mental health problems, charities and experts give us advice on how to manage our mental health, exercise gurus frame their injunctions to stretch, jump, run, and so forth, not just for the good for our locked-in bodies, but because they are good for our mental health. Awareness is all. Once we are aware that the feelings we are experiencing are mental health problems, once we can speak openly about these mental health problems to family, friends, and employers, we are en route to a solution. No stigma, no shame-who could not welcome the fact that mental health has come out of the shadows?",

The Anarchy has little to say directly about India's environment, natural resources, or geographic conditions. But it is surely significant that the events that most nearly stopped the EIC's rise in its tracks-the Bengali famine that began in 1769-was partially a \"natural\" disaster, caused by a confluence of EIC greed and environmental conditions (particularly weather). The famine killed about ten million people. It also not only caused the value of the company to plummet, but instigated a long road of parliamentary investigations that, eventually, brought the company increasingly under the control of the British Crown.",

But the narrative is at its best when it is able to step back and make broader, global historical connections. One of the indirect effects of the Bengali famine, for example, was the 1773 Tea Act-an attempt by the British parliament to protect the EIC's fortunes by selling and taxing EIC tea in the American colonies.

Although, again, The Anarchy, to its detriment, is hardly a book about race, ethnicity, or religion, the lessons Cornwallis took from America were remarkably biopolitical: \"[He] was determined to make sure that a settled colonial class never emerged in India to undermine British rule as it had done, to his own humiliation, in America\" (p. 327). In practice, this meant severely restricting the rights of any Anglo-Indians (children born from unions between British men and Indian women). This \"unembarrassedly racist legislation\" disqualified them from owning land, or serving in the military or civil service.

Butler lays out a world that feels palpably familiar-the ravages of inequality seethe, climate change consumes its landscapes, and a greedy and heartless plutocracy puts profits before people. It is a bleak world. The brilliance of Butler's work, as so many have noted, is her choice of \"mundane\" science fiction, a genre not immersed in fantasy, intergalactic travel, or weird looking aliens (who surprisingly eat with forks and knives!).

Having interviewed 125 people to learn from their stories and experiences, Chigudu argues \"the telling of stories is always a political act and, in this way, stories are an especially illuminating prism through which to explore the politics and social contours of the cholera outbreak and its aftermath\" (p.23). But, precisely as an attempt to assemble many different kinds of materials, Chigudu also interviewed government officials and amassed \"an extensive catalogue of documentary sources\" (p. 27) including media articles, technical reports, and scientific studies on the cholera outbreak. For her part, Mason explains how \"in focusing on a local government system in the most powerful non-Western country in the world as a critical node in a global network of disease control, this book decenters the dichotomous relationship between powerful Western actors and victimized non-Western locals presented in much of the ethnographic literature on global health\" (p. 32).

And, for pandemic reading, I can wholeheartedly recommend all three of these books, not only because of their clear relevance for thinking about COVID-19, but also for the contributions they have made to helping us improve our research practices when we take a biological phenomenon (e.g., vibrio cholerae, H1N1 virus, or SARS) as the object of our social study.",

The primary function of anger, Silvan Tomkins claims, is to \"make bad matters worse and further to increase the probability of an angry response\" (p. 115). It has been common in feminist texts to see anger figured as a restorative event: under the right conditions, or in the right hands, anger will lead to clarity and empowerment. I am less sure. I wonder if the appeal of anger, in a manifesto or on a street, is that it makes a bad set of circumstances more noxious. Part of what makes anger so compelling is that it pushes me (and those around me) beyond what is tolerable with no promise of catharsis, or clarity, or a way forward. It seeks the intensification of wretchedness, destruction, ugliness, and pain. If that is the case then the function of anger inside feminism may need reconsideration. Ti-Grace Atkinson saw this early: \"Sisterhood is powerful\" she is alleged to have said \"it kills sisters\" (Joreen 1976, p.92) . Maybe anger in response to misogyny also carries with it the capacity to damage the people and places and ideas that feminism holds dear. If this damage is unavoidable and non-trivial then we are going to need a less idealizing account of what feminist anger does. Manifestos like SCUM help me see how anger-surely a feeling essential to any political action-resists our attempts to contain and control it.",

Filippa Lentzos is a Senior Research Fellow, with a joint appointment in the Department of Global Health & Social Medicine and the Department of War Studies, at King's College London.What Am I Reading? Todd MeyersDepartment of Social Studies of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, CanadaWhat I am reading at the moment is a small effort to orient myself to whatever this moment is. The expatriate-novelist-protagonist, Luswage Amini, of Renee Gladman's Ravickian series--Event Factory (Dorothy, 2010), The Ravickians (Dorothy, 2011), Ana Patova Crosses a Bridge(Dorothy, 2013), and Houses of Ravicka (Dorothy, 2017)--is helping me come to terms with a world that resists translation. Kate Briggs's This Little Art (Fitzcarraldo, 2018), a book on literal translation from the translator of Roland Barthes's seminars at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, shows me that the effort to translate can be a creative act, generative of new forms.So much of the discussion these days is about control--being controlled, exerting control over a situation out of control. Julietta Singh's Unthinking Mastery: Dehumanism and Decolonial Entanglements (Duke University Press, 2018) reminds me that older forms of control do not recede in crisis, and our dissatisfaction with those forms must match their tireless agility and ugly inventiveness.Absorbing loss and becoming accustomed to new ways of mourning are also themes on my nightstand.I started reading Sabrina Orah Mark's Wild Milk (Dorothy, 2018) after being awed by her powerful essay on parenthood, scholarship, and the failures of the academy in The Paris Review (\"Fuck the Bread. The Bread is Over,\" May 7, 2020). Naja Marie Aidt's When Death Takes Something From You Give It Back, translated from Danish by Denise Newman (Coffee House Press, 2019) is a chronicle of mourning written in the aftermath of the sudden loss of her son, a book about reinhabiting the present as much as recollecting the past. Jenn Ashworth's Notes Made While Falling (Goldsmiths, 2019) is an unclassifiable book, at once an intimate story of traumatic childbirth and a critical work on worlds out of alignment. Ashon T. Crawley's The Lonely Letters (Duke University Press, 2020) and T Fleishman's Time is the Thing a Body Moves Through: An Essay (Coffee House Press, 2019) are both books that instrumentalize the body in ways that are often failing, sometimes erotic, but always aiming to grasp something, anything, about ourselves and others. I have returned to dispatches from a different moment of crisis, a moment that never really passed. I find Paula A. Treichler's How to Have Theory in an Epidemic: Cultural Chronicles of AIDS (Duke University Press, 1999) endlessly instructive, now especially on ways we can continue to speak when the value of speech seems to be emptying out. And David Caron's The Nearness of Others: Searching for Tact and Contact in the Age of HIV (University of Minnesota Press, 2014), a book about proximity and the desire to touch and be touched is so relevant in the new age of social distancing and self-isolation. I have been thinking about what comes next and what remains. Sarah M. Broom's The Yellow House (Grove Press, 2019) has me considering what possibilities there are in the return to origins, and what awaits us there. And finally, Susan Stewart's The Ruins Lesson: Meaning and Material in Western Culture (University of ChicagoPress, 2020)  gives me hope that even in aftermath there is something that grows:",
