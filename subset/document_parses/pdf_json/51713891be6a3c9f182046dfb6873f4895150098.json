            "text": "Background: /Aim: Various reports of the occurrence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in patients with COVID-19 have been published, denoting an association between both diseases. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to summarize the prevalence of T1DM in COVID-19 patients and to identify the clinical presentations and outcomes in this patient population. Materials and methods: Up to 10/27/2020, Medline, Embase, cochrane and google scholar databases were searched for original studies investigating the association between COVID-19 and T1DM. A manual search was conducted to identify missing studies. The quality of included studies was analyzed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) risk of bias tool. Outcomes included length of hospital stay, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), severe hypoglycemia, and death. Results: Fifteen studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Included studies reported data of both adult and pediatric patients. The prevalence of T1DM in COVID-19 patients ranged from 0.15% to 28.98%, while the rate of COVID-19 in patients with T1DM ranged from 0% to 16.67%. Dry cough, nausea, vomiting, fever and elevated blood glucose levels were the most commonly reported presentations. The investigated outcomes varied widely among studied populations. Conclusions: The prevalence of T1DM in patients with COVID-19 ranged from 0.15% to 28.98%. The most common presentation of COVID-19 in patients with T1DM included fever, dry cough, nausea and vomiting, elevated blood glucose and diabetic ketoacidosis. The outcomes of COVID-19 in terms of length of hospital stay, hospitalization, ICU admission, DKA rate, and severe hypoglycemia were reported variably in included studies. Due to the heterogeneous study populations and the presence of many limitations, more studies are still warranted to reach a definitive conclusion.",

The interrupted supply of drugs, technology, and care for T1DM patients can result in poor glycemic control and, subsequently, more complications [13] . It also delays the proper response to emergency situations since a significant reduction is reported in emergency department access mainly because of fear of infection [14] .

In our review, we included a total of 15 studies (8 retrospective cohort studies, 3 cross-sectional studies, 2 retrospective case-control studies, 1 retrospective case series, and 1 study of non-specified design). The prevalence of T1DM (known, newly-diagnosed, and non-specified) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in three studies. In the study of Li et al. [22] , the prevalence of T1DM was 0.15% (1/658), while it was 3.0% (39/1317) in the study of Cariou et al. [20] Yang et al. [27] conducted a study among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and they found that COVID-related T1DM (fasting plasma glucose of 7 or more mmol/L 2 months during hospitalization without a previous diagnosis of diabetes) occurred in 28.98% (20/69) of patients. This difference could be attributed to the differences in studied populations, the timing of conduction of the study (during the early pandemic vs. during the late pandemic). Inconsistently, Kumar et al. [45] conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies to investigate the prevalence of DM in patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The authors included 33 studies in their final meta-analysis, which revealed that the pooled prevalence of DM in patients with COVID-19 was 9.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) \u00bc 8.7%e10.9%) after adjusting for the encountered heterogeneity. This finding is different from ours, but this could be attributed to the fact that these authors investigated the prevalence of DM, overall, and not just T1DM. And, the low rate of T1DM among COVID-19 patients in our study could be explained by the fact that T1DM is far less common compared to type 2 DM (T2DM), which was reported in the majority of analyzed studies in the review of Kumar et al. [45] Another possible factor is that some of these studies may have been conducted in areas where COVID-19 was highly prevalent, while it was less prevalent in other countries.",

Therefore, the association between COVID-19 and new-onset diabetes still warrants further investigation in both adults and young children. In this context, we also aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 increased the incidence of newlydiagnosed T1DM; however, relevant data were only reported in two studies. Ebekozien et al. [25] included patients with COVID-19 and T1DM; among them, 15.6% (5/33) had new-onset diabetes. This rate was higher than the study of O'Malley et al. [30] , with a prevalence rate of 1.77% (2/113). On the other hand, Unsworth et al. [24] reported a prevalence rate of new-onset diabetes of 90.1% (30/ 33) among 33 diabetic patients, of whom only 5 were diagnosed of COVID-19. This substantial difference could be explained by the minimal number of included participants in each study, which would result in the over-or under-estimation of the real burden of COVID-19 among patients with T1DM.",

            "text": "Death due to COVID-19 was reported as a single outcome or a composite outcome in some of the included studies. For instance, Barron et al. [19] reported that 1.50% (364/23,698 patients) of patients with T1DM died from COVID-19. Noteworthy, the reported rate of 1.50% does not reflect those with both T1DM and COVID-19 but rather describe the death rate due to COVID-19 among the overall studied population. Meanwhile, Vamvini et al. [26] studies cases with COVID-19 and T1DM and a control group T1DM patients alone. The authors reported that composite outcome (ICU admission and/or intubation and/or death) was dramatically higher in the case group, with a rate of 28.50% (2/7) compared to the 14.30% (4/ 28) in the control group. However, there was no statistically significant difference between both groups, and this could be attributed to the very small sample size. Noteworthy, Al Hayek et al. [18] found no mortality cases in patients with T1DM and COVID-19. Inconsistently, the mortality rate was lower in the study of O'Malley et al. [30] , who reported a rate of 4.0% (5/113). On the other hand, the rate of COVID-19-related death was very low in the study of Holman et al. [21] , who reported a rate of 0.16% (432/ 264,390). Furthermore, in the study of Ebekozien et al. [25] , it was noted that the mortality rate was slightly lower in the case group (COVID-19 and T1DM, 3%), compared to the control group (COVID-19-like disease and T1DM, 3.3%). Of note, Yang et al. [27] found that COVID-19-related T1DM was significantly associated with a higher mortality rate compared to peers (P \u00bc 0.0019). On the other hand, the study of Cariou et al. [20] reported that the risk of death was lower in patients with T1DM (OR \u00bc 0.44; 95% CI: 0.11e1.86). However, this difference did not reach statistical significance. This wide variation in the rate of COVID-19-related deaths in the studied populations, as well as the differences in the risk of death in T1DM, may be attributed to many factors. For instance, the clinical heterogeneity in studied populations (hospitalized patients vs. community-based cases; adults vs. children; the presence of comorbidities vs. absence of comorbidities) could substantially impact the interpretation of these findings. Also, the burden and/or the prevalence of COVID-19 in different regions of the world is not the same, and the exact reason for this variation is not yet clearly understood, and this could possibly account for the differences in our findings. Diabetic ketoacidosis was a prevalent outcome in patients with COVID-19 and T1DM. The rate of DKA was lowest in the study of Vamvini et al. [26] , with a rate of 14.28% (1/7); however, this rate was higher than that observed in controls (without COVID-19, 7.14%; 2/28). Other studies reported higher rates of DKA in patients with COVID-19 and T1DM, where O'Malley et al. [30] , reported a rate of 24.0% (27/113), Unsworth et al. [24] reported a rate of 36.0% (12/33), and Atlas et al. [28] reported a rate of 51.7% (30/ 58) . Noteworthy, in the study of Ebekozien et al. [25] , it was noted that the rate of DKA in patients with COVID-19 (case group) was three folds that of patients without COVID-19 (control group) (45.5% vs. 13.3%), respectively.",

Meanwhile, the acute injury of the islets has been minimally reported in the literature. However, it has been previously reported that viruses were isolated from pancreatic islets with serological evidence of multiple viruses, including Coxsackie B and Mumps, resulting in a few cases of acute diabetes [47] . It has been previously reported that hyperglycemia acts as an independent risk factor of death in SARS-CoV-infected patients [48] . The coupling of the virus to the ACE2 receptor may result in the impairment of the function of ACE2, and the loss of function of this enzyme is reported to cause DM, as observed in ACE2 KO mice [49] . Moreover, the virus can also use the ACE2 as its receptor to be able to get inside the pancreatic islets for replications, causing damage to the pancreatic islet cells, such as the insulin-producing beta cells. This will subsequently lead to insulin deficiency, a direct cause of acute DM, as noted in SARS-CoV-infected patients [50] .",

Second, the populations studied were clinically heterogeneous (some studies included adult patients and others included pediatric populations). Third, the differences in the timing of conducting the study, as well as the country in which the study was conducted, could be responsible for the variations in the reported findings due to the variations in the burden of COVID-19 in different regions. Fourth, the majority of included studies were not designed primarily to estimate the prevalence of new-onset T1DM in COVID-19 patients. Fifth, the small sample size of most included studies made it difficult to reach definitive conclusions. Finally, the radiographic findings of such patients are not properly investigated in the available evidence, and the quality of all included studies was low. Therefore, more studies of larger sample sizes are still warranted to reach a definitive conclusion.",
