            "text": "A homoplasy is a trait shared between individuals that did not arise in a common ancestor, but rather is the result of convergent evolution. SARS-CoV-2 homoplasic mutations are important to characterise, because the evidence for a mutation conferring a fitness advantage is strengthened if this mutation has evolved independently and repeatedly in separate viral lineages. Yet detecting homoplasy is difficult due to insufficient variation between sequences to construct reliable phylogenetic trees. Here, we develop a method to more robustly identify confident homoplasies. We derive a maximum likelihood (ML) tree, with taxa bearing seemingly recurrent mutations dispersed across the tree, and then, for each potentially homoplasic mutation, we derive an alternative tree where the same taxa are constrained to one clade such that the mutation is no longer homoplasic. We then compare how well the two trees fit the sequence data. Applying this method to SARS-CoV-2 yields only a few instances where the constrained trees have significantly less statistical support than unconstrained tree, suggesting phylogenetics can provide limited support for homoplasy in SARS-CoV-2 and that caution is needed when inferring evidence of convergent evolution from phylogenetic methods in the absence of evidence from other sources.",

The British B.1.1.7 (Rambaut et al., 2020) , South African B.1.351 (Tegally et al., 2020) , and Brazilian P.1 (Faria et al., 2021) VOC lineages arose in late 2020 and quickly became dominant within the countries in which they were first detected. The Indian B.1.617.2 variant has also recently been designated as a VOC (Public Health England, 2021) . Additional variants under investigation (VUI), which may be later classified as VOC, continue to appear. There is evidence that some of these new strains have evolved resistance to immunity acquired by prior infection or current vaccines (Greaney et al., 2021; Thomson et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021) possibly undermining development of vaccine induced herd immunity (Naveca et al., 2021) . VOC mutations likely also increase transmissibility (Davies et al., 2021) and virulence or severity of disease. Hence, the surveillance of emerging variants, and the identification of those most likely to have altered phenotypes, is paramount in understanding and controlling the pandemic.",

Some changes may represent an adaptation or response to selective pressure, and might increase in frequency due to the resulting increase in fitness. Current identification of VOCs is based principally on these increases in infection frequency. However, rapid increases in mutation frequency can occur in the absence of any adaptive change due to founder effects (D\u00edez-Fuertes et al., 2021) , poor public health or increased sampling in the region in which the variant emerged, circulation in a sub-population more prone to infection or 'hitchhiking' onto an advantageous change elsewhere (Smith and Haigh, 1974) . Ambiguity in the reason for increases in frequency highlights the importance of other indications of a fitness advantage.

Identification of homoplasic changes generally relies on a reliable phylogenetic tree which establishes that lineages with the same mutation are actually independent. This is difficult for SARS-CoV-2 due to the limited genetic diversity (Duchene et al., 2020) and therefore low phylogenetic signal. Also, phylogenetic trees are mathematical models representing a simplified reconstruction of complex real-life events, with parameters optimised to best fit the data at hand. These models are too simple to represent the underlying evolutionary process and tree construction depends on robustness of the phylogeny to the inevitable model misspecification. Typically, a large number of phylogenetic trees approximately equally fit the observed sequence data. Lack of phylogenetic signal greatly increases the size of the plausible tree set, whilst model misspecification alters the trees included in this set and their relative likelihood values. In this case, the tree with the highest likelihood (the 'best-fitting' tree) is selected, more or less at random, from an immense set of plausible trees with nearly equal support (Morel et al., 2020) , which makes it extremely unlikely that this \"best\" tree represents the true evolutionary history. It is difficult to conclude that some feature of the evolutionary dynamics, such as homoplasy, is supported by the phylogeny if the set of plausible trees includes trees that do and do not support that feature.",

The speed of phylogenetic inferences compared to, for example in vitro or in vivo laboratory experiments make evolutionary analyses extremely useful and attractive for selecting the sequence changes for further study using these more time-consuming methods. To gain robust phylogenetic insights and prioritise SARS-CoV-2 mutations for phenotypic or experimental analyses, we must have a measure of confidence in phylogenetic output. Specifically, we need to address how confident an inference derived from the best-fitting tree is, given the large selection of plausible alternatives. One possibility is to examine whether there are plausible trees where there is no homoplasy at the position under study.",

We first construct the best maximum likelihood (ML) tree derived from SARS-CoV-2 sequences, from which potential homoplasies are identified. Then, for each observed potential homoplasy, we derive an alternative tree, which is the best possible (maximum likelihood) phylogeny given a specific topological constraint. Theoretical examples are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1a and 1b. The topological constraint in each case is a tree in which all taxa bearing the potentially homoplasic mutation are manipulated to be monophyletic. In this latter tree, the mutation is no longer homoplasic, as only one change from a common ancestor would give rise to daughter taxa all with the same change. We then ask: is the constrained tree a significantly worse fit for the sequence data? To determine this, we use the Approximately Unbiased (AU) test (Shimodaira, 2002) , which ascertains whether a certain phylogenetic structure is supported by the sequence data. If the best constrained tree is indeed significantly less well supported, then this analysis provides evidence for homoplasy. In contrast, if the data are also found to be consistent with the constrained tree topology wherein the homoplasy has been removed, then the given site has weak phylogenetic support for homoplasy.",

            "text": "By contrast, Spike mutations have been scrutinised because Spike is an important target for the adaptive immune response, the viral antigen used in all current vaccines, and is relatively simple to functionally characterise in vitro. The statistically supported homoplasies Spike \u220669/70 and \u2206144, are lineage-defining deletions in VOC B.1.1.7 (Rambaut et al., 2020) . \u220669/70 is associated with higher viral loads and may explain the increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 (Kemp et al., 2021) , while \u2206144 abolishes binding of the neutralising antibody, 4A8, and thus is expected to alter Spike antigenicity in the population (McCarthy et al., 2021) . None of the other Spike defining mutations found in VOC B.1.1.7, B.1.351 or P.1 (O'Toole et al., 2020; Rambaut et al., 2020; Tegally et al., 2020; Faria et al., 2021) were significantly supported for homoplasy by our analysis (Supplementary Table 1 ). This was surprising, because recurrent VOC mutations are widely believed to be homoplasic (Ferrareze et al., 2021; Lemmermann et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2021; Resende et al., 2021) . For instance, the Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) mutations E484K, which reduces neutralisation by sera (Collier et al., 2021) (Fig. 2) , and N501Y, which increases affinity to ACE2 (Starr et al., 2020) (Fig. 3) , had weak support for homoplasy. Despite the acquisition and appearance of common VOC mutations in different lineages ( Fig. 2a; Fig. 3a ), we showed that we can still generate a plausible phylogenetic tree that suppresses the homoplasy ( Fig. 2b; Fig. 3b We did observe statistical support for two other homoplasic mutations in the Spike protein: S939F and L5F (Fig. 1) . L5F has been preferentially observed in specific sequencing laboratories, suggesting that it might be a sequencing artefact (De Maio et al., 2020; Turakhia et al., 2020) . Likewise, S939F was reported to be a recurrent artefact by De Maio et al. (2020) , although other studies have predicted that this mutation, which occurs in the 'fusion core' of the HR1 domain, may destabilise the Spike protein (Ahamad et al., 2021) , including the post-fusion assembly (Cavallo and Oliva, 2020) .",

Secondly, even with maximum likelihood analyses, there will be a systematic bias in tree reconstructions due to long branch attraction, in which clades with long branch lengths are inferred to be closely related, regardless of their true evolutionary relationship (Felsenstein, 1978) . Finally, it is clear that the assumptions of the phylogenetic analysis are not fulfilled. For instance, the assumption that every site in the alignment can be treated independently is contradicted by observations of epistatic interactions (Kemp et al., 2021) . Errors due to model misspecification are likely to be a greater problem with longer branches, as the pattern of mutations will be less constrained.

It is not immediately obvious why Spike \u220669/70 and \u2206144, which are found on a long-branch leading to VOC B.1.1.7, were not subject to the same uncertainties as other long-branch changes. The answer might lie in how phylogenetic analyses treat indels and nucleotide changes differently. ML calculations aim to estimate the best parameter values (e.g., topology, branch lengths) to maximise the probability of the sequence data given the model (tree). Homoplasies involve multiple changes of the same type, which is less likely than a single change, decreasing the likelihood of a phylogenetic tree. Algorithms ameliorate this reduction by resolving/removing the homoplasy, but this often has the adverse effect of creating new homoplasies -in other words, by resolving one homoplasy, we often produce a homoplasy at a different site. Thus, maximal likelihood resolves homoplasies which have a substantial penalty in favour of homoplasies that incur a lesser penalty. The problem with indels is that they are considered to be 'missing data', such that they do not have any likelihood consequences. Therefore, phylogenetic algorithms preferentially resolve homoplasies in base substitutions at the detriment of increasing homoplasies in indels. This may produce a general bias towards identifying homoplasic indels with high but potentially mistaken confidence.",

As a result, we analysed only a subset of the available sequences, those selected by Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2). Statistical support for homoplasy was substantially larger when the analysis was repeated with a smaller data set of 524 taxa. The decrease in support with increasing sequence data can result from a number of factors. Fewer sequences results in longer branches and fewer constraints on substitution model parameters, causing biases in the tree reconstruction due to long branch attraction and model misspecification. These biases can easily result in the appearance of seemingly well supported but erroneous homoplasies. In addition, the inclusion of additional taxa exacerbates the difficulties and uncertainties inherent in tree reconstruction, making the set of plausible phylogenetic trees substantially larger and more likely to include trees consistent with absence of homoplasy. For these reasons, it is unlikely that an analysis of a larger number of taxa would yield greater support for the homoplasic mutations. The time required for these calculations precluded the analysis of the most recent data. In particular, our analysis was performed prior to the observation of the various Indian B.1.617 variants. We would expect that the overall conclusion, that phylogenetics provides little support for potential homoplasies, would not be affected. Determining the homoplasies for which there is support would require continued updating of the analysis, but can be streamlined by neglecting homoplasies without statistical support and where additional sequences do not result in additional mutations in the updated unconstrained tree.",

In contrast, we identify a mutation as homoplasic when the ensemble of plausible trees does not contain trees where that mutation is not homoplasic. As a result, we are still able to robustly evaluate statistical support for homoplasies in the absence of a wellsupported phylogenetic tree, since our approach does not depend on knowing the 'correct' phylogeny.",
