This qualitative study was performed based on inductive qualitative content analysis in 2020. The samples were 10 nursing students who were selected purposively from the emergency and intensive care unit wards of hospitals affiliated with Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences in Iran. Data were collected through semistructured and individual interviews and analyzed simultaneously and continuously by Granheim and Landman inductive qualitative content analysis. Experiences of nursing students in the care for patients with COVID-19 include 3 main categories and 7 subcategories: (a) psychological stress (fear of ward and patients and mental conflict), (b) social isolation (rejection by the family and friends, isolation, and concealment of the workplace), and (c) coping strategies as an adaption strategy (a positive impact of spirituality and an effective role of increasing information). According to the findings of this study, the education system and university administrators can help reduce psychological stress and improve the quality of care in nursing students.",

Therefore, they are exposed to a high workload and the risks of infection with the disease for them and their families, leading to some levels of psychological burden (4) . Due to the high global prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the mortality rate caused by the disease, health care workers were more exposed to psychological disorders and anxiety than others due to being at the forefront of fighting this disease. Moreover, health care workers should wear masks and heavy protective clothing, which limit their movement and cause difficulty in performing medical procedures and practices compared to normal conditions (5) . Studies showed that those health care workers feared contagion and infection of their family, friends, and colleagues (6) , felt uncertainty and stigmatization (6, 7) , reported reluctance to work or contemplating resignation (7) , and reported experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, which could have long-term psychological implications (8) . Similar concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising (9) . Creating emotional problems and mental disorders such as stress, anxiety, and fear is one of the inevitable consequences of this disease that can cause stress, depression, and even suicide. Given that students, as a critical element of the educational system, have a unique role in achieving the educational system, it is essential to pay attention to their mental, emotional, and physical health (10) (11) (12) .",

In the United Kingdom retired nurses and undergraduate nursing students have become part of the workforce (13) . However, with predictions of significant staff shortages as patient care needs increased and as health workers themselves became unwell, the possibility for nursing students to support the clinical workforce was explored (14, 15) . On the other hand, nursing internship students, due to their close interaction with the hospital are affected by various conditions such as fear of being a Coronavirus carrier and its transmission to the family, high job fatigue, reduced sleep quality, malnutrition, fear of death, lack of proper communication with the family, frustration, violent behavior, etc. Research on sources of anxiety among health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the need to be heard, prepared, and supported (16) . So, concerning the nursing community is essential to at the time that they are directly fighting this disease. Due to the job prospects of many nursing students depend on this. The ignoring of nurses needs could create a pessimistic vision for the nursing students, followed by a lack of interest in education, academic decline, dropping out of school, changing the field, etc (17) .",

The research subjects were experienced in the care of COVID-19 patients so that they visited different wards as nursing students and performed the care of COVID-19 patients. The inclusion criteria consisted of being able to communicate, nursing students in the seventh or eighth semester who are spending the last year of their studies and having experienced in the care of COVID-19 patients. After interviewing 10 nursing students, data were collected continuously until no new data or codes about the phenomenon were added in the last interview. The sampling process aimed to select different gender (male: 5, female: 5), age (23) (24) (25) , and cultures (Bojnourd: 1, Tehran: 1, Tonekabon: 1, Amol: 3, Babol: 2, and Sari: 2) to provide rich, wide, and deep information so as to gain possible maximum variation in sampling.",

The nurses somehow quarantined themselves due to the stress of transmitting the disease to a family member. They tried to keep their distance from others in different ways.

They expressed interest in serving their country and patients (39) . Other research has shown what was expected of them as students were not the same as those in the workforce. This is described as a transition shock. Thus, when students approach their graduation, they lack confidence (40, 41) . This is why participants conceived this experience as an opportunity to improve their training, gaining confidence and skills, and taking care of patients without having full responsibility for them.
