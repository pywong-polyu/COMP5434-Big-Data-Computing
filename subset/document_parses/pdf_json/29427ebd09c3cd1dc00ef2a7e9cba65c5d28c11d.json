In this study, bioaccumulation potentials of 18 QACs with alkyl chain lengths of C8\u2212C18 were determined in the in vitro\u2212in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) model using the results of human hepatic metabolism and serum protein binding experiments. The slowest in vivo clearance rates were estimated for C12-QACs, suggesting that these compounds may preferentially build up in blood. The bioaccumulation of QACs was further confirmed by the analysis of human blood (sera) samples (n = 222). Fifteen out of the 18 targeted QACs were detected in blood with the \u03a3QAC concentrations reaching up to 68.6 ng/mL. The blood samples were collected during two distinct time periods: before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (2019; n = 111) and during the pandemic (2020, n = 111). The \u03a3QAC concentrations were significantly higher in samples collected during the pandemic (median 6.04 ng/mL) than in those collected before (median 3.41 ng/mL). This is the first comprehensive study on the bioaccumulation and biomonitoring of the three major QAC groups and our results provide valuable information for future epidemiological, toxicological, and risk assessment studies targeting these chemicals.",

            "text": "Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) have been extensively used as disinfectants, antimicrobials, and surfactants in a variety of consumer, pharmaceutical, medical, and personal care products for more than 70 years. 1 QACs are organic salts of ammonium with aryl and alkyl substitutes and the major QAC groups include benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs), dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DDACs), and alkyltrimethylammonium compounds (AT-MACs) [ Figure S1 , Supporting Information, SI]. Several QACs are considered high production volume chemicals by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) with production volumes reaching up to 50 million pounds in 2015. 2 During the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid- 19) pandemic, disinfecting of the indoor and outdoor environment has considerably expanded in order to limit disease transmission, leading to the increased use of disinfecting chemicals. 1 The U.S. EPA's List N that includes disinfecting products effective against the SARS-CoV-2 has more than 200 products containing certain QACs as active ingridients. 1 In addition, more frequent hand washing with antibacterial soaps has also likely led to the increased use of BACs that replaced triclosan banned by the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) in 2016. 1, 3 BACs may constitute on average about 1.8% (by weight) in soaps and multipurpose sprays. 4, 5 In addition, DDACs and ATMACs can be intentionally or unintentionally added to surface disinfectants. 5, 6 Increased disinfection practices are likely to continue beyond the pandemic and it is anticipated that the surface disinfectant market will grow by \u223c10% worldwide during 2020\u22122027. 1 In addition, QACs are also the common ingredients in personal care and other household products. 1, 7 For example, DDACs are used in fabric softeners and ATMACs are used in cosmetics and hair conditioners. 1, 7, 8 The large-scale manufacturing and use of these compounds have led to their widespread presence in the environment, including surface water, sediment, and soil. 9\u221215 BACs (e.g., C12-and C14-BACs [i.e., BACs with 12 and 14 carbons in their alkyl chains, respectively]) and DDACs (e.g., C10-DDAC), have been found in fruits, food additives, milk, and other dairy products, though their levels did not exceed the acceptable daily intake (0.1 mg/kg) established by the European Food Safety Authority. 16\u221220 We recently reported a widespread occurrence of 19 QACs, including 7 BACs, 6 DDACs, and 6 ATMACs, in indoor residential dust detected at concentrations reaching up to 531 \u03bcg/g (\u223c1% by weight). 5 A recent exposure modeling study showed that dermal contact with surfaces disinfected using QAC-containing products may pose health risks, especially for children, even if the surfaces are disinfected once a day. 4 These studies indicate that humans are widely exposed to QACs through diet, accidental dust ingestion, and dermal absorption.",

            "text": "There is a growing concern of the QAC toxicity. The U.S. FDA has recently requested additional safety data on certain active ingredients, including BACs, in medical and consumer antiseptic products. 21, 22 Moreover, additional scientific evidence points to the high toxicity of BACs, DDACs, and ATMACs in aquatic organisms. 9 Animal studies show that skin irritation is the most frequently observed symptom of subchronic exposure to BACs and DDACs. 23\u221225 In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that BACs and DDACs can exacerbate inflammation and disrupt mitochondrial function and cholesterol homeostasis. 26\u221233 Chronic exposure through a BAC-containing diet resulted in a significant decline of fertility and fecundity in both male and female mice along with increased dam mortality. 34, 35 Furthermore, maternal exposure to low levels of BACs in rodents led to neural defects in their embryos 36 and inhalation exposure to QAC-containing aerosols induced pulmonary cell damage and inflammation. 30, 31 Human epidemiological studies on the health effects of exposure to QACs are limited and mostly include occupational exposure studies linking QACs to exacerbation of asthma-related symptoms. 37\u221239 In a recent study, the concentrations of BACs and DDACs in human blood were associated with the increase in inflammatory cytokines, decrease in the mitochondrial function, and disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in a dose-dependent manner at levels detected in the general population. 40 The bioaccumulation potential of QACs in humans is not well understood as it has been assumed that most QACs do not bioaccumulate due to their high water-solubility 24, 25, 41 and poor intake via dermal and oral absorption (<10%). 42\u221246 However, there is a growing evidence showing that certain QACs can accumulate in blood and other tissues. Herron et al. (2019) has shown that dietary exposure to C12-and C16-BACs can lead to detection of these compounds in mice, including maternal blood and neonatal brain, suggesting that BACs can accumulate in tissues and even cross the bloodplacental barrier. 29 A recent study reported C10\u2212C16 BACs and C10-DDAC detected in 80% of human blood samples collected from the general U.S. population at mean concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1.58 ng/mL. 40 In addition, exposure models also predict that blood concentrations of C8\u2212C18 BACs and C8\u2212C12 DDACs in adults can range from 0.03 to 11 and 0.4 to 5.4 ng/mL, respectively. 4 The Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program has categorized QACs as a high priority for biomonitoring in children. 47 QACs were also added to the list of priority chemicals to monitor in the general population by the Biomonitoring California program in 2021. 48 The biological effects of chemical pollutants in organisms strongly depend on their accumulated levels in the body and are directly related to exposure levels and biotransformation processes. 49 Biotransformation rates of QACs can be measured in vitro and extrapolated to account for in vivo metabolism through clearance models. 49, 50 This approach has been used to estimate the intrinsic clearance rates for a number of environmental contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and organophosphate esters. 50\u221252 It has been previously reported that BACs were metabolized quickly in human liver microsomes through a cytochrome P450 enzyme mediated process and that their metabolic rates were dependent on the length of the alkyl chain in their structure (C10 > C12 > C14 > C16), suggesting enhanced metabolic stability of the longer chain BACs. 53 However, the human biotransformation of many other widely used QACs, including DDACs and ATMACs, has not yet been examined. Studying metabolism of QACs would help understand the bioaccumulation potential of these compounds as well as their toxicity and provide guidance for future epidemiological and risk assessment studies. 53, 54 Here, we conducted an in vitro metabolism assay using human liver microsomes and serum protein binding experiments where the in vitro hepatic biotransformation rates (CL in vitro ) and unbound fraction (f ub ) values for 18 QACs, including 6 BACs (C8\u2212C18), 6 DDACs (C8\u2212C18), and 6 ATMACs (C8\u2212C18), were determined. Bioaccumulation potentials of these compounds were calculated using a hepatic clearance in vitro\u2212in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) model. We also measured these 18 QACs in human blood (sera) samples (n = 222) collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed us to evaluate the general QAC occurrence in human blood and to assess the effect of the pandemic 1,5 on the QAC levels. This is the first comprehensive study on bioaccumulation potentials and biomonitoring of the three major QAC groups and our results provide valuable information for future epidemiological, toxicological, and risk assessment studies targeting this class of compounds.",

The substrate concentration (0.5 \u03bcM) used in this study was based on the predicted blood concentration using in vitro bioactivity data. 4 After preincubation in a shaker at 37\u00b0C for 5 min, a NADPHgenerating system (NADP 6.5 mM, glucose 6-phosphate 16.5 mM, MgCl 2 16.5 mM, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 U/mL) was added to initiate the reaction. The incubation was performed in triplicates at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 \u03bcL of chilled acetonitrile after 0; 0.5; 1; 1.5; 2; 2.5; and 3 h of incubation. A reaction with heat-deactivated microsomes was used as a negative control to assess potential background interferences and nonenzymatic changes. All incubation reactions were conducted on the same day to avoid the intralaboratory variability. After the incubation, the mixture was ultrasonicated with 500 \u03bcL acetonitrile for 1 h and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred into a clean vial and the residue was re-extracted with 500 \u03bcL acetonitrile twice.

A similar trend was found in a recent study that reported the human hepatic clearance rates for BACs decreased with the increase in length of their alkyl chains (C10 > C12 > C14 > C16) 53 and in studies on biotransformation of BACs and ATMACs in aquatic organisms and bacteria. 60, 61 ATMACs were generally metabolized at slower rates than BACs and DDACs. The biotransformation rates of ATMACs ranged from 0.042 to 0.165 mL/h/mg protein, up to 10 times lower than those for BAC and DDAC homologues with the same length of the alkyl chain. The higher metabolic stability of ATMACs can be explained by the substitution of the benzyl group in the BAC structure with a methyl group in the ATMAC structure ( Figure  S1 ), making the latter more resistant to biotransformation via oxidation (e.g., hydroxylation or epoxidation). 60, 62 Binding affinity to blood proteins plays an important role in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a chemical 49, 50, 57 where only the unbound portion of the substrate is available for metabolism. 50 The f ub is the unbound fraction of QACs in blood (Table 1) , which is dependent on the binding affinity of QACs to serum proteins. The f ub values for the target QACs were all below 0.5 (range 0.040\u22120.284), indicating that only a small fraction of QACs can be transferred to and undergo metabolism in the liver. The f ub generally decreased with the increasing length of the alkyl chain for the C8\u2212C12 compounds, then increased for the C14 homologue and declined for the C16\u2212C18 QACs. The lowest f ub was found for C12-BAC (0.048) and C12-ATMAC (0.027), due to their strong binding affinities to serum proteins (Table S6 and Figure S6 ). The structure-dependent binding potency of these 63 and was also found for per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) when the C8 PFAS exhibited the strongest binding affinity to serum proteins, 64\u221268 compared to other PFAS with shorter or longer carbon chains.",

The in vivo hepatic clearance rates (CL in vivo ) calculated based on the in vitro metabolic rates and protein binding affinities (eq 7) are given in Table 1 and Figure 1 . While CL in vivo rates generally decreased with the increase in the length of the alkyl chain for all three QAC groups, the C12 homologues had the slowest in vivo hepatic clearance rates compared to the C14 and C16 homologues. For example, CL in vivo for C12-ATMAC was 2\u22124 times lower than those for C14-and C16-ATMACs. This relationship of the in vivo clearance rates with the length of the alkyl chain was different from that found for the in vitro clearance rates described in the previous section, further emphasizing the effect the binding affinities to serum proteins could have on the clearance of xenobiotics. For example, the higher binding affinity of C12-BAC to serum proteins reduces its unbound fraction in blood, which may lead to its slower clearance from the body, even though its hepatic metabolism is faster than that for the BACs with longer chain alkyl substitutes in their structure. The slower in vivo clearance rates of C12-QACs determined here suggest that these compounds may preferentially build up in blood. Similar CL in vivo rates were found for C10\u2212C16 BACs and C10-DDAC, suggesting a comparable build up potential for these compounds.",

            "text": "The \u2211QAC concentrations in blood collected during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly higher than those in blood collected before the pandemic (p < 0.05 based on a Table 2 ). The overall increase in the \u03a3BAC and \u03a3ATMAC concentrations was 174% and 40%, respectively (p < 0.05). Specifically, the levels of C12-, C14-, and C16-BACs and C14-ATMAC in samples collected during the pandemic were up to 3 times higher than those in samples collected before the pandemic ( Table 2 and Figure 2) . One of the possible explanations of the significant increase in BAC and ATMAC levels during the pandemic could be the increased use of household disinfecting products; however, this suggestion needs to be taken with caution as we did not collect information on the disinfectant use from the participants in this study. Our previous research shows that 72% of the households increased the disinfection frequency during the pandemic and over 80% of households regularly used QAC-containing disinfecting products. BACs contributed up to 64% to the \u2211QAC concentrations in some of the products used in these homes (Products 1\u22123 from Zheng et al. 2020) and ATMACs contributed up to 82% (Products 4\u22127). 5 No significant change was found in the \u03a3DDAC concentrations in blood collected before and during the pandemic, possibly due to the low detection frequencies of these QACs in both sample groups. Another possible explanation for this could be that because DDACs are more commonly used as antistatic and fabric softener additives than as disinfectants the change in DDAC concentrations in serum is not significant as a function of the pandemic. 1 Significantly higher \u2211QAC concentrations were found in samples collected in May, June, July, and August 2020 compared to those in samples collected during the same months of 2019 (p < 0.05; Figure S7 ). The highest median \u2211QAC concentration was observed in August 2020, when the pandemic was still ongoing in the United States (median 5.95 ng/mL, Figure S7 ). The QACs with slower in vivo clearance rates (Table 1 ) were detected at higher levels in serum, further suggesting a higher bioaccumulation potential for these compounds. A similar trend was observed for organophosphate esters 50 and polybrominated diphenyl ethers 51 in previous hepatic metabolism studies. The slowest in vivo clearance rates (0.114\u22120.505 mL/h/g liver, respectively) were determined here for C12\u2212 C16 ATMACs, and these compounds were found at the relatively high concentrations in both sample groups. BACs that generally had faster in vivo clearance rates compared to ATMACs were detected, on average, at lower concentrations than the corresponding ATMAC homologues. The levels of QACs in human serum found in this study were lower than previously reported concentrations of PFAS in serum or plasma (median 9.27\u221220.8 ng/mL) 69, 70 and those of synthetic phenolic antioxidants (8.52 ng/mL), 71 but higher than those of photoinitiators in serum from the United States (0.821 ng/ mL). 54 The frequent detection of QACs in blood collected from the general population provides evidence of the widespread QAC exposure. Uses of QACs in various settings, including hospitals, childcare facilities, offices, and other public spaces, along with residential use, have increased significantly during the Covid-19 pandemic. 1, 5 Moreover, the increased improper use of QAC-containing products since the outbreak of Covid-19 can exacerbate the ongoing exposure. Poison centers of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received more than 17 000 calls related to improper disinfectant use during January\u2212 March 2020, indicating an overall increase of 16.4% in such calls compared to 2018. 72 The elevated levels of QACs in blood collected during the pandemic found here could be related to the increased use of the QAC-containing disinfecting products; however, a direct connection cannot be made based on our data as the information on disinfecting practices was not collected.",

            "text": "Potential Exposure Pathways. Our previous study has reported the first evidence of a widespread exposure to QACs in the indoor environment during the Covid-19 pandemic and suggested dust ingestion as a potential human exposure pathway. 5 Here, we compared the distribution profiles of the three QAC groups in dust reported in this previous study 5 and in blood collected during the pandemic based on the relative contribution of each QAC group to the \u03a3QAC concentrations. This comparison (Figure 3) shows that the QAC distribution patterns in these two matrices are somewhat different (48%, 2%, and 50% in serum vs 56%, 26% and 18% in dust for BACs, DDACs, and ATMACs, respectively). While both blood and dust have similar contributions of \u03a3BACs, the \u03a3ATMAC contribution in blood is much higher than that in dust, indicating that other exposure pathways may contribute to the burden of ATMACs in blood. ATMACs are more volatile based on their lower octanol-air partitioning coefficients (log K OA 8.17\u221211.8) 73 compared to BACs and DDACs (11.0\u2212 18.2) 73 and thus have a higher potential to evaporate from products and to partition to air, similar to other contaminants with lower log K OA values such as polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. 74, 75 Hence, inhalation could be another significant exposure pathway for more volatile QACs, like ATMACs. However, there are no data on the occurrence of QACs in air except one study that has reported high concentrations of C12\u2212C16 BACs and C10-DDAC in the hospital air after spraying a QAC-containing product. 76 Our unpublished data from indoor passive polyurethane foam samplers 77 (n = 6) deployed in homes for 4 weeks show that indoor air \u03a3QAC concentrations can reach up to Figure 3 ). 48 The high abundance of ATMACs in air suggests inhalation as a potentially important exposure pathway in the indoor environment that may lead to the buildup of ATMACs in blood. In addition to dust ingestion and inhalation, exposure to QACs via dermal absorption and mouthing-mediated ingestion of surface residues should be taken into consideration in future studies. Strengths and Limitations. Our results provide important insights into the human hepatic biotransformation and first biomonitoring data for three QAC groups. The frequent detection of QACs in blood demonstrates a widespread human exposure in the general population. Our data highlight the importance of biomonitoring of a wide range of QACs as we report for the first time ATMACs as the most abundant QAC group in blood. Moreover, the higher QAC concentrations in blood collected during the pandemic suggest increased exposure during this period, possibly due to the increased disinfection of the indoor and outdoor environment.",

First, the molecular weight membrane cutoff of the ultracentrifugation filter used in this study was 10 kDa and did not retain some small serum proteins and peptides (<10 kDa), which may result in underestimating the binding affinities. The clearance rates determined here for QACs only characterize the hepatic metabolism and do not account for other clearance mechanisms (e.g., biliary or renal). The extrapolation from in vitro to in vivo includes uncertainties related to the variability of scaling factors applied in the model (e.g., microsomal protein and hepatic blood flow). 49 The samples collected before and during the pandemic were not paired and there is a possibility of other confounding factors contributing to the differences in the QAC concentrations found between the two groups. Because we were not able to collect information on the use of disinfecting products in participants' homes, we cannot provide direct evidence showing that the increased use of disinfectants was associated with the elevated levels of QACs in blood collected during the Covid-19 pandemic; however, this was not the main goal of this study.
