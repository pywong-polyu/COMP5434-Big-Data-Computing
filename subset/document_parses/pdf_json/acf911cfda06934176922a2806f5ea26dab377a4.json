Currently, vaccination is one of the main measures to control these two diseases; however, there are few combination vaccines that can prevent these two diseases. To determine the effect of combination immunization, we developed capsid-derived (Cap) virus-like particles (VLPs) of PCV2 and a new recombinant chimera composed of the P97R1, P46, and P42 antigens of Mhp. Then we investigated the immune responses induced by the immunization with this combination vaccine in mice and piglets.",

The lymphocyte proliferative response in PCV2 group was stronger than that in PBS, VP, Mhp CV in mice. The antibody levels for Cap remained stable and reached the peak at 35 DAI. The IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 in sera were significantly enhanced in the Pro group than that in the negative control-VP group on Day 14 and 28 post-the first immunization in piglets.",

This chronic respiratory disease is widely spread all over the world and causes considerable economic loss [1, 2] . The specific adhesion of Mhp with cilia of epithelial cells of the respiratory tract is the key step for Mhp infection. Multiple functional adhesion factors (e.g. P97, P46, P42, P216, P102, P95, and P159), found in recent years, are involved in the adhesion process and are tightly associated with the pathogenicity and immunogenicity of Mhp [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The C-terminal region of the adhesin P97 (P97R1), which are much conserved among the different strains of Mhp, plays an important role in the adherence [9] [10] [11] . Many researchers have focused on studying this conserved region The molecular chaperone DnaK (P42) and membrane surface protein (P46) are another two important adhesion factors, which can be potentially used in vaccine research [4, 5, [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

Currently, mainly separate vaccination is relied on for each disease, which causes great inconvenience to the immune process and causes an economic burden to farm managers. It has been reported that a chimera composed of the P97R1, P95, P46 and P42 antigens of Mhp showed good results in mouse immune responses [4] . Moreover, Cap protein of PCV2 can be assembled into VLPs by the Escherichia coli (E. coli) system and were able to induce specific antibody responses in pigs [22] . Therefore, the combined injection of several antigens of Mhp and Cap antigen of PCV2 may achieve simultaneous protection on both diseases. In the present study, we first developed a recombinant chimeric protein composed of the P97R1, P46, and P42 antigens of Mhp and recombinant Cap VLPs of PCV2 and then evaluated the immunogenicity of a combined vaccination using these two kinds of proteins in mice and piglets.",

However, some studies have shown that these commercial vaccines for MPS could not induce satisfied levels of antibodies against Mhp antigens [23] . Therefore, there may still be some defects in commercial vaccines, although these commercial vaccines were prevalent used in swine industry. Because the large variety of adhesion factor proteins in Mhp causes difficulty in antigen selection and the development of protein vaccines involves problems of expression, assembly and purification, there are no genetically engineered vaccines for Mhp but a few genetically engineered vaccines for PCV2 available on the market now [24, 25] . Therefore, it is of great value to the development of genetically engineered vaccines for Mhp and PCV2. The development of combined vaccines or combined vaccination strategies has gradually become the main trend to adapt to the needs of the market. Recently, researchers evaluated some of these combined vaccines and obtained good results in the immune reaction induced by them in mice or pigs [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Combined vaccines can not only reduce cross-infection between diseases but can also reduce the labor of animal keepers. However, the purity, safety, efficiency, duration of the effects and production costs of these kinds of vaccines have become problems that should be of great concern. Therefore, the combined vaccination of some singledisease vaccines has become a good strategy to solve these problems in the development of combined vaccines.",

The total IgG antibody levels reflect the level of the systemic humoral immune response. Sera from the Pro group had good reactivity with all four antigens, which maintained increasing trends during the mouse immunization phase (Fig. 7) . Results of IgG isotypes levels suggest that the combined vaccination induced a mixed Th1/Th2-type response in mice, which show as strong humoral immunity against antigens from Mhp and a strong cellular immune effect against PCV2 in mice (Fig. 8) . The predominant production of humoral immunity induced by the rP97R1P46P42 chimera is consistent with research by de Oliveira et al. (2017), but the level of the cellular immune effect is lower than that in their studies. This discrepancy may be due to the different types of adjuvant we used. Studies have shown that oil adjuvants can induce a higher IgG2 immune response [31] . Freund's adjuvant as an oil adjuvant is widely used in human and animal preliminary immune experiments, and has played a good adjuvant role in the results of other researchers [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . However, it seems that his effect on the production of chimeric antigen-specific antibody is not good. Analyses of lymphocyte proliferation levels and total IgG and IgG isotype levels show that lymphocytes or sera from the Mhp CV group did not react with all the antigens. This can be ascribes to the commercial Mhp vaccine strain does not produce these antigens or expressed them at low levels, which was similar to the results of other researchers [4, 5, 15, 23, 40] . For the detection of Mhp strain 168 and PCV2 strain ZJ/C extracts as antigens, serum showed good reactivity with native proteins from these two strains (Fig. 9 ). In this study, Cap VLPs played an important role in combined vaccination, which manifested in better induction of humoral and cellular immunity against Cap than that induced by the PCV2 commercial vaccine.",

Therefore, in practical applications, because of the different environments of pig farms, commercial vaccines may not always have a good protective effect against local field strains. In contrast, the vaccine produced by the specific antigens of pathogens using a genetic engineering method keeps a good immune effect [41, 42] . Despite the antigen selection of the Mhp chimera in this study is based on the results of de Oliveira et al. (2017), we analyzed the function of the four antigens they selected, screened out three of them, and further evaluated their immunogenicity in piglets. Although chimeras developed with more antigen components may be able to induce more comprehensive immunity, the results showed that the humoral immune response induced by the chimera we developed could be more balanced through serum analysis of IgG levels against subunit antigens. The formation of a chimera from fewer subunits may be more beneficial to the exposure of these subunit epitopes. Although the number of samples in pig immunization experiments is limited, it is enough to prove that combined immunization can induce humoral and cellular immune effects in piglets. It also shows good compatibility between the two components, which provides a theoretical basis for a large number of challenge experiments in next step.",

Cap (lacking the nuclear localization signal of 41 amino acid residues) from the PCV2 isolate ShanDong3-2016 (KY656098.1) was used as the other antigen (Table 1 ) [43] . A flexible linker GGSG (GlyGlySerGly) was inserted between each chimeric subunit protein of Mhp to enable the proper folding of the protein. The chimeric gene of Mhp was named rp97R1p46p42. The three-dimensional structure of the chimeric protein rP97R1P46P42 was predicted using the I-TASSER online software (https://zhanglab. ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) [44] .",

RPMI-1640 medium was used as a negative control, and Concanavalin A (5 \u03bcg/mL; Sigma, USA) was used as a positive control. Each splenic lymphocyte sample was plated in triplicate. The proliferative activity was measured by a standard MTT method. The optical density (OD) was determined at a wavelength of 490 nm, and the stimulation index (SI) was calculated as follows: SI = mean OD of antigen-stimulated cells (rP97R1, rP46, rP42, and Cap added)/mean OD of unstimulated cells (RPMI-1640 added).",
