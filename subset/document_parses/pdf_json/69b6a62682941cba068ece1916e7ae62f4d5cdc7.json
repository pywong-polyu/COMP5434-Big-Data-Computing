On the other hand, higher sedentary time during the pandemic period can have deleterious effects. The objective of this study was to compare physical activity levels, sedentary time, and sleep parameters during the pre-COVID period and the COVID-19 pandemic period in young badminton athletes. Methods Fifteen young badminton athletes were evaluated during a pre-COVID period (July 2019) and during the COVID-19 period (July 2020). Sleep parameters, physical activity level, and sedentary time were measured using a tri-axial accelerometer. Participants wore the accelerometer on their dominant wrist for 7 days consecutively. In addition, the average of each sleep parameter [time in bed and total sleep time in hours per day, sleep efficiency (%), wake after sleep onset (WASO, total per day), and sleep latency (minutes per day)] was reported over the 7-day period. Results Athletes presented increased sedentary time (pre-COVID = 7.0 \u00b1 1.1 vs.COVID-19 = 8.9 \u00b1 1.9 h/day, p = 0.004, d = 1.30) and significant decreases in the total PA observed in counts per day (pre-COVID = 2,967,064.4 \u00b1 671,544.1 vs. COVID-19 = 1,868,210.2 \u00b1 449,768.4 counts/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.99), time in vigorous PA (pre-COVID = 7.7 \u00b1 0.9 vs. COVID-19 = 6.1 \u00b1 1.2 h/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.56), and time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (pre-COVID = 8.1 \u00b1 0.9 vs. COVID-19 = 6.5 \u00b1 1.3 h/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.48). There were no significant differences for time in light and moderate PA or in sleep parameters (p > 0.05). Conclusion Young badminton athletes presented increased sedentary time, and decreased total physical activity, time in MVPA, and time in vigorous activities during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID period, however, there were no significant differences in sleep parameters.",

Sedentary behaviors (SB) are conceptualized as activities with energy expenditure \u2264 1.5 metabolic equivalents (MET), such as watching television, using a computer or smartphone, and playing video games [3] , SB are associated with impaired glucose metabolism [4] , cardiovascular diseases and mortality [5] , and low physical fitness [6] . Weiler et al. [7] verified that 79% of the daily routine of English first division professional football players was characterized by SB. Sperlich et al. [5] demonstrated that rowers of the German elite, despite complying with the time recommendations for moderate-vigorous PA, remained in SB for more than 11.5 h a day. Thus, although highly trained athletes accomplish the moderate-to-vigorous PA recommendations, they present an amount of SB similar to individuals who do not meet the recommendations.",

In fact, 2 meta-analysis with more than 90,000 subjects, showed a decrease in PA and an increase in SB [11, 12] during social isolation and lockdown periods around the world. Highly trained athletes need to adapt, or in some cases stop, their regular training sessions and competitive routine for several weeks-which is likely to decrease their strength and endurance performance after detraining [13] , inducing possible degeneration of all the structures of a joint [14] , during social isolation for COVID-19, which can change their habitual PA and SB, and lead to lower sleep quality [15] . In non-athlete populations, the association of a reduction in PA [16] [17] [18] and increased SB [19] with lower sleep quality is well accepted.",

Differences between sports disciplines such as triathlon, volleyball, and soccer [22] can affect the sleep quality of athletes. In addition, the form of stimulus (which has been impacted during the pandemic), such as high-intensity interval training or small-sided game training [23] , can also affect the sleep quality of athletes. Therefore, the training and sleep quality of athletes are known to be complex issues [23, 24] , and comparing the pandemic period with the period prior to the pandemic is relevant in badminton athletes.",

Paoli and Musumeci [14] showed that higher ST could decrease performance in athletes, reducing maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max), strength, and endurance capacity, regardless of their previous physical fitness condition [13] . Furthermore, lower time in sedentary breaks and less skeletal muscle activity can increase the risk of muscle-tendon injuries and also impair metabolic mechanisms associated with glucose and triglyceride absorption [33] . In this sense, decreased ST and increased sedentary breaks are extremely important for people of all ages and populations. Although the athletes presented substantially decreased amounts of physical activity (total counts per day), and time in vigorous activities and MVPA during the COVID-19 pandemic, all of them accumulated the amount of MVPA suggested by the WHO [1] in both the pre-COVID (486.1 min/ day) and COVID-19 periods (392 min/day), which may be a protective factor in these athletes. According to the WHO [1] , the increase in physical activity level, mainly moderate-vigorous activities, can improve the immune response c Time in moderate physical activity (hours per day) in mean and standard deviation; d Time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in mean and standard deviation; e Time in vigorous physical activity (hours per day) in mean and standard deviation; f Total counts (counts per day) in mean and standard deviation to infections, which would be very important during the pandemic period [34] . Mart\u00ednez-de-Quel et al. [35] agreed in part with our data, since the authors analyzed the impact of mandatory confinement in students over 18 years old using the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire to measure PA and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to verify the sleep quality. The authors demonstrated that a total of 48 days locked down at home had a negative impact on PA and sleep quality. In the present study, after about 90 days locked down at home, the athletes also presented decreased PA levels and increased ST. However, there is no updated scientific information about the amount of physical activity that may prevent a decrease in athlete performance and future studies should investigate the chronic effect of ST on performance.",

With regard to the quantity and quality of sleep, Kent et al. [15] showed that a social isolation routine could lead to sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression. Sleep quality has huge importance for athletes, since it enables maintained alertness, contributes to a shorter reaction time, and improves mood and physical vigor [20, 36] . Furthermore, Rowlands et al. [37] used data from 91,248 UK Biobank participants with accelerometer data and demonstrated an association between markers of sleep/rest and physical activity and the risk or severity of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the prevention of changes in sleep and PA behavior seem to be very important for the whole population and it is necessary to investigate whether a long period of quarantine could impact sleep quality in athletes.",
