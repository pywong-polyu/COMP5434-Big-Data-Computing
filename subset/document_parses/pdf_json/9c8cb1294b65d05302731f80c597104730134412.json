Census data within the United States from 2018 indicate that most children younger than 15 years are from non-White groups [2] . Increasing attention to attributes such as gender identity, ability, ethnicity, sexual identity, creed, socioeconomic background, age, military experience, learning style, personality, education level, geographic background/country of origin, language, marital status, caretaker status, occupation and appearance is necessary because of both a history of oppression and persisting implicit bias. Within the United States, historical structures, many persisting to our modern day, have perpetuated prejudice and discrimination against those who are not able, White, straight, affluent, cis-gender Christian men. We must recognize that individuals who are members of non-dominant groups often face significant disadvantages throughout their lives inclusive of educational opportunities.",

Although the murder of George Floyd in 2020 was a seminal moment for political organizing, his death has been both preceded and followed by many other Black and indigenous people of color who have died at the hands of police or vigilantes. Similarly, the poorer outcomes for people of color with regard to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic provides a health care example of the impact of systemic bias. Bias in the community is replicated in any work environment without intervention. Diversity and equity in the workplace is a step toward bringing an end to institutionalized racism.",

The literature and electronic medical records are among the realms in which we see discussion of social determinants of health [3] . Many of the features of diversity are those that are included in social determinants of health, which can contribute to inequalities in health among groups and are not caused by genetics or willful choices but by cultural factors. Once again, the example of worse outcomes for people of color with COVID-19 illustrates how social determinants of health can result in health inequalities. The impact of these social determinants of health is yet another reason for the importance of diversity within all aspects of life, but particularly within health care delivery systems. By hiring diverse people in our workplaces inclusive of leadership positions, we help broaden the perspectives of the decision makers and we present a workforce that reflects the community.",

Further, being inclusive and welcoming is simply the right thing to do. In the United States, many forms of explicit bias are now illegal. Hewlett et al. [9] reported that more diverse groups result in higher levels of performance as well as innovation. Individuals and teams can perform better when they are able to focus on their tasks in a comfortable environment. In addition, a broader perspective and new concepts can be brought forth when all members are able to communicate their ideas. Being inclusive and embracing diversity results in a larger talent pool from which to select team members. Excluding any particular group is a loss for the field. Greater problemsolving ability is found with increased diversity [10] [11] [12] . Work output and health care delivery improve with diversity, and evidence demonstrating improved health outcomes is likely to increase steadily with more emphasis on diversity in practice and in research.",

It is important to note that the influence can be positive or negative and might not coincide with our stated beliefs. Unconscious bias is unintentional. It can be seen in forms like gender bias, racial bias, disability bias, affinity bias and beauty bias. One of the notable studies illustrating bias is a randomized double-blind study in which application materials of identical students were provided to faculty with the only difference being the randomly assigned male or female gender of the applicant, and the results demonstrated a clear bias in favor of the male applicant. This bias was present in both male and female faculty [14] . This study highlights that being a member of a discriminated group does not make a person immune from bias against that group. Unconscious bias can be measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which is inexpensive and accessible online [24] and can provide feedback on personal unconscious bias for self-reflection. However, although the test taker receives immediate feedback, this test does not appear to change behavior [25] . Additional work is needed to correct these biases. It becomes important to mitigate unconscious bias at both individual and organizational levels to promote diversity, equity and inclusion [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Measures can be taken to correct unconscious biases, and recognizing that they exist is the first step.",
