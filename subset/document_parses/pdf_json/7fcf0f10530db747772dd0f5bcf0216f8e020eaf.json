While the impact of COVID-19 is affecting the general public, it is clear that these distressful experiences will be magnified in older adults, particularly people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), making them the most vulnerable group during this time. People with differing degrees of ADRD are especially susceptible to the virus, not only because of their difficulties in assessing the threat or remembering the safety measures, but also because of the likelihood to be subject to other risk factors, such as lack of proper care and psychological issues. Therefore, in this article, we will discuss the challenges related to home-based care for people with ADRD during a pandemic and propose a formulation of systematic solutions to address these challenges and to alleviate the social and economic impact resulting from the crisis.",

Older adults aged 65 and above have been defined as a higher risk group of the virus in scientific publications as well as in media coverage [1, 2] . This group of people, therefore, has become the subject of specific national social distancing and 'cocooning' measures [3] . These measures and implications are difficult to be handled by older adults, in particular, individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), due to implications from disease symptoms and the need for additional care [4] . It is unclear from existing discussions how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting people with ADRD as a whole, even though they respond to the crisis differently based on their stages in disease progression [5, 6] . There is a lack of study showing a direct association between the suspected, infected, or fatal cases of COVID-19 and people with ADRD thus far. More importantly, how exactly people with ADRD are responding to the pandemic situation remains unknown.",

Hence, without delineating an accurate number of COVID-19 positive people with ADRD from the general reported cases [11] , there is a high possibility of overlooking the actual home-based care needs for the people with ADRD and this could affect the timely development of suitable policies for this group of people [12] .",

Furthermore, memory problems at late-stage ADRD, which, for example, make safety instructions difficult to remember [28, 29] and also make clearly understanding the messages of cocooning and self-isolation difficult [30, 31] , are deteriorating the capabilities of this group of people to combat the pandemic.

Retrospective studies, for instance, found that rates of suicidal tendencies among older adults aged 65 and above were higher during the SARS-2003 epidemic [32] [33] [34] . The study further identified predominant reasons explaining this exceptional increase of suicide deaths among older adults, which include anxiety in contracting the disease, fear of disconnection, stress over being a burden to their families, and social disengagement. The combination of these reasons was described as a \"serious public health concern\" [35] that must be addressed immediately to minimize the adverse impact of the pandemic on people with ADRD. A better understanding and appreciation of the impact of this rapidly evolving situation can help in the improvement of care for people with ADRD [36] . Besides, the documentation of measures taken by institutions (structural) and individuals (personal) to manage the effect of COVID-19 will facilitate future strategies on disease prevention for people with ADRD [37] .",

For instance, it is not easy for people with late-stage ADRD to understand instructions about social distancing (e.g., staying \"2 meters or 6 feet apart\" from others) and abide by the rules. The 'forgetful' characteristics might hinder them from remembering to wear face masks, wash their hands frequently, or take other recommended preventive measures [29] . The limited access to information poses additional difficulties to the group to change or reconfigure personal and social expectations. Simultaneously, it is important to pay attention to how the lack of these preventive measures could impact the dynamic interactions between people with ADRD and their caregivers, leading to both having a higher chance of infection [44] .

Lessons learned from the previous epidemic crisis may enlighten our understanding of the best effective measures. During a pandemic, the virus is not only threatening people with ADRD, but also their family members and friends, who are the main sources of home-based care in contexts where there is a lack of adequate health care systems. A significant proportion of people with ADRD has been suggested to have home-based care services with the argument of retaining social networks, individual independence, and a higher quality of life [55] . However, there are challenges related to home-based care, such as lack of support for family caregivers, lack of disease recognition, insufficient clarification in policies regarding hospital-to-home discharge, and poor system coordination [56] . Furthermore, the social distancing guidelines are almost impossible, particularly for those staying at home, due to limited resources for sustaining a home-based care infrastructure that allow the implementation of these measures.",

This implies that the isolation process can disrupt meaningful personal relationships and result in a greater risk of loneliness for people with ADRD [44] . Caregivers can initiate participatory and recreation activities for people with ADRD such as physical activity, gamification, virtual meetings, or digital storytelling [22, 69] . In addition, different digital resources such as telephone calls and online-based cognitive behavioral therapies could be harnessed in order to protect their social networks and enhance a sense of belonging [70] . Furthermore, it is important to develop advanced care plans considering the wishes and unique needs of people with ADRD to utilize readily available resources [44, 64] . Finally, family caregivers should share and exchange their experiences with friends and neighbors who are also taking care of people with ADRD at home to promote good practices for home-based care.",

The family caregivers should keep in contact with the nearest emergency care service providers to maintain regular updates of the conditions of people with ADRD [75] . At the same time, they should be in touch with the family doctor if the people with ADRD develop any symptoms of COVID-19 to get instructions regarding medication, hygiene, and personal cleanliness [67, 72] . It might also be beneficial to have a video conversation between the doctor, caregivers, and the patient to discuss their experiences navigating through the pandemic while managing medical conditions, the encountered stress, and effective communication techniques between all parties to provide the best medical assistance to people with ADRD [31, 72, 76] .",

Another issue that needs to be considered is that ADRD is heterogeneous, which is the reason that any simple and generic recommendation for this group of people might not be effective. However, awareness of possible impacts and knowing details about the vulnerable risk group may prevent or reduce the harm of this pandemic on people with ADRD and their potential caregivers.",
