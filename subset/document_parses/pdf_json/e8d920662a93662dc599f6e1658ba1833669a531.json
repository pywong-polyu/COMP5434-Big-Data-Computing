This paper indicated that BNP was positive correlation with the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality in HIVinfected patients. Hence, BNP may be induced by viral infection and could be an indicator for monitoring patients' condition after viral infection.",

However, little data are available to describe the disease pathogenesis, and no pharmacological therapies of proven efficacy yet exist now [3] . Based on our recent experts clinical experience on COVID-19, we found some early-onset COVID-19 patients were not very dangerous in the early stage, but the patient's condition may deteriorate suddenly and enter a statge of multiple organs failure caused by a storm of inflammation [4] . Meanwhile, we also observed that high BNP was significantly associated with acute respiratory symptoms and respiratory failure, which may be an indicator of COVID-19 patient's condition deterioration. Hence, we strongly recommend more clinical warning indicators such as BNP should be explored for the early identification of COVID-19 critically ill patients, and take more effective and normative approaches to reduce the conversion from mild to severe patients at an earlier stage.",
