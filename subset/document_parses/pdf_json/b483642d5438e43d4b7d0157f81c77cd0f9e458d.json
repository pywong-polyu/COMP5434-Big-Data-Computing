            "text": "Older adults have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with higher odds of hospitalization and death even among vaccinated individuals. 1,2 Two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), have demonstrated robust protection from infection and severe disease outcomes, including in older adults, whom health policies prioritized in vaccination strategies. 2, 3 Positive detection of antibodies has been correlated with reduced risk for infection. 4 However, older adults have lower antibody levels relative to young and middle-aged adults following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. 5, 6 Vaccine response in older adults remains incompletely understood, in part due to selection criteria excluding frail older adults from vaccine trials. 7 Evidence from prior vaccine studies, including influenza, varicella-zoster, and pneumococcal pneumonia have described frailty as a better predictor than chronological age for impaired vaccine effectiveness in older adults. [8] [9] [10] Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by disproportionate vulnerability to adverse health outcomes due to impaired physiological and functional reserve. Additionally, frailty is a reliable predictor for COVID-19 disease severity. 11 Frailty can be measured across the population of older adults, with up to 40% of community dwelling older adults categorized as frail. 11, 12 The frailty index (FI), which measures accumulation of health-related deficits to categorize frailty with well-defined cutoffs, has been validated as a tool in vaccine research in older adults. [8] [9] [10] 12, 13 At Wake Forest School of Medicine, an electronic frailty index (eFI) score is readily available using electronic health record (EHR) data for patients seen in the healthcare system. 12 The continuing COVID-19 pandemic in conjunction with waning vaccine-induced immunity emphasizes the importance of understanding the impact of frailty on COVID-19 vaccine responses in A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 older adults. [7] [8] [9] We hypothesized that frail individuals would have a decreased COVID-19 mRNA vaccine antibody response compared to non-frail older adults. Both tests have reported sensitivity >90% and specificity >99%. 14 Antibody test results were reported to the study coordinating site for analysis.",

The majority of participants were in early-old age with their A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 selection influenced by the online methodology of the CRP cohort. We previously described frailty but not age in this cohort was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of completing at home serologic testing, which adversely impacts the inclusion of individuals with frailty. 18 While using multivariable regression controlled for age and frailty allowing for precise outcome estimates, the interaction between age and frailty and small frail category population decreased the accuracy of our estimates.",

Waning protection after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in uninfected individuals has been well described. 20 Our findings suggest frail older adults are particularly vulnerable to waning vaccine immunity, but further research on the durability of COVID-19 vaccine responses and clinical outcomes in frail populations is needed to test this hypothesis. In addition, we did not study the impact of tertiary vaccine booster doses, which became widely available after the serological study surveillance period. Although impaired vaccine effectiveness in frail individuals has been well described, the immunological effects of frailty remain incompletely understood, warranting further investigation. 7-10 CONCLUSIONS While antibody detection was high across age and frailty categories following vaccination, frailty independently influences impaired antibody response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in older adults.

The CRP is a health systembased, longitudinal serologic surveillance study launched in April, 2020. Participants were recruited online via email, internal communications, and social media. A majority of cohort participants were selected for at-home fingerstick dried blood spot cards for antibody testing. Multiple factors including time of study enrollment and rate of return of completed antibody tests influenced the number and frequency of test results per person. Dried blood spot cards were analyzed at Labcorp (Burlington, NC USA) for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein via Euroimmun test (L\u00fcbeck, Germany). Positive spike protein antibody results were reflex tested for SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein to detect if antibodies were developed from infection via Roche test (Basel, Switzerland).",
