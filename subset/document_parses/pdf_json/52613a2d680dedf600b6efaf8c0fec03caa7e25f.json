            "text": "The demanding environment that contemporary dance students are exposed to could result in high stress levels, which can influence injury susceptibility. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between stress and injuries. In the period between September 2016 and March 2020, four cohorts of first-year dance students (N = 186; mean age 19.21 \u00b1 1.35 years) were followed for one academic year. Each month, general stress was assessed on a 0-100 visual analogous scale. The Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Questionnaire on Health Problems was used on a monthly basis to monitor injuries. Injuries were defined as \"all injuries\" (i.e., any physical complaint irrespective of the need for medical attention or time-loss from dance) and \"substantial injuries\" (i.e., leading to moderate/severe/complete reductions in training volume or performance). Mann-Whitney tests were performed to measure differences in general stress levels between injured and injury-free students, while repeated-measures ANOVA were performed to investigate whether general stress scores increased before and during injury occurrence. The overall average monthly general stress score over all cohorts for all students was 39.81. The monthly general stress scores ranged from 31.75 to 49.16. Overall, injured and substantially injured students reported higher stress scores than injury-free students, with significant differences in 3 out of the 9 months for all injuries (September, October, March, p < 0.05), and in 5 months for substantial injuries (September, October, November, December, April, p < 0.05). Within the 3-month period before and during injury occurrence, a (marginally) significant linear effect of general stress across the time periods was found for all injuries [F(1.87,216.49) = 3.10, p = 0.051] and substantial injuries [F(2,138) = 4.16, p = 0.018]. The results indicate an association between general stress and injuries. Future research should focus on effects of varying stress levels on injury risk using higher sampling frequency, for instance by measuring weekly since stress levels are likely to fluctuate daily. Practically, strategies aiming at stress reduction might have the potential to reduce the burden of dance injuries and may have positive outcomes for dancers, teachers, schools, and companies.",

It mainly represents a fusion of styles and has specific aesthetic values; choreographers classify common traits such as experimental elements, a conceptual framework, or the inclusion of improvisation, text, or multimedia elements (Giguere, 2018) . Contemporary dance training requires advanced physical and artistic skills and may consequently increase dancers' susceptibility to injury (Kenny et al., 2016) . Reported injury incidence rates among pre-professional dancers, ranging from 0.77 to 4.71 injuries per 1,000 h of dance, have indicated that dance is a high-risk activity (Kenny et al., 2016; van Winden et al., 2019) .",

The meta-analysis showed that a strong stress responsivity has the strongest association with injury risk in sports compared to the other variables that are connected to injury risk according to the model (e.g., personality, history of stressors, coping). The model suggests that the stress response in a potentially stressful situation can influence injury risk due to increased muscle tension and decreased coordination, a lack of focus and increased self-consciousness (Williams and Andersen, 1998; Staufenbiel et al., 2013; Ivarsson et al., 2017) . Moreover, prolonged stress can cause changes in brain functions that increase the risk of poor decision-making (Ivarsson et al., 2017) , which has also been related to increased injury risk (Gabbett et al., 2012) . The model can be applied to dance-specific examples according to a literature review of Pollitt and Hutt (2021) , as for instance done by van Winden et al. (2020b) . In line with the stress-and-injury model, the results of the systematic review of Mainwaring and Finney (2017) also showed that stress, psychological distress, coping and personality were associated with risk of dance injury.",

Furthermore, stress has been associated with injury-caused absence from dance activities and prolonged injury duration in (pre-)professional ballet dancers (Adam et al., 2004; Noh et al., 2005) . However, the current body of research focusing on stress and dance injuries is insufficient to draw decisive conclusions (Kenny et al., 2016; Mainwaring and Finney, 2017) . Prospective cohort studies are needed (Kenny et al., 2016) , as longitudinal and frequent monitoring of perceived stress may provide further insight into the changes in stress levels in relation to the dynamic nature of injury occurrence (van der Does et al., 2017) .",

Especially within the academic setting, injuries can have a tremendous effect leading to hindered artistic development due to absences from dance activities (Kenny et al., 2016) , and even study delay or early drop-out of university. Furthermore it is possible that the specific academic environment could result in even higher stress levels compared to the general dance setting, due to, for example, the limited timeframe for achieving artistic and academic goals (Weigert, 2005) . Besides, it is possible that all new (i.e., firstyear) dance students are at an elevated level of injury risk, due to stressors such as moving, managing finances, and homesickness (Pollitt and Hutt, 2021) . Therefore, a prospective cohort study with four cohorts of first-year contemporary dance students over the course of a full academic year was performed to gain more insight into the association between general stress levels and injuries (i.e., physical complaints irrespective of the need for medical attention or time-loss from dance). We hypothesize that students perceive more stress when injured.",

Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, results from March 2020 until June 2020 were excluded from the analysis, as students were not able to follow regular classes during that period. Students were enrolled in a 4-year educational program of either a Bachelor Dance or Bachelor Dance Teacher. Both Bachelor programs focus on acquiring the required technical dance competencies with classes containing a wide range of modern techniques (e.g., Cunningham, Graham, Laban, Limon), (modern) jazz, ballet, and \"floorwork.\" In addition, a large number of guest teachers contribute their personal styles, often inspired by their own development and research. Furthermore, performance creative skills (i.e., improvisation, composition, and drama) are important. Besides, health classes including basic knowledge of nutrition, anatomy and (sport)psychology are being offered within the first-year of the Bachelor Dance's curriculum.

Students were categorized as having a substantial injury if they reported problems leading to moderate or severe reductions in training volume (value \u226513 on question 2 of the OSTRC Questionnaire) or moderate, severe, or complete reductions in performance (value \u226513 on question 3 of the OSTRC Questionnaire) (Clarsen et al., 2014) .",

In general, our between-subject analyses showed that injured students and substantially injured students reported higher general stress scores than their injury-free or non-substantially injured peers across all months, except for January, in which injury-free students scored higher than injured students. These results were significant for all injuries during 3 out of the 9 months, and for substantial injuries during 5 out of the 9 months. The results for January might differ due to the fact that January is a relatively \"easy\" month within the academic calendar and was preceded by a holiday break. Furthermore, significantly higher stress scores were found in the months September and October for (substantially) injured students, consistent with the start of the first semester. Sustaining an injury in the beginning of their academic career could result in higher stress, since students are still adjusting to their new environment (e.g., the intensity of classes, social aspects, teachers' reactions toward injuries et cetera). These stressors arise on top of the stressors all new (i.e., first-year) dance students experience (e.g., moving, managing finances, and homesickness) (Pollitt and Hutt, 2021) . In addition, within-subject analyses showed that general stress scores significantly differed between the injury-free period and the injury period for injured students and substantially injured students. The indicated association between stress levels and injuries is in agreement with previous research. Studies including preprofessional ballet dancers found associations between injuries and negative (general and/or dance-specific) stress (Krasnow et al., 1999; Adam et al., 2004; Noh et al., 2005) . In the sports literature, the stress-and-injury model of Williams and Andersen (1998) highlights the association between stress and injuries. Major psychosocial stressors (i.e., events resulting in major changes in the life of those affected) (Junge, 2000) and minor or everyday events (e.g., health, workload, or social issues) (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984) can have an effect on stress and thereby increase injury risk. Contemporary dance students are, for instance, exposed to life events, such as managing finances, homesickness, competitive auditions, approaching exams and performances and high expectations from others which can lead to great amounts of stress (Mainwaring et al., 1993; Adam et al., 2004; Pollitt and Hutt, 2021) .",

Psychological training programs aimed at reducing stress levels might have the potential to reduce the burden of dance injuries and may have positive outcomes for dancers and those in their environment (e.g., dance schools, teachers, directors, and health professionals), as recommended by Ivarsson et al. (2017) in the context of sports. According to previous literature, a reduction in injury risk is likely when students are able to manage their stress levels better (Fawkner et al., 1999) . For example, Noh et al. (2007) showed that within young ballet dancers, imagery, self-talk and relaxation techniques enhanced psychological coping skills and reduced injury frequency and duration. Besides, mindfulness can be an effective instrument to achieve a relaxed state of body and mind (Arvinen- Barrow and Walker, 2013) , and potentially reduce stress and the subsequent physiological (e.g., relaxation) and attentional (e.g., mindfulness) changes (Ivarsson et al., 2017) . A recent study among university dance students indicated that improvements in mindfulness may help students with numerous general and dance-specific demands (Blevins et al., 2021) .",

To illustrate, the monthly stress levels peaked in periods with exams and special project weeks. Moreover, dancers typically face an increase in demands prior to important performances, in contrast to sports where tapering periods are common before an important match (Balk et al., 2018) . Lowering workload during stressful periods, as well as facilitating possibilities for dancers to leave their dance bubble (i.e., the social, professional and education environment that is connected to dance) for \"mental detachment\" by, for instance, taking time off after stressful periods or organizing non-dance activities (Balk et al., 2018) , might help balance stress levels throughout the year, and thereby influence the injury burden. However, future research should look more closely at changes in training load on individual level preceding the onset of injury (Drew, 2015; Lee et al., 2017) , in order to gain more insight into the stress-workload relationship.",

However, stress levels are likely to fluctuate on a day-to-day basis (von Rosen et al., 2017a), whereby sudden changes and short periods of high stress could potentially be overlooked when using a monthly measuring method (van der Does et al., 2017) . Therefore, future research should consider including higher sampling frequencies, for instance on weekly basis. Moreover, in line with the dynamic nature of stress, future research should examine the effects of intra-individual varying stress levels on injury risk. However, higher sampling frequencies are needed to adequately perform these in-depth analyses. To illustrate, a study among athletes indicated a significant increase in stress scores in the week prior to injury (Fawkner et al., 1999) , showing a much shorter time period between changes in stress levels and injury occurrence than measured in our study (week versus month). Gaining insight in these intra-individual varying stress levels can, for instance, be achieved by using more sophisticated statistical models, such as joint models, in which survival and longitudinal sub-models are linked and specific, individual predictions can be included (Long and Mills, 2018) .",

            "text": "Besides, the current study focused on students' perceived general stress before or during the month of incurring an injury. Previous research has shown that perceived stress and recovery during the injury period differed between injured and healthy athletes; injured athletes perceive more stress and feel less recovery during the period that they were injured (Evans et al., 2012) . Consequently, in order to inform return-to-dance interventions, it is essential to conduct further research into perceived stress and recovery levels during injury periods (van der Does et al., 2017) . Furthermore, future research should include other mental and physical risk factors as well, especially due to the small to medium effect sizes found in this study. For instance, studies have shown that dance exposure (i.e., years of training, exposure hours) or poor aerobic capacity could be associated with injury risk (Kenny et al., 2016) . In addition, studies on sports have indicated mental detachment (Balk et al., 2019) , perceived recovery (van der Does et al., 2017), sleep volume (von Rosen et al., 2017a,b) and self-esteem (von Rosen et al., 2017a) as potential injury risk factors. Finally, the present study was conducted among a first-year contemporary dance student population. These results may help direct injury prevention in second-year students in light of the similarity across their curriculums. However, generalizability to third-year (and fourth-year) dance students is limited, as these curriculums differ to a larger extent. Besides, it is questionable if the results can be generalized to other populations such as pre-professional ballet dancers or professional dancers. Future directions in dance research should focus on large prospective cohort studies. These studies will allow us to perform subgroup analyses based on different dance populations.",

Between-subject analysis indicated that injured and substantially injured students reported higher general stress scores than injury-free or non-substantially injured students, although not all monthly scores were significantly higher for injured or substantially injured students. Furthermore, within the 3-month period before and during injury occurrence, a significant linear effect of general stress scores increasing across the time periods was found for all injuries and substantial injuries, with the highest scores in the injury period. However, more research, especially into the effect of varying stress levels on injury risk, with higher frequencies (for instance with weekly measurements) is needed. For now, better management of workload and a focus on the possible effects of dance students' stress levels, by including psychological training programs aimed at reducing stress levels, for instance based on mindfulness, might have the potential to reduce the burden of dance injuries and may have positive outcomes for dancers, teachers, schools and companies.",
