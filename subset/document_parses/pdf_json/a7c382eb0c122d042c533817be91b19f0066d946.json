It has very harmful effects all over the global economy, education, social, daily living and general health of humans. To restrict the quick expansion of the disease initially, main difficulty is to explore the positive corona patients as quickly as possible. As there are no automatic tool kits accessible the requirement for supplementary diagnostic tools has risen up. Previous studies have findings acquired from radiological techniques proposed that this kind of images have important details related to the coronavirus. The usage of modified Artificial Intelligence (AI) system in combination with radio-graphical images can be fruitful for the precise and exact solution of this virus and can also be helpful to conquer the issue of deficiency of professional physicians in distant villages. In our research, we analyze the different techniques for the detection of COVID-19 using X-Ray radiographic images of the chest, we examined the different pre-trained CNN models AlexNet, VGG-16, MobileNet-V2, SqeezeNet, ResNet-34, ResNet-50 and COVIDX-Net to correct analytics for classification system of COVID-19. Our study shows that the pre trained CNN Model with ResNet-34 technique gives the higher accuracy rate of 98.33, 96.77% precision, and 98.36 F1-score, which is better than other CNN techniques. Our model may be helpful for the researchers to fine train the CNN model for the the quick screening of COVID patients.",

For the diagnosis of COVID, chest radiography is a common and inexpensive method of quickly examining the lungs and chest condition. Yet, the COVID Virus was identified when the overall symptomatic case fertility risk (the chance of dying after acquiring symptoms) of COVID in Wuhan was 1.4 percent (0.9 percent -2.1 percent). Since COVID is both treatable by using the vaccines and often fatal in patients with low immunity, improving its diagnosis is of the utmost importance. During writing this paper the accumulative number of diagnosis worldwide has increased 90,82,986, which seriously harmful for the lives and the health of the humans all over the world. COVID is the caused by type of virus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COVID Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . The biggest problem at present is the recognizing and investigating of COVID. This type of virus can be detected by using the RT-PCR (Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) for diagnosing viral nucleic acids as a baseline standard [2] . Now, COVID virus outbreak all over the world, the number of mortality and morbidity rate are rising day by day according to the updated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). However, due to a huge range of epidemics, it is not enough to test all the infected individuals in high incident areas and countries and also it is impossible to do RT-PCR tests on Thousands of infected patients not only this diagnosing way to takes many hours or even days to be finished [3] .",

However, the perfection of detecting COVID by Chest scanning is deeply depends upon the specialists and deep learning approaches were investigated as a tool for brutalising and diagnosing. Medical professionals can use chest photographs to recognise the architecture of formations of the chest and to see their forms, sizes, densities, and qualities. Due to these considerations, a variety of deep learning-based approaches for coronavirus have been proposed. [6] . A serious stage is here an actual and correct showing of the COVID patients not only getting rapid treatment and isolation after the public to stop distribution of the viral infection as well. Serology and inverse record of polymerase chain reaction, i.e., rRT-PCR, are state-of-the-art procedures for identifying COVID. Serology for antibody recognition is a service that provides scientific systems and people observation. Because the testing kits aren't universally available, it's fascinating to observe who's been infected by the virus. Moreover, possible trials consume sometime to give the results, time overwhelming sometime fault disposed to in the existing state of emergency. So, a quicker and consistent showing methods that might be more established by the PCR test is directly essential. Several studies have used radiography like X-rays as well as computed tomography (CT-scans) could determine the new COVID virus's distinctive symptoms. [7] New research suggests that chest radiography is being used for early COVID testing in outbreak regions. (Aminian, 2020). As either a result, radiographic image testing can be employed as an alternative towards the PCR approach, though in some instances has a greater sensitivity [8] .",

The validation result is used for prevent the model from overfitting and obtain the optimal results. The input X-Ray images were initially resized 224x224 while using AlexNet, VGG-16, MobileNet-V2, SqueezeNet, ResNet-34 and ResNet-50. Each model was trained for 50 epochs. The batch size and number of epochs resolute analytically. The performances of each model were determined depends upon different matrices that are F1-score, sensitivity, precision, specificity and accuracy. These matrices are computed by different parameters of confusion matrix I-e True-Positive (TP), True-Negative (TN), False-Positive (FP), False-Negative (FN). ",

            "text": "When the CNN model's result is matched to the DL technique for the detection of coronavirus disease by utilising Chest X-Ray pictures, it's clear that the suggested model produced more fine-tuned results than the other methods. As compare to the studies [18] , [19] , [4] the suggested study considered an equitably large amount of specimens to confirm the CNN models while [24] , [25] utilised similar but larger datasets to support their algorithms, however these datasets suffered from class variance issue and had a lower number of coronavirus infected cases in general, whereas the dataset used in this work had equal class distribution for healthy and coronavirus infected individuals. In paper [24] the issue of category variance was resolved by the use of offline amplification techniques, and it was also discovered that binary distribution was used in the majority of the research nevertheless, multiclass (mostly 3,4) grouping was performed in [24] , [25] . Moreover, in the context of CoV class susceptibility, an efficiency distinction was made in between recommended approach and the current technique. The COVID-19 category susceptivity of researchers [25] was the lowest, at 87.10 percent. It should be observed that suggested technique likewise obtained 100% CoV category susceptivity [18] , researcher [24] also obtained a 100 percent COVID-19 category susceptivity. The primary test set employed in these research, on the other hand, has a similar lower number of coronavirus disease images. ",

The fact that this suggested model is verified using a very few coronavirus affected images is a serious flaw. There is currently no big dataset publically accessible; this is an ongoing and novel pandemic; nevertheless, we want to test our technique with larger datasets in the future.",
