            "text": "The differential impact of COVID-19 on minorities has reportedly varied over the course of the pandemic. An early review of the literature by Public Health England concluded there is evidence of higher test positivity rates, defined as the percentage of processed SARS-CoV-2 swab tests that are positive, for people identifying as Black. 1 Later studies reported an increased test positivity rate and mortality for the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) population in the first wave of the pandemic in England and Wales. 2,3 A recent study on COVID-19 hospitalised people during the first wave found evidence of increased critical care admission for BAME patients, while mortality was higher only for South Asians. 4 Mathur and colleagues additionally found that between September and December 2020 the increased risk of testing positive disappeared and there was a reduced risk of death for Black and mixed ethnicity groups but not for South Asians. 2 Morales and Ali suggested that this change might be due to interventions that occurred between the two waves (e.g. better access to testing, targeted public communication and reduction of occupational risks), but stressed the importance of additional studies to better disentangle the effect of ethnicity from that of other variables. 5 Socio-economic deprivation is another key factor that contributes to health inequalities. People living in the most deprived areas in England and Wales were reportedly twice as likely to die from COVID-19 in the first wave. 6 A Europe-wide study tested a range of sociodemographic characteristics at country level and found that income was the best predictor of COVID-19 cases between December 2019 and April 2020. 7 As socio-economic deprivation correlates with ethnicity a , it is necessary to consider both dimensions simultaneously to accurately assess their impact on COVID-19 burden. Socio-economic and ethnic inequalities in England have become more pronounced during the pandemic and have contributed to unequal death tolls across communities. 8 Rose and colleagues found an association between socio-economic deprivation and mortality in England at Upper Tier Local Authority level in the first wave, after adjusting for ethnicity and other socio-demographic factors such as population density and age. 9 A recent study by Lo et al. reported that ethnic minorities were at a higher risk of testing positive in the UK and the US in 2020 and some of this increase could be explained by these communities living in more deprived areas. 10 Morrisey at al. provided the only contribution to date on the time-varying impact of deprivation on COVID-19 cases, showing that the impact was more pronounced in the first wave of the pandemic and that non pharmaceutical interventions helped reduce it. 11 A detailed analysis of whether and how the role of social and ethnic inequalities on SARS-CoV-2 infections varied over time is still missing from the literature. This is especially true for understanding their combined effect. Most literature to date covers March to December 2020 and has focused either on mortality or test positivity rates, with the latter indicator being affected not only by the actual number of infections but also by testing capacity and strategies. In this study we focus on SARS-CoV-2 infections in England and evaluate how the effects of area level socio-economic deprivation and ethnic composition evolved over the course of the pandemic (from 1st June 2020 to 19th September 2021). A key novelty of our analysis is that we consider test positivity rate as well as a new derived measure of prevalence proportion which corrects for the ascertainment bias of the tested population, enabling us to assess the impact of inequalities both on observed disease surveillance indicators and on the estimated underlying infection rate.",

We used the following search terms: \"Ethnicity\" or \"Deprivation\" combined with \"COVID-19\" or \"SARS-CoV-2\" and with \"infections\" or \"cases\" or \"prevalence\". We filtered out the studies which considered specific subgroups (e.g. children, care home residents), or specific occupations (e.g. healthcare workers) or covered only the first wave of the pandemic. The remaining articles provided evidence that ethnically diverse and socio-economically deprived communities have been differentially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Only one paper investigated how the impact of deprivation on COVID-19 cases changes in time, but, while considering ethnicity in the study as a confounder, did focus the results only on deprivation. Additionally, it analysed data for January-December 2020 and at monthly resolution. A detailed up-to-date nationwide analysis of whether and how the role of social and ethnic inequalities on SARS-CoV-2 infections varied over time is still missing from the literature.",

We therefore separately analyse weekly point prevalence proportion, defined as the proportion of infected individuals in the population who would be PCRpositive if tested.

When including LFT in the analysis the summer peak is lower than the two winter ones ( Figure  11 in Supplementary Material, top panel). This might potentially reflect the change in testing policy: LFT became more widespread as businesses were encouraged to sign up for a testing scheme for their staff, increasing the denominator of the positivity rate. The summer peak is also somewhat less pronounced when removing vaccine uptake from the confounders; in this case the temporal random effect implicitly accounts for the fact that higher vaccination rates lead to a reduction in infections ( Figure 11 in Supplementary material, central panel). Finally, the time pattern does not change when we include a lockdown indicator, suggesting that the temporal component already captures much of this effect ( Figure 11 in Supplementary Material, bottom panel).",

The overall effects of IMD and BAME are similar: for instance, among areas with high deprivation, changing the BAME population from low to high leads on average to an additional 7 weekly positive cases and 35 infected individuals in each LTLA; in parallel, among areas with high proportion of BAME population, changing deprivation from low to high corresponds on average to a weekly increase of 5 positive cases and 30 infected people at LTLA level ( Figure 9, Supplementary material) .",

Figure 3 (top) illustrates the time-varying nature of the effects of BAME and IMD on test positivity. The differences among the different profiles shrink as the pandemic evolves in time. In August-September 2020 there is a 51% (CrI 43\u221258%) increase on the OR scale in test positivity for areas with high deprivation and BAME population (violet line), compared to areas with low deprivation and low BAME (i.e. mostly White) population (red line) and a 30% increase for areas with high deprivation, but relatively small BAME population (pink line). Later, at the peak of the second wave (in December 2020 and January 2021) the effect of BAME becomes more pronounced, but reaching only a 19% increase in test positivity for areas with large BAME population and low deprivation (light blue line). During the same period there is a less clear gradient across the other profiles. This is expected given the emergence of the Alpha variant and the resulting high disease prevalence across the country at this time, leading to infections spreading more easily across all communities.

Compared to areas with low deprivation and low BAME population, weekly test positivity and debiased prevalence increase by 13% and 10%, respectively, in the most ethnically diverse and deprived areas. A similar effect is seen for IMD and BAME: among highly deprived areas test positivity rates and debiased prevalence increase by 5% going from low to high BAME populations; similarly among highly ethnically diverse areas test positivity increases by 7% and debiased prevalence increase by 5% going from low to high deprivation.",

When disentangling the effects of ethnicity, we found specifically that areas with a high percentage of South Asian and Other BAME populations were more adversely affected, but not areas with a high percentage of individuals identifying as Black. Moreover, we found that the impact of the two covariates varies over time: deprivation had a stronger effect during the first period of the analysis (until October 2020) whereas the effect of ethnicity became more pronounced during part of the second wave, in December-January (Figure 3) . From the spring of 2021 onwards there is a less clear distinction between the impact of BAME and IMD on either outcome. The consistency of results across the two outcome measures leads us to conclude that disease exposure or susceptibility, rather than testing access and habits, differs between areas with those communitylevel characteristics. This is the first study to evaluate the impact of social and ethnic inequalities on infections over the whole course of the pandemic so far (excluding the first few months when testing was not widely available at the community level). It is also the first study to model how these effects have evolved over time. Additionally, as we consider test positivity rate and a debiased estimate of prevalence proportions, we can evaluate the impact of deprivation and ethnicity on both the monitoring and spread of the pandemic, robustly and free from . Time-varying test positivity (top) and debiased prevalence (bottom) for profiles of ethnicity disaggregated by BAME subgroups. To improve the legibility of the chart we focus only on South Asian and Other BAME profiles, while reporting the full set of profiles in Figure 17 of Supplementary material. Each line represents the monthly median odds ratio for that profile relative to a population with a low percentage of all BAME subgroups, while the shaded area around it represents the corresponding 95% credible interval. The median odds ratio and its uncertainty are outputs of the model after adjusting for IMD, confounders and the spatiotemporal correlation structure. Periods of national lockdown are marked in grey.

A similar pattern is seen for prevalence, but with overlaps in the credible intervals among profiles. In March 2021, when the delta variant was first identified, we see an increase in test positivity for areas where most of the BAME population is South Asian, which is not reflected in the debiased prevalence. potential confounding by testing ascertainment bias.

Firstly, as already pointed out, the number of positive tests suffer from ascertainment bias; nevertheless we are able to mitigate this issue by also considering a statistically debiased measure of the number of cases as an additional outcome, which is obtained via model calibration of the testing data against the REACT randomised survey, the latter being less susceptible to ascertainment bias by design. Secondly, the demographic data considered may not fully represent the structure of the population at the time of analysis. For local population sizes, we used mid-year population estimates from 2020 as reference (the most up-to-date available at the time of the study), hence neglecting any changes occurring during the time of the analysis. More critically, we retrieved the proportion of BAME population from the 2011 Census (the most up to date source available at the time of the study). We work under the implicit assumption that the ethnic composition of LTLAs has not changed drastically, but we cannot verify this. Thirdly, this study shows an area-level association between inequalities and SARS-CoV-2 infection burden. Given that we consider aggregated data, the analysis may suffer from ecological bias, 19, 20 and consequently we can only make inferences about association but not about causality. Lastly, we acknowledge that our analysis did not consider all the potential confounders, such as level of education, housing conditions or occupation. However, education and housing conditions are implicitly accounted for through the IMD as they contribute to two of its domains. In the future we plan to evaluate the role of the different IMD domains separately, but this raises delicate methodological issues given their large correlation. Spatially varying residual confounding, such as as the proportion of key workers, is accounted for through the spatial random effects. It is important to note that the residual variability is between 76% and 80% of the total spatial variability, showing the importance of including it in the model as an additional adjustment for unaccounted sources of variations and heterogeneity.",

Additionally, by considering ethnic composition in conjunction with deprivation, we are able to assess the results for combinations of these two variables, disentangling which variable has a greater impact on test positivity and prevalence at different times. For instance, we show how the nature of the association changed over time, with deprivation being more important in discriminating COVID-19 burden at the beginning of the period under study. As several of the most deprived areas are in the North West of the country (see Figure 2 of Supplementary Material), we note that the national lockdown was eased when cases in those areas were still high; this was followed by governmental policies to support businesses in hospitality (Eat-Out to Help Out Scheme) which led to increased social mixing, ultimately driving infections up. 11 Consequently, restrictions were imposed again on these areas through the local tiered system in Autumn 2020. This means that they experienced the longest lockdown period, which in turn might have helped bring infections down. 22 In fact, as seen in Figure 3 , by the end of November 2020 most deprived areas were characterised by lower values of test positivity and prevalence. During the same time, areas in South East England and Greater London did not experience local restrictions, while also being hit by the Alpha variant. These areas are generally characterised by lower deprivation, but higher ethnic diversity, explaining why we see higher levels of test positivity and prevalence among areas with this profile in Figure 3 .",

Previous reports highlighting an increased test positivity rate for those identifying as Black are limited to the first wave of the pandemic (February -August 2020). 1 Mathur et al. reported that in September -December 2020 the increased test positivity rate in the Black group g https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/ uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/991343/Variant s_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_14.pdf.(last accessed 12-12-2021) disappeared. 2 At the same time, our estimates point towards an increased test positivity for South Asians and Other BAME groups for most of the period under analysis prior to July 2021, thus replicating and extending findings reported by Mathur et al. in the first part of the second wave. 2 While a study on genetic predisposition to the virus was recently published, it is likely that the main differences across ethnic groups are explained by environmental and occupational factors. 23, 24 In particular, Individuals with a South Asian background are more likely to live in overcrowded/intergenerational households; additionally, the proportion of essential workers as defined by the Office for National Statistics, reaches 7% in the South Asian population, whereas it is 3.3% for the Black population. 25\u221227 To conclude, this nationwide population-based study adds to evidence on the impact of social and ethnic inequalities on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Additionally, it shows that, as the pandemic evolved, with the introduction of new variants as well as new policy responses, so did the susceptibility of different communities. We believe that with the constantly changing epidemic dynamics, it is important to continually monitor how different communities are responding, in order to inform relevant policies aimed at eliminating social inequality in COVID-19 burden.",

The overall spatial distribution (left column) is disaggregated into two components, representing what is explained by social deprivation, ethnic composition and confounders (centre column) and the unobserved spatial residuals (right column). It can be seen that social deprivation, ethnic composition and the confounders partially explain the higher values of both outcomes in large cities, like London, Birmingham, and the area around Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. Altogether, exposures and confounders account for approximately 24% of the overall spatial distribution of test positivity and 20% of debiased prevalence.",

To improve the legibility of the chart we focus only on South Asian and Other BAME profiles, while reporting the full set of profiles in Figure 17 of Supplementary material. Each line represents the monthly median odds ratio for that profile relative to a population with a low percentage of all BAME subgroups, while the shaded area around it represents the corresponding 95% credible interval. The median odds ratio and its uncertainty are outputs of the model after adjusting for IMD, confounders and the spatiotemporal correlation structure. Periods of national lockdown are marked in grey. Areas with large South Asian and other BAME populations (yellow line) generally show an increased risk for test positivity, reaching a peak in August 2020 (21%, 16-27% CI)) and in May 2021 (20%, 15-26% CI). A similar pattern is seen for prevalence, but with overlaps in the credible intervals among profiles. In March 2021, when the delta variant was first identified, we see an increase in test positivity for areas where most of the BAME population is South Asian, which is not reflected in the debiased prevalence.",
