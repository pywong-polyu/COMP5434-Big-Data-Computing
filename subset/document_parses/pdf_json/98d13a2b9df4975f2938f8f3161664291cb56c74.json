While 4G was largely associated with traditional operator models, due to Abstract Private networks will play a key role in 5G and beyond to enable smart factories with the required better deployment, operation and flexible usage of available resource and infrastructure. 5G private networks will offer a lean and agile solution to effectively deploy and operate services with stringent and heterogeneous constraints in terms of reliability, latency, re-configurability and re-deployment of resources as well as issues related to governance and ownership of 5G components, and elements. In this paper, we present a novel approach to operator models, specifically targeting 5G and beyond private networks. We apply the proposed operator models to different network architecture options and to a selection of relevant use cases offering mixed privatepublic network operator governance and ownership. Moreover, several key enabling technologies have been identified for 5G private networks. Before the deployment, stakeholders should consider spectrum allocation and on-site channel measurements in order to fully understand the propagation characteristic of a given environment and to set up end-to-end system parameters. During the deployment, a monitoring tools will support to validate the deployment and to make sure that the end-to-end system meet the target KPI. Finally, some optimization can be made individually for service placement, network slicing and orchestration or jointly at radio access, multi-access edge computing or core network level.",

To this end, several key enabling technologies have been already identified and integrated for 5G public networks such as network slicing and orchestration, Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) support and machine learning at the edge support. Nevertheless, private networks impose specific context-dependent challenges with respect to local ownership, governance and optimization of locally deployed resources. This includes dynamic configuration and reconfiguration of hardware and software components to determine which part of the network belongs to private or public operators.",

            "text": "In the literature, there is a growing interest in non-public network [2] , private network [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , campus network [9] , micro-licensing for locally operated networks [10] , neutral host networks [11] or private unlicensed networks [12] . Larmo et al. [3] propose private 5G networks to address critical wireless communication requirements (i.e., reliability, availability, quality of service, security and interworking) in public safety, infrastructure and industry. Ordonez et al. [4] and 5G-ACIA alliance [2] provide an overview of 5G non-public networks, studying their applicability to the industry 4.0 ecosystem. They identify a number of deployment options relevant for non-public networks, and discuss their integration with Mobile Network Operators (MNO) public networks according to different criteria, including technical, regulatory and business aspects. Brown [5] investigates key issues in private 5G networks, including how the end-user can deploy and operate the technology, the integration of private local-area and wide-area public networks, and the importance of spectrum for private deployments. In particular, he discusses how private 5G can be deployed across diverse licensed, shared licensed, and unlicensed spectrum bands. Rostami [6] analyzes, classifies and compares, with a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, the potential deployment architecture and operation models for private 5G networks. He shows that each model comes with its own benefits and costs, and that not all the quality metrics can be optimized at the same time. Thus, it is crucial to analyze the usage scenarios and identify corresponding requirements before choosing a suitable operation and deployment model. Aijaz [8] provides an overview of several technical aspects of private 5G networks for industrial applications and scenarios. In particular, he discusses their functional architectures, use cases, spectrum opportunities, and advanced features, like network slicing, time-sensitive networking, and optimization of resource allocation. It also provides a few overall considerations on the related business opportunities. Matinmikko et al. [10] propose to deploy local radio access networks and offer dedicated vertical services in specific areas with micro-licensing allowing different stakeholders to use 5G spectrum locally on a shared basis. They identify the regulatory implications when the 5G end-to-end network spans across different stakeholders administrative domains and seek to address how spectrum authorization should be done for the future 5G networks. They present the local microlicensing model from regulatory perspective to complement the existing individual authorization and general authorization models by combining their benefits. Siriwardhana et al. [13] focuses on localized 5G networks and local operators that operate such networks within their premises with guaranteed quality and reliability to complement MNOs offerings. The authors investigate specific network architectures (and the related network function deployments), with a focus on two use cases: massive wireless sensor networks and mobile robots. Ahokangas et al. [7] examine a complex industrial stakeholder ecosystem and build a private 5G-enabled platform ecosystem (i.e., data and connectivity platform configurations) to benefit from digitalization and serve its stakeholders. They also identify the regulatory challenges of deploying private 5G networks (e.g., spectrum, operator role, competition, access to infrastructure, radio equipment authorization, security and privacy, and vertical specific regulation). Bajracharya et al. [12] argue that the unlicensed spectrum plays a crucial role in private network but faces various limitations and restrictions (i.e., region and band specific, reduced efficiency) due to the coexistence of networks in the shared band. They discuss about potential solutions such as listen before talk with maximum channel occupancy time, adaptive backoff, handover skipping, self-organized network and multi-domain coexistence. Kibria et al. [11] introduce a new business model called neutral host micro-operator networks in shared spectrum. This self-contained network allows authentication of SIM-based or SIM-less access to provide localized and local context-based services by location owners for subscribers of different service providers and satisfying coverage extension and traffic offload.",

Kuklinski et al. [15] analyze the BMs enabled by network slicing. They identified the distinct roles of key players and their business interactions, particularly for multiple infrastructure owners and service providers. Camps-Arago et al. [16] also analyze BMs with the adoption of 5G and network slicing technologies and discuss six potential models: (i) micro-operator that does not own spectrum and only operates in a specific area, (ii) provider of Xaas offering something as a service, (iii) use case enabler addressing business to business relationships, (iv) ecosystem orchestrator playing the structural role of leading efforts to foster relationships beyond its direct customers, (v) pervasive platforms striving to dominate the value chain and extract substantial rents, and (vi) specific ecosystem within their physical boundaries. Ahokangas et al. [17] explore other generic BMs for local 5G micro-operators, including vertical (i.e., based on use case similarity), horizontal (i.e., based on direct business to business in localized domain) and oblique (i.e., based on a platform that supports mass-tailoring). Sacoto-Cabrera et al. [18] implement two BMs: strategic (e.g., when the MNO and the Virtual Operator (VO) provide service to its own user bases and the MNO receives revenue per VO subscriber) and monopolistic (e.g., when the MNO provides service to both user bases). Noll et al. [19] introduce collaborative BMs based on the postulation of 5G as a system of systems. Collaborative BMs are known by the sharing of network infrastructure and when mobile and indoor operator have agreements to share revenues. Hmoud et al. [20] study BM platformization and big data-driven BM with two or more parties interacting with each other and propose a twosided advertising BM using design science approach and grounded theory principles.",

Anticipating initial concerns by different stakeholders to novel operator models, it is important to explore this field unbiased, in order to better understand the different degrees of freedom of operator models and how they are interrelated. 5G elements (e.g., 5G network functions, RAN components, etc.) and non-5G elements (e.g., enterprise Information Technology (IT)), private 5G network lifecycle tasks and involved stakeholders (e.g., enterprise, MNO, service provider) are important and interrelated dimensions. For example, whether one stakeholder can carry out management task on a 5G component depends on a multitude of factors, including the physical and logical location of that element (e.g., 5G Core) and on what other stakeholders own and govern. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of operator models, associated requirements and concerns to be addressed. In general, such concerns to novel operator models are attributed to different perspectives: confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, access to and control of elements (specifically 5G components), the private 5G network life-cycle and responsibilities, business models and expertise required by the stakeholders for each task, regulatory aspects, and applicability and practicability.",

In order to reduce the T&E cost, additional diagnosis models are used to detect vibration, collision, acoustic emission, temperature, or energy consumption-input that goes beyond that of traditional computer-aided manufacturing software to generate tool paths along a workpiece geometry. Virtual or Augmented Reality (VR/AR) can help process engineers reveal full productivity of machines by superimposing graphical objects (e.g., 3D models, charts, vector fields and text messages) on top of a video streaming on head-mounted displays. Here, high data rate along with low latency properties of 5G can be utilized, while high fidelity 3D scenes with millions of polygons are rendered remotely and transferred wirelessly lightweight VR/AR device in terms of video streams to facilitate high mobility on the shop floor. Recognized objects (e.g., machines, spindles and workpiece) are then linked with the digital twins to query corresponding 3D models, sensing data, and condition values, and synthesized as virtual objects in the VR/AR scenes. For example, tool paths can be plotted and color-coded according to features, such as the vibration level, and superimposed on the real machine image or the machine 3D model. This enables process engineers to observe machining conditions in a more intuitive way, shorten the T&E process planning time and interact with various digital twins at the same time in a focused and hands-free manner. Figure 3 illustrates the architecture of the AR/VR use case. The 5G network will be deployed on the shop floor to connect equipment (e.g., CNC, robot, conveyor and AGV) with a CPE to link with the gNB and the edge cloud. The data collection is achieved by a secured open platform communications unified architecture client server pair. The control agent is a software module located in the edge data center.

However, processing smaller batches for increased product variety demands for greater flexibility (mobile robots), while at the same time production performance needs to be improved, e.g., in terms of overall equipment efficiency. One approach to achieve this is to offload (parts of ) the control functions to the local edge cloud (edge programmable logic controllers), which would not only improve efficiency, but also unlock more synergistic optimization potential through the pooling of computing resources. Besides, production efficiency can be improved by centrally managing, troubleshooting, monitoring and programming of remote robot and machine controllers in the cloud. A 5G link can interconnect the robot with the backend to fulfill the speed and reliability requirements imposed by the exchange of motion control messages (e.g., target values of joint positions or speeds) and feedback (e.g., joint angles and torques).",

Fig. 4 ), we use a 7-degree-of-freedom Franka Emika's collaborative robotic arm called Panda to demonstrate the performance of the underlying 5G network between the edge controller and the robot. The Panda robot is normally connected to a workstation PC via Ethernet and requires communication to the controller at 1 kHz. Franka uses a real-time robot control code using UDP messages via the Franka Emika interface. This interface includes a motion generator and a controller, through which a programmer can send commands to the robot. Motion generator defines robot motion in joint or coordinate space and uses an internal controller to follow the commanded motion, whereas the external controller sends torque commands directly to the To demonstrate the 5G network performance of closed control loop of the Panda robotic arm, a dynamic split of the control algorithm between the edge cloud and the robot side will be implemented. The network's Key Performance Indicators (KPI) will be analyzed, and an adaptive approach to the static control loop will be developed by taking into account the dynamic latency of the 5G network. Initially, an emulated network delay model (e.g., using a 5G network simulator) will be inserted between the control loop split parts, and the control function parameters will be modified to avoid intrinsic safety condition due to network delay by respecting the desired trajectory precision and increasing the processing time. For example, predictions about the network delay can be provided by smart machine learning-based algorithms using 5G network data analysis function. At a later stage, it is expected that the network emulator and the wired link will be replaced by the 5G system, allowing the performance of the real 5G system to be tested and using real performance metrics.",

Effectively, most end-to-end connections will pass through a multitude of stakeholders, who will not be bound by static service level agreements, but will need to pass through a rich ecosystem of dynamic technical (and economic) relationships. Ownership and governance of individual elements, especially network elements, are crucial aspects of operator models. If one stakeholder owns a network element, restrictions on governance and access to that network element by another stakeholder can be expected. In this regard, the following definitions are important: Initial ownership is the designer or developer of elements that will be used in the private 5G Network. Owning Stakeholder is the legal proprietor of the deployed element (e.g., physical infrastructure, licenses). Governing Stakeholder is the stakeholder responsible for the management and operation of the element in question.

In order to reduce costs, RAN sharing models have been explored, allowing different PLMNs to be supported by the same RAN system. National roaming and MVNO enable a communication service provider to deliver service in a region even if it does not have a RAN system there. Dedicated Core networks (DECOR) and network slicing technologies enable mobile communication service to be provided to private subjects when they do not have a mobile system at all. Another model of RAN sharing is the so-called neutral host, in which the RAN infrastructure is not owned by any of the MNOs whose PLMNs are supported by that infrastructure, and the infrastructure owner also announces its own private PLMN. This is an architecture defined by the MulteFire alliance and citizen broadband radio service Alliances, and targets tower companies that may also be service providers.

These scenarios can be grouped into two categories: intra-enterprise and inter-enterprise scenarios. In the intra-enterprise scenarios, user plane data are produced and consumed within a single enterprise, which may nevertheless have different geographical locations far apart, such as office buildings and production plants. To design a private mobile network to meet such scenarios, three general architectural choices can be considered for the CN and its functions. In the first framework, these functions can be distributed among the different sites of the enterprise, for example for reasons of increased performance or reliability. However, this choice is made at the cost of a more complex management. A second option is to centralize all CN functions. This has the advantage of reducing the complexity and effort of managing and orchestrating the network at the different sites. Finally, a third intermediate stage is possible, called the hybrid model. In this model, a central CN is accompanied by replication of some critical control plane functions to specific distributed sites, such as a production plant, to enable services such as ultra-reliable low-latency communications. These network functions may include the application function, which, for example, must interact with the 5G Core and manufacturing applications; or, for privacy reasons, the user plane function in its role as a gateway to a central database. In contrast to intraenterprise scenarios, inter-enterprise scenarios include business cases where user plane data are shared between different enterprises. In such a setting, communication protocols and network architectural choices must obey even stricter security mechanisms. It is possible that in such scenarios, different private 5G networks come from different vendors and are operated by different MNOs or service providers. The standard solution for interoperability and intercommunication is then to establish secure connections between endpoints or between services that are part of the data networks of the enterprises involved, such as VPN connections. Secure external databases or a database hosted by a party can be used to exchange information between enterprises. As in intraenterprise case, some critical network functions in the control plane must be replicated for reliability and security purposes.",

The simplest case is where the enterprise owns the elements from the user devices to the applications.

The same is true if the enterprise deploys its own core network and applications, but the RAN is shared and connected to the MNO and enterprise core networks. The USIM cards still belong to the enterprise. But in a hybrid model where the enterprise owns its radio and core network, the enterprise user can access both the MNO network and the private network under certain roaming agreements. In the extreme case, in the MNO's private network, the enterprise owns its application where the 5G elements and USIM cards are owned by MNO. Depending on the mapping, users must register or subscribe to both the private network and the MNO network or only to a private network. Governance (i.e., management and orchestration) and skill requirements must also be considered when mapping operator models. The enterprise might need specialized telecom engineers to setup and maintain its own elements, while third parties will mainly need a system integration team and the MNO will govern the elements. Some considerations must also be done on spectrum allocation. The private 5G network may use licensed spectrum with the permission of the MNO license owner or government authorized private spectrum or unlicensed band. Before selecting an operator model for an architecture, some KPIs must also be considered. Latency depends on the data path in a certain operator model. In fact, traffic may be sent only to private edge servers or to both the cloud server and the edge server, which may be physically or logically located on-site, in a local data center or in cloud centers.

In general, fulfilling this group of requirements is less of a problem, when fewer stakeholders are involved in management and operation tasks. For instance, this is the case for the fully private model, where the enterprise retains full control over each and every element, or where the MNO has full control, e.g., in the hybrid and MNO models. Remote access to network elements can be accomplished through standard tools, but if maintenance needs to be carried out locally, access must be guaranteed by the enterprise, which requires bilateral contractual agreements. Additional requirements emerge from the aspect of interoperability of security systems and alignment of security concepts. This is of major concern of the party that which wants to integrate the private 5G network into the local IT infrastructure, i.e., the enterprise. One example is that the UDM and encryption keys shall be accessible and governed by the enterprise. In principle, there are no dependencies between MNO or SP security concepts and that of the enterprise in the fully private model. In fact, private 5G can be securely integrated as needed. Obviously, the MNO might prefer the MNO model as this is the one that requires least IT integration efforts. For models, where many different stakeholders are involved, lack of expertise to carry out certain network lifecycle tasks might be a main problem. In particular, this applies for the enterprise, which generally might lack competencies regarding cellular network management, which includes handling of the spectrum. Here, the enterprise might prefer an MNO-or SP-operated model, such as the hybrid, MVNO or MNO model. Of course, since MNOs and SPs bring in the right expertise, there might be only a few requirements toward the enterprise depending on tasks that could be transferred to the enterprise. In terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, the fully private model may be the clearly preferred model by an enterprise, whereas for the MNO model most requirements can only be fulfilled by contract between the parties, which specify to handle events of data breach, system unavailability, etc., with different kinds of service level agreements. One such requirement is that for confidentiality reasons the UPF shall not be accessible by any other third party in case of unencrypted data transfer. Because fewer other stakeholders are involved in the MNO and hybrid models, they are clearly preferred by an MNO in terms of stakeholder autonomy. While QoS guarantees can be given by technical features through the MNO/SP in their view, the enterprise might want to prefer contracts that would also ensure appropriate QoS beyond today's known use cases. On the contrary, the fully private model might be preferred by the enterprise, where the latter can directly negotiate the network features and QoS guarantees with the network vendor. Other requirements also emerge from concerns related to ownership of and governance over elements by another stakeholder, e.g., easy expansion of UE base. While in many cases this might require additional technical features of extension of the wireless network and compute capacity (technical features), the enterprise might require dedicated capacity expansion plans, which are solved through contractual means.",

Ultimately, the fully private model might be the one to be considered by (large) enterprises, while MNOs and SPs can quite flexibly apply technical solutions solving most of the challenges of private 5G networks and their operation.

Some parts of the spectrum are allocated to general purposes, e.g., Industrial, Scientific, Medical (ISM), and are available unlicensed under strict usage rules. Other parts of the spectrum are licensed, which means that only the license holder can deploy and operate radio equipment and services in this particular spectrum. Spectrum that is designated for terrestrial mobile telecommunication services, needed to operate 4G, 5G and beyond, is usually divided into sub-bands auctioned off to MNO at high prices for a state or country wide license. Such mechanism became an obstacle for availability of designated spectrum to be licensed to professional users for localized private networks which had so far to share unlicensed spectrum potentially with other users and equipment operated in the same spectrum and the same location. This puts feasibility limits for MCC because it is impossible to guarantee quality of service or latency. As a consequence locally available licensed spectrum becomes a prerequisite for the success of Industry 4.0, while unlicensed spectrum provides additional capacity for non-MCC supplementary services. Fortunately, governments have started the process of opening allocated spectrum as licensed shared spectrum or dynamic spectrum sharing for localized use in specific bands to enable the deployment and operation of private 5G networks.",

Of course the edge cloud offers less storage and computational resources than the large data centers. To overcome this issue, virtualization techniques such as virtual machines and containers help in creating an open edge computing environment, in which storage and computational resources are distributed across the edge cloud when and where needed. To properly exploit this possibility, it is necessary to optimize resource placement and scheduling, in particular, it is necessary to choose the nodes that are the most suitable to store the data and to run the applications offloaded from the querying sensors. In performing this selection, we advocate the use of a joint strategy that considers computational and storage resources jointly. Only few works have considered together communication, computation and caching resource. In [38] , the authors solve the problem of service placement and request scheduling aiming to maximize the number of serving requests, allowing direct access only to one server per user. The work in [39] considers overlapping coverage areas for edge nodes with the Fig. 15 5G end-to-end system aim to minimize the request routing to the core cloud (i.e., to maximize the assignment at the edge). Here, we propose a method to minimize the total delay spent on satisfying all service requests, jointly solving the problem where to store services and where to run the requested applications. We consider a wireless edge network consisting of a set N of edge nodes, each one endowed with a MEC server to enable virtualizing network services/applications (VNFs), i.e., equipped with storage, computation and communication capabilities, and endowed with a wireless access point, covering local areas, possibly overlapping. There is a set S of network services, usually consisting of virtual machines and/or containers, able to run such sophisticated applications. Services can be stored on the edge clouds in order to satisfy a set K of sensor devices, each demanding for network services, if there is an active connection link. The aim of our work is to minimize the total system delay occurring for transmitting data from each sensor to an edge server and for processing them. Thus, latency depends on the amount of information data needed to run the desired application, apart from the radio capacity of the transmission link and the computation capacity at the edge cloud. Sensors can offload their data if connected to an access point, then, if none of the neighbor edge nodes cached the demanded service, the device can be routed to a data center, generically indicated as a core cloud C , storing the entire set S of services but placed at a much longer distance. The same occurs if none of the edge server has enough capacity to serve the request. To tackle the problem to solve an Integer Linear Program, we leverage an approximation algorithm based on a randomized rounding [40] , with provably guarantees to satisfy the imposed communication and computation constraints on expectation.",

In 5G-CONNI project, the UPF for the European testbed is designed according to 3GPP standard, and the MEC platform leverages the 5G network architecture and performs the traffic routing and steering function in the UPF. An UL classifier of the UPF can be used to steer the UP traffic matching the filters controlled by the Session Management Function (SMF) to the local data network, where it can be consumed by the MEC application. The Policy Control Function (PCF) and the SMF can set the policy to influence such traffic routing in the UPF. Also, the application function can influence the traffic routing and steering via the PCF. Therefore, MEC in 5G is able to influence the UPF through the standardized Cloud Provider (CP) interface in the SMF. Furthermore, the MEC platform is completely virtualized environment in order to enable seamless application lifecycle management paired with seamless platform management. On the other hand, the bump-in-the-wire MEC for the Taiwanese testbed is implemented according to ETSI standard, where MEC cloud includes an NFV infrastructure and data plane functions. NFV infrastructure is named ECoreCloud. The data plane functions comprise Software-Defined Networking (SDN) switch and Mobile Edge Enabler (MEE) VNF developed, where SDN switch is used to route and mirror the traffic, and MEE VNF provides a traffic steering function so that selected data traffic can be offloaded locally. The MEE VNF is divided into two modules, including the Control Plane Analyzer module and Data Plane Processor. The Control Plane Analyzer module takes charging in decoding and correlating signals, and the Data Plane Processor is to process data plane traffic and steering. The bump-in-thewire MEC standalone prototype is deployed between 5G New Radio and 5G standalone core network, which is a convenient deployment because it does not need the additional configurations for the core and RAN network. Furthermore, the MEC must handle N2 interface according to 3GPP TS38.413 [44] and process the GPRS tunneling protocol user plane extension header packet for N3 interface based on 3GPP TS29.281 [45] so that the GPRS tunneling protocol user plane can be handled properly.",

The virtual network functions are managed by NFV technology, which flexibly allocates virtual resources and provides modular architecture. In addition, SDN enables the communication between virtual network functions. By programmable network routing and separation planes, SDN technology achieves resource isolation for each network slice. With the benefit of NFV and SDN, network slicing allows operators to fast create ondemand network services for 5G vertical industries (e.g., smart factories, remote robotic surgery, and autonomous driving) based on slice configuration. Our goal is to realize a NFV-like lightweight 5G core in 5G CONNI. First, we implement a set of VNFs to run a 4G core and analyze the total completion time including instantiation time and configuration time as our performance metric. Based on our experimental result, the completion time is less than 12 minutes for deploying a total of 20 instances. The deployment efficiency is acceptable for operators to fast create different services. As a result, we will extend the lightweight framework with the same architecture to run a 5G core prototype including AMF, SMF, AUSF, UDM, and UPF.",

The goal is to allocate radio (e.g., transmit power, quantization) and computation resources (e.g., CPU scheduling at the edge server), to explore the trade-off between network energy consumption, end-to-end (E2E) delay and accuracy of the learning task. Here, the E2E delay is intended as the time elapsed from the generation of a new data unit by a sensor/mobile device, until its computation is performed at the Edge Server (ES) to run the online learning task. Indeed, as clear from Fig. 19 , data units experience a local queueing delay (red queue), a transmission delay for data uploading to the ES, a remote queueing delay at the ES (blue queue), and a computing time to be elaborated. The output of the computation performed by the ES is an estimation/prediction/classification result (up right part of the figure).",

The work in [49] proposes an strategy to maximize learning accuracy under latency constraints. Elgabli et al. [50] proposes a decentralized machine learning algorithm that dynamically optimizes a stochastic quantization method, with applications to regression and image classification, and with a communication-efficient perspective. A stochastic gradient descent distributed machine learning algorithm at the edge is presented in [51] . In particular, the authors consider the trade-off between local update and global aggregation. In [52] , the authors present a data compression algorithm to reduce the communication burden and energy consumption of an IoT network, to enable machine learning with a desired target accuracy. Edge machine learning is a research topic at its infancy, so that the research community just started investigating the possible directions. Our goal is to jointly optimize radio and computation resources to minimize the network energy consumption, under constraints on the E2E delay and the accuracy of the learning tasks, which in this case is an estimation task based on least mean squares. The power of the method is that it does not require any prior knowledge of the statistics of data arrivals, radio channels, and data distributions. It should be noted that both the transmit energy consumption of the sensors and the learning accuracy are affected by the number of quantization bits used to encode the data. More bits lead to better accuracy but higher energy consumption, due to the longer payloads to be transmitted. As a measure for the accuracy, we use the Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) between the true parameter and the estimation performed on offloaded data. More technical details can be found in [46] .",

In particular, we want to highlight how, given a certain E2E delay constraint (set to 30 ms), the accuracy affects the performance in term of energy consumption. To this aim, we consider 5 sensors at the same distance from the AP, with the same arrival rate, the same average E2E delay constraint, but different constraints on the MSD (i.e., the accuracy). In particular, we assume that two sensors represent two benchmarks: (i) minimum energy, obtained by the device always transmitting with 3 quantization bits (i.e., the minimum number of bits), for all t; (ii) best accuracy, obtained by the device always transmitting data with 8 quantization bits (i.e., the maximum number of bits). The other three devices have different intermediate requirements for the MSD. In Fig. 20a , we show the average E2E delay as a function of the sensor energy consumption, obtained by tuning a trade-off parameter from Lyapunov optimization [46] . In particular, the parameter increases from right to left, as shown in the figure. From Fig. 20a , we can notice how the energy consumption decreases while the E2E delay increases. However, this trade-off is different among the different devices due to the different accuracy constraints. In particular, let us first comment on the results for the two benchmarks. The green curve (squared marker) shows the best accuracy case, which indeed achieves the highest minimum energy among all devices, given the E2E delay (the legend of all figures is shown in Fig. 20a ). At the same time, from Fig. 20b , which shows the MSD vs. the time index, we can notice how this device achieves the minimum MSD. These first two results are due to the maximum number of quantization bits shown in Fig. 20c , which reaches the highest value for this device. Note that the average number of quantization bits is shown as a function of the Lyapunov tuning parameter, using the same values as for Fig. 20a . On the other hand, the blue curve (triangle marker) represents the minimum energy case, and it achieves the worst accuracy due to the minimum number of quantization bits adopted, as can be noticed from Fig. 20a -c. The other curves represent intermediate energy cases obtained fixing a target MSD constraint, and can be interpreted via similar analysis over Fig. 20a -c. Finally, the energy consumption of the ES decreases as the Lyapunov parameter increases, until reaching a floor as the device energy consumption (Fig. 20d) . In summary, the takehome message of Fig. 20 is twofold: (i) Our method is able to obtain a low system energy solution with accuracy and E2E delay guarantees; (ii) by relaxing the accuracy constraint, lower energy can be achieved due to the lower number of quantization bits, which translates into a lower average data rate over the wireless interface.",

RAN-DU sits close to the radio unit and runs the RLC, MAC, and parts of the PHY layer. This logical node includes a subset of the eNB/gNB functions, depending on the functional split option, and its operation is controlled by the RAN-CU Radio Access Network-Central Unit (RAN-CU) The RAN-CU is responsible for non-real time, higher L2 and L3. RAN-CU runs the RRC and PDCP layers. The split architecture enables a 5G network to utilize different distribution of protocol stacks between RAN-CU and RAN-DUs depending on midhaul availability and network design. It is a logical node that includes the gNB functions like transfer of user data, mobility control, RAN sharing, positioning, session management etc., with the exception of functions that are allocated exclusively to the RAN-DU. The RAN-CU controls the operation of several RAN-DUs over the midhaul interface Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)The SIM is a fundamental element of the cellular system, because it allows authenticating the validity of a terminal as it tries to access the network.
