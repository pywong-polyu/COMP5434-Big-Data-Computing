However, the World Health Organization (WHO) Guideline on Health Policy and System Support to Optimize Community Health Worker Programmes reveals important gaps in the evidentiary certainty about which health system design practices lead to quality care. Routine data collection across countries represents an important, yet often untapped, opportunity for exploratory data analysis and comparative implementation science. However, epidemiological indicators must be harmonized and data pooled to better leverage and learn from routine data collection. Methods: This article describes a data harmonization and pooling Collaborative led by the organizations of the Community Health Impact Coalition, a network of health practitioners delivering community-based healthcare in dozens of countries across four WHO regions. Objectives: The goals of the Collaborative project are to; (i) enable new opportunities for cross-site learning; (ii) use positive and negative outlier analysis to identify, test, and (if helpful) propagate design practices that lead to quality care; and (iii) create a multi-country 'brain trust' to reinforce data and health information systems across sites. Results: This article outlines the rationale and methods used to establish a data harmonization and pooling Collaborative, early findings, lessons learned, and directions for future research.",

The intention was to choose a list of indicators that included both aspirational measures and indicators reflective of what organizations were already monitoring ( Table 1 ). The aspiration was to make a statement about what community health programs ought to strive to measure and monitor, based on members' collective experience in CHW programming. For instance, more organizations measured the proportion of children assessed within 72 hours of symptom onset rather than within 24 hours; however, as malaria and other childhood illnesses can often cause suffering and death within the first 24 hours, an ambitious target was set (metric 1, Table 1 ) [7] . Likewise, rather than simply focusing on metrics pertaining to service coverage, a deliberate effort was made to triangulate indicators for quality and speed of care.",

While this has since improved with the 2021 release of the Guidance for Community Health Worker Strategic Information and Service Monitoring and CHW-led work on construct definition, it is still necessary to identify which service delivery metrics best predict impact outcomes and to drive uptake of harmonized definitions [10, 11] . Second, in a context in which hundreds of randomized trials demonstrate the efficacy of CHW programs [3, 12] , large-scale programs often produce no results, and the capture and analysis of service delivery implementation data on program speed, quality, and coverage is needed to foster necessary quality improvement [13] .",

CHWs provide the services and acquire community-level programmatic data that make the data harmonization Collaborative possible, a contribution often undervalued by the norms and regulations in global health research. CHW supervisors and program managers ensure that coverage, speed, and quality care are provided to communities, and that the data collected are complete and reliable.
