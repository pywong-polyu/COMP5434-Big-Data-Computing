The policy overlooked the dynamic interactions between people's motivations to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and their economic capacity to survive.",

With this massive and rapid exeat, COVID-19 infections were exported from high-infection conurbation of Bangkok to other parts of the country and many of travellers' destinations reported upticks in COVID-19 cases in early April-data can be found (Thailand's Department of Disease Control, 2020a).",

Therefore, their inability to survive economically outweighed their motivations to stay in Bangkok, and their urgency to travel via underprepared mass transit increased the contact rate from infected travellers to others. The causal pathway of these unintended, adverse policy consequences can be seen in Figure 1 .",
