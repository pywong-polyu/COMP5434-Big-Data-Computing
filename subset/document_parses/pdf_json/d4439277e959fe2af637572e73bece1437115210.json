In all three countries, we find that following the implementation of mobility restriction measures, human movement decreased substantially. Importantly, we also uncover large and persistent differences in mobility reduction between wealth groups: on average, users in the top decile of wealth reduced their mobility up to twice as much as users in the bottom decile. For decision-makers seeking to efficiently allocate resources to response efforts, these findings highlight that smartphone location data can be leveraged to tailor policies to the needs of specific socioeconomic groups, especially the most vulnerable.",

Abouk and Heydari [11] outlined the ways in which different types of locationbased mobility information can help to better target and design measures to contain and slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Together with daily state-level data on COVID-19 tests and confirmed cases, they rank policies based on their effectiveness using a difference-in-differences approach. They found that statewide stay-at-home orders had the strongest causal impact on reducing social interactions. Klein et al. [12] analyzed mobility data for the US and find that, by March 23, the policies enacted had reduced by half the overall mobility in several major US cities. Along the same line, Pepe et al. [13] analyzed GPS data in Italy and found that the restrictions in mobility, closure of public spaces, and the enhancement of smart/remote working, led to an average reduction of potential encounters of 8% during week the second week and almost 19% during third week following the outbreak. Kraemer et al. [3] used real-time mobility data from Wuhan along with travel history to investigate case transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of implemented policy. Tian et al. [14] investigated the spread and control of COVID-19 using a dataset that included case reports, human movement, and public health interventions, and found that the Wuhan shutdown effectively delayed the arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days. Maloney and Taskin [15] used Google mobility data for a large sample of countries across various income levels to assess the determinants of mobility changes during the pandemic. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to quantify the differences in mobility reduction between socioeconomic groups in developing countries.",

We define a user's home location to be her most frequently visited administrative unit during nighttime hours (11pm-7am) in our period of analysis.

This allows us to capture the diversity of places visited, controlling for the level of activity of each user. We then normalize our measure by the average number of neighborhood visits across users during the period of analysis, for ease of interpretation.

Immediately after this, the number of neighborhoods visited decreased and stabilized in a manner similar to Mexico. In Colombia, mirroring the trend observed in the time users spend at home, the number of neighborhoods visited started increasing again after the sharp decrease that happened in mid-March. 10 Overall, the number of neighborhoods visited decreased between 50 and 100% more for high-wealth users compared to low-wealth users.",

The analysis presented here can provide information about the groups and areas that may need targeted interventions, and where the provision of additional services complementing social distancing measures is warranted. Such services could include dedicated information campaigns to increase awareness, and additional resources assigned to protect those that cannot stay home. By looking at the mobility patterns of those that are constrained to move around the city during a lockdown, policymakers could think about how to safely provide bus routes services to maintain connectivity between areas that are seeing sustained flows. In overcrowded areas where staying home is difficult, policymakers could think about investments in open spaces, and through that facilitate the implementation of social distancing measures. This type of analysis could also be used as input to assess the risks and immediate impacts of lifting lockdown measures. Thinking ahead, policymakers can use the analysis in this paper to identify areas that may require additional investments to build long-term resilience through better services.",

We computed 4 indicators of mobility: A-C) the average time users spend at home, D-F) the share of users commuting from home to work, G-I) the average number of neighborhoods (defined by administrative units) in which they are active, and J-L) the maximum distance between their GPS locations. Users are divided into deciles based on the value of the wealth index of the admin unit where they live. For each mobility indicator, we report changes in mobility relative to the average mobility computed during the first 2 weeks of February for all users (black), users in the top decile (orange) and users in the bottom decile (blue). Average value during the first 2 weeks of February, and the change relative to the first 2 weeks of April are reported in parentheses and indicated by the horizontal dotted lines. Taken together, this figure documents a large and persistent mobility gap between users based on their wealth.",
