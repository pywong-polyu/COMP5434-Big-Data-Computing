Research to identify effective therapies for COVID-19 includes: (1) designing a vaccine as future protection; (2) de novo drug discovery; and (3) identifying existing drugs to repurpose them as effective and immediate treatments. To assist in drug repurposing and design, we determine two apo structures of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease at ambient temperature by serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography. We employ detailed molecular simulations of selected known main protease inhibitors with the structures and compare binding modes and energies. The combined structural and molecular modeling studies not only reveal the dynamics of small molecules targeting the main protease but also provide invaluable opportunities for drug repurposing and structurebased drug design strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",

On March 11, 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which originated from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infec-1965). In 2002, a deadly version of coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was identified in China (Heymann and Rodier, 2004) . SARS-CoV-2, the most recent member of the coronavirus family to be encountered, is a close relative of SARS-CoV and causes many systemic diseases (Andersen et al., 2020; Dutta and Sengupta, 2021; Braun et al., 2020) . COVID-19 patients exhibit (1) high Creactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels; (2) macrophage and monocyte infiltration to lung tissue; (3) atrophy of spleen and lymph nodes, which weakens the immune system; (4) lymphopenia; and (5) vasculitis (Zhang et al., 2020a McGonagle et al., 2020) . The release of a large amount of cytokines results in acute respiratory distress syndrome causing aggravation and widespread tissue injury, leading to multi-organ failure and death. Therefore, mortality in many severe cases of COVID-19 patients has been linked to the presence of the cytokine storm evoked by the virus (Ragab et al., 2020) .",

Among these, ORF1a/b encodes papain-like protease (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, along with polyproteins named polyprotein1a (pp1a) and polyprotein1b (pp1b) (Astell et al., 2005) . Encoded polyproteins are then proteolyzed to NSPs by precise Mpro and PLpro cleavages of the internal scissile bonds. NSPs are vital for viral replication, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Nsp13, which are used for the expression of structural proteins of the virus (Dai et al., 2020; Thiel et al., 2003; Ullrich and Nitsche, 2020; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . SARS-CoV Mpro has no homologous human protease that recognizes the same cleavage site (Pillaiyar et al., 2016) . Therefore, drugs that target its active site are predicted to be less toxic and harmful to humans (Zhang et al., 2020a (Zhang et al., , 2020b . High sequence conservation of Mpro provides minimized mutation-caused drug resistance . Given its essential role in the viral life cycle (Dai et al., 2020; Thiel et al., 2003; Ullrich and Nitsche, 2020; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) , the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro presents a major drug target requiring a detailed structural study.",

            "text": "Structure-based drug repurposing is a rapid method of identifying potential therapies that could be effective against COVID-19 compared with continuous investigative efforts (e.g., identification of new drugs and development of preventive vaccine therapies). The well-studied properties of drugs currently in clinical use mean that such compounds are better understood than their counterparts designed de novo. A putative drug candidate identified by drug-repurposing studies could make use of existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution, an advantage over developing new therapies (Chen et al., 2020a; Huang et al., 2020; Pushpakom et al., 2019; Jarada et al., 2020) . In previous drug-repurposing studies, approved drug libraries were typically screened against the active site or an allosteric site of target protein structures, which were traditionally obtained by methods with limitations in revealing the enzyme structure, e.g., cryogenic temperature or radiation damage Kneller et al., 2020) . Such investigations generally only involve screening of drugs currently on the market Choudhary et al., 2020; Beck et al., 2020; Wang, 2020) . Current structural biology-oriented studies that display a repurposing approach to SARS-CoV-2 research have focused on structurebased drug design, virtual screening, and a wide spectrum of inhibitors based on previously published tertiary protein structure alignments (Rathnayake et al., 2020; Chauhan and Kalra, 2020; Chen et al., 2020a Chen et al., , 2020b Chen et al., , 2020c Muralidharan et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2020) . Given the high-infectivity and persistence of SARS-CoV-2, any molecular candidates identified through drug-repurposing studies could be a potential treatment in the short term and should thus be investigated using empiric structural data.",

Domain II of Mpro resides between residues 101 through 180 and mostly consists of antiparallel b sheets. The third domain of the Mpro is located between residues 181 through 306 and consists of mostly a helices and has a more globular tertiary structure ( Figure S3 ). The intersection between domain I, domain II, and the loop region of domain III is the key region for enzyme activity ( Figure S3 ), which forms the catalytic site and substrate binding pocket of the enzyme. The biologically active form of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is a homodimer (Zhang et al., 2020a (Zhang et al., , 2020b . Previous biochemical studies of SARS-CoV Mpro suggested that there is a competition for the dimerization surface between domains I and III. In the absence of domain I, Mpro undergoes a new type of dimerization through domain III (Zhong et al., 2008) . During our purifications, we repeatedly observed a combination of monomeric and dimeric forms of Mpro on sizeexclusion chromatography steps that may be caused by this dynamic compositional and conformational equilibrium.",

Temperature factor analysis revealed that the active site is surrounded by mobile regions ( Figure S4 ). The presence of these mobile regions was observed in both SFX crystal structures, suggesting intrinsic plasticity rather than a structural artifact arising from the crystal lattice contacts (Figure S4 ; indicated with red circles). Furthermore, this intrinsic plasticity suggests that inhibitor molecules that interact via non-covalent bonds to the Mpro binding pocket would do so weakly (Gao et al., 2021) . Our investigation of PDB structures with available electron densities identified that the majority of the Mpro inhibitors formed covalent bonds with the active site residue Cys145. In addition, few non-covalent inhibitors were identified among the available structures in September 2020, which have downloadable electron densities and exhibited weak electron densities ( Figure S5 .).",

Thus, we compared our monoclinic ambient-temperature SFX structure with the previously published ambient-temperature X-ray structure PDB: 6WQF for observing minimization of secondary radiation damage effect on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure by SFX technology. Both structures were largely similar with an RMSD value of 0.404 \u00c5 (Figure 2A ). We observed significant conformational differences, especially in the side chains of Thr24, Ser46, Glu47, Leu50, Asn142, Cys145, Met165, and Gln189 residues ( Figures 2B and S6 ). As suggested before, flexibility could conceivably help design by providing alternative binding sites for non-native molecules (Niu et al., 2008) . Observed significant conformational differences are caused by intrinsic flexibility around the binding pocket in our SFX structure. This flexibility allows us to observe alternative side-chain conformations inaccessible to the ambient-temperature X-ray structure (PDB: 6WQF). The calculated bias-free composite omit map that covers the active region has been shown (Figures 3B and S7) . This structure offers insights into the active site of Mpro complementary to the PDB: 6WQF structure, which may be important for future ligand screening and in silico modeling studies. All three domains contribute to the formation of the active site of the protein. The intersection of domain I residue His41 and domain II residues Cys145 and His164 interact via a coordinated water molecule with Asp187 located at the N-terminal loop region of domain III to form the active site (Figures 2C and S8) . The N-terminal loop of domain III is suggested to be involved in enzyme activity (Ma et al., 2020) . The distance between Cys145 Sg and His41 N\u03b52 is 3.7 \u00c5 , similar to the ambient-temperature structure PDB: 6WQF (Kneller et al., 2020) . Od1-Od2 atoms of Asp187 and NH2-N\u03b5 atoms of Arg40 contribute to a salt bridge between these two residues and stabilize the positions of each other. The W5 water molecule (indicated with a red sphere at the figure) in the active site plays crucial roles for catalysis (Kneller et al., 2020) . W5 forms triple H bonds with His41, His164, and Asp187 side chains with the distances of 2.8, 2.9, and 2.8 \u00c5 , respectively ( Figures 2C and S8) . There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit cell colored in dark salmon (left). A biologically relevant dimeric form is generated by application of a symmetry operator which is colored in green.

As the catalytically active form of Mpro is a homodimer, we have used the dimeric form of crystal structures. For the SFX structure obtained in space group C121 with a monomeric asymmetric unit, the relevant dimeric form is generated by symmetry operation. The MD simulations were run for 200 ns to elucidate the dynamic effects on the structures, specifically for the active site region. The evolutionary changes of atomic coordinates over time were monitored by calculating the RMSD for both chains, i.e., protomers (Figures S12 and S13 for PDB: 7CWB and 7CWC, respectively). The root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) were also computed based on Ca atoms for both protomers separately (Figures S14 and S15 for PDB: 7CWB and 7CWC, respectively) to determine the flexible regions. In simulations for both PDB: 7CWB and 7CWC, the protomers exhibit non-identical behavior as also observed by others in apo form of Mpro (Su\u00e1 rez and D\u00edaz, 2020; Sheik Amamuddy et al., 2020) , although, as The 2F o \u00c0 F c electron density belonging to the N-terminal region of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is contoured at the 1s level and colored in gray.

            "text": "Principal-component analysis correlates the interdomain motions and its impact on the drug-binding pocket dynamics The trajectory frames obtained from MD simulations were used to perform principal-component analysis (PCA) to determine the variations of conformers of protein structures, i.e., to observe the slowest motions during MD simulations. As PCA and PCAbased methods are useful to reveal intrinsically accessible movements, such as domain motions (Bahar et al., 2010) , we have performed PCA for backbone atoms of dimeric units for the structures belonging to different space groups. We focused on the first three principal components (PCs), which show around 40% of the total variance in MD trajectories, to determine the regions of protein structures that display the highest variation (Figures S16 and S17 for PDB: 7CWB and 7CWC, respectively). The first three PCs were projected onto the protein structures to determine the contributions of each residue to specified PCs. The motions of specific regions with blue regions with higher thickness represent more mobile structural parts of the protein along the specified PCs. We also provide supplementary movies to illustrate the movements along the species PCs: in Videos S1, S2, and S3 the motions along PC1, PC2, and PC3 for PDB: 7CWB are displayed, respectively, while for PDB: 7CWC the movements along first three PCs are displayed in Videos S4, S5, and S6, respectively. In the movies, different colors represent the different domains of the enzyme such that domain I is colored in light blue, domain II is colored in cyan, and domain III is colored in dark salmon for both protomers A and B. In all of the movies presented, protomer A is shown on the right and protomer B is shown on the left. It can be seen that both in C121 and P2 1 2 1 2 1 space group structures, again protomers A and B display asymmetric behavior and domain movements along all considered PCs (Figures 4A-4C for PDB: 7CWB and Figures 4D-4F for PDB: 7CWC) (Sheik Amamuddy et al., 2020) . When the motions displayed by two dimeric forms are compared with each other, we observe that domain III is more mobile in PDB: 7CWB compared with PDB: 7CWC (Videos S1, S2, and S3 for PDB: 7CWB and M4-M6 for PDB: 7CWC). However, the loop region containing residues 45-53 around the catalytic site is more mobile for both protomers in PDB: 7CWC, while it is only mobile for chain B of PDB: 7CWB. Interestingly, protomer A of PDB: 7CWC is more mobile compared with protomer A of PDB: 7CWB, which could reflect the differences in dimeric interface due to the additional four N-terminal amino acids and missing interactions with chain B N-terminal residues in the dimer interface. However, the loop regions surrounding the binding pockets with residues 166-172 and 185-195 display higher flexibility in chain A of PDB: 7CWB, while its mobility is somewhat restricted in PDB: 7CWC.",

            "text": "We have also performed cross-correlation analysis of residues along the PC space to understand the correlation between motions especially for different domains. The correlation between the motions along the first three PCs were plotted as dynamical cross-correlation maps, displayed in Figures 4G and 4H for PDB: 7CWB and 7CWC, respectively. Focusing on the correlation between motions within protomers initially, we see that motions of domains I and III as well as domains I and II are mostly anti-correlated, as shown by the purple regions in Figure 4G for PDB: 7CWB and Figure 4H for PDB: 7CWC. While we observed similar behavior for protomers A and B of PDB: 7CWC, the directions of domains I and III movements are different in protomers A and B of PDB: 7CWB, specifically for residues [189] [190] [191] [192] , which are at the linkage points of domains II and III and residues 45-50 of domain I bordering the catalytic site. While in protomer A, these loops move in the same directions, their movements are mostly anti-correlated in protomer B for the slowest motion along PC1 in PDB: 7CWB (Video S1, Figure 4G ). This could cause differences in the accessibility of catalytic sites in a time-dependent manner in protomers of PDB: 7CWB. On the other hand, domains II and III within protomers have mixed correlations with each other in which motions of some residues are along the same directions, others are in opposite directions within both protomers A and B of PDB: 7CWB, while domain II has limited mobility as being more buried than other domains (Su\u00e1 rez and D\u00edaz, 2020) except for the b strand segment of residues 166-172 of protomer A. Surprisingly, this segment also has some mobility, albeit limited, in protomer B of PDB: 7CWC instead of protomer A (Video S4; Figure 4H) . Glu166 of this segment is actually an important residue that plays a role in stabilizing the substrate binding site S1 by interacting with Ser1 of the alternate protomer along with Phe140 (Ghahremanpour et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020) and we observed that, along PC1, for protomer A of PDB: 7CWB and protomer B of PDB: 7CWC, the motions of these residues are correlated (Video S1 for PDB: 7CWB and M4 for PDB: 7CWC). This could have implications about information transfer from one protomer to the other, although other Mpro structures of SARS-CoV-2 need to be studied in atomistic detail. In addition, we observed that correlations between domains of protomers A and B for PDB: 7CWB and 7CWC are dissimilar. For instance, domains I of PDB: 7CWB have defined anti-correlated motions as can be seen from the purple areas in Figure 4H , while in PDB: 7CWC the movements of domain I are more ambiguous. There are also differences in the behavior of domain I of protomer A and domain II of protomer B in the dimer structures in which for PDB: 7CWB the motions of these domains are positively correlated while they are anti-correlated in PDB: 7CWC.",

Selected Mpro structures were cryogenic apo form (Zhang et al., 2020a (Zhang et al., , 2020b ) (PDB: 6Y2E and 7C2Y), holoprotein with non-covalent inhibitor, X77 (PDB: 6W63), and a room-temperature apo-form structure (Kneller et al., 2020) (PDB: 6WQF). Space groups of these structures are C121, P2 1 2 1 2 1 , P2 1 2 1 2, and I121, respectively. The completeness of the structures was also evaluated: PDB: 6WQF, and 6Y2E crystallized in fulllength sequence (1-306); however, PDB: 6W63 only lacks Gln306 at both C-terminal ends of its chains. Among compared structures, PDB: 7C2Y, which has the same space group as PDB: 7CWC, lacks 24 amino acid residues (chain A, 1-3, 141-142, 281-283, and 298; chain B, 1-2, 45-50, 139-142, and 277-279) . In our structures, PDB: 7CWB has a full-length sequence; however, PDB: 7CWC lacks its last six amino acid residues from the C-terminal in chain A, and starts with Phe3 (lacks Ser1 and Gly2), and ends at Ser301, lacking the last five residues. When six structures (PDB: 6W63, 6Y2E, 6WQF, 7C2Y, 7CWB, and 7CWC) were compared based on hydrogen bonding interactions at the dimerization interfaces, more similarities were observed for the latter three (PDB: 7C2Y, 7CWB, and 7CWC). One of the main differences between our structures and the other four is the hydrogen bond between Ser139 (chain A) and Gln299 (chain B) ( Figure S18 ). Although this hydrogen bond is not observed in other structures, the corresponding residues are close to each other; however, they are not within hydrogen bonding distance ( Figure S19 ).",

(2020) was screened in a library of around 10,000 compounds consisting of approved drugs, compounds in clinical trials, and natural products, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. They identified six specific hit compounds, of which the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values range from 0.67 to 21.4 mM. In this study, we used the top 3 hit compounds (i.e., Ebselen [IC 50 = 0.67 mM], Tideglusib [IC 50 = 1.55 mM], and Carmofur [IC 50 = 1.90 mM]) for the investigation of ligand-target interactions. These compounds were docked to the PDB: 7CWB and 7CWC structures and all-atom MD simulations were performed for the top-docking poses. An induced fit docking (IFD) approach was conducted to better account for the flexibility of both of the ligands and the active site of the target structures. These three compounds were also docked to structures with PDB: 6W63 and 6Y2E (cryogenic) for comparison. MD simulations were performed using the same MD protocol as performed for apo-form structures. Results showed that, especially for apo-form dimer targets, Ebselen and Carmofur are quite flexible at the binding pocket throughout the simulations and, in most cases, they do not form a stable complex structure ( Figure S23 ). Tideglusib has a more stable structure at the binding pocket of Mpro; however, its binding modes are different at the different targets considered in this study ( Figure 5 ).",

Tideglusib initially docked to the binding pockets of dimeric Mpro structures PDB: 6Y2E and 7CWC using an IFD approach. Top-docking poses of these compounds were then used in all-atom MD simulations using the same MD protocols. While Tideglusib was structurally very stable at the binding pocket of PDB: 7CWC during the simulations, it was not so stable at the binding site of PDB: 6Y2E ( Figure 5A ). Representative trajectory frames (i.e., the frame that has the lowest RMSD to the average structures) were used in the comparison of binding modes ( Figure 5B ). Results showed that, while the binding mode of Tideglusib forms hydrogen bonds and p-p stacking interactions with Glu166, Gln189, and His172, respectively, at PDB: 7CWC its corresponding binding mode at PDB: 6Y2E only forms van der Waals type interactions with hydrophobic moieties. A timeline of protein-ligand contacts was visualized throughout the simulations ( Figure 5C ). Results showed that Thr25, Leu27, Met49, Glu166, and Gln189 form stable interactions with the ligand at PDB: 7CWC. However, corresponding interactions of the ligand at the active site of PDB: 6Y2E were not stable ( Figure S24 ). Ligand interactions with protein residues that occur for more than 15% of the simulation time are also presented ( Figure 5D ). Comparison of binding pocket volumes of PDB: 7CWC and cryogenic Mpro structure (PDB; 6Y2E) shows that the latter has a bigger average binding pocket volume ( Figure S25 ). Average binding pocket volumes were 174 and 142 \u00c5 3 for Tideglusib bound PDB: 6Y2E and 7CWC structures, respectively. Corresponding solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) values throughout the MD simulations also support this result. The SASA, which is the surface area of a molecule accessible by a water molecule of PDB: 7CWC is smaller than PDB: 6Y2E ( Figure S25 ).",

The naphthalene ring of the ligand formed a p-p stacking interaction with the His41 in the PDB: 7CWB structure. A similar binding mode of Tideglusib was observed when PDB: 6WQF was used. However, in this binding mode, His41 and Gly143 are found to be important. A backbone hydrogen bond was observed between one of the carbonyl oxygens of the thiadiazolidine ring and Gly143. His41 formed two p-p stacking interactions between the benzyl and the naphthalene rings of Tideglusib ll OPEN ACCESS Article ( Figures S26A and S26B ). These two binding modes predicted by IFD were used in 200 ns classical all-atom MD simulations. Each Mpro-Tideglusib system is evaluated based on RMSD changes from the average structure and we obtained representative structures from corresponding trajectories. In the representative structure of the PDB: 7CWB-Tideglusib complex, we observed van der Waals interactions between surrounding residues: Thr25, His41, Cys44, Thr45, Ser46, Met49, Asn142, Cys145, His163, His164, Met165, Glu166, and Gln189.

This has been the focus of several structural and biochemical studies, many of which have been performed at cryogenic temperatures, aiming to provide better understanding of the active site dynamics and reveal an inhibitor that affects the enzyme based on structural information. In our study, two crystal forms of Mpro, native and modified, were determined at ambient temperature with resolutions of 1.9 and 2.1 \u00c5 , respectively. The two produced crystal forms are optimal for co-crystallization and soaking, respectively. Cocrystallization experiments provide efficient interaction in the binding pocket as both drug and protein are stabilized before the formation of crystals. Due to the close crystal lattice contacts, co-crystallization should be the preferred method for larger molecules against the native form of Mpro in the space group C121. However, there are numerous successful soaking experiments with small non-covalent fragments (Douangamath et al., 2020) . Residues at the N terminus of Mpro play a critical role in crystal packing. Elimination of the H-bonding network produced orthorhombic crystals in the P2 1 2 1 2 1 space group yielding a wider binding pocket, increasing the probability of capturing an expanded number of protein-drug complexes by soaking. Obtaining two different crystal forms helped eliminate the artifacts introduced by specific lattice packing restraints of each crystal form and thereby increased the quality of the MD analysis. However, the presence of four additional residues at the N terminus could hinder soaking or co-crystallization efforts given that $200 ligand-bound structures of Mpro have been reported (Douangamath et al., 2020) .",

Due to the anionic nature of Cys145, it seems challenging to design molecules that interact with the active site only through non-covalent bonds as it has a flexible region (Chang, 2010) . These findings provide a structural basis for and are consistent with studies claiming that the majority of inhibitors form covalent bonds with the active site of Mpro through Cys145 ). In particular, unlike that suggested by some studies, Ebselen does not form a stable complex structure Sies and Parnham, 2020; Men\u00e9 ndez et al., 2020; Zmudzinski et al., 2020; Weglarz-Tomczak et al., 2021) , ( Figure S30 ). The Cys145 residue is a key amino acid for catalytic activity, on the other hand the coordinated W5 molecule, regulating the catalytic reaction via triple hydrogen bonding interactions with His164 and Asp187, which stabilizes the positive charge of the His41 residue (Kneller et al., 2020) .

(Dai et al., 2020) ; along with these amino acids, Thr24 makes van der Waals interaction with the N3 inhibitor, and Ser46 undergoes conformational changes in the presence of this inhibitor (PDB: 6LU7). N3 bound Mpro through Leu50 gives different side-chain conformations with SFX according to the PDB: 6WQF structure (Kneller et al., 2020) (Figure 2B ). There were differences in the crystallization conditions between the SFX and PDB: 6WQF studies, the former making use of charge effects and the latter molecular crowding. Kneller et al. (2020) elegantly presented the major differences between cryogenic and ambient-temperature Mpro structures. The SFX study is eliminating potential artifacts to examine crucial amino acids at the atomic level, especially in terms of catalytic and inhibitor binding sites. An example of this is the decarboxylation of acidic residues, something frequently encountered at high X-ray doses ( Figures S6-S8 ) (Martin-Garcia et al., 2016; Johansson et al., 2017) . These two high-resolution SFX structures in different space groups reveal alternate active site residue conformations, intra-and inter-domain networks, and their dynamics at the atomic level. This information provides a better understanding of structural allosteric transitions of Mpro interacting with the inhibitors (Figures 5 and S23-S30) . Therefore, considering the importance of the required sensitivity in drug design or the use of natural compounds in the studies, these active site residue conformations reveal the critical importance of our study more clearly.",

Although potent antiviral drug candidates have been identified and several vaccines are on the market, a desirable final cure has not yet been found. Having access to the alternative ambient-temperature structures of Mpro and observed conformational changes on active site residues will be a significant boon for the development of therapeutics by providing robust models for computational studies and a better understanding of ligand and inhibitor binding. At this point, our work has two original aspects. Firstly, we used a comprehensive platform, SFX, which helps to deeply understand the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 and the structural dynamics of the target protein Mpro at near-physiological temperatures. Secondly, we determined two high-resolution SFX structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in two different space groups due to an upgraded highthroughput data collection setup offered by the MFX instrument of the LCLS-II.",

            "text": "A grave issue with antiviral drug research is the variability of the target proteins, as the mutations and modifications may render the found drugs ineffective (Dinesh et al., 2019) . For this reason, working with a protein whose biochemical properties are conserved over time and carries significant importance among different strains. Evolutionarily, viruses bypass the host immune system by mimicking the proteins involved in the functioning of the host organism. For instance, the cytomegalovirus can mimic a common host protein to hijack normal cell growth machinery or the human immunodeficiency virus can mimic a high percentage of human T cell receptors (Root-Bernstein, 2017; Robertson, 2003) . SARS-CoV-2 virus contains the PLpro enzyme, which is highly similar to the deubiquitinating enzymes as ubiquitin-specific proteases 7 and 14 (USP7, USP14) in ll OPEN ACCESS Article human metabolism, which potentially pose the risk of interfering host metabolic pathways (Ratia et al., 2014) . In addition, the spike protein, one of the other targeted proteins, has a higher mutation rate (Jia et al., 2020) , and it includes a similar restriction site with epithelial channel protein (Anand et al., 2020) . Besides, inhibitors that target the spike protein provide a more effective solution before the host cell is infected by the virus. As there is no Mpro homolog in the human genome, targeting this protease is therefore highly attractive due to reduced cross-reactivity and side effects, making it an ideal candidate for drug therapy (Goyal and Goyal, 2020) In contrast, covalent inhibitors may show cross-reactivity with human enzymes and are therefore less appealing as drug candidates.",

Knowing the beneficial and detrimental ef-fects of targeted drugs, along with well-established precautions, will help with time limitations. This procedure has emerged as a fundamental and very strategic approach, not only for prospective cohort design but also for many types of clinical trials. In particular, cross-sectional studies which require a large data pool, would benefit, as repurposed molecules have well-defined profiles and would not require prolonged pre-clinical studies. Hence, these molecules could be potential candidates to consider in the case of disease emergencies or outbreaks (Su and Sanger, 2017; Cavalla, 2013; Choo et al., 2019; Aguila and Cua, 2020) . Considering all of this, adopting a drug-repurposing approach and using the known inhibitors Ebselen, Tideglusib, and Carmofur to carry out Mpro-based in silico molecular docking, MD simulations and post-MD analyses make our hybrid approach more specific for subsequent future studies. Our structural active site dynamics data further provide the nearest physiological template for future structure-based drug design and development of new Mpro inhibitors.

After sonication step, cell lysate was centrifuged by using The Beckman Optima\u00d4 L-80 XP Ultracentrifuge at 40000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 C by using Ti45 rotor (Beckman, USA). After ultracentrifugation, the pellet which contained membranes and insoluble debris was discarded and clear supernatant applied to nickel affinity chromatography by using a Ni-NTA agarose resin (QIAGEN, USA). To purify the Mpro protein, first the chromatography column was equilibrated by flowing 3 column volume of the loading buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HAc pH 7.5, 5 mM Imidazole, 150 mM NaCl. After equilibration, the supernatant containing the overexpressed Mpro protein was loaded into the Ni-NTA agarose column at 2 ml/minute flow rate. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with 5 column volumes of the loading buffer to clear the non-specific binding. After washing, hexa-histidine tagged Mpro proteins were eluted from the column with the elution buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HAc pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole in 35 ml of total volume. After elution, purified protein was placed in a 3 kDa cut off dialysis membrane and dialyzed against the buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HAc pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl overnight to get rid of the excess Imidazole. After the dialysis step, we applied 1:100 stoichiometric molar ratio 3C protease (PreScission protease, GenScript, USA) to cleave the C-terminal hexa-histidine tag of construct-1 with native N-& C-terminals. For construct-2 with modified N-terminus we used thrombin protease (Sigma, USA) to get rid of the N-terminal hexa-histidine tag. Both PreCision and thrombin cleavage have been performed overnight at 4 C. In the final purification step, to remove the cleaved hexa-histidine tag and other non-specific binding proteins we applied the solution to reverse Ni-NTA chromatography and collected the unbound fractions containing the untagged Mpro protein.

The sitting drop solutions were then covered with 20 ml of 100% paraffin oil (Tekkim Kimya, Turkey). All the crystallization experiments were performed at ambient-temperature. For our native construct-1 we were able to obtain multiple hit conditions and among them the best crystals were obtained at Pact Premier TM crystallization screen 1 condition #39 from Molecular Dimensions, UK. The best crystallization condition has contained 100 mM MMT buffer pH 6.0 and 25 % w/v PEG 1500 [MMT buffer; DL-Malic acid, 4-Morpholine Ethane Sulfonic acid (MES) monohydrate, 2-Amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3propanediol (TRIS)-HCl]. For the modified construct only one crystallization condition yields the macrocrystals. After multiple optimization of the seeding protocol by using crystals obtained by microbatch under oil, we scaled up the batch crystallization volume to a total of 14 ml for native construct-1 and total volume of 50 ml for modified construct-2. Microcrystals 1-5 3 5-10 3 10-20 mm 3 in size were passed through 100 micron plastic mesh filters (Millipore, USA) in the same mother liquor composition to eliminate the large single crystals and other impurities before the data collection. Crystal concentration was approximated to be 10 10 -10 11 particles per ml based on light microscopy. Due to COVID19 travel restrictions none of the initial crystals or the batched crystalline slurry were able to be pretested for their diffraction quality before the scheduled XFEL beamtime.",

The raw data images were subjected to detector corrections with CHEETAH (Barty et al., 2014) , as well as for hit finding based on Bragg reflections. The hit finding parameters for all datasets classifying a hit were as follows (using peakfinder8): a minimum pixel count of 2 above an adc-threshold of 500 with a minimum signal to noise ratio of 7 was considered a peak, and an image containing at least 20 peaks was classified as a crystal hit. The crystal hits were then indexed using the software package CrystFEL (White et al., 2012; White, 2019 ) version 9.0 (10White et al., 2020 using the peaks found by CHEETAH. Indexing was attempted using the indexing algorithms from XGANDALF (Gevorkov et al., 2019) , DIRAX (Duisenberg, 1992) , MOSFLM (Powell et al., 2013) and XDS (Kabsch, 2010) in this order.

The integration radii were set to 2, 3, 5 and the ''multi'' option was switched on to enable indexing of multiple crystal lattices in a single image. The indexed reflections were subsequently integrated and merged using PARTIALATOR applying the unity model over 3 iterations and the max-ADU set to 7500. The complete reflection intensity list from CrystFEL was then scaled and cut using the TRUNCATE program from the CCP4 suite (Winn et al., 2011) prior to further processing.",

We have employed a grid-based docking method, Induced Fit Docking (IFD) protocol of Maestro (Sherman et al., 2006) which uses Glide Halgren et al., 2004) and Prime (Jacobson et al., 2004) to induce adjustments in receptor structures with flexible ligand sampling options. For target structures in apo form (structures with PDB IDs: 7CWB, 7CWC, 6WQF and 6Y2E), binding sites for docking studies were defined by centering grids at the centroid of a set of residues, namely His41, Cys145 and Glu166. On the other hand, for target structures in holo form (structures with PDB ID: 6W63 both monomeric and dimeric form) binding sites were defined by centering the grids at the centroid of the co-crystallized ligand molecule. In the dimeric form of Mpro, only one chain was considered for docking studies. IFD protocol involves subsequent phases, including (i) initial docking of the compounds with the rigid receptor in which 20 poses per ligand are retained; (ii) refining the residues (within 5 \u00c5 of the ligand) in complex using Prime module (Jacobson et al., 2004) , and (iii) redocking of each protein/ligand complex structure within 30 kcal/mol of the lowest-energy structure and within the top 20 structures overall. During Glide redocking, standard precision (SP) option was chosen. The docking poses were scored and ranked based on GlideScore and poses with the lowest scores, i.e. top-docking poses were selected for further studies at each target protein.",

The apo form structures obtained in this study were also subjected to MD simulations. For comparison reasons, MD simulations were also performed for the holo form structure (PDB ID: 6W63) with its co-crystallized ligand, X77. The target protein-ligand complexes were placed in simulation boxes with orthorhombic shape in which box sizes were calculated based on buffer distance of 10.0 \u00c5 along all three dimensions and solvated with explicit water molecules of SPC (Berendsen et al., 1987) model. The simulation systems were neutralized by the addition of counter ions (Na+ or Cl\u00c0 depending on the charge of the systems) and 0.15 M NaCl solution was added to adjust concentration of the solvent systems. All atom MD simulations package Desmond (Bowers et al., 2006) was employed. Proceeding the production MD simulations, the systems were equilibrated using relaxation protocols of Desmond package in which a series of minimizations and short MD simulations which were performed with small time-steps at lower temperature and restrains on the non-hydrogen solute atoms in the initial stages and slowly time-steps were increased as well as simulation temperature and restrains on solute atoms were released. The production simulations were performed under constant pressure and temperature conditions, i.e. NPT ensemble. Temperature was set as 310 K while being controlled by Nose-Hoover thermostat (Nos\u00e9 , 1984; Hoover, 1985) . The pressure was set as atmospheric pressure of 1.01325 bar with isotropic pressure coupling and controlled by Martyna-Tobias-Klein barostat (Martyna et al., 1994) . Smooth particle mesh Ewald method (Essmann et al., 1995) was utilized to calculate long range electrostatic interactions with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). For short range electrostatics and Lennard-Jones interactions, the cut-off distance was set as 9.0 \u00c5 . The multi-step integrator RESPA was employed in which the time steps were varied for interaction types as followed in fs for: bonded, 2.0; near 2.0 and far 6.0.",

If the distance between the acceptor and the donor atoms is <3.5 \u00c5 and the angle <70 hydrogen bond is defined between atom groups. Salt bridges were defined between atoms of negatively charged [ASP (OD1, OD2) and GLU (OE1, OE2)] and positively charged [LYS (NZ) and ARG (NH1, NH2)], where distances were <4.0 \u00c5 . T-stacking, pi-cation, and pi-stacking distance criteria were 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 \u00c5 , respectively. Hydrophobic and vdW interactions were calculated based on atom R (radii), if the distance between atoms is less than the sum of R of atom A, R of atom B, and 0.5 \u00c5 .
