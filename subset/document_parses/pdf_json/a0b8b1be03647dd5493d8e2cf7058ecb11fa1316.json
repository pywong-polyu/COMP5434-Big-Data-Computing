To accomplish this, I suggest three ethical guidelines to be used in the presentation of results, mandating AI systems to expose uncertainty, to instill distrust, and, contrary to traditional views, to avoid explanations. The paper does a preliminary discussion of the guidelines and provides some arguments for their adoption, aiming to start a debate in the community about AI ethics in practice.",

What a NN algorithms does is to create a complex mathematical function which maps an input pattern into known patterns, provided as labelled examples by its developers. Based on those, the algorithm produces a classification token, the one most similar according to the examples. As brilliantly put by Alan Blackwell [2] , \"...

However, omitting the uncertainty takes a completely new dimension when the result of the algorithm has more impacts on people's lives, such as when used to determine a parole claim, the identity of a criminal, the provision of a home loan, or to stop an automatic car from running over a pedestrian. To fix this, I propose the following ethical guideline: Ethical Guideline 1 -Expose Uncertainty: Interfaces with results of an AI algorithm should properly disclose to its users realistic estimates of the uncertainty of the algorithm, in easy-to-understand forms.",

Estimates of uncertainty are not the same as confidence levels, likelihoods, or even probabilities, in the rare cases where AI algorithms actually compute them. Real uncertainty must consider the errors of the algorithm, the labeling mistakes of the training datasets, and possible new conditions of the moment when the results are presented. For example, AI algorithms used to predict stock prices had its real uncertainty increased when the COVID-19 pandemic started. Similarly, ecommerce recommendations portrayed a lot of nonsensical suggestions after the lock-downs started, since it was the first time they were seeing data of entire populations buying all their needs in the Internet. In practice, factoring in the issues affecting uncertainty is a hard problem, sometimes harder than the one the AI algorithm is trying to solve.",

Similarly, there are many ways to convey uncertainty through language, for instance, by preceding statements with phrases such as \"I believe...\" or \"I guess...\"; by using uncertainty adjectives and adverbs such as \"approximate\" and \"about\"; and by using informal language [16] . Further investigation is needed whether the use by machines of such terms and methods indeed produces similar effects as when used by people, even considering that some previous work on human perception of computers points towards a positive answer [23, 21] .",
