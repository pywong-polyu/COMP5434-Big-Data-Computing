            "text": "Objective and design Our prospective study assesses the role of detailed lung ultrasound (LUS) features to discriminate the etiological diagnosis of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) in children. Methodology We analyzed patients aged from 1 month to 17 years admitted between March 2018 and April 2020 who were hospitalized for ALRTI. For all patients, history, clinical parameters, microbiological data, and lung ultrasound data were collected. Patients were stratified into three main groups (\"bacterial\", \"viral\", \"atypical\") according to the presumed microbial etiology and LUS findings evaluated according to the etiological group. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from all patients. A qualitative diagnostic test developed by Nurex S.r.l. was used for identification of bacterial and fungal DNA in respiratory samples. The Seegene Allplex\u2122 Respiratory assays were used for the molecular diagnosis of viral respiratory pathogens. In addition, bacterial culture of blood and respiratory samples were performed, when indicated. Results A total of 186 children with suspected ALRTI (44% female) with an average age of 6 were enrolled in the study. We found that some ultrasound findings as size, number and distribution of consolidations, the position and motion of air bronchograms, pleural effusions and distribution of vertical artifacts significantly differ (p < 0.05) in children with bacterial, viral and atypical ALRTI. Conclusion Our study provides a detailed analysis of LUS features able to predict the ALRTI ethology in children. These findings may help the physicians to better manage a child with ALRTI and to offer personalized approach, from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up.",

Moreover, LUS has several advantages over X-ray, particularly useful for the pediatric population: radiation-free, lower cost, possibility of follow-up examinations, ability to monitor treatment, easy accessibility in all settings (including poor countries), fast, and can be used immediately as a point-ofcare method. LUS results are immediately available to the clinician, who must decide about the initial empirical treatment [19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

Categorical variables were compared using chi-squared or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Continuous variables were assessed using Mann-Whitney U test.

            "text": "Our prospective study is one of the largest prospective studies assessing the role of detailed LUS features to discriminate bacterial, viral and atypical ALRTI in children. We found that the size, number and distribution of consolidations, the position and motion of air bronchograms, pleural effusions and distribution of vertical artifacts significantly differ in children with bacterial, viral and atypical ALRTI. Such differences were particularly relevant when bacterial ALRTIs were compared with viral and atypical ones. Conversely, clinical parameters, including fever, chest pain and main auscultation features, and laboratory were not able to significantly distinguish between these groups. CXR, despite being still widely used, was the less useful tool in this discrimination. These findings highlight, therefore, the need of using new tools to support the etiological classification of pediatric ALRTI. We proved that several LUS features may easily support clinicians in this using the LUS along with available clinical, anamnestic and laboratory data. Given the increasing phenomenon of antibiotic resistance in children, the possibility of knowing the etiology of the infection represents an important step forward. The first decade of LUS studies focused on the role of LUS in detecting pneumonia. A recently performed meta-analysis confirmed high sensitivity (96%) and specificity (93%) of LUS for detecting pneumonia in children [4] . First studies showed specific LUS patterns to diagnose viral lower respiratory tract infections and bronchiolitis in children [28] [29] [30] [31] . Buonsenso and colleagues [15, 24] showed that specific LUS patterns on diagnosis and after 48 h of treatments (bronchograms, consolidation size, characteristics of pleural effusion) were predictive of antibiotic response in children with ALRTI, more than clinical data and laboratory results. Moreover, recent basic science and clinical studies are clarifying the knowledge of and genesis of artifacts generated by the ultrasound-lung interaction. In particular, performing physical analyses on artificial models and using modern deep learning strategies and train a fully convolutional neural network, Demi and colleagues [32] [33] [34] showed that B-lines have different morphologies according to the medical conditions that generate them (interstitial lung diseases, cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic lung edema, interstitial pneumonia and lung contusion).",

Other authors also highlighted that consolidation size or distribution can support the diagnosis of viral bronchiolitis, Influenza pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia [21, [28] [29] [30] 37] . These findings were comparable with our study. However, our study has evidenced more important LUS features not previously assessed. We found that air bronchograms were more common in bacteria and atypical ALRTI but, importantly, fluid bronchograms were almost exclusively described in bacterial cases. Also, complicated pleural effusions were never described in viral ALRTIs. Vertical artifacts, which gained more interest during the last year and in particular since LUS has been routinely used in COVID-19 pneumonia [21, [37] [38] [39] [40] , also played a significant role, since in bacterial ALRTI were mainly located in proximity of the main consolidation, while in the others were mostly diffuse and bilateral.",

LUS, particularly when used in adjunction to clinical examination by experienced operators, can support the etiological of pneumonia and offer a personalized approach to patients. If further confirmed, this approach can also support antibiotic stewardship programs. Our study has limitations to address. The gold standard for the diagnosis of ALRTI is the chest CT scan; however, its routine use in children is not ethical in children so we did not do the CT. Therefore, the diagnosis of ALRTI for the inclusion of patients in our study was made on a clinical bases according to the available guidelines [18] . The stratification of patients according to the etiology cannot be 100% accurate, since the definitive microbiological diagnosis in non-mechanically ventilated children is difficult to establish, since bronchoalveolar lavages are invasive procedures. However, to date all studies assessing the microbiological diagnoses of ALRTI, including vaccine-probe study [41] , have the same limitation that is difficult to address.",

Unfortunately, however, with regard to the individual viral agents (in the context of viral pneumonia) and the individual atypical agents (in the context of atypical pneumonia), we did not carry out the aforementioned correlation analyzes between the ultrasound findings and single viral or atypical pathogen because each group of single isolated pathogen (such as \"RSV group\" or \"rhinovirus group\" or \"adenovirus group\" or \"mycoplasma group\" etc.) was not sufficiently numerous to be used for a correlation analysis between a single pathogen and the associated ultrasound characteristics.",
