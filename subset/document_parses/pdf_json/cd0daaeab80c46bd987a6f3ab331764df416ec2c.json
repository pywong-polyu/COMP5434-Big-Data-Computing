Materials & methods: The viral load of throat, nasal and feces specimens of 10 children with coronavirus disease 2019 were detected and analyzed. Results: The virus load of nasal and throat specimen decreased extremely and all respiratory specimens tested negative on the third week after they were admitted. All children showed positive PCR results in their feces. A total of 70% children showed positive results at the fourth week and 40% children showed positive results in their feces at the fifth week. All children tested negative on the sixth week. Conclusion: The positive rate of stool in children was higher than that in adults and the shedding time of stool was longer than that of respiratory specimen.",

Unfortunately, more than 25 million people have been infected with the virus to date, and 800,000 patients died [1] . While the information on epidemiologic investigation and clinical manifestation are accumulating, the viral kinetics of the novel virus have not been systematically evaluated yet, especially in children. Given that children's clinical characteristics are different from adults, most children have mild or asymptomatic infections; their viral load and viral shedding pattern and persist time also differ from adults in several reports [2] [3] [4] [5] . The behavior of the virus in children should be understood. Thus, we present the viral load kinetics of 10 children in Jinan, China to assess the virus' activity pattern and prompt people to take improved protective measures toward this age range.",

Case 1 was a young girl with no symptoms. After 15 days in the hospital, she was discharged with her parents. However, 2 weeks after discharge from the hospital, case 1's stool test at home showed that she was positive with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this patient was admitted to the hospital again and her stool nucleic acid was tested extremely late (Table 1) . Case 4 was not followed up because the last test of cycle threshold (Ct) was close to 40 or higher than 40 cycles.",

At the shortest, the observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days in patients from Wuhan, China. The virus was continuously detectable until death in nonsurvivors. Meanwhile, the differences between severe (19 days) and critical patients in a previous study are not significant (24 days) [8] . A previous study also reported that the virus shedding time even reaches up to 49 days in certain individuals [9] . In the present study, all pediatric patients' respiratory tract specimens tested negative on the third week or even earlier, which was similar to results of most previous studies [10] [11] [12] . However, several studies found a higher viral load in sputum specimens than in nasal and throat swabs [13] and various works have found a higher viral load in nasal swabs than in throat swabs [12] . However, the difference between the viral load in nasal swabs and throat swabs in our study was not significant. Whether this phenomenon differs from children and adults still needs additional in-depth research. Given our relatively small number of cases, we cannot draw strong conclusions for this phenomenon. At present, SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an entry receptor [14] . Studies on SARS-CoV-2 have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is highly expressed in esophageal epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, thereby suggesting possible fecal transmission [15] . Several studies showed that patients with COVID have digest symptoms, such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and abdominal pain and live viruses or viral nucleic acids can be detected in feces [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Further research showed that 36-53% fecal PCR becomes positive 2-5 days later than patients who are sputum PCR positive. Fecal excretion persists after sputum excretion in 23-82% patients for 1-11 days [19] . In the present study, stool samples were positive in all children (100%), although they did not have any digestive symptom, which was much higher than that reported in adults [19] . At the same time, the shedding time of stool sample was much longer than respiratory specimens, that is, reaching even up to more than 5 weeks. Our team also found that children have longer shedding time than adults in feces sample [4] . Therefore, given that many children are asymptomatic or mildly infected [2, 3] , they have a high proportion of stool poisoning and long shedding time. Therefore, once they are infected, children will become hidden and have the a high risk of transmission.",

According to the high viral infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, long shedding time in feces and poor hand hygiene in children, we believe that exposure to a fecal-contaminated environment may cause the fecal-oral route of transmission.

Third, we cannot estimate the exact time at which the children were exposed to the virus because they were all diagnosed after close contact with their families that were confirmed to be infected with the virus. Fourth, given that positive RNA testing is not a proxy for infectivity, this study showed that stool positivity is a problem and that other infectious factors are needed to determine whether prevention and control measures, such as the isolation of live viruses or discovery of evidence of transmission, are needed. Appropriate precautions should be taken for any positive result. Further studies are needed to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection.
