Although literature remained sparse, reports indicated that food insecurity is disproportionately high among African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) population since the outset of COVID-19. Hence, we assessed the food insecurity conditions of ACB populations globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Comprehensive searches in CINAHL, Medline (Ovid), PubMed (Medline), Food Science and Technology Abstracts, SCOPUS, EMBASE, AMED, CAB Abstracts, Cochrane Library (OVID), and PsycINFO were carried out. Title/abstract and full-text screening, quality appraisal (modified JBI QARI), and data extraction were carried out by double reviewers. Results The initial search yielded 354 articles. After removal of duplicates and irrelevant articles, a full-text review and critical appraisal, 9 papers were included in the study. After data extraction and synthesis, six major themes emerged from the analysis: increased food insecurity, adverse health outcomes of food insecurity, exacerbation of existing disparities, systemic inequities and adverse policies, racism, and sociocultural response and solutions.",

In the USA, counties which have a large population of Native Americans and African-Americans-such as Navajo County in Arizona and Orleans Parish in Louisiana-are projected to have some of the highest food insecurity rates as the ongoing pandemic rages on [8] . Likewise in Canada, it is also expected that the food insecurity situation will double from the existing 4.4 million, further impacting racialized populations as a result of factors such as unemployment, reduced income, and food-price spikes [9] . Many countries-such as those in the Horn of Africa, Central America and Caribbean, Western Africa, and parts of Asia-that rely on essential agricultural seasons may be impacted by reduced agricultural workforce, or reduced access to agricultural inputs, due to a combination of the lockdown measures and supply chain disruptions. Consequently, this could lead to spikes in food-price in these low-income countries, and other long-term repercussions [1] .",

The recent COVID-19 Impact Survey which collected data on American adults in May 2020 indicated that more than half of Black respondents with children reported that they were food insecure, and over 40% of Hispanic respondents with children reported food insecurity [13] . All the more, the pandemic has had indirect impacts on the food insecurity experience of Black people. For instance, about 39% of jobs held by Black American workers have become vulnerable due to reduced pay at work, short-term furloughs, or outright layoffs [12] . Such economic circumstances have, in turn, led to the difficulty in purchasing nutritious food [14] . Similarly, since ACB people rely on essential public services such as public transportation to be able to access food at grocery stores, ongoing containment measures such as lockdown and restrictions on movement have worsened the already precarious food insecurity situation [12, 15] . Even though some of the factors that exacerbated the food insecurity among ACB population are apparent, it is worthy to note that this current food insecurity experience could be traced to years of structural disparities, longstanding health and economic inequities that systematically place ACB and other marginalized populations at socioeconomic disadvantages [5, 10] .",

This modified instrument consists of a total of thirteen questions and was adapted by combining three questions from the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Appraisal Checklist [18] with ten questions from the JBI QARI [19] . The thirteen questions on the modified JBI QARI tool were uploaded to Covidence, and a risk of bias (ROB) assessment was carried out for each paper by the two independent reviewers. For each question on the tool, the reviewers were to choose between High, Unclear, or Low ROB. A High ROB was assigned 0 point, Unclear ROB was issued 0.5 point, and Low ROB obtained 1 point. A maximum score of 13 was assigned to the modified JBI QARI tool and a grading system was then created to assess the quality of each paper: High = 10-13; Moderate = 6-9; Low = 0-5. Hence, a total score was then computed for each paper. Any disagreements that arose between the two reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer.",

This included a drop in employment of 3.0 million jobs and an increase in COVID-19-related absences from work of 2.5 million [47] . As an attempt to reduce the impact of the economic fallout, various governments from predominantly high-income countries implemented relief measures which were expected to reduce food insecurity. These involved stimulus checks to employees who experienced income-loss due to the pandemic, as well as various protections to businesses, enabling them to retain some of their staff [48] .

Social determinants are known to account for the disproportionate health risks and differential health outcomes experienced in the ACB communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include systemic anti-Black racism; poor representation in healthcare leadership, research and decision-making; lack of culturally appropriate services; and lack of culturally competent health [51] . Systemic racism is often very subtle. It affects people not only at an interpersonal level but also through the broader structures of society, most notably in the systems of justice, media, public policing, immigration, and employment, as well as through hate activity and government policies [52] . As a result of these inequities, people of African descent and those in the western nations including Canada are often more prone to pre-existing health conditions including diabetes and high blood pressure. Also, they represent some of the most vulnerable populations in terms of their susceptibility to health risks and particularly to COVID-19 [53] .",

Hence, this review found some strategies that are being used by some countries to mitigate the burden of food insecurity among ACB people during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes immediate food assistance to their citizens, provision of special budgets for the most vulnerable people, expansion of food distribution process, and cash transfers [23, 29] . Such strategies have also been utilized in the past during disease outbreaks to alleviate the impact on food insecurity. For instance, during the 1918 influenza pandemic, organizations such as the American Red Cross and Tuberculosis Society assisted affected families with salaries, food for convalescents, and up to 100 quarts of milk per day, and volunteers also prepared meals for patients at community kitchens opened by the U.S. Food Administration [62] . Conclusively, other possible ways in which countries can build the competence of their food systems during pandemics have been suggested, including elimination of food wastage, utilizing byproducts of food processing in the context of emergencies, and identifying the most critical threats to the food system so as to tackle them proactively [63] .",

It is a human disease and not the fault of any one race. Yet the disease does have disproportionately negative impacts on individuals and communities that struggle with hunger and poverty -Official Statement from Washington State's Leading Hunger Relief Agency Northwest Harvest (Businesswire, 2020) 3 Exacerbation of existing disparities Increased poverty and food insecurity Poverty and food insecurity have deepened dramatically since the lockdown began on March 27.-South Africa announces $26 billion to help struggling nation (Anna et al., 2020) Unemployment/Job Losses and food insecurity In addition, as individuals already at risk for food insecurity are more vulnerable to losing their jobs, rates of food insecurity will climb higher as the pandemic progresses (Page 9 of 13) -Food insecurity and COVID-19: Disparities in early effects for US adults (Wolfson et al., 2020)4 Systemic inequities and adverse policies Policies during the pandemic have exacerbated food insecurity The same harms (food insecurity; violence; loneliness; depression; anxiety; stigma) are repeated across many groups, and are exacerbated by many COVID-19 policy interventions. This is crucial; it shows that inequitable policy options may generate interactive and multiplicative harms -A framework for identifying and mitigating the equity harms of COVID-19 policy interventions(Glover et al., 2020) Governments have already begun to impose draconian quarantine and physical distancing measures for the urban poor without also ensuring that those residing in urban slums can meet their everyday needs, such as food and clean water Key results/findings We find that, as of mid-March 2020, 44% of adults with an income < 250% of the FPL were food insecure in the past 30 days, and these individuals were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic. This disparity in food security status based on race/ethnicity is an additional way in which COVID-19 is disproportionately impacting communities of color in the US -Food insecurity and COVID-19: Disparities in early effects for US adults (Wolfson et al., 2020) These communities face roadblocks to opportunities put in place by an inequitable system that does discriminate.
