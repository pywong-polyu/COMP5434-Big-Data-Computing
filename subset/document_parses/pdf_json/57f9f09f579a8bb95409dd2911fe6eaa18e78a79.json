However, the extent to which the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic accelerated the adoption of QR code mobile payment has not been sufficiently researched. Based on social learning theory, this study models how external interaction with the environment has affected the internal appraisal and behavioral intention to adopt QR code mobile payment during COVID-19. Empirical results from 248 respondents revealed that perceived severity and social influence positively affected the perception of utilitarian and health benefits of respondents, which in turn influenced the behavioral intention to use the QR code mobile payment. The theoretical contribution and managerial implications of this study are also discussed.",

However, less is known about the factors that contributed to the rapid growth in popularity of QR code mobile payment in 2020; in particular, it is unclear whether the external environmental stimulus of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of this payment system. For example, scholars have called for closer attention to the health benefits of using QR codes during the COVID-19 pandemic (Yan et al., 2021) . Therefore, it is desirable to better understand the determinants of QR code mobile payment adoption in the context of This study aims to examine the increasing use of QR code mobile payment from a social learning theory perspective by considering the impacts of both external environment interaction and internal psychological appraisal. Specifically, this study addresses the following questions: (1) How does internal psychological appraisal (e.g., utilitarian benefit and health benefit) affect the adoption of QR code mobile payment? (2) What are the effects of the perceived severity of the COVID-19 pandemic on the internal psychological appraisal of QR code mobile payment of consumers? Did the pandemic further motivate the adoption of this form of payment?",

First, while previous studies have focused mainly on utilitarian factors (de Kerviler et al., 2016; Park et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2021) , this study adds new knowledge to the literature on QR code mobile payment by emphasizing the appraisal of health benefits in the adoption process. Second, unlike prior research that has considered mobile payment merely as a transaction tool in the common consumption context (Teo et al., 2015) , this study enriches the literature on mobile payment by investigating the adoption of QR code mobile payment of consumers in response to the threat of COVID-19. Finally, this study examines the interaction between the external environment and the internal psychological appraisal of consumers to investigate the process of adoption of QR code mobile payment by applying and validating social learning theory in the mobile payment context. Overall, this study not only provides a theoretical assessment of the adoption of QR code mobile payment during the COVID-19 pandemic but also has managerial implications for companies wishing to expand QR code mobile payment to respond to disease outbreaks.",

Both NFC and QR codes are proximity systems. NFC payment is based on radio frequency channel communication connecting payment devices and vending terminals without depending on mobile networks (Coskun et al., 2013) . Although NFC payments are used in many scenarios, such as public transportation, their popularity is limited by the lack of devices due to the relatively high cost of NFC modules.

As a payment solution, the QR code enjoys both low cost and high popularity among customers and businesses. In fact, QR code mobile payment has the potential to replace cash and credit cards in the physical store. For example, consumers can use the camera of their mobile phone to scan the QR code of the supermarket at the checkout to pay for goods. Alternatively, consumers can show a QR code on the screen of their mobile phone to a store employee, who can then scan the code using a scanner or their own mobile phone. The QR code is linked to the credit or debit card of the client. If the client does not have sufficient funds to make the QR code payment, the store will submit the payment claim later. The most popular use of QR code payments in China is through third-party payment platforms such as Alipay and WeChat Pay, rather than via mobile client apps provided by banks.",

Since 2020, Chinese consumers have increasingly adopted QR code payment methods in order to satisfy the need for social distancing in public places. Both the health QR code and payment QR code are based on two social media apps (WeChat Pay and Alipay); therefore, it is convenient for new users to transfer their experience of the health QR code to the payment QR code. Moreover, the influence of other people is the strongest predictor of mobile payment adoption (Slade et al., 2015) . Specifically, the positive opinions of family members, relatives, friends, and superiors can encourage individuals to adopt mobile payment (Oliveira et al., 2016) .

            "text": "Social influence from others affects health-related behaviors. For instance, social influence factors have been proven to be predictors of the acceptance of healthcare information technology in hospitals (Lu et al., 2020) . Social support was found to be a key trigger of value co-creation behavior in online health communities (Liu et al., 2020) . Thus, in the context of COVID-19, opinions from important others (e.g., family, friends, and superiors at work) can be powerful motivators to accept contactless methods of payment. In fact, according to the theory of social influence, support from important others may encourage adoption of a particular technology by consumers (Venkatesh et al., 2012 usage and/or recommendations of others, consumers acquire enough information to understand the utility or risk of a new technology. For example, Slade et al. (2015) determined that social influence was the strongest predictor of behavioral intention toward mobile payment in the United Kingdom. An online survey from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) also showed that social influence positively affected the perceived benefits (e.g., convenience, economic, informational, enjoyment, experiential, and social benefits) of mobile payment of consumers (Park et al., 2019) . In view of the health risk posed by COVID-19, the utility of mobile payment is not limited to efficiency and transaction speed; it also offers improved safety by reducing physical contact and increasing social distancing, which, in turn, help to contain the spread of COVID-19 (Yan et al., 2021) . Thus, in the internal psychological process of social learning, we suggested the inclusion of health benefits in addition to utilitarian benefits. Based on the above literature and discussion, we hypothesized that social influence positively affected the internal psychological process in favor of the adoption of QR code mobile payment during the COVID-19 pandemic: H3. Social influence positively affected the perceived utilitarian benefit of QR code mobile payment during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Although prior research has focused on utilitarian benefits such as transaction speed and convenience (Yan et al., 2021) , the proposed model in this study suggests that the perceived health benefit may also enhance the behavioral intention to use QR code mobile payment. This discovery adds to the literature on the benefit appraisal process and encourages further research examining the importance of the health utility provided by contactless payment tools. These findings also respond to calls from past studies (Yan et al., 2021) .",

They shed light on the adoption of QR code mobile payment of consumers under the influence of external interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The external impact of perceived severity and social influence triggers the internal psychological process of appraising QR code mobile payment, which implies that the threat of environmental risks such as COVID-19 can be important antecedents to the uptake of mobile payment. First, our findings suggest that companies can encourage the use of QR code mobile payment by reminding consumers of the pandemic. For instance, physical stores could telecast news about COVID-19 worldwide to stimulate the appraisal of, and intention to adopt, mobile payment of consumers. Second, this study suggests that companies could include the health benefit of reducing interpersonal contact as an advantage when promoting QR code mobile payment. For instance, companies or stores could persuade consumers to use mobile payment by labeling it a \"smart choice for your health.\"",

First, the model only concentrates on the utilitarian and health benefits in the internal appraisal process, without considering other factors such as self-efficacy, innovativeness, and trust. Such factors may provide more detailed insights into the usage of QR code mobile payment. Second, the sample size of this study constrains the generalizability of the research results. Thus, in future studies, large-scale, crossnational surveys could be conducted to confirm the findings of this study. Third, this study only investigates the behavioral intention to use QR code mobile payment on the part of consumers, without considering the attitudes of shopkeepers. Therefore, we recommend that future studies also explore the factors affecting usage intention from the perspective of the retailer.",
