Our goal was to evaluate these websites for conformity to accessibility guidelines. Specifically, we assessed, on a scale of increasing levels of accessibility compliance requirements, the results of the efforts made by website developers to incorporate and meet accessibility compliance criteria. We focused on homepages and vaccine pages in 49 states. For this study, we used the automated AChecker tool to assess conformance to the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at A, AA and AAA levels of conformance, and conformance with the Section 508c standard. We also manually rated, on a scale 0 (none) to 3 (highest), the specific accessibility features, if any, that web developers had included on the pages. We found that accessibility violations were prevalent across states but to varying degrees for a specific accessibility criterion. Although violations were detected in all 4 POUR accessibility principles, the most number of known violations occurred in meeting the perceivability and operability principles. Most violations in 508c guidelines occurred in not providing functional text in scripting languages and in not providing text equivalents for non-text. The degree of effort and conformance significantly varied between states; a majority of states exhibited a lower degree of effort, while a few attempted innovative ways to enhance accessibility on their websites. The efforts seemed to focus on meeting the minimum threshold-it is not clear if websites were designed proactively for accessibility.",

Large swaths of the public, healthcare professionals, including front-line workers and contact tracers, and more recently decision makers and workers in industries, businesses, and educational institutions have come to rely on these websites as a primary daily source of up-todate information for making lifesaving decisions and as a portal to access and schedule vaccinations for themselves and their families. Given the need to be useful and serve as many people as possible during a pandemic, and to widely communicate and distribute accurate, credible, and life-saving information on COVID-19 and related services such as vaccines, to all people in the general population, it is important that these websites be highly accessible.",

Four of these five studies have evaluated the extent to which websites violated published and well-accepted web accessibility guidelines, such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) (WCAG Guidelines, 2022) using automated website accessibility checkers such as AChecker (AChecker, 2022) and WAVE checker (WAVE Accessibility Checker, 2022) . The fifth study by Howe et al. (2021) manually analyzed the viewability of vaccine registration websites, the availability of non-English language options on the pages, and the reading level of information on these pages. The general picture that emerges from these studies is that public health websites, especially those created to disseminate information on COVID-19, violate many accessibility guidelines and principles in general, be it the WCAG guidelines or other specific principles such as the reading levels of information on a page.",

            "text": "Although these studies provide important preliminary insights into accessibility errors and problems, they are limited in one important respect -they report only aggregated counts of the number and type of known problems, errors, and violations of the broadest WCAG accessibility principles and guidelines (WCAG Guidelines, 2022) and decide if a website fails to conform; they do not delve deeper into an analysis of the graduated scales in the conformance levels and success criteria defined for each WCAG guideline. The mere reporting of the number of known problems, errors, and violations, or judging the overall conformity of a website as a \"fail\" if even one known problem is present at any level of conformance, as the studies using automated checkers cited above have reported, does not reflect the nuance involved in interpreting accessibility violations using graduated scales like the WCAG levels of conformance scale. WCAG organizes its framework in a hierarchy. The highest level in the hierarchy consists of the foundational accessibility principles that websites must be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust (commonly referred to as the POUR framework). At the next level of the hierarchy, for each principle, WCAG specifies 12 guidelines -these guidelines set goals that web authors should work toward to make content accessible. Finally, at the lowest level of the hierarchy, WCAG provides testable success criteria with three increasing levels of conformance, A (lowest level), AA (medium) and AAA (highest level). The critical point to note here is that many studies fail to consider when reporting the results that these levels of conformance form an ordinal scale and have a natural order and gradation to them; A is the lowest level of conformance (and hence an easier threshold to meet in practice) than an AAA level of conformance. Furthermore, not all guidelines specify criteria that can be met at all three levels of conformance: 3 guidelines specify only an A level; 3 others specify A and AA; the remaining 6 guidelines of the 12 specify all three levels of conformance, A, AA, and AAA. Meeting higher levels of conformance would require that the webpage also meet the lower levels of conformance -for example, for a webpage to be classified as conforming to the highest AAA level, it must conform to the AAA, AA, and A criteria specified for that guideline (assuming the guideline has criteria at all three levels).",

            "text": "The main implication of the gradation in the conformance scale is that web designers may choose to aim for a particular level of conformance when they develop a website, particularly given that building accessibility into state department health websites is voluntary, and designers do not have to conform to Federal accessibility standards such as those specified in Section 508c (Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Act of , 1973 . If an accessibility guideline requires the designer to meet only the lowest level of conformance of A, it may be easy for the designer to achieve success in conformance. If, on the other hand, a guideline includes all three levels of conformance, a designer may choose to still meet only the lowest level of conformance and not aim for higher levels of conformance. Or they may choose to aim for higher levels of conformance. In judging the overall level of conformance of a website, one must consider violations of accessibility principles jointly at all 3 levels (A, AA and AAA) of conformance. For example, for a particular guideline, if a website has no known problems at the highest AAA level, has known problems at the AA level, but has no known problems at the A level, the overall level of conformance of that website would be at the A level. Not having known problems at a certain level for a guideline does not mean that the website conforms at that level. By the same token, having known problems at a certain level does not mean that the website fails to conform; it may just have conformed at a lower level. Furthermore, given that accessibility guidelines such as the WCAG 2.0 are goals web designers can voluntarily strive to achieve in their development effort, the levels of conformance scale can be reflective of the level of effort web designers may have chosen to apply to successfully conform to accessibility guidelines, which the published studies thus far do not address.",

            "text": "Extending and integrating the ideas that conformance can occur at progressively increasingly difficult levels, and that conformance requires and reflects design and development effort, and further that web developers for state public health agencies are not obligated to adopt WCAG or other guidelines such as Section 508c and do so voluntarily, our main study goal was to evaluate and understand the level of effort in designing for accessibility on health websites dedicated to COVID-19 information in US states. To this end, in addition to using the WCAG 2.0 A, AA and AAA levels of conformance, we extended our overall evaluation of efforts to design for accessibility to include two additional aspects -we included conformance with the Section 508c standard, and we also manually identified, evaluated, and rated the specific accessibility features if any that web developers had included on their website (more than just the website code passing automated checkers). Our rationale was that states did not have to meet Section 508c standards; website developers did not have to provide any additional features for accessibility or inclusion. Therefore, in addition to the WCAG levels of conformance, if a website complied with 508c guidelines as well and if it contained specific visible features that improved accessibility, it would reflect additional efforts to make the website accessible. Furthermore, we sought to address the limitations outlined in previous paragraphs in recently published studies on how overall conformance is interpreted when analyzing reports of accessibility violations with automated checkers. Finally, our objective was to add to existing data on accessibility violations by evaluating the prevalence and pervasiveness of accessibility problems on state health department websites so that we could determine whether a handful of states contributed to the majority of accessibility violations. In particular, we evaluated the home / landing pages and the vaccine information pages in our study, given the importance of these pages during a COVID pandemic.",

We identified the number of possible opportunities that each state had to conform to levels of A, AA, and AAA in all POUR guidelines. At the A level, there were 12 possible opportunities, at the AA level 6 opportunities, and at the AAA level 9 opportunities. Then we computed the number of times a state actually conformed to that level (A, AA, or AAA) across all criteria and guidelines. This represents the raw conformance rates. Given that A is the minimum threshold and AAA was the highest threshold for conformance, we weighted A, AA, and AAA at 1,2 and 3, respectively, and used raw conformance rate at a level * weight at that level as the weighted conformance rate. We weighted the raw conformance rates to ensure that the higher degree of effort needed to conform to higher levels of threshold was reflected in the analysis.

But researchers also point out that fears that designing websites for accessibility may be expensive and will take enormous effort may be unfounded (Brady & Bigham, 2015; Harper & Chen, 2012; Law et al., 2005; Loiacono & Djamasbi, 2013; Pichiliani & Pizzolato, 2021) . Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 during the initial phases of the pandemic, we suspect that state public health agencies were under enormous time pressure to get websites up and running quickly, and to disseminate vital health information infection risk and how to minimize this risk. Therefore, conforming to the highest accessibility standards may have taken a bit of a backseat compared to rapidly disseminating web content with lifesaving information about a rapidly spreading disease.",

            "text": "However, recent studies suggest that webmaster attitudes have changed tremendously from Lazar's seminal study (2004), so much so that many web developers now consider it their ethical obligation to make websites accessible (Antonelli et al., 2018; Farrelly, 2011; Freire et al., 2008; Inal et al., 2019 Inal et al., , 2020 Pichiliani & Pizzolato, 2019; Putnam et al., 2012; Schmutz et al., 2016 Researchers also believe that there is a gap between knowledge of accessibility standards and translating that knowledge into implementation and practice. Many models of technology adoption and implementation have been developed in the literature, such as the diffusion of innovation model (Rogers, 2003) , the technology acceptance model (Davis et al., 1989) , the theory of reasoned action (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980 ) the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991; Vollenwyder et al., 2019) and the unified theory of acceptance of use of technology (Venkatesh et al., 2003) . Specific accessibility models like the causal loop diagram (Abdelgawad et al., 2010) , WIAM Web accessibility integration model (Lazar et al., 2004) , the process model for continuous testing of web accessibility (Campoverde-Molina et al., 2021) , and machine learning and statistical tools or evaluating accessibility (Lundgard & Satyanarayan, 2021; Sutton, 2020; Yu & Parmanto, 2011 ) also have been developed, but the extent to which these models have changed day-to-day website design and development practices needs a deeper evaluation. It is surprising that, although 31 years have passed since the time the first ever website went live in 1991, and nearly 22 years have passed since the first WCAG guidelines were formalized and published in 1999, and all the development in web tools and technologies that have occurred in these years, websites continue to have problems with accessibility and that widespread awareness and knowledge and awareness of website accessibility guidelines and standards may be lacking, especially among website programmers and developers. Indeed, what may be needed is to view accessibility design not just as satisfying guidelines and complying with criteria (Farrelly, 2011) , but viewing accessibility holistically in the broader context of equity and inclusion of broader populations (Holliday, 2020; Kelly et al., 2004; Sloan et al., 2006) .",

We evaluated the prevalence and variability of accessibility problems and the criteria violated, and the degree of effort that state public health agency websites demonstrated to provide or enhance accessible information on home and vaccine pages for 51 states. We found that accessibility violations were prevalent across states but to varying degrees for a specific accessibility criterion. Our evaluation indicates that state public health websites can improve support for nontext content, use of assistive technologies, make their content distinguishable, and improve navigation to support website users who need accessible content. The degree of effort and conformance significantly varied between states; a majority of states exhibited a lower degree of effort, while a few attempted innovative ways to enhance accessibility on their websites.",

AI technology holds immense potential for not only making websites accessible for users at the click of a button, but it can also reduce web page authoring and coding burdens for designers, particularly when important accessibility considerations such as alternative text for images, or contrast, color and font changes have to be implemented -these do not have to be coded into the webpages.",

            "text": "panel A) and vaccine pages (figure 4, panel A) in 20 states violated the perceivability principle by not providing adequate text alternatives to users for all nontext content). 13 homepages (figure 3, panel B) and 16 vaccine pages (figure 4, panel B) violated the principle of perceivability by not creating content that could be presented to the user in different ways without losing information, structure, and relationships in the content. 21 homepages (figure 3, panel C) and 19 vaccine pages (figure 4, panel C) contained known problems in navigability and, therefore, in fulfilling the principle of operability by helping users determine the purpose of each link in context on the page -the success criteria for making pages navigable evaluates whether each link purpose can be determined by the user from the link text alone or from the text with the link context. Homepages also violated the understandability principle. The web content on four homepages did not identify the language of the page so that user agents (both assistive technologies and conventional user agents) could accurately render and present text and other linguistic content (figure 3, panel D). 19 homepages (figure 3, panel E) and 18 vaccine pages (figure 4, panel D) did not provide labels or instructions to users when the content required user input, thus violating the guideline to provide input assistance to users so that they could avoid and correct mistakes. The homepages of 11 states (figure 3, panel F), and the vaccine pages in 10 states (figure 4, panel E) violated the robustness principle -their content was not robust enough to be parsed and interpreted reliably by a variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. Overall, at the A level of conformance, although all POUR accessibility principles were impacted on both the homepages and the vaccine pages, for each principle, only a few success criteria were violated. Furthermore, for the criteria that were violated, the number of known problems varied from a low of just one problem (figure 3, panel F) to a high of 22 problems (figure 3, panel C) for homepages, and from 1 problem (figure 4, panel E) to a high of 19 problems (figure 4, panel A) for vaccine pages. Most importantly, though, it is clear from the cumulative percentages in panels A through F that only a small number of states contributed to the known problems for these criteria and that the states that contributed to the problems varied for each criteria (the horizontal axis indicates different states in each panel), indicating prevalence of known problems in one criteria or another across states. Figures 5 and 6 present results of an evaluation of homepages and vaccine pages at the mid-AA level of the WCAG 2.0 conformance criteria. At this level of conformance, 3 home pages (figure 5 panel A) and 1 vaccine page violated the distinguishability guideline by not providing a minimum contrast ratio of at least 4.5: 1 when visually presenting text and images of text. 27 homepages (figure 5 panel B) and vaccine pages (figure 6 panel A) violated the distinguishability guideline by not allowing for up to 20% resizing of text without loss of content or functionality. The violation of this criterion also contributed to the highest number of known problems for the AA conformance level, resulting in 70 problems all in one state for homepages and 62 problems all in one state for the vaccine pages, but also being prevalent in more than half of the 49 states evaluated. Together, poor contrast ratios and inadequate provisions for resizing text, reduced perceivability of the homepages. The homepages in 19 states (figure 5 panel C) and vaccine pages in 16 states (figure 6 panel B) contained known problems in describing the topic or purpose of the pages via the headings and labels they used on the pages. This impacted navigability, which, in turn, resulted in a violation of the operability principle. Overall, at the AA level of conformance, we saw a similar trend to the A level of conformance in that only a few principles and success criteria were violated. The number of known problems at this level of conformance ranged from a low of 8 (figure 5 panel A) to a high of 71 (figure 5 panel B) for homepages and from a low of 8 (figure 6 panel B) to a high of 62 (figure 6 panel A). Although the number of states that contributed to the known problems varied between a low of just 3 states to a high of 27 states (figure 5 panel B) for homepages and between a low of just one state to a high of 27 states, we observed again that a significant percentage of the known problems came only from a handful of states and that the states contributing to the problems varied for each criteria at the AA level of conformance. Figures 7 and 8 present the results of an evaluation of homepages at the highest AAA level of the WCAG 2.0 conformance criteria. At this highest level of conformance, 20 homepages and 17 vaccine pages had known problems providing an enhanced contrast of at least 7:1 when visually presenting text and images of text, thus violating the distinguishability guideline and reducing the perceivability of their homepages. This criterion also resulted in the highest number of known problems, 107 in 2 states and over 50 in a few more states for home pages and 128 in 2 states and over 40 in a few more states for vaccine pages. Interestingly, at the AAA level of conformance, even fewer states contributed to a larger cumulative percentage of known problems than",

One state accounted for all 25 violations on home pages (figure 9 panel B) in not providing redundant text links for active regions of server-side image maps, and 19 violations on vaccine pages (figure 10 panel B) in not providing frame titles on the pages so identification and navigation of the frames on the vaccine pages could be easy for the user. The highest number of violations and the most prevalent was with the lack of functional text in the scripting language that assistive technology could read -the homepages of 45 states (figure 9 panel C) and vaccine pages of 43 states (figure 10 panel C) contained 534 violations and 504 violations of this criterion respectively.
