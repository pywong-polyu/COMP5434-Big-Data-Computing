Advances in cognitive psychology have led to the development of adaptive learning systems that make vocabulary learning more efficient. One way these computer-based systems optimize learning is by measuring learning performance in real time to create optimal repetition schedules for individual learners. While such adaptive learning systems have been successfully applied to word learning using keyboard-based input, they have thus far seen little application in word learning where spoken instead of typed input is used. Here we present a framework for speech-based word learning using an adaptive model that was developed for and tested with typing-based word learning. We show that typingand speech-based learning result in similar behavioral patterns that can be used to reliably estimate individual memory processes. We extend earlier findings demonstrating that a response-time based adaptive learning approach outperforms an accuracy-based, Leitner flashcard approach in learning efficiency (demonstrated by higher average accuracy and lower response times after a learning session). In short, we show that adaptive learning benefits transfer from typing-based learning, to speech based learning. Our work provides a basis for the development of language learning applications that use real-time pronunciation assessment software to score the accuracy of the learner's pronunciations. We discuss the implications for our approach for the development of educationally relevant, adaptive speech-based learning applications.",

            "text": "Storing word representations in the mental lexicon is one of the most important aspects of learning a language. Since the process of memorising words is tedious and effortful, methods that can improve the efficiency of this process are valuable for anyone who is learning a new language (Hartshorne et al., 2018) . Recent advances in cognitive psychology have led to the development of adaptive learning systems that aim to improve the process of word learning by determining optimal learning strategies for individual learners. These digital systems typically focus on teaching orthography (i.e., the letters that spell a word) and require the learner to respond by typing or selecting the correct answer in response to a cue (e.g., Wozniak and Gorzelanczyk, 1994; Van Rijn et al., 2009; Lindsey et al., 2014; Papousek et al., 2014) . Several variables, such as accuracy and reaction times, are measured during the learning process and are used in real time to determine optimal repetition schedules for individual learners. In practice, using such adaptive learning systems results in higher learning efficiency than learning with traditional, non-adaptive methods, which often translates into better retention at the end of the study sessions (Wozniak and Gorzelanczyk, 1994; Van Rijn et al., 2009; Lindsey et al., 2014; Papousek et al., 2014; van der Velde et al., 2021a) .",

Furthermore, the possibilities for such speech-based adaptive learning have not received elaborate scientific attention. One important reason for the lack of research in this area concerns the technical challenge of automatically recording and assessing speech to use in realtime adaptive learning systems. However, methods to automatically score pronunciation accuracy in real time currently exist (e.g., Moustroufas and Digalakis, 2007; Neri et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2020 , and see www.emotech.ai) and pilot data from our lab shows promising results for the application of such methods in adaptive, speech-based learning systems (Wilschut et al., 2021) . In the current study, we will further examine how to use speech in adaptive learning systems.",

            "text": "Speech-based learning systems have numerous potential advantages compared to typing-based systems. Most importantly, adaptive speech-based systems allow the learner to efficiently learn the correct pronunciation of words, which is an important part of language acquisition that is completely omitted in typing-based learning. Furthermore, speech-based learning systems could be used by people who lack the opportunity to type (e.g., while driving a car or walking) or the ability to type (e.g., young participants, or people who physically lack the ability to proficiently type), making them applicable in a wide range of settings. Hence, combining the advantages of adaptivity and speech-based vocabulary learning seems particularly promising. In order to explore the possibilities for speech-based adaptive learning, it is important to understand how words are stored in, and retrieved from long term memory. According to the widely accepted standard model in psycholinguistics, learning a language-and more specifically a second-language vocabulary-involves forming distinct types of representations for each word (Levelt, 1999; Aitchison, 2012; Bobb and Kroll, 2018; Sanches et al., 2018; D\u00f3czi, 2019) . The learner needs to store an association between representations for the meaning of words (their semantic representation) and their formal representations: sound (phonology) and spelling (orthography). These associations are stored in a mental lexicon, which is a long-term memory store for words. The lexicon has three distinct but interacting parts that contain the semantic, orthographic and phonological representations (Levelt, 1999; Aitchison, 2012; Bobb and Kroll, 2018) . For first language (L1) word representations, connections between the different representations are rich and strong (Jiang, 2000) . Activation of, for example, the phonological representation automatically results in activation of the semantic representation. Research has shown that second language (L2) vocabulary learning initially relies on the establishment of a connection between the L2 formal representation and the L1 formal representation. Only after substantial practice with the second language, connections between L2 formal representations and semantic representations are formed (Jiang, 2000) .",

This connection between response time and memory strength was exploited by Van Rijn and colleagues et al in the SlimStampen (or Rugged Learning) system (Van Rijn et al., 2009; van der Velde et al., 2021a; Sense et al., 2021) . Originally developed for typingbased learning, SlimStampen aims to create maximally efficient repetition schedules for individual learners by combining the beneficial effects of retrieval practice and spacing (Van Rijn et al., 2009; Sense et al., 2016) . Active retrieval practice, rather than passively rehearsing the study material, greatly contributes to learning efficiency (e.g., Roediger and Karpicke (2006) ; see Moreira et al. (2019) for a review). Spacing learning over time consistently results in better long-term memory consolidation (Cepeda et al., 2008; Kornell, 2009; Karpicke and Bauernschmidt, 2011; Nakata, 2017 ).",

The system uses the ACT-R architecture's model of human declarative memory to model the activation of each word in the learner's memory (Anderson et al., 1998) . Individual learning differences are captured by a single parameter called the rate of forgetting (RoF), which is computed independently for each item and each student and which is continuously updated throughout the learning session using the combination of reaction times and accuracy scores. The RoF is used to determine optimal repetition schedules for each learner (see Van Rijn et al. (2009) and Sense et al. (2016) for details). The system has proven itself in both lab studies Sense et al., 2018; van der Velde et al., 2021a) and realworld applications (Van Rijn et al., 2009; Sense et al., 2021) and has shown its value by allowing secondary-education students to study from home during the COVID-lockdowns (van der Velde et al., 2021b), yet it is currently limited to orthographic inputs.

The learner already has strong, well-established associations between the semantic representation for house and the associated L1 orthographic and phonological representations. Interacting with the digital learning system gradually strengthens the new connections between L1 orthography and L2 orthography or phonology as the learner practices by giving typed or spoken responses to written cues. Due to this study process, the new L2 representations will be gradually and implicitly connected to the existing L1 and semantic representations, here denoted by the dashed lines. As outlined above, the theoretical assumption is that response times and accuracies can be used to infer the strength of the associations between the representations depicted in Figure 1 . Here, we are specifically interested in the new connections between L1 orthography and L2 phonology and orthography that are learned, with as working hypothesis that we can use voice onset times (when the L2 response is spoken) in a similar manner as keypress-based reaction times (when the L2 response is typed). Based on the short literature review above, and pilot studies conducted in our own lab, we expect relatively high functional similarity between reaction times during orthography-based and phonology-based word learning. Therefore, we hypothesise that voice onset times can be used to infer memory strength in speechbased learning, and that the typing-based SlimStampen learning model can be successfully applied to speech-based learning.",

Second, we aim to show that the adaptive learning benefits found in typing-based setups will generalise to speechbased learning. We test these hypotheses by comparing a speechbased learning session using the SlimStampen model to 1) a typing-based learning session that employs the same adaptive learning algorithm and 2) a speech-based session using a Leitnerbased flashcard algorithm that repeats incorrectly answered questions sooner than correctly answered questions. This comparison mirrors the experiment that was conducted by Van Rijn and colleagues et al.

Each part ended in a test. All items that the participant encountered during the learning session were asked on the test in the order in which they were introduced during the learning session. The parts differed in how participants were asked to respond (typing or speaking) and in the way in which the items were scheduled (using the RT-based SlimStampen algorithm or using a Leitner flashcard algorithm). The response method on each test matched the method of the associated learning condition (see below). The first condition used the SlimStampen, RT-driven adaptive learning algorithm and was typing-based (RT-adaptive typing). At the first presentation of a word, either the Dutch or German word was presented in text on a computer screen together with the written English translation of this word. In subsequent presentations of the word pair, only the written Dutch/ German word was presented to the participants, and they were asked to type the correct English translation of the word and received corrective feedback. The SlimStampen adaptive algorithm determined when each item was repeated and when new items were introduced, based on learners' reaction times and accuracy scores. See Sense et al. (2016) for a detailed description of the algorithm used. In the typing-based learning condition, reaction times were defined as the time elapsed between the start of the presentation of the question and the first keypress.",

The item repetition schedule was determined by the Leitner flashcard system (Mubarak and Smith, 2008) , which groups words into three virtual boxes: All words start in Box one and move to the next box if answered correctly. If a word is answered incorrectly, it moves back to the previous box. The procedure continues until all items are in Box 3. This flashcard system allows for difficult items to be rehearsed more often than easy items and has been shown to be a relatively effective study strategy (Bryson, 2012 ).

Voice onset times were measured by the experimenter using a physical delayed key trigger box, that registered the onset of all sounds that lasted longer than 98 ms. Audio was looped using Loopback (www.rogueamoeba.com/loopback/), such that the voice trigger box only received the participants' audio recordings and did not receive audio from the experimenter or the example pronunciations in the experiment. The accuracy of the responses was manually scored by the experimenter using a USB gamepad during both speaking conditions of the experiment.",

For example, participant one would complete list A in the RT-adaptive typing condition, list B in the RT-adaptive speaking condition and list C in the Leitneradaptive speaking condition. Participant two would complete list B in the RT-adaptive typing condition, list C in the RT-adaptive speaking condition and list A in the Leitner-adaptive speaking condition, etc. Each of the three lists appeared in each condition the same number of times, in order to control for word difficulty. Words were selected on the basis of 1) being difficult to pronounce for native Dutch/German speakers, such as the th-sound in thersitical, 2) having an irregular orthography-phonology mapping, such as hierarchy or awry, 3) having difficult stress, such as analysis, or 4) being long and containing many consonants, such as omphaloskepsis. There were two main reasons for the selection of difficult and/or infrequent English words. First, to prevent ceiling effects caused by participants being familiar with the study materials presented, we selected infrequent English words. Second, study materials were selected to be difficult in order to increase the differences in learning outcomes between conditions in a relatively short amount of time. The proportional distribution of words from each category was equal for all three lists of words. The correct exemplar pronunciations that were provided to the participants were generated by Google's WaveNet text-to-speech algorithm (www. cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) in British English. In the 3-min filler task, participants completed integer sequences in an openquestion format (e.g., '3-6-12-24-?' requires response 2 \u00d7 24 48).

Figure 3 shows a visual comparison for the distributions of reaction times in both learning conditions over the time course of the experiment (in 1-min bins). In order to simplify the interpretation of the figure, only reaction times for correct trials are shown (for a visual representation of reaction times for incorrect trials, Supplementary Figure S6 ). Trials with reaction times longer than 6 s are not shown in Figure 3 (this affected 124 trials in the RT-adaptive typing condition (5.4%) and 18 trials in the RT-adaptive speaking condition (0.7%)). Remarkably, average reaction times per item were significantly lower in the typing condition compared to the speaking condition (t (4,683) 11.940, p < 0.001). We fitted a linear mixed effects model to predict reaction time from learning condition and time (in minutes, over the course of each learning session). Reaction times declined slightly (with, on average, approximately 52 milliseconds per min) over time (t (4,669) \u22125.114, p < 0.001), indicating that average responses became faster throughout the learning session. There was no interaction effect of condition and time (t (4,671) \u22120.181, p 0.856), indicating that participants became faster during the learning session in both the typingbased and the speech-based learning condition. Figure 3 shows that the shape of the reaction time distributions is relatively similar in both learning conditions. Average accuracy did not differ significantly between the typing-and speech-based learning condition (t (4,454) 1.868, p 0.062), and was relatively high in both conditions (80.1 and 81.6% of all trials were answered correctly in the typing-and speech-based learning condition, respectively). Both the correct RTs and the incorrect RTs were, on average, faster in the RT-adaptive typing condition compared to the RTadaptive speaking condition (t (3,716) 9.672, p < 0.001; t (774) 6.175, p < 0.001, respectively), Supplementary Figure  S7 .

For both the RT-adaptive typing condition and the RT-adaptive speaking condition, we normalized these expected activation values in order to facilitate straightforward comparisons between conditions. Subsequently, we fitted two mixed effects logistic regression models in which we predicted the accuracy on each trial using the normalized, RT-based expected activation scores: one for the typing-based learning session and one for the speech-based learning session (see Table 1 and Figure 4 ). This approach allowed us to remain agnostic with respect to the exact threshold and logistic noise values in function (2). In the models, we controlled for variation between participants and items by adding these variables as random effects. Table 1 shows that memory activation estimated using both typing-and speech-based reaction times can be used to predict learning accuracy. 2 . The \u03b2 coefficient for normalized, RT-based activation scores is higher for the speech-based model than for the typing based model, indicating that differences in RT-based activation translate to stronger changes in accuracy predictions in the speaking model compared to the typing model. Figure 4 shows how the normalized activation maps onto accuracy according to the two models shown in Table 1 .

First, despite the fact that we found systematic differences in average reaction times, both typing-based and speaking based reaction times proved useful approximations of individual memory activation and learning accuracy. In fact, memory activation estimated from voice onset times were significantly better predictors of actual learning accuracy compared to activations calculated using keypress response times. Second, the benefits of employing RT-based, adaptive learning algorithms generalized to speech-based learning: Adaptive speechbased learning resulted in significantly higher accuracy and significantly lower average reaction times compared to flashcardbased adaptive learning, which mirrors the findings (Van Rijn et al., 2009) presented for typing-based learning.",

We hypothesised that-given the assumed functional similarity between typing-and speechbased learning-both types of learning are likely to result in similar reaction time distributions, and that consequently both voice onset times and keypress response times can be used in adaptive learning systems to estimate internal memory parameters. We found that, although both types of reaction times followed relatively similar distributions, reaction times in the typing-based learning condition were systematically faster compared to reaction times in the speech-based learning condition. Several speculative but intuitive interpretations of these systematic differences in reaction times can be given. A first possibility is that the time it takes to prepare responses is inherently longer for speech-based responses compared to typing-based responses. For example, Torreira et al. (2016) and Indefrey and Levelt (2004) show that voice responses typically require preparatory \"planning\", and that spontaneous voice responses (like the responses required in the current speech-based learning setup) can be relatively slow. Second, evidence from picture naming studies shows that the phonological complexity and length of the to-be-spoken words has a large influence on voice onset latencies (Sternberg et al., 1978; Bonin et al., 2002; Qingfang and Yufang, 2003) , especially in the case of spontaneous (unplanned) utterances. It is possible that the longer reaction times in the speech-based learning condition are a consequence of the fact that all selected items in the sample were chosen to be very difficult to pronounce, perhaps leading the participants to engage in a form of mental rehearsal before starting to speak, which can have resulted in slower average response times. Despite these differences in average reaction times for typingand speech-based learning, we showed that it is possible to use both keypress reaction times and voice onset times to predict memory activation and learning accuracy. More strongly put, we found that reaction times recorded in the speech-based learning condition resulted in estimated activation scores that were even better predictors of learning accuracy compared to reaction times recorded in the typing-based learning condition. This finding should be interpreted with some caution. The interpretability of the models used to estimate accuracy using reaction-time derived activation scores partly depends on the similarity of the distributions of correct and incorrect reaction times in both learning conditions. Although reaction time distributions appear similar across conditions based on the visual Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence | www.frontiersin.org December 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 780131 8 examinations, future research should focus on more formal comparisons of reaction time distributions. If speech-based reaction times are indeed reliably slower then typing-reaction times, future studies should examine the possibility to implement a speech-specific offset to reaction times in order to increase the accuracy of the internal memory parameter estimations. Despite the sub-optimal distributional assumptions discussed above, our results support the idea that voice-based reaction times only differ in average value (i.e., that there is a modality-specific offset) but that they are functionally similar to typing-based reaction times: Both can be used to predict learning performance.",

As an example of its universal applicability, in a proof-of-concept study conducted in collaboration with the Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) in Magdeburg, Germany, we applied the aboveproposed speech-based learning method to elderly German participants. Research has shown that keyboard-or touchscreen typing requires high-level motor control and cognitive flexibility, which are likely to deteriorate with age (Bosman, 1993; Krampe, 2002; Jimison et al., 2006) , which makes a speech-based learning system particularly useful for elderly users. Twenty-nine subjects aged between 65-85 years completed a learning session in which the names of German cities were studied. The sequencing of items was determined by the SlimStampen algorithm, again using the voice-key triggers as response times. Next to the learning session, all participants completed two validated memory assessments: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for mild cognitive impairment (MoCA) (Nasreddine et al., 2005; Freitas et al., 2013) and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) cognitive abilities test (Morris et al., 1989) . The CERAD score is typically used to arrive at a binary assessment of cognitive functioning. To allow for more fine-grained analyses, we calculated the difference between the obtained score and the threshold criterion that is based on gender, age, and education. This CERAD distance measure has previously been used to relate CERAD scores to other cognitive measures (Maa\u00df et al., 2021) . We examined the correlation between the internal memory parameters estimated by our speech-based learning algorithm and the performance on both memory scales. We found that the MoCA memory scores were negatively associated with average rates of forgetting for individual participants (Pearson's r \u2212 0.49, Bayes Factor 9.12), for the CERAD distance scores no conclusive evidence regarding a correlation was found (Pearson's r \u2212 0.30, Bayes Factor 1.13). Yet, this finding suggests that the internal SlimStampen memory parameters can be used to successfully capture individual differences in cognitive impairment for elderly participants. Using mixed effects model regression analyses, we replicated the analyses mentioned earlier in this paper (Model 1 and Model 2, Table 1 ). We found that there is a strong relation between voice onset response times and accuracy (Supplementary Tables S1,3 and Supplementary Figure S8 ). This relationship persisted even when controlling for performance on established memory scales, indicating that speech-based response times can be seen as a robust measure of individual memory activation and learning accuracy.",

First, given the relatively small number of participants included in this experiment, its conclusion should be validated in future studies. Second, in the current study, spoken responses were manually scored by the experimenter. As discussed in the introduction, recent technological advances allow for the automatic, real-time assessment of pronunciation accuracy. Using automatically assessed pronunciation accuracy does not only lead to more objective performance measures, but could also be used to provide detailed feedback to the learner, which may further enhance the effectiveness of speech-based word learning. This approach showed promising results in preliminary analyses conducted in our lab (Wilschut et al., 2021) . In addition, pronunciation quality-expressed as the degree of overlap between the learner's pronunciation and a reference exemplar-would provide a continuous score, which might prove to be a more sensitive measure of memory strength than binary accuracy. Adaptive systems that use both continuous reaction times and continuous performance scores have been shown to outperform systems that use binary accuracy only (Mettler et al., 2011) . Future work should explore whether combing two continuous scores (voice onset time and pronunciation quality) could further improve such systems.",
