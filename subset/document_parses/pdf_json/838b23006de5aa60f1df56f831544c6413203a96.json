The recent establishment of the health technology assessment (HTA) entity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has resulted in increased interest in economic evaluation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the technical approaches used in published economic evaluations and the limitations reported by the authors of the respective studies that could affect the ability to perform economic evaluations in the KSA. Methods. We conducted a systematic literature review of published economic evaluations performed for the KSA over the past 10 years. An electronic literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was performed. A CHEERS checklist was used to assess the quality of reporting. Reported limitations were classified into domains including the definition of perspectives, identification of comparators, estimation of costs and resources, and use of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold. Results. Twelve evaluations were identified; most involved cost-effectiveness analysis (92%). Missing and unclear data were found within the CHEERS criteria. Regardless of the perspective used, most described the perspective as an ''institutional'' perspective (70%) and almost half were reclassified by the current reviewer (42%). Most did not clearly state the comparator (83%), and published model comparators were commonly used (50%). Resource estimation was mostly performed by the authors of the respective studies (67%), and costs were mostly obtained from hospital institutional data (75%). The lack of an established threshold for the country-specific willingness to pay was observed in 50% of the analyses. Conclusions. Economic evaluations from the KSA are limited. Capacity building and country-specific HTA guidelines could improve the quality of evaluations to better inform decision making.",

Unfortunately, these guides are often underutilized, and our findings identify considerable missing, not clearly stated, or incomplete data within the analyses, which can weaken the impact of the recommendations. The limitations reported by the authors of the respective studies emphasize the suboptimal quality of the reporting. A lack of data was frequently identified and resulted in using ''institutional'' practice as a major source of data input for the analyses. In light of the call for the establishment of an HTA entity in the KSA, framing a standard analytic approach when conducting economic evaluations will support HTA in informing resource allocation decisions.

            "text": "The health care system in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has grown rapidly since the launch of Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program (NTP). 1 The program's goal is to make health care and social development a top priority to improve quality of life. Public expenditures in 2020 for health and social services accounted for SAR 167 (US $44.5) billion (16.4%) of the total budget. 2 Actual spending for the same year increased by 13.5% and was allocated to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The national health care transformation strategy has been directed toward reforming health sector governance, corporatizing the model of care for accountable health care facility clusters, privatizing hospitals according to public private participation health care models, enhancing health insurance programs, and expanding manpower and the digital health system. 3 The Saudi health care system's current structure consists of 3 entities: the organizer of legislation, the service provider, and the financier. 3 Within the vision realization programs, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be responsible solely for organization and legislation, while national holding companies will take over service delivery. National health insurance will cover finance. The main strategy is to ensure financial sustainability with transparency. Improving health care performance is expected to contribute to public resources and budget allocation decisions. This led to the launch of a series of reforms to improve infrastructure and build the capacity of health economics. Recently, at the 2020 meeting of the Group of Twenty (G20), the KSA promoted a value-based health care system as a key transformation strategy under the Global Coalition for Value Health Care. 4, 5 This includes a health technology assessment (HTA) proposal to assess the value of health technologies. 6, 7 Health care structure and the distribution of access to health care in the KSA vary owing to an ongoing transformation program and reconstruction of health services; this includes the privatization model and insurance expansion. The overall structure can be simplified into public or private sectors. Currently, public services cover citizens regardless of employment status, whereas private services cover residents or citizens who are employees in the corporate or private sectors. 8 The public-to-private ratio of hospital numbers is 2:1. 9 The public sector consists of MOH clusters with medical cities, other hospitals, and primary health care centers. The sector also includes specialized hospitals, such as the Ministry's hospitals (interior, defense, national guard, and education) and the King Faisal Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH&RC). The KFSH&RC is one of the major health care system sectors, along with the Saudi Health Council, the Council of Cooperative Health Insurance, the Saudi Commissions for Health Specialties, the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA), and the Saudi Red Crescent Authority. 3 Collectively across health care providers, most already have structured plans for transformation as part of Vision 2030, and some have even published these plans on their websites. 10 Economic evaluations play a critical role in priority setting for decision making in health care. There are few publications on health economic evaluations in the KSA and Gulf States, leading to a call to build research capacity. 11, 12 Systematic reviews of economic evaluations or systematic reviews with cost and cost-effectiveness outcomes have drawn increased interest in the field. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Identifying current methodological considerations for published cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) will improve practice and enhance future research foundations. In a systematic review to assess the quality of CEA reporting in the KSA, the conclusion was drawn that there was a general absence of reporting specific details of a CEA. 21 This review identified some deficiencies in the published CEAs; however, there is a need to comprehensively review and better understand the reported limitations of CEAs and the challenges facing analysts in the KSA to improve the quality of future evaluations. Our systematic review aims to go in depth on CEA methodology and to navigate future research to inform decision making on ways to value technologies for HTA within the KSA health system. Therefore, the aim of this review was to evaluate the technical approaches used in published economic evaluations conducted for the KSA. The present review examines limitations reported by authors of the respective studies that affect the ability to perform economic evaluations for the KSA's health care system. It is not intended to draw conclusions about technology adoption or rejection in health care.",

Costing approaches were assessed according to O'Sullivan et al. 24 and classified as involving micro, unit, and gross costing. Comparators, resource estimates and costs, and the ICER threshold were classified according to the article.

Within the model structure, missing data were identified in 25% for time horizons, 65% for cycle lengths, and 27% for utility. Clinical data were derived from the literature (60%), while the remaining data (40%) originated from a singlecenter study/institutional registry/hypothetical cohort. All analyses performed under the payer perspective used health costs and resources, whereas the societal perspective also used travel and/or productivity loss costs of ''nonhealth''. Most analyses (75%) used the US dollar as the common currency for the analysis, but a large amount of missing data was identified for the price year, the conversion exchange rate, and consideration of inflation.

Missing or unclear data were observed frequently. The limitations reported by the authors of the respective studies were classified under the following domains: the definition of perspectives, identification of comparators, estimation of costs and resources, and use of the ICER threshold. In summarizing these limitations, 70% of reports defined perspectives as belonging to the ''institutional'' health care setting, 42% had to have the study's perspective reclassified, more than 80% did not clearly state the choice of the comparator, and approximately 67% had resources estimated by the authors of the respective study and 75% of the costing data were obtained from institutions (hospitals), among which 90% used unit costing. Finally, although all reports stated no explicit ICER threshold for the country, 25% used the WHO value, 25% used the United States as a reference, and 50% did not provide a threshold. A lack of local data was identified by the authors of the respective studies as a common theme in all limitation domains, broadly including epidemiological, clinical, and costing data. The studies were all recently published, yet none used a checklist for reporting economic evaluation studies, such as CHEERS. From a reporting perspective, private hospitals may not represent a payer perspective but rather a health care sector perspective. This is applied to insurance under the Council of Cooperative Health Insurance, which does not cover medical services such as the treatment of infertility or artificial insemination, as per the analyses by Al Maslami et al. 25 In this scenario, patients pay out-of-pocket expenses for specific medical services excluded by insurance. The second scenario occurs when uninsured personnel pay for elective services from the private sector in the KSA instead of the public sector. Until recently, performing CEA from a patient perspective was considered appropriate if the analysis was performed in a private hospital, as described by Nasef et al. 36 Specialized ''institutional'' hospitals-as part of the public sector-usually cover all monetary costs without out-of-pocket patient payments. Therefore, in principle, the institutional perspective may represent the payers' perspective for CEA analysis.",

All plausible comparators should be included considering the setting and current practice. 37 Adopting a comparator from a published reference or previous model does not guarantee that the comparator is relevant to the country under study, especially if most analyses are done from an institutional perspective. Institutions generally have their own formulary that is not relevant to the entire health care field across health facilities in the KSA. However, tertiary institutions may be used as references when defining comparators, thereby guiding the HTA entity in the future. In fact, specialty hospitals are probably the most useful source, particularly for highly specialized diseases such as cancer and metabolic diseases. The use of a comparator from an institutional standard practice was limited. Nevertheless, this is likely a favorable means to ensure the proper identification of the comparator within the KSA system. Regardless of whether the above comparator assumptions are valid, The assumed comparator, generalizability Estimation of costs and resources Lack of epidemiology, clinical, costing, and utility local data; model assumptions that affect ICER; adopted model from existing models Use of the ICER threshold Generalizability a As classified per consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards (CHEERS) criteria.

Estimating costs should include payers' and societal perspectives in the reference case, as described in the second panel. 19 Most of the studies performed costing through an ''institutional'' facility, since costing data can be easily collected. Specialty hospital data for cost analysis can be overestimated. Many factors are considered for cost estimation in these advanced health care deliveries. Costs for resource estimation can be high due to operational costs and equipment costs, along its maintenance, as shown in one institutional study. 38 Using patient-level resources and electronic health records (EHRs) could have major limitations due to incomplete or missing data. This approach may also require a request for access to ensure patient confidentiality. Conversely, EHRs can be a good source for estimating nonhealth resources if provided by the institution-such as transportation and cumulative sick leave-to calculate productivity loss. Variations in costs are expected across the KSA, which makes gross costing appealing. Further effort should be encouraged in future research.",

The proposed threshold provided in this analysis is close to the lower range of the WHO CHOICE recommendations (1 times the GDP per capita). The review identified only 2 analyses that had employed the same range. Any threshold value may be considered too high or low. If it is too low, this may result in not funding many technologies with higher marginal costs per QALY. Eventually, some countries agreed to adopt a higher threshold than the estimated threshold to improve access to technologies with great benefits. 40, 41 Setting a WTP threshold is a challenge for many jurisdictions. Future work from the KSA should focus on empirically estimating a WTP from the supply side. The supply-side approach may suggest thresholds even lower than the lower end of the WHO range. However, under Vision 2030, public funding programs for health care are clearly generous, which may shift the supply-side WTP thresholds to higher estimates. This may especially suggest that a single cot-effectiveness threshold may not be the best scenario owing to the different funding streams. Instead, it may be interesting to consider a different opportunity cost of health for public and private systems and what this implies for determining a single cost-effectiveness threshold for the KSA.",

This is especially true in countries with known health economy structures, education, and practices in their infancy and in middle-or low-income countries. 46 A similar review of the Gulf Region identified a lack of published economic evaluations. 47 In a recent workshop established to understand pharmaceutical companies' insights for upcoming HTAs, a major discussion concerned HTA methods and the local data sources required for economic models within submissions. 7 This was a clear call to create guidance and definitions when assessing the value of technology in the KSA's health care structure. Establishing a future HTA in the KSA would encourage more research in CEA studies. A recent study published by the Vision 2030 realization office of the MOH evaluated the expectations of establishing the HTA entity as a national agency for the KSA. A lack of data was identified as a common issue among local experts. 48 The study revealed the importance of having an HTA entity. Such an entity may have to focus on HTA services considering the deliberation context/process for analytical assessment and starting the implementation of high-impact technologies. It was also emphasized that broad partnership with other decision makers in the KSA-such as the SFDA and leading hospitals such as the KFSH&RC and others-was necessary. The current decision makers' debate on the future HTA entity within the KSA can make the greatest contribution to developing good practices for decision making.",
