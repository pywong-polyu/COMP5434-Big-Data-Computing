            "text": "A readily available, noninvasive tool that may provide early warning of impending cytokine storm involves analysis of the cadence of cardiac cycles. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a physiological metric, regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), that has been used for decades to evaluate general well-being in various clinical settings. 2 Because the ANS responds quickly to changes in physiological states, it may offer signals, in the form of HRV, that can warn of an impending cytokine storm sooner than other currently employed laboratory tests. It is probable that earlier recognition of clinical deterioration, by triggering earlier therapeutic interventions, could better the chance of positive outcomes. However, the ability to extract, analyze, and calculate HRV from our standard hospital monitors was impossible for this study. Our standard hospital monitors are not technically set-up for HRV analysis because of the challenge of extracting the necessary electrocardiogram (ECG) data for HRV calculations. The relation between HRV and inflammatory states has been extensively studied. A recent meta-analysis of over 51 studies encompassing a total of 2,238 patients demonstrated an inverse relationship between HRV and inflammation. 3 However, a precise mechanism for how the immune system and the ANS interact to impact the HRV has not been described. 4 A common measure of HRV is the standard deviation of the interval between heartbeats (SDNN). This measure of HRV has been shown to correlate inversely with the nonspecific inflammatory marker CRP. 4 In the current COVID-19 pandemic, CRP has become vital to monitoring patients' inflammatory status. 5 Clinicians across the globe are using CRP to stratify and predict disease severity in COVID-19. 6 Large rises in CRP and interleukin-6 coincide with cytokine storm and with the progression to more severe disease states. 1 Interleukin-6 levels, while more specific to cytokine storm, 7 often require blood samples to be sent to specialized laboratories, resulting in extended turn-around times for results. C-reactive protein levels, on the other hand, are readily available for most hospital clinicians. Therefore, physicians in the community follow CRP values to determine the onset of this hyper-inflammatory state. Current literature has found elevated CRP to be an independent factor predicting disease risk and correlating with disease severity. 5, 6 In the present study, we set out to determine whether decreases in HRV predict elevations in CRP in COVID-19 patients.",

In 10 of the 12 patients who demonstrated an increase in CRP of >50%, the clinical condition of the patients deteriorated. In one of those patients, the HRV decreased in spite of normal vital signs, inflammatory markers, and decreasing O 2 requirements. In response to this apparent clinical improvement, the primary care team gradually weaned therapy. The patient subsequently deteriorated 72 hours later with massive rises in CRP. She developed severe hypoxemia and required mechanical ventilation. In this case, the drop in HRV warned of deterioration despite the appearance of clinical improvement Several factors contributed to the limitations of this observational study. There were no controls correlating daily HRV and CRP levels in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure. Frequency of laboratory testing and therapeutic interventions were not standardized because they were ordered at the discretion of the primary care team. Daily critical illness severity scores such as Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score would have been beneficial in analyzing the clinical significance of both changes in HRV and CRP. However, the requisite laboratories needed for critical illness severity scores were not universally available every day for each patient. Furthermore, the small sample size limits generalizability. Nonetheless, the results warrant further investigation.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest a clinical value in intermittently assessing HRV in admitted COVID-19 patients. The overall thrust of current efforts to treat this disease focuses on intervening early, particularly in mitigating the sometimes-overwhelming effects of a cytokine storm. Currently, clinicians look for a sharp rise in CRP before instituting anti-inflammatory therapeutics. An earlier prompt to begin pharmacological intervention intuitively would seem advantageous to combatting or even preventing a cytokine storm. Because it can be difficult to predict which patients will need anti-inflammatory interventions, short-segment HRV metrics in COVID-19 patients may prove to be a noninvasive leading indicator aid for triage and subsequent treatment throughout the disease course.",

Daily short-segment HRV readings may aid clinicians in the triage, disease progress monitoring, and treatment. Intermittent HRV analysis could provide an early warning of an impending inflammatory response (e.g., cytokine storm). Furthermore, this capability could have a major impact in the care of moderate to severe COVID-19 patients in major medical centers, as well as field hospitals. Larger, prospective, randomized, multisite-controlled trials are needed to evaluate the potential value of HRV in the management of COVID-19 patients throughout the course of their hospitalizations.",
