This is consistent with observations reported by others, that an increase in breakthrough COVID infections was found among older adults [3] . The effect of the age-dependent decrease in immune response appears to be less after the second dose, supporting the positive impact of booster vaccines for older adults. Lastly, the agedependent decrease in immune response is independent of the virus strains, as similar trends were observed in the ancestral strain, Alpha, and Gamma variants. These reports strengthen the notion that older adults have a lower immune response than younger adults. Second and possibly third dose will likely be important for older adults.",
